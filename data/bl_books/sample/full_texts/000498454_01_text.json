At the death of the twelfth C\u00e6sar the Roman world entered upon a period of unexampled prosperity. Eighty years and more of tyranny and its correlative degradation had been unable to crush Rome's vital force and vigorous elasticity. The worst of her tyrants had fallen a victim to his own jealous and suspicious disposition, and he was succeeded by a series of five able and virtuous Emperors, who maintained the grandeur of the empire, the extent of its dominions, the varied nature of its resources, and the wealth and civilisation of those who lived beneath its sway. Nor is it so much the vast extent of the earth's surface comprehended within its limits which constitutes the great marvel. Modern Russia extends over a greater B"], [10, "2 HISTORY OF ROME. number of square miles, and is able to maintain a much larger standing army than the thirty formidable legions or brigades of Hadrian.* The true marvel is, that the whole of human civilisation was contained within the boundaries of the Roman empire, whilst almost the whole civilised portion of mankind lies without the Russian portion. The combination of these various tribes and nations into one whole, the addition of province to province, and kingdom to kingdom, is due to the energies of the people when independent and free. The period of the republic, and of the first C\u00e6sar, was one of conquest. The energies of the Roman people were employed in building up that mighty system which entitled Rome to be called the Empress of the World ; and which made it a pardonable piece of vanity to identify the empire with the world. The far-sighted policy of Augustus recognised the wisdom of setting a bound to Roman ambition, and of con solidating by the arts of peace the various elements which war had subjugated. His last will embodied the advice to limit the dominions of Rome to its natural boundaries \u2014 the Rhine and Danube on the north, the Euphrates on the east, the African Desert on the south, and on the west the Atlantic Ocean. This advice was upon the whole acted upon by his successors ; and during the first century of the Christian era Britain alone was added to the empire. * The legion at this period consisted of six thousand eight hundred and thirty-one Roman soldiers, besides so large a number of auxiliaries as would amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men. His army, therefore, consisted of about three hundred and seventy-five thousand."], [11, "3 HISTORY OF ROME. It was, indeed, disregarded by the soldier-like Trajan ; but Nerva, Hadrian, and the Antonines thought it wiser to preserve the integrity of the empire, than to enlarge its dimensions. M. COCCEIUS NERVA. BORN AD. 32; DIED A.D. 98 On the same day* on which Domitian was assassi nated, M. Cocceius Nerva was proclaimed Emperor by the Pr\u00e6torians, and confirmed by the people. He owed his elevation principally to Petronius, Prefect of the Pr\u00e6torians, and Parthenius, chamberlain to the late Emperor. He was of Cretan origin, and a native of Narni in Umbria, and consequently the first Emperor who was not of Italian descent. His family was a distinguished one \u2014 three successive generations had been honoured with the consulship ; his grandfather was a celebrated jurist in the reign of Tiberius ; he himself had been decorated with the triumphal in signia by Nero, and had a statue erected to his honour in the palace : twice he filled the consulship, his colleagues having been firstly Vespasian, and secondly Domitian. He was not entirely destitute of literary merit, for his epigrams are spoken of favourably by Pliny and Martial. He was prudent, upright, generous, and of a gentle temper ; but a feeble frame and weak constitution, added to the burden of sixty-four years, rendered him too reserved, timid, and irresolute for the arduous duties of a sovereign prince. * September 18, A.D. 96. b2"], [12, "4 HISTORY OF ROME. He had but just accepted the purple when there was a rumour that Domitian was alive. This some what shook the fidelity of the army, who were much PART OP A BUILDING INCLOSING THE FORUM OJ NERVA. attached to the late Emperor ; for the soldiers knew that he had been as firm a friend to military despotism as he had been a bitter enemy to the civil power of the Senate. There were also threatenings of mutiny"], [13, "5 HISTORY OF ROME. amongst the troops on the Danube, but promises of the usual largess won the hearts of the soldiers, who were also pacified by the influence of Dio Chrysostom. The rebellion was crushed, and the Senate received Nerva with acclamation. The tolerant and reforming administration of the new Emperor soon became popular. Rome breathed again after the bloody tyranny under which she had been trampled to the dust. The perjured delator was threatened with the severest penalties. The treach erous slave who had denounced his master was put to death. Exiles returned to their native cities, and again enjoyed their confiscated possessions. The crime of high treason against the Emperor was erased from the code. To observe Jewish customs and ordinances, under which were of course included those of Christianity, was no longer penal, and the special imposts levied upon the Jews were removed; the Emperor, in deference to the civil power, bound him self by a solemn oath, as Titus had done before, never to put a senator to death. Eusebius* states that the Evangelist St. John was a participator in the advan tages derived from Nerva's toleration, and was thus enabled to return from his banishment in Patmos, and to discharge the duties of his apostolate. Determined to administer the government for the benefit of the Roman people, he turned his attention to the question of finance, and to the burdensome taxation which was the fruit of the extravagance of his predecessors. In order to render the diminution of taxation possible, he began with retrenchment. In * Euseb. Chron. iii. 20."], [14, "6 HISTORY OF ROME. accordance with his own wish, a commission was appointed by the Senate to report upon the public expenditure, and to place it upon the most economical footing. He diminished the enormous sums which were lavished upon shows and spectacles, and reduced, as far as was possible, his personal and household expenses. He made restitution of all property which Domitian had unjustly confiscated ; abolished the succession and legacy duty of five per cent, which had been imposed by Augustus ; sold a large portion of the imperial property to meet the exigencies of the State ; and showed great liberality to the poorer citizens. The following anecdote which is related of him illustrates his uprightness: \u2014 Atticus, a citizen of Athens, having found a treasure in his house, re quested instructions from Nerva as to the disposal of it. Nerva simply replied that he might make what use of it he pleased. Atticus again referred the question to the Emperor, alleging that he dared not take advantage of his generosity, because the treasure was too great for a person of his condition. Still Nerva was firm, and bid him use, or, if he pleased, abuse the wealth which he owed to his good fortune, for it was his and his only. His principal faults were those of age and of a cautious and gentle disposition. Though a reformer on principle, he was slow and timid in carrying out his principles in practice. He was a bit-by-bit reformer, when the corruption of manners required immediate and decided measures. He threatened the delators, but too often the lame foot of Punishment halted even more than usual. On one"], [15, "7 HISTORY OF ROME. occasion* amongst the guests at his table were present Junius Mauricus, who had been exiled by Domitian, and Fabricius Veiento, who had ruined many during the previous reign by secret informations. The con versation turned upon Catullus Messalinus, an infa mous informer. \" What,\" said the Emperor, \" would Catullus do now if he were alive?\" \"Probably,\" replied Mauricus sarcastically, \" he would be dining with us.\" It was not probable that an emperor of so weak and yielding a character, notwithstanding his good qualities as a prince and a statesman, would be ac ceptable to a licentious and dominant soldiery. But a few months had elapsed when a conspiracy was organized against him by Calpurnius Crassus. It was, however, discovered ; and the ringleader having confessed his crime, experienced the Emperor's usual generosity, being only punished by banishment to Tarentum. It is said that Nerva even invited the conspirators to sit by him in the amphitheatre, and presented them with swords, in order to show that he had no fear of death. Meanwhile the Pr\u00e6torians, led on by \u00c6lianus Carperius, who had been their Prefect under Domitian, besieged Nerva in his palace, with cries of vengeance upon the assassins of his prede cessor, murdered Petronius and Parthenius, and com pelled the timid Emperor publicly to express his approbation of the deed, and to testify his obligation to them for wreaking vengeance on the guilty. Ever since the time of Augustus, it had been the custom with each emperor to associate with himself * Plin. Ep. iv. 22."], [16, "8 HISTORY OF ROME. as colleague whomsoever he designed to be his suc cessor. It was a wise policy, calculated to meet the dangers consequent upon an interregnum in elective monarchies, and rendering the change of government, when it occurred, almost imperceptible to the go verned. Nerva was in declining years, and, taught COIN OF NERVA. by circumstances that he was unequal to curb or cope with the insolence of the soldiery, adopted Trajan as his son and successor. Soon after, he conferred upon him in the Senate the rank of C\u00e6sar, and the name of Germanicus, and added the tribuneship and the title of Emperor. This act calmed the tumult, and was welcomed with the unanimous consent of the Senate and the people. It appears from some medals, which give Nerva the title of proconsul, a title which the emperors never assumed unless absent from Rome, that he made a journey from Rome at the close of this year. Soon after the adoption of Trajan he died of a fit of ague which brought on fever, at the gardens of Sallust, after a reign of sixteen months, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.* He was * A. D. 98."], [17, "HISTORY OF ROME. 9 buried in the mausoleum of Augustus, and Trajan built temples in his honour. It was now a regular custom that divine honours should be paid to deceased emperors, and the ceremonies of an apotheosis enrolled Nerva amongst the number of the gods. M. ULPIUS NERVA TRAJANUS. BORN A. D. 52 ; DIED A. D. 117. The choice which Nerva had made proved a fortu nate one. M. UTpius Nerva Trajanus was a Spaniard, a native of Italica, near Seville {Alcala de Rio). His native town was one of the earliest Roman settlements COIN Or TRAJAN. in Spain, having been founded by the soldiers of the Scipios. He was of an ancient and distinguished family, and his father had filled the office of consul. Although a foreigner, he was a Roman in habits, sympathies, and language ; for the south of Spain had become so completely Roman that the inhabitants generally spoke Latin. When a young man he had distinguished himself in a war against the Parthians.* * About A. D. 80. b3"], [18, "10 HISTORY OF ROME. In due course he discharged the duties of pr\u00e6tor* and consult and at the time of his adoption by Nerva he was in command of a powerful army in Lower Germany, his head-quarters being at Cologne. He was in the prime of life, possessed of a robust constitution, a commanding figure, and a majestic countenance. He was a perfect soldier, by taste and education, and was endowed with all the qualities of a general ; he was vigilant, indefatigable, capable of enduring hardship, content with the hardest fare, despising luxury, teaching his soldiers their duty by himself sharing all the privations and discomforts of the campaign. Although he never spared himself, he was compassionate to his troops, and the sick and wounded were always sure of his sympathy and con solation. He was a strict disciplinarian, but he knew all his veterans, spoke to them by their names, and never let a gallant action pass unrewarded. His simple-minded frankness and hatred of pomp and state, his courtesy to all, his devotion to public business, his kindliness, his patronage of science, lite rature, and philosophy, fitted him for the discharge of hi3 duties in peace, as his other virtues rendered him a popular and successful general. His amusements and relaxations, instead of the effeminate and luxurious indulgences which disgraced most of his predecessors, were manly. He delighted in the pleasures of the chase, in sailing and rowing, and the practice of athletic exercises. Although he is said to have been guilty of occasional excesses, he had not enervated his constitution by habitual * a.d. 86. t a.d. 91."], [19, "11 HISTORY OF ROME. self-indulgence. His passions were strong, and his temper somewhat irascible, but these are defects to which men of strong will and indomitable energy are often subject. He seldom, however, allowed him self to be overcome by their violence, but kept them in check by his good sense, practical judgment, and moral determination. With such qualities for com manding respect, he could afford to be loved rather than feared. When his friends blamed him for his too great kindness and courtesy towards everybody, his reply was an illustration of the great Christian moral maxim: \u2014 \" I wish,\" said he, \" so to behave as I should wish an emperor to behave to me were I a private man.\" In his financial administrations he was just and equitable, and his aim was to correct the oppressive extortions which generally filled the imperial treasury. In the administration of justice he was exact and impartial, and was the author of the celebrated maxim, that it is better that a criminal should go unpunished rather than an innocent man be condemned. Such was the character which cen turies later commanded the unfeigned admiration of Gregory the Great, and called forth his well-known prayer, that the grace of God would bring Trajan to a knowledge of Jesus Christ. That he had an ardent passion for military glory is by no means to be wondered at ; but, as Pliny writes, he was a sincere lover of peace, without being afraid of war. The news of Nerva's death was conveyed to him at Cologne by his cousin Hadrian, where he immedi ately received the imperial power. During the first year of his reign he remained with the army in"], [20, "HISTORY OF ROME. 12 Germany, engaged in establishing the discipline of the troops and in inspiring them with a love of their duty. The Emperors were, generally speaking, consuls during the first year of their reign ; but although the Senate pressed that office upon Trajan, he declined it, because he was unable to discharge the duties of it at Rome. The ensuing year he made his entry into Rome BEN EVEN TUM. on foot, together with his empress, Pompeia Plotina, whose amiability and estimable character contributed much to the popularity of her husband. Her conduct, together with that of his sister, Marciana, exercised a most beneficial influence upon Roman society. They were the first ladies of the imperial court who by their example checked the shameless licentiousness which"], [21, "13 HISTORY OF ROME. had long prevailed amongst women of the higher classes. The Romans conferred upon him the title of Father of his Country {Pater Patri\u0153), of which his liberality to the poor, especially to the children, both in Rome and the provinces, proved him to be eminently deserving. The tastes and habits of his former life led to a change in the peaceful policy which had so long pre vailed. The first war in which he was engaged was with the Dacians, who inhabited the country beyond the Danube. Decebalus, their king, had, during the reign of Domitian, compelled Rome to purchase peace by the payment of an annual tribute. Trajan could ill put up with this disgrace, and the Dacians, en couraged in insolence by such pusillanimous sub mission, provoked resistance by some overt acts of hostility. A sanguinary battle was fought, in which the Romans gained the victory, but with great loss.* Trajan, with his usual humanity, when linen for bandages failed, tore up his own clothes to supply the wounded. Victory after victory was gained by him and his lieutenant-generals, until at length his warlike and courageous foe was reduced to sue for peace. But the Romans continued their advance into the centre of his territories, until they reached the capital. The sister of Decebalus fell into the hands of the Roman general Maximus, so that he compelled him to purchase peace by the surrender of a large portion of his dominions. Trajan then returned to Rome in triumph, and assumed the surname of Daci cus. The peace with the Dacians lasted three years, \u00ab A. D. 101."], [22, "14 HISTORY OF ROME. during which interval Trajan constructed a harbour at Centum Cell\u00e6, which was probably Civita Vecchia, the present port of Rome. XCCHl. Rumours now began to reach Rome that Decebalus was making preparations for a second war;* that he was levying troops, fortifying his towns, and endea vouring, by force or persuasion, to attach the Scythians and neighbouring barbarian nations to his standard. When the Senate received this intelligence, it declared war, and Trajan marched in person against the Dacian king. Decebalus treacherously endeavoured to have the Emperor assassinated on his march through M\u0153sia, but the plot was discovered, and the Romans arrived a.d. 104,"], [23, "HISTORY OF ROME. 15 on the banks of the Danube. Across the majestic stream Trajan threw a bridge of stone, whose twenty one arches (the span of each being one hundred and seventy feet) rested upon twenty piers sixty feet in diameter, and one hundred and fifty feet in height. It was flanked at each extremity by a massive tetedu pont. Although the Danube was here narrow, it was proportionately deep and rapid, and would have deterred a general of less energy and de termination. Traces of this bridge are still visible, a little below the ancient town of Viminac, in Hun gary. The ensuing year saw this great work com pleted, and Trajan and his army crossed over. The Dacian monarch proved by no means an unworthy opponent, but he was unable to resist the generalship of Trajan. The soldiers emulated the bravery of their imperial commander, and amongst them Hadrian, the successor of Trajan, was eminently signalised. The conquest of Dacia was in no slight degree owing to his skill and courage, and Trajan acknowledged his obliga tions to him by presenting him with a diamond which Nerva had sent him on the occasion of his adoption. The Dacian king, seeing that all was lost, too proud to sue for pardon, and despairing of obtaining it, killed himself. His head was carried to Rome ; his buried treasures of gold and precious stones be came the prize of the conquerors. Dacia was made a Roman province, and continued so until the invasion of the Goths, a century and a half after. Forts were built to overawe the inhabitants, and colonies were settled in its principal towns, especially in Transyl vania and the hill country of Wallachia and Moldavia."], [24, "16 HISTORY OF ROME. So Latinized did Dacia become, that even now the Roman language is the basis of the Wallachian. This new province was bounded by the Danube, the Theiss, the Dniester, and the Euxine. Trajan returned to Rome a second time in triumph ; the beautiful column which bears his name was erected ; and the interesting THE ROMANS AND THEIR ALLIES IN A BATTLE WITH THE D. bas-reliefs which wind like a wreath from the base to the capital, immortalise the events of the two Dacian wars. Simultaneously with these northern conquests, Arabia Petr\u00e6a submitted to the Roman arms. A few years of peace ensued, which Trajan endured with patient reluctance ; and many great public works undertaken during the interval show his genius for civil as well as for military administration. A road stretched across the unwholesome Pomptine marshes, and plans were made for embellishing the capital. But his presence was soon required in the East, and he joyfully hailed the opportunity thus offered him for gaining fresh laurels."], [25, "HISTORY OF ROME. 17 The real object of this expedition was ambition \u2014 the pretext, that Exedarius, or Exodares, king of Armenia, had received the crown from the king of Parthia, instead of from the Emperor of Rome, as Tiridates had from the hands of Nero. For this insult he demanded satisfaction. Chosroes, the king of Parthia, at first treated his message with contempt ; but afterwards, seeing that war was imminent, he sent ambassadors with presents to meet Trajan at Athens, and to announce to him the deposition of Exedarius, and to entreat him to confer the crown of Armenia upon Parfhamasiris, or Parthamaspes. Trajan received the ambassadors coldly, told them that he was on his march to Syria, and would there act as he thought fit. Accordingly he crossed into Asia, and marched by way of Cilicia, Syria, and Seleucia to Antioch. The condemnation of the martyr bishop St. Ignatius marked his stay in that city. It seems strange that the persecution of the Christians should have met with countenance and support from an emperor like Trajan ; but the fact is, the Roman mind could not separate the Christian from the Jew. The religious distinction was beneath their notice ; they contemplated the former merely as a sect of the latter. The Roman party in Asia were persuaded that the Jews were meditating and pre paring for insurrection ; and the rebellions of this and the ensuing reign proved that their apprehensions were not unreasonable. Hence, at Antioch, the imperial influence was on the side of persecution ; and hence when Pliny, the gentle governor of Pontus and Bithynia, wrote to Trajan for instructions respecting"], [26, "18 HISTORY OF ROME. the Christians in his province, his \"rescript\" spoke of Christianity as a dangerous superstition, and en joined the punishment of its professors if discovered, although he would not have them sought for. Having received the voluntary submission of Abgarus, prince of Osrhoene in Mesopotamia, he marched against Armenia. Parthamasiris, who had assumed the royal state, laid his diadem at his feet, in the hopes that he would return it to him as Nero had to Tiridates. Trajan claimed his kingdom as a province of the Roman people, and the unfortunate monarch lost his life in a useless struggle for his crown. This was the commencement of his triumphs : he received the voluntary submission of the kings of Iberia, Sarmatia, the Bosphorus, Colchis, Albania ; and he assigned kings to most of the barbarous tribes that inhabited the coast of the Euxine. Still he proceeded on his career of conquest. He chastised the king of Adiabene, who had behaved to him with treachery, and took possession of his dominions, subju gated the rest of Mesopotamia, constructed a bridge of boats over the Tigris, and commenced a canal to unite the two great rivers of Assyria. His course of conquest was resistless ; he captured Seleucia, earned the title of Parthicus by taking Ctesiphon, the capital of Parthia, imposed a tribute on Mesopotamia, and reduced Assyria to the condition of a Roman province. He returned to winter at Antioch, which was in the same winter almost destroyed by an earthquake. Trajan escaped through a window, not without per sonal injury. It is said that beneath the ruins none were found alive, except an infant hanging to the"], [27, "HISTORY OF ROME. 19 breast of its mother, already dead, and a mother who had sustained her own and her child's life with her milk during those terrible days.* The river Tigris bore the victorious Emperor from the scene of his conquests down to the Persian Gulf; he subjugated Arabia Felix, and, like a second Alex ander, was meditating and even making preparations for an invasion of India by sea; but his ambitious designs were frustrated by troubles nearer at hand. Some of the conquered nations revolted, and his gar risons were either expelled or put to the sword. He sent his generals to crush the rebels; one of them, Maximus, was conquered and slain ; the other, Lusius Quietus, gained considerable advantages and was made governor of Palestine, which had begun to be in a state of insurrection. He himself marched to punish the revolted Hagareni {Saracens), whose city was called Atra, in Mesopotamia. It was situated in a desert plain, almost without water, occupying a posi tion of great natural strength, and surrounded with fortifications. Trajan laid siege to it, but was obliged to raise the siege with great loss. Soon after this he was seized with illness, which some attributed to poison : it was dropsy, accom panied with partial paralysis. Leaving his army therefore to the care of Hadrian, whom he had made governor of Syria, he embarked for Rome at the earnest solicitation of the Senate. On arriving at Selinus in Cilicia (afterwards named Trajanopolis), he was seized with diarrh\u0153a, and expired in the twentieth year of his reign. His corpse was burnt, * A. D. 115."], [28, "20 HISTORY OF ROME. and his ashes conveyed to Rome in a golden urn by his widow Plotina and his niece Matidia. They entered the gates in a triumphal car, on which was placed a statue of the deceased, and were buried beneath his magnificent column \u2014 an exception to the wise provisions of the Roman law, which forbade FAN'S COLU intramural burial. He died childless, and it is said had not intended to nominate a successor, following in this the example of Alexander. Hadrian owed his adoption to Plotina : it is said that after Trajan had expired, she caused some one to counterfeit the voice of the deceased Emperor, and to declare that he"], [29, "HISTORY OF ROME. 21 adopted Hadrian. Dio positively asserts that she concealed her husband's death for some days, and that the letter informing the Senate of his last inten tions was signed by her, and not by Trajan. Hadrian received the despatches declaring his adoption on the 9th of August, and those announcing Trajan's death two days afterwards. The eastern conquests of Trajan were not destined to be per manent ; almost all the conquered nations revolted, and his successor thought it wiser to surrender than to reconquer them. His works as a civilian conferred a more lasting benefit upon his subjects. Besides the ports and other works already mentioned, he adorned Rome with a library, a theatre, a large num ber of fountains, and the grand place in the middle of which stood his column ; he made a canal to dis charge the superfluous waters of the Tiber, and he provided for the public safety by forbidding the building of houses beyond the height of sixty feet."], [30, "22 HISTORY OF ROME.

The family from which he was de scended had settled at the birth-place of Trajan, and hence it has been supposed that he was a native of that town. His father, \u00c6lius Hadrianus Afer, was a Roman senator who had served the office of pr\u00e6tor, and had married an aunt of Trajan. He was left an orphan at the age of ten years, and was placed under the guardianship of Trajan and of a Roman knight named C\u00e6lius Attianus. Thus was the foundation laid for that confidence which Trajan reposed in him. As soon as he was proclaimed Emperor at Antioch, he sent an apologetic despatch to the Senate request ing their assent to his election ; the army, he said, had chosen him without waiting for their sanction,"], [31, "23 HISTORY OF ROME. lest the Republic should remain without a prince. The confirmation which he asked for was immediately granted. In return he repeated his predecessor's solemn promise that he would never put a senator to death, whilst he rewarded the devotedness of the soldiery with a double largess. COIN OF HADRIAN. It is recorded by Dion Cassius that during the night before he received intelligence of the Senate's assent he had a dream, which was thought to argue the future prosperity of his reign. He thought that the heavens were beautifully serene and bright, and that a flame of fire came down, and, after playing round his head, vanished without inflicting on him any injury. The Senate had, in its fulsome adulation, offered to him the triumph which it had decreed to Trajan. This, however, he positively declined, and insisted that it should be given to the late Emperor, to whom alone it of right belonged. The state of Roman affairs was at this moment a very critical one, and did not permit the new Emperor to leave the East. Emboldened by the news of Trajan's illness, the conquered Parthians had revolted"], [32, "24 HISTORY OF ROME. and achieved some great successes ; Sarmatia on the north, Mauritania, Egypt, and Syria on the south, were already in a state of insurrection. The far sighted prudence of Hadrian led him to fear that the empire was not unlikely to fall to pieces by its own weight, and that the Euphrates was its best boundary. It was doubtless a great sacrifice to surrender all the rich and populous provinces beyond that river which had been gained by the arms of his predecessor. It was no coward fear or mean envy of Trajan which prompted Hadrian, but he wisely felt that it was worth any price to purchase peace and security. Accordingly he withdrew the Roman armies from Armenia, Assyria, and Mesopotamia, constituted the former of these an independent kingdom, surrendered the two latter to the Parthians, and restored their deposed king Chosroes to his throne. In order to check the lawlessness of the Mauritanians, he gave the command in that coun try to Marcius Turbo, who had been successful in quelling the Jewish insurrection, and would gladly have given up Dacia but for the sake of the numerous Roman citizens who were settled there as colonists. After taking these measures for establishing peace in the East, he left Catilius Severus governor of Syria, and returned by way of Illyria to Rome, where he arrived the following year. The new Emperor commenced his reign with a liberal and generous policy. He distributed nume rous largesses to the people, and cancelled the debts due from a vast number of individuals to the imperial treasury, committing their bonds and memorandums to the flames. A restless curiosity, which was one of the"], [33, "25 HISTORY OF ROME. principal features in his character, would not permit him to remain inactive at Rome ; he determined to make a personal survey of every province throughout his vast dominions, and for this reason he is so fre quently represented on medals as the Roman Hercules. He commenced his travels with Gaul, thence he pro ceeded to Germany, where he established order and discipline amongst the Roman forces, and then crossed over to Britain. Since the recall of Agricola many abuses had prevailed amongst the Roman troops quartered there. These, with energetic promptness, he corrected and reformed. The heathen inhabitants of the island had recovered their liberty, and, in order to separate them from those who still submitted patiently to the Roman yoke, he built a wall extend ing from Newcastle to Carlisle. Having settled the affairs of Britain he recrossed into Gaul, and built a superb basilica at Nismes, in honour of the Empress Plotina. No relics of this building remain, but the amphitheatre and other antiquities in the neighbour- hood are supposed to have been the works of Hadrian or his successor. It would be uninteresting to give a mere catalogue of the countries which he visited during the ensuing ten years of his reign.* In the fifteenth winter of it he arrived in Egypt, and rebuilt the tomb of Pompey the Great at Pelusium. Thence he proceeded to Alexandria, which was at that period the university of the world. A portion of the magnificent palace, which occupied a quarter or even a third of the city, was devoted to the museum, the home of science and * A.D. 122 to A.D. 131. c"], [34, "26 HISTORY OF ROME. literature. There the scholars and philosophers had ample revenues assigned for their maintenance ; they were divided into collegiate bodies, who ate their commons* together ; and these sectional bodies were determined according to the sciences of which they were professors, or the philosophical schools to which they belonged. This academical institution, together with its celebrated library, was founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus. The Emperor Claudius enlarged it by a second foundation. The learned esteemed it an honour to be made fellows of this body, and Hadrian, on the occasion of his visit, conferred this distinction upon the philosopher Dionysius of Miletus, and an Egyptian poet named Pancrates. He himself had some scientific and literary merit, although his inge nuity was superior to his taste, for he preferred Anti machus to Homer, and Ennius to Virgil. He was remarkable for his readiness and liveliness in dispu tations, and therefore he proposed theses to the professors, and answered the philosophical questions which they proposed to him. Caracalla broke up the museum,f but it was afterwards resounded, and existed until its destruction in the reign of Aurelian.t. Hadrian, during his stay at Alexandria, visited the neighbourhood of Cyrene, and there hunted and killed with his own hand a huge and savage lion, which for some time had committed great devastations in the country, and had destroyed many of the inhabitants. In Egypt, also, his favourite, Antinous, died. It is said that, sailing with Hadrian on the Nile, he fell overboard and was drowned. Dio, however, asserts * mao-Ma. t a.d. 216. X A.D. 270."], [35, "HISTORY OF ROME. 27 that the Emperor, having learned by magical arts that in order to prolong his own life it was necessary that some one should die for him, accepted the offer of his friend to be a voluntary sacrifice. His grief A^TINOUS. was inconsolable. The Greeks, in compliment to the Emperor, deified this beautiful youth, and have filled Europe with his statues. Temples were erected in his honour, and the astrologers flattered Hadrian that he was now a star in the heavens. After building a town on the spot where he was buried, Hadrian bent his steps homeward. He had scarcely passed through Syria when the Jews revolted, and continued in arms for three years. In the reign of Trajan there had been a Jewish insur rection in Egypt and in the \" parts of Libya about Cyrene,\" in which they committed unheard-of cruel ties, and, according to Dio, utterly depopulated the country, having massacred two hundred thousand persons.* In the ensuing year there was another Jewish insurrection, equally bloody, in which the * A.D. 115. C 2"], [36, "28 HISTORY OF ROME. insurgents destroyed the city of Salamis, in Cyprus. and put the inhabitants to the sword; and in the same year a rising was threatened in Mesopotamia, CYFRl'S which was quelled by Lusius Quietus. The Jews having been crushed in all these revolts, remained quiet until the close of Hadrian's reign, when they broke out again in open war in Palestine itself. The alleged cause was that Hadrian had established a Roman colony at Jerusalem, had built a temple to Jupiter on the site of the temple of God, and had changed the name of the city to \u00c6lia Capitolina. Their ringleader was Bar-Cozeb (son of a lie), who took the name of Barcochebas {son of a star), in allusion to the"], [37, "HISTORY OF ROME. 29 prophecy of Balaam,* and pretended to be the Messiah. Hadrian sent an immediate reinforcement to the gover nor of Jud\u00e6a, Tinius Rufus, who executed a terrible vengeance on the revolters, sparing neither sex nor age. The temple was razed to the ground, and a plough passed over the site where it stood. It is said that during this war of three years five hundred and eighty thousand Jews fell in battle. Those who survived were sold as slaves, some at the fair held annually beneath the terebinth-tree of Abraham, others at Gaza, and a few were transported to Egypt, where they perished. All Jews, including Jewish converts to Christianity, were forbidden to enter Jerusalem, or even to approach so near as to be able to see the top of Mount Moriah ; and of the new Gentile colony established by Hadrian St. Mark was consecrated the first bishop. The loss of the Romans was so great that Hadrian, in his despatch to the Senate, could not commence with the usual salutation : \" Si vos et liberi vestri bene valetis, bene est, Ego quoque et exercitus bene valemus.\" {If you and your children are well, it is well, land the army are well also.) Jerusalem was again rebuilt, but the name was so completely forgotten in the new title of \u00c6lia Capitolina, that Eusebius writes that, a martyr at C\u00e6sarea having called himself a native of Jerusa lem, neither the governor of the province nor any of his officers understood his meaning. An unimportant war with the Alani or Massaget\u00e6 followed,t which is principally interesting because the general orders were written by the celebrated tactician Arrian. Hadrian spent the winter at Athens, where he * See Numbers xxiv. 17. t a.d. 134."], [38, "HISTORY OF ROME. 30 gratified his architectural taste by completing the temple of Jupiter Olympius. He was also initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, and presided at the festival of the Dionysia. By the 3d of May* he was in Rome, where he endowed professors, and ATHENS. founded a college for the study of literature and eloquence, which he called the Athen\u00e6um. Soon, however, he became afflicted with a constant bleeding at the nose, which exhausted his system, and brought on dropsy. Conscious, therefore, of the infirmities of disease and of advancing years, he adopted L. Aurelius Verus, a man of pleasure and of weak and delicate health, totally unfit for his new position. Hadrian retired to a magnificent villa, two miles distant from * a.d. 135."], [39, "31 HISTORY OF ROME. Tivoli, adorned with splendid works of art. In its extensive ruins sculptures of the most exquisite beauty have been discovered in modern times. The palace was surrounded with delightful gardens, adorned with the rarest exotics. Niebuhr states that many plants which are not found in any other part of Italy have been indigenous in that part from the time of Hadrian. But age and disease had now so altered his character that he became luxurious, self-indulgent, suspicious, and even cruel. Verus did not live two years, and the Emperor then adopted Titus Antoninus * on con dition that he should in his turn adopt M. Annius Verus, afterwards called M. Aurelius, and the son of Aurelius Verus, to the former of whom Verus had betrothed his daughter Faustina. His malady now became insupportably painful, his temper savage even to madness, and many lives of senators and others were sacrificed to his fury. His sufferings were so excruciating that he was always begging his attendants to put him to death. At last he went to Bai\u00e6, where, setting at defiance the pre scriptions of his physicians, he ate and drank what he pleased. Death, therefore, soon put a period to his sufferings, in the sixty-third year of his age and the twenty-first of his restless reign. Antoninus was present at his death, his corpse was burnt at Puteoli (Pozzuoli), and his ashes deposited in the mausoleum (moles Hadriani) which he had himself built, and which is now the Castle of St. Angelo. This massive building was originally adorned with a colossal statue of the Emperor, which was demolished by the Goths * A.D. 138."], [40, "32 HISTORY OF ROME. at the sack of Rome. His insane cruelties at the con clusion of his life had rendered him so hateful to the Senate that Antoninus with difficulty obtained for him the usual honour of an apotheosis. PUTEOLI Hadrian's character is a most remarkable one. His talents were brilliant but not profound. He had an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and a memory so retentive that there were few subjects with which he was not to a certain extent acquainted; he was, therefore, an accomplished rather than an able man.

He was born September 19th, a.d. 86. His ancestors had been natives of the towTi of Nismes in Gaul. He was a rich man, for he was so popular with his relations that many bequeathed to him their property. It is said that he owed his adoption by Hadrian partly to his filial affection ; that the Emperor was one day struck by seeing him enter the Senate-house with his aged father or grandfather leaning on his arm, and that he found by inquiring that this was his constant custom. If the anecdote be true, it is an indication of that patriotic benevolence"], [44, "36 HISTORY OF ROME. which in after-life had for its main object the happi ness of his subjects. The first instance which the new Emperor gave of his generosity was to pay the HA.

The twenty-three prosperous years of the reign of the first Antoninus belong to the obscurest portion of Roman History. Dark as are the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, that of Antoninus Pius is darker still. It was almost entirely undisturbed by domestic troubles or foreign wars. Whatever slight uneasinesses threatened the peace of the provinces were speedily calmed by his generals ; and no necessity for his personal presence"], [45, "HISTORY OF ROME. 37 with the army prevented him from devoting himself to the duties of civil government. But for this very reason his reign is by no means fruitful in the usual materials for history ; and the few notices which have ANT0HINU3 PIUS. been preserved of this period consist principally of general statements rather than of specific facts, and of outlines of the principles which regulated the practice of his administration.* A conspiracy was formed against him, the date of which is uncertain, by Attilius Tatianus and Priscian, of whom the latter committed suicide, the former was outlawed. He refused to have measures taken for the discovery of the other conspi rators, saying, \" I am not pleased that people should see that there are persons who do not love me.\" Disturb ances which broke out in Achaia, Egypt, Mauritania, Germany, and Dacia, and also in Jud\u00e6a, were soon repressed ; and whatever of these have any pretensions to be considered as wars must have been confined to the commencement of his reign, since in the year A. D. * Xipbilinus, in his Supplement to Dio's History, complains of the meagre relics of his 70th book, the incurable lacuna, and the almost total ignorance of this reign."], [46, "38 HISTORY OF ROME. 139 he received the title oilmperator for the second and last time. The same obscurity as to their date hangs over the exploits of the Romans in Britain during his reign, which conferred upon him the title of Britannicus. The Brigantes, who inhabited Northumberland, made a descent upon the districts which owned the Roman sway \u2014 according to Camden, a part of North Wales. They were defeated by Lollius Urbicus, and deprived of the principal portion of their territories: a vast rampart or earthwork was constructed for the defence of the northern frontier, which stretched across Scot- land from the Frith of Forth to the Frith of Clyde. Slight though the indications are, which history has transmitted, of the relations which subsisted between the imperial government in the capital and the distant extremities of the Empire, the absence of all important wars, the few incidents which occurred to break the calm repose of the Roman world, convey most im- portant information. It is sufficiently clear that the great war policy of the Roman nation, which was not content with conquest alone, but amalgamated the con- quered nations with themselves in their institutions, both civil and military, in their laws, and their muni- cipal rights, was now almost complete. The process had been slow, gradual, and almost imperceptible ; but the peaceful genius and temper of Antoninus and his successor, commonly called the two Antonines, were most favourable to its development. So far as it was possible for barbarians of the most opposite character? to become Romanized, the policy was proved to be perfectly feasible in the reign of Antoninus Pius,"], [47, "39 HISTORY OF ROME. and that of his successor saw the transformation complete. History having left nothing more than a general idea of the administration of Antoninus, it is only possible to attempt a sketch-like portrait of the prince, without a record of special acts, or a history of his times. His private character is a complete key to his public one. Seldom has prince or statesman ex hibited so much consistency in both capacities. His temper was unruffled and cheerful, his manners natural and free from affectation, his tastes were simple and averse to ostentation, he did not value applause or seek for adulation, and therefore he was free from all jealousy or envy of others who surpassed him in those qualities or accomplishments which command admi ration. In the management of his private property he was careful and exact ; prudent himself, he taught prudence to others by assisting them with loans at low interest, and on proper occasions he was generous even to magnificence. To the discharge of all matters of business he brought habits of application, a cool and patient judgment ; but, free from overweening self confidence, he habitually availed himself of the advice of those friends whom he trusted. Though a man of business, he was no busy-body ; tranquil, gentle, serene, and grave, he was never carried away by excessive passions. He showed himself able to rule others by always being master of himself. The fea tures of his countenance, composed, dignified, and benevolent, showed self-respect without selfishness, and kindness without weak partiality. These virtues of the individual shone forth with"], [48, "40 HISTORY OF ROME. greater brilliance in the emperor. He devoted himself to the sole cares and duties of government, whilst he despised all outward show \u2014 the gorgeous banquet, the royal robes, the cortege of guards. He enjoyed with sobriety the convivial society of his friends. He cul tivated the acquaintance of men of learning, and was always ready to listen and give his best consideration to measures recommended for the public welfare. With the advice of Gaius and other eminent jurists of his day, he made many regulations for the police of the Empire ; and, whilst he made himself accurately acquainted with the wants and conditions of the pro vinces, he was careful that the revenues should be collected without extortion, and that justice should be administered everywhere with impartiality. Liberal as he was at his own cost, he 'was economical in the management of the public revenues, and thus left a large surplus in the imperial treasury. He revoked all pensions which had been granted to unde serving persons. He shunned all unworthy means of enriching himself. It was the custom of those who died childless to bequeath their property to the reigning emperor : these legacies he declined. A prince endowed with such qualities could not be otherwise than peaceful in his policy : war was to him a stern necessity. He was, as historians have called him, a second Numa ; and the saying of Scipio was frequently on his lips, \u2014 \" I would rather preserve the life of a single citizen than slay a thousand enemies.\" Upon the whole, he was a good man rather than a great prince, and there is no doubt but that he had not strength of character to arrest that decay which"], [49, "HISTORY OF ROME. 41 so soon afterwards impended over the Roman Empire. He died at the age of sixty, so calmly that he seemed to sink into a quiet sleep. M. AURELIUS ANTONINUS. BORN A.D. 121 ; DIED A.D. 180. L. AURELIUS VERUS COMMODUS. DIED A.D. 169. M. Aurelius Antoninus was descended from the old and distinguished family of the Annii, and was born April 26th, a.d. 121. His original name was Catilius Severus ; but, after his father's death, being adopted by his grandfather, he took his name, M. Annius Verus. Hadrian, struck by his conscientious truth fulness in word and deed, was in the habit of calling him \"Verissimus.\" When adopted by Antoninus, he took the names of M. \u00c6lius Aurelius Verus. On AURELrri becoming Emperor, he transferred his name of Verus to L. Commodus, his brother by adoption, and assumed the name Antoninus. In his earliest years he gave proofs of a noble"], [50, "42 HISTORY OF ROME. nature and virtuous principles ; he was dutiful to his parents, affectionate to his relations, had a deep rever ence for the religion of his country, and was eminently pure-minded. Purity and virtue were expressed in ANTONINUS PIUS. every feature of his face, and his natural talents received an additional charm from his modesty. His intellectual tastes were trained by eminent teachers, and he was instructed in the different branches of a liberal education, literature, philosophy, and Roman law. At the early age of twelve he attached himself to the doctrines of the Stoics, which recommended themselves to his grave and self-denying spirit. So soon did he begin to look upon virtue as the highest good, vice as the greatest evil, and pleasure and pain as unworthy of the consideration of a wise man. His philosophy was not merely theoretical but practical, his creed influenced his heart as well a3 his head, and"], [51, "43 HISTORY OF ROME. its principles were illustrated in all the actions of his reign, and were expressed throughout the book of meditations of which he was the author. The pro sperity of his subjects verified his favourite Platonic maxim, \" that states would indeed be happy if their rulers were philosophers;\" and as his endeavours to promote the happiness of his people were founded upon the purest principles, he was beloved by the whole Roman world ; and in Italy, where his virtues were still better known, he was almost adored. At the age of twenty-five he married Annia Faustina, the daughter of Antoninus Pius, by whom he had several children, and although he loved her with the greatest tenderness, she was by no means worthy of so good a husband. On the death of Anto ninus Pius* the Senate conferred the Empire upon him alone ; but M. Aurelius associated with himself as his colleague L. Commodus (Verus), partly, according to Dio, because of infirmity of health, partly in order that he might have leisure ' imjra for philosophical study. Verus enjoyed robust health, and was of a more active temperament than his colleague; like him he had some taste for literature and philosophy, but he was fonder of trifling amusements than was consistent with the imperial dignity, and lived a life of luxury * A.D. 161."], [52, "44 HISTORY OF ROME. and self-indulgence. He had, however, great respect for M. Aurelius, and was wise enough to defer to him in everything, and modest enough to conduct himself rather as a coadjutor than a colleague. The peace which had been bequeathed to the new emperor was not destined to be of long continuance. Scarcely a year had passed before the Parthians broke out into open war, the barbarian Catti simultaneously made an inroad into Rh\u0153tia {the Tyrol), and there were rumours of rebellion in Britain.* These im pending calamities were still more perilous because peace had enervated the army and relaxed its disci pline. Active preparations, however, were made with out delay. Calphurnius Agricola was immediately despatched to Britain, Aufidius Victorinus made a campaign against the Catti, whilst Verus led his legions against the Parthians ; M. Aurelius remained at Rome to administer the home government. He was not sorry to give his colleague this opportunity of distinguishing himself, since he hoped that the active duties of a general might reclaim him from his love of pleasure and of frivolous amusements ; but he was disappointed, for Verus returned home worse than he went, corrupted by the enervating influences of Oriental life. Vologesus was at this period king of Parthia. He was probably the son of Cosrhoes, who had been restored to his throne. On the death of Antonine he declared war, and raised the whole country between the Tigris and Euphrates. He commenced the war with considerable energy and success, and in Armenia * A.D. 162."], [53, "HISTORY OF ROME. 45 defeated a Roman army with great slaughter, which was commanded by Severinus, a Gaul, who committed suicide ; he then marched into Syria, laid waste the country, and penetrated into Cappadocia. Whilst the enemy was achieving these fatal triumphs, Verus was endangering the welfare and honour of the state by culpable delay and foolish diversions. M. Aurelius accompanied him as far as Capua, and again joined him at Canusium {Canosa), where indulgence in feasting and folly had laid him on a bed of sickness. As soon as he recovered, he sailed to Corinth and Athens, amused himself in the principal cities of Asia, and at length took up his head-quarters at Antioch, where he remained during the whole war, which con tinued four years."], [54, "46 HISTORY OF ROME. Twice only during this period, at the urgent solici tation of his council of war, he marched as far as the Euphrates. Pretending that his commissariat was deficient, he left the whole conduct of the war to his lieutenant-generals, Statius Priscus, Avidius Cassius, and Martius Verus. History furnishes no detailed account of this war, but it is certain that the Roman arms were universally victorious. In one battle, Osrhoes, a prince of the royal house, who was com mander-in-chief of the army of Vologesus, saved his life by swimming across the Tigris, and found refuge TIGRIS. in a cave. Tradition ventures to make the incredible assertion that in this war the Romans slew three hundred and seventy thousand of their enemies with the loss of two killed and nine wounded ! The per manent result was a treaty of peace with Parthia, according to the terms of which Mesopotamia was ceded to the Romans. The Senate conferred upon"], [55, "47 HISTORY OF ROME. the two Emperors the title of \"Conqueror of the Medes and Parthians.\"* Whilst L. Verus was gaining his undeserved lau rels by deputy, M. Aurelius was earning his by the peaceful exercise of benevolence, justice, and political sagacity. Rome rang with his praises ; he was equally popular with all orders. He respected the privileges of the Senate, whilst his behaviour towards the people was never such as to remind them that they had no rights and no liberty. He was present at the debates of the Senate as if he were one of themselves, and frequently paid them the compliment of referring cases to them for decision which properly belonged to his own jurisdiction. He was indefatigable in the discharge of business, especially in the administration of justice, devoting his nights as well as his days to the consideration of important causes. Strict as he LUCIUS VERUS \u2014 TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO ROME. was in the punishment of great crimes, he still showed that his inclination was towards mercy, and to be severe towards himself rather than towards other men. So lenient was he, that it is related, that * A. D. 165."], [56, "48 HISTORY OF ROME. in the case of an inefficient pr\u00e6tor, instead of de priving him of his office, he contented himself with suspending him from the exercise of its functions. After an absence of five years,* L. Verus returned to Rome, and entered the city in triumph together with his colleague. The motley character of his triumphal procession was an indication of his frivolous disposition, for instead of captive kings to adorn his triumph, he brought a company of comedians in his train. The Senate conferred upon both the titles of Parthicus and Pater Patri\u00e6. At the solicitation of Verus, the children of M. Aurelius (Commodus and Annius) were made C\u00e6sars. f A fearful pestilence followed the march of his army from province to pro vince, \u2014 it spread desolation throughout the Roman world, especially in Italy, and many illustrious per sons fell victims to its poisonous breath ; at Rome two thousand persons died daily, and Africa alone escaped its fury. Niebuhr, not without reason, attri butes the greatest historical importance to this terrible scourge. As \" the reign of M. Aurelius,\" he writes, \" forms a turning point in so many things, especially in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague. The plague at Athens, in the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, forms a similar turning point in the history of Attica, and a pestilence in general always draws a strong line of demarcation between the periods on the boun daries of which it occurs. The Black Death, for ex ample, which raged in Germany in the year 1348, * A.D. 166. t Oct. 12."], [57, "HISTORY OF ROME. 49 put a complete stop to our early literature ; and the literature of Florence was manifestly affected in the same way. After the Black Death, the arts were for years at a perfect standstill. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague which visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius.\"* Superstition attributed its origin to Divine wrath, provoked by the plundering of a temple of Apollo at Seleucia or Babylon, by the Roman soldiery. It is said that they found there buried a magic casket of gold, from which, when forced open, there issued, as from a second Pandora's box, the pestilential vapour which infected so large a portion of the human race. Galen the physician, who was just attaining celebrity, makes frequent mention of this plague and its ravages. Famine and pestilence are seldom separated from one another. Rome on this occasion suffered from both these scourges, and, to add to their public difficulties, the Marcomanni, who had been for some time threaten ing an outbreak, took up arms against the Empire. The Emperor was averse to wrar unless it was abso lutely unavoidable, and the old Roman spirit or resistance to insult was now extinct. Negotiations deferred the crisis for a time, but at length it could be averted no longer, and, on the return of Verus, his colleague announced to the Senate that both Emperors must march into Germany. He evidently could not trust Verus by himself with the civil authority at home or with a military command abroad. The ex ample of the Marcomanni was followed by other nations, and all the barbarians on the frontier of the * Lect. cxxii. D"], [58, "50 HISTORY OF ROME. Empire, from Gaul to the eastern verge of Illyricum, joined their standard. The war raged with the utmost fury ; the Roman armies, already weakened by pesti lence, were unable to stem the tide; towns were captured and pillaged, whole provinces presented a scene of desolation. The barbarians retained for some time possession of Pannonia {parts of Austria, Hungary, and Sclavonia), and penetrated into Greece (now the Roman province of Achaia) as far as Elat\u00e6a in Phocis. The Romans had never measured swords with such formidable foes since the Punic wars. On the banks of the Danube an incident occurred which carries back the thoughts to the stern and severe discipline of the Republic. Some auxiliaries in the army, commanded by Avidius Cassius, hearing that three thousand Sarmatians were encamped by the river-side, attacked them when off their guard without waiting for orders, put them all to the sword, and returned laden with their spoils. They fully expected that their gallantry would meet with approbation and reward ; but Cassius, who saw the perils of relaxed discipline and insubordination, ordered the centurions to be crucified as if they had been slaves. This order caused a mutiny in the army, but Cassius rushed for ward unarmed and defenceless, and cried, \" Kill me if you will, and add this crime to your want of dis cipline.\" The mutineers were awed into silence, and discipline was completely re-established. So great was the effect which this act of severity produced upon the enemy, that they sent to sue for peace. The approach of the two Emperors struck a panic"], [59, "HISTORY OF ROME. 51 into the Allemanni, who were in arms ; all the barba rians seemed disposed for peace, and sent delegates to ask pardon for their rebellion. Upon this Verus wished to return to the pleasures and amusements of Rome, but M. Aurelius, finding that this appearance of affairs was not to be trusted, remained some time at Aquileia. made all the necessary preparations for insuring the safety of Illyricum and Italy, and not till then crossed the Alps and returned with his col league to Rome.* This formidable movement of the German tribes appears to have been caused by an advance westward of the Sclavonic nations. Driven before these formi dable hordes, the Marcomanni, Chatti, Quadi, and others made common cause with their former foes, the inhabitants of Sarmatia {Eastern Prussia and part of Poland), poured down upon the Roman frontier from Dacia {the Danubian provinces) to Gaul, and even penetrated into Rh\u0153tia (the Tyrol). Of the Marco manni history is silent after the wars of M. Aurelius ; probably they were broken up and dispersed amongst the Sclavonic invaders. In the following years the two Emperors assumed the title of hnperator , which implied that they had been victorious ; but the peace had been made with only a portion of the confederates, and did not last long, for in the ensuing year they left Rome for Aquileia, intending to winter there and open the cam paign against the Germans in the spring. J Scarcely, however, had they arrived at Altino when Verus was seized with apoplexy. He remained speechless for * A.D. 167. t A.D. 168. X A.D. 169. d2"], [60, "52 HISTORY OF ROME. three days, and then expired in the ninth year of his reign, at the age of thirty-nine. His remains were conveyed to Rome and buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian. So sudden was the death of this fainiant emperor, that his mother-in-law and wife, and even M. Aurelius himself, have been unjustly accused of poisoning him. There is no doubt that the follies of Verus had caused disagreement between him and his colleague, and that latterly M. Aurelius had seldom consulted him. But it is a strong proof of his gentle arid indulgent temper, that he bore so long with his frivolities. M. Aurelius now reigned alone,* and made vigorous preparations for carrying on the war. The Roman generals had already gained some advantages, which entitled the Emperor to be proclaimed Tmpierator for the sixth time. The cavalry of Vindex and the infantry of Candidus had put to flight six thousand Allemanni and Lombards who had crossed the Danube. But reverses followed, and Vindex was defeated and slain in an engagement with the Marco manni. About this time an impostor, named Alex ander, predicted victory and peace to the Romans if they would throw two lions into the Danube with certain ceremonies. His directions were complied with, but the event was so contrary to his predictions, that the Romans immediately afterwards lost in one battle twenty thousand men ; the barbarians pushed on to the frontiers of Italy, and almost took the town of Aquileia. The legions were now so thinned by war and pestilence that it was necessary to enlist * A.D. 170"], [61, "HISTORY OF ROME. 53 slaves (as had been done in the war with Hannibal) and gladiators, and to hire mercenaries even from amongst the Allemanni themselves. The expenses of the war, moreover, had almost exhausted the treasury, although at the death of Antoninus Pius it had con tained about sixty-three millions sterling. The Emperor, however, replenished it without taxation by a sale of property and jewels, and thus raised a suffi cient sum to carry on the war with the Marcomanni for five years, and to bestow an extra largess upon the people. The war went on slowly but successfully ; the Marcomanni, Sarmatians, Vandals, and Quadi, were driven out of Pannonia, and the title of Germanicus was conferred upon the Emperor's son Commodus.* On one occasion during the Marcomannian war, when the Emperor was present in person,f he and his army were intercepted and surrounded by the Quadi. It was the height of summer, and the army was re duced to the last extremity by the burning heat of the sun and want of water. On a sudden the sky became overcast, and rain fell in torrents and refreshed the thirsting army. The enemy chose this moment for a general attack, but the same storm which re lieved the Romans hurled lightning and thunder bolts against the ranks of the foe, the fire from heaven scorched them to death, and the very rain which fell seemed, like oil, to add fuel to the flames. Both Pagan and Christian historians have seen in this event a miracle. The former attribute it to magical arts, the latter assert that the Roman army was saved by the prayers of the twelfth legion, which was raised \u2022 A.D. 172. t A.D. 174."], [62, "54 HISTORY OF ROME. at Melitina in Armenia, and was composed of Chris tians. The Antonine column, the reliefs on which set forth the victories of Aurelius over the Marco manni, recognises the Jupiter of lightning and thunder as the author. Eusebius relates, that on ac count of this miracle the Emperor conferred on the twelfth legion the title of \" Thundering.\" This, however, is untrue, for it bore the title as early as the reign of Trajan. A letter is quoted by Tertullian and Eusebius, purporting to be written to the Senate by M. Aurelius on the subject of this incident, in which he seems inclined to attribute it to the prayers of the Christian soldiers, but there is every reason for sup posing that the letter is not genuine. It was on the occasion of this victory that the Emperor assumed the title of Germanicus. Notwithstanding his successes, and his own weakly constitution, he would not yield to the solicitations of his friends that he would return to Rome. He granted the Quadi peace, on condition that they did not approach within forty-eight stadia {six miles) of the Danube ; but this treaty was not of long duration, war broke out again, and continued into the next reign. The Marcomanni obtained peace on the same terms as the Quadi, together with the additional con dition of furnishing eight thousand cavalry. To other less formidable tribes peace was granted on easier terms, and in accordance with the wise policy of amal gamating them with the other subjects of the Empire, and giving them an interest in maintaining it, terri tories were assigned to them in Dacia, M\u0153sia, Pan nonia, Germany, and even in Italy itself."], [63, "HISTORY OF ROME. 55 The attention of Aurelius was now called in another direction ; Avidius Cassius, who had held many important military commands in succession, and was now governor of Syria, revolted.* L. Verus had already had occasion to suspect his loyalty, and had written to that effect to his colleague ; but the latter, always averse to think evil of others, declined to pay attention to his complaint. Cassius soon made himself master of the whole of Syria, of which, according to some authorities, he was a native, and his influence was even paramount as far as Egypt. The Jews joined his standard, the troops in Bithynia would have followed the example of the rest, had not their mutinous spirit been quelled by their com mander, Clodius Albinus. When the intelligence reached the ears of M. Aurelius, he at first concealed it ; but finding that it became publicly known, he in formed the army. He gently reproached Cassius for having made so unworthy a return for all his favours, and sent a despatch to the Senate expressed in similar terms. Cassius, who was an able man, possessed of great practical shrewdness, defended the course which he was pursuing, by alleging that the Emperor's ex cessive benevolence and studious habits rendered him unfit to cope with those enemies of the state who required to be checked by a strong and vigorous arm. A bloody civil war seemed to be imminent, when the leader of the rebellion was assassinated by a centurion named Antonius. His head was brought to M. Aurelius, but the gentle Emperor refused to see it, and instead of showing exultation, he complained of * a.d. 175."], [64, "56 HISTORY OF ROME. having lost an opportunity of showing mercy by giving him his life, and remonstrating with him on his ingratitude. This compassionate lenity he extended to all con nected with Cassius, and the accomplices in his revolt. A few centurions were put to death as a warning against committing an offence which is, by all military law, unpardonable ; but he restored to his wife and family half the property which had been forfeited by his treason, conferred a free pardon upon all the senators and knights who had professed themselves of his party, and upon the towns which had declared in his favour. No event in his reign exhibits in stronger colours the generosity and benevolence of M. Aurelius than his conduct on this occasion ; Divine Providence had crushed the re bellion, and he was too noble-hearted to entertain any feelings of personal revenge. Tertullian asserts that neither in this nor any other rebellion was a single Christian found implicated, so completely did the Church act up to the precept of their inspired teacher, \u2014 \" The powers that be are ordained of God.\" On the first outbreak of the rebellion, M. Aurelius had despatched Pertinax into Syria, and on the death of Cassius he had recalled him to be governor of Illyricum, and to take the command on the shores of the Danube. He himself set out for the purpose of re-establishing tranquillity in the East. He was accompanied by his wife Faustina, and his son Com modus ; the former died on the journey at a town on the spurs of Mount Taurus, which, in honour of her,"], [65, "HISTORY OF ROME. 57 he named Faustinopolis. His progress through Syria and Egypt, instead of bringing terror to the partisans of Cassius, assured them of his pardon and future good will, and this moderation conciliated the affec tion of all with whom he came in contact. After visiting Palestine, Alexandria, and Smyrna, he went to Athens,* where he established professorships in each SM1RXA philosophical school, with salaries averaging ten or twelve thousand drachm\u00e6 {four or six hundred pounds) . From Athens he returned to Rome, and entered the city in triumph with his sonCommodus,tin commemoration of his victories in the German wars. On his journey * A. D. 176. t December 23. d3"], [66, "58 HISTORY OF ROME. he received a letter from a celebrated philosopher named Aristides, informing him that Smyrna had, since his departure from that town, been desolated by a terrible earthquake. The intelligence of this mis fortune affected him to tears, and he lost no time in laying the case of the Smyrn\u00e6ans before the Senate by letter, for he would not touch the imperial treasure without their permission. After his arrival at Rome, he introduced a measure which indicates at once the wisdom and benevolence of his policy. If any insti tution had more than another demoralized Rome, it was that of the Circensian games ; such scenes of murder harden more than continual war. The sight of needless suffering and bloodshed brutalizes man's nature, and utterly destroys all moral sensibility. M. Aurelius forbade the gladiators from using any weapons but blunted swords, so that they could show their skill without endangering their lives. After a residence at Rome of nineteen months, the good Emperor departed on his last campaign,* and took Commodus with him, after having married him to Crispina, the daughter of Bruttius Pr\u00e6sens. Before he set out, he solemnly swore that no senator had been put to death by his order or with his know ledge, and that he would never touch the public money without the permission of the Senate, adding that it all belonged to the Senate and the people, and that a Roman emperor had no property. In this campaign the Romans gained a signal victory over the combined forces of the Marcomanni, Hermonduri, Sarmatians, and Quadi, and M. Aurelius in con- * a.d. 178, August 5."], [67, "HISTORY OF ROME. 59 sequence received the title of Imperator for the tenth and last time. It was not, however, allotted to him to reduce Germany to a Roman province. He was naturally of a delicate constitution, into which the fatigues and privations of eight campaigns had made great inroads ; and a contagious disease which was prevalent in the army seized him at Vendobona {Vienna), and after an illness of seven days he ex pired calmly, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, and the twentieth of his reign.* The same unselfish regard for others which had been the great feature of his life, distinguished his last moments, for he forbade his son to prolong his last interview for fear he should catch the infection. He recommended him to the loyalty of the army, and entreated his friends to aid him with their counsel ; but the vicious habits of Commodus embittered the death-bed of Aurelius, and, according to Dio, at his instigation the physicians hastened the last moments of the Emperor. A short time before he died, a tri bune asked him for the parole, and his reply was, \"Go to the rising sun, for my beams are setting.\" He died universally beloved, and his ashes were entombed in the Mausoleum of Hadrian. It is unnecessary to enumerate the leading charac teristics of this great and good prince, for every action of his life was instinct with them. There can be no doubt that the sole end which he kept in view was the happiness and prosperity of his people, and the success which attended the policy of himself and his predecessor is at least a sign of its soundness, as * A. D. 180, March."], [68, "60 HISTORY OF ROME. well as of its benevolence. Whatever errors he had were on the side of kindness and humanity ; he may have been too partial to his friends and too lenient to offenders, but his clemency was not the result of mere instinctive feeling, but of the principles and dictates of the purest school of heathen philosophy. He knew what human nature was \u2014 its weakness and imper fections, and he was conscious that it demanded, as a right, indulgence rather than severity. It was an error to have associated Verus with himself as a colleague, but he endeavoured to correct that mistake by acting on his own responsibility without asking his counsel. It would have been better if he had ruled the governors of the distant provinces with a stronger and sterner hand. It was wrong to raise Commodus to the dignity of Augustus and the offices of tribune and consul, at an age when those very external circumstances were likely to develop the worst qualities of his nature ; but great allowance must be made for the feelings of an affectionate father towards a son who was naturally rather weak than wicked, especially as he left no means untried to educate his faculties, and to correct the faults of his moral nature."], [69, "HISTORY OF ROME. 61 CHAPTER IV.

The decline of Roman literature had doubtless commenced after the death of Augustus ; taste had become too rhetorical, genius had been paralysed, and its free aspirations checked by tyranny and cruelty. But when political circumstances became more favourable to the develop ment of talent, when men were permitted to think as they pleased, and to give utterance to what they thought,* the poet breathed again, the love of the sublime and beautiful revived, and language which had become cold and declamatory, was animated by noble and vigorous sentiments. This improvement had already commenced during the better times of Titus. and Vespasian, and even the tyrant Domitian arrested * Tacit. Hist. i. 1."], [70, "62 HISTORY OF ROME. the downward progress of Roman literature, for he himself had some taste, and wrote verses/' and gave encouragement to learned men. At the head of those who at the commencement of this era rescued learning from corruption, stands forth Tacitus, the representative of true Roman in dependence of thought. He stands alone, no one approaches near him ; he learned of no school, he owes to no mortal man those purely original powers which influenced his own and succeeding ages. He had already published his Life of Agricola in the latter years of the reign of Domitian, but his great works belong to the times of his successors. The writing of history was too dangerous an employment under a tyrannical emperor, but it found patronage under the fostering influence of a Trajan. Next to Tacitus stands his admirer, the younger Pliny. In the writings of these two great contemporaries, we find dignity, gravity, honesty, and truthfulness. In corruptible virtue is as visible in the pages of Tacitus, as benevolence and tenderness are in the letters of Pliny. They mutually influenced each other's cha racters and principles, their tastes and pursuits were similar, they loved each other affectionately, corrected each other's works, and accepted patiently and grate fully each other's criticisms. If, however, on all occasions their observations were such as appear in the letters of Pliny, it is probable that their mutual regard, and the admiration which Pliny felt for his friend, made them rather laudatory than severe. \u2022 Domitian was the author of a paraphrase of the Pk\u0153nomena of Aratus, a poem which enjoyed a large share of popularity. St. Paul quotes from it (Acts xvii. 28)."], [71, "HISTORY OF ROME. 63 The exact date of the birth of Tacitus is not known, but it may be inferred from one of the letters ot Pliny,* that he was one or two years older than the latter, and therefore born about A.D. 59 or 60. He was of equestrian rank, and was procurator of Belgic Gaul, in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus. He was also one of the fifteen commissioners ap pointed to celebrate the Ludi S\u0153culares,^ and served the offices of pr\u00e6tor and consul. His wife was the daughter of C. Julius Agricola, but it is not known whether he left any descendants. The extant works of Tacitus are (1) a life of Agricola, (2) a tract on the manners of the Germans, (3) a fragment of a larger work entitled Histories, (4) two-thirds of another historical work entitled Annals. None of these, except the Agricola, were published before the accession of Trajan. So great was the admiration which Tacitus entertained for his father-in-law, that his life of him is rather a panegyric than a biography, but still that brief sketch is a beautiful and vigorous portrait, even if the likeness is flattered, and one of the most attractive biographies extant. To us it is especially interesting, because Britain was the scene of his glory as a military commander, and of his success in civil administration. . The treatise on Germany is short, and as the author was never in that country, his geographical descriptions are often vague and inaccurate, and some of the narrative consists of mere travellers' tales ; but his descriptions of manners are truthful, and are supported by well-known Teutonic habits and insti- * Plin. Ep. vii. 20. t a. D. 80."], [72, "64 HISTORY OF ROME. tutions. He tells of the German bards, and explains the meaning of the term by the word Barditum, which signified the recitation of poems, of wild legends such as those in which the Germans still delight. He describes their pure race, and consequently the universal prevalence of the national features, \u2014 blue eyes, light hair, and gigantic frames. According to his account their political constitutions were elective monarchies, limited in power by a popular assembly. The youth were solemnly invested with lance and shield like knights, and in the high estimate in which woman was held we see the germ of chivalry. They were hospitable, constant in family friendships, unforgiving in hereditary feuds, fond of gambling, strict as to debts of honour, great drinkers of beer, and averse to transacting business without a convivial meeting. Their slaves were serfs or villains, and, as we do still, they reckoned their time by nights in stead of days. In speaking of our forefathers, the Angli, who inhabited part of Schleswig-Holstein, he relates that they worshipped Herthus {Earth), i. e. Terra, and mentions the naval prowess of the Suiones, the ancestors of the Normans and Sea-kings. These histories are mingled with fables. In the regions of the north he affirms that a hissing noise is heard as the blazing orb of the sun plunges into the sea, and the awful forms of the gods, their heads surrounded with halos of glory, are visible. The period comprehended in the \" Histories,\" ex tended from the second consulship of Galba to the death of Domitian, and as the word Divus (the deified) occurs in connexion with Nerva and not with Trajan,"], [73, "HISTORY OF ROME. 65 it is plain that they were written after the latter's accession. The object of the author in this great work, was \"to investigate the political state of the commonwealth, the feelings of its armies, the senti ments of its provinces, the elements of its strength and weakness, the causes of each historical phenome non.\"* It was an object worthy of the philoso phical historian, the Eoman Thucydides. His only faults \u2014 and these are comparatively few \u2014 arise from his accepting- information and evidence without GLEN IN CRETE. sufficiently examining their value. Hence the false traditions wdiich he relates respecting the Jews. According to him, the chosen people migrated to * Hist. i. 4."], [74, "66 HISTORY OF ROME. Palestine from Crete, and from Mount Ida received the name of Id\u00e6i, which was afterwards corrupted into Jud\u00e6i. Egypt being afflicted with a plague, the king Bocchoris, by the advice of the oracle of Ammon, purged his kingdom of them, and they wan dered forth under the guidance of Moses. Dying of thirst, they followed a herd of wild asses, which led them to a well of water. Moses therefore set up the image of an ass in the sanctuary of their temple. This statement he afterwards virtually contradicts by saying that the Jews allow no images in their temple, that they preferred taking up arms to admit ting the statue of Caligula into the sanctuary, and that when Pompey took Jerusalem, he found no image of any deity, and the sanctuary empty. He adds that they sacrifice rams in contempt of Ammon, and oxen, because in Egypt Apis was worshipped under that form ; that they abstain from pork because of the leprosy to which swine are liable, and eat unleavened bread as a memorial of their having once stolen food. He asserts that, according to some authorities, they keep holy the seventh day and seventh year in honour of Saturn, and embalm their dead like the Egyptians. The \"Annals\" commence with the death of Augus tus, and end with that of Nero. They contain rather biographies of the emperors, than the history of the Roman people, but this is the necessary condition of narrating the fortunes of a nation which now pos sessed only the bare name, and not the reality of a constitution. The state was now the emperor, the end and purpose of the social system his security, and"], [75, "67 HISTORY OF ROME. every political event was therefore treated in its rela tion to him. The philosophical importance therefore of the \"Annals,\" consists in their being amoral rather than a political study. They do not paint the rise, progress, and development of constitutional freedom, for it had reached its zenith, had declined, become paralysed, and finally extinct. The object of Tacitus, therefore, was not like that of the philosophical historian of Greece, to describe the growth of poli tical institutions, the strife between classes, and opinions, and principles, but the influence which the establishment of tyranny on the ruins of liberty exercised for good or for evil in bringing out the character of the individual. The imaginary speeches of Tacitus are perfect specimens of art ; as a general rule, more truthful than those of other Roman historians. Nevertheless, he made use of this form of writing, not only to embody traditional accounts of what had been really said, but also to illustrate the character of the speaker, and to convey his own political opinions. To sagacious observation and descriptive power, Tacitus added incorruptible integrity in the midst of the influences of a corrupt age. The purity and gravity of his sentiments are worthy even of a Chris tian writer. In the style of Tacitus, form is always subordinate to matter, language to ideas. It is difficulty because his sentences suggest more than they express, but his brevity is the necessary condensation of a writer whose thoughts flow more quickly than his pen can express them. Nor is this brevity dry and uninteresting; for his language is highly figurative,"], [76, "68 HISTORY OF ROME. his descriptions picturesque, and his characters de lineated with dramatic power. The other great literary light of Trajan's reign, C. Plinius C\u00e6cilius Secundus, was sister's son to the elder Pliny, and was adopted by his uncle. He was born on the beautiful shores of the lake of Como,* and learned eloquence and belles lettres by con stant attendance upon the lectures of Quintilian. Before he had completed his fifteenth year, he wrote a Greek tragedy, and also composed verses with quickness and facility. He was called to the bar in his nineteenth year, and gained celebrity as a pleader. He stood high in favour with Tra jan, and filled with distinction high offices, both civil and military. So anxious was he for the education of the youth of his native town, that he offered to aid in founding a school and library, and in endowing exhibitions for ingenuous students. The works of Pliny consist of a panegyric of Trajan, a somewhat fulsome piece of courtly flattery, and a collection of letters in ten books. The fact that many of them were designed for publication detracts somewhat from their value as truthful exponents of the writer's thoughts, but nevertheless they give an insight into the writer's character, the politics of the day, and the mind and manners of his illustrious con temporaries. For liveliness, elegance, and simplicity they are scarcely inferior to those of Cicero, whom he evidently took for his model. They show as great versatility of talent as those of Horace Walpole. The tenth book, which consists of his despatches * A.D. 61."], [77, "HISTORY OF ROME. 69 to Trajan, together with the Emperor's rescripts, will be read with the greatest interest. The well-known despatch respecting the Christians, written from Bithynia, and the Emperor's answer,* illustrate the marvellously rapid propagation of the Gospel, the manners of the early Christians, the treatment to which their constancy exposed them, even under favourable circumstances, and the jealousy with which even a governor of gentle temper thought it his duty to regard them. The letters of Pliny amply prove the accurate and judicial character of his mind, his political and ad ministrative wisdom, his taste for the beautiful, his power of description, his unrivalled neatness, his power of imparting interest to every subject which he takes in hand. His touches are neither too many nor too few. A note of thanks for a present of thrushes f shows as much skill in its way as a des patch to the Emperor. His brief biographical notice of Silius Italicus contains all that could be said favourably of his correspondent. His sympathy with his friends is exhibited in the few lines which he wrote to Geminius on the death of the wife of Macrinus, his honesty in the case of Pomponia's in heritance, his legal skill in numerous passages, his descriptive power in the narrative of the eruption of Vesuvius, in which his uncle perished, and in the full and minute portraiture of his villa, its vari ous furniture, works of art, garden, and surrounding scenery.

Lenis, who served at the battle of Bedriacum, was probably born soon after the death of Nero.* He was an advocate and private secretary to Hadrian. Pliny the younger speaks of him as a man of integrity and learning, and adds that the more he knows of him the more he loves him. His chief writings were the lives of the twelve C\u00e6sars, and of eminent literary men. It is probable that his biographies of the C\u00e6sars were written subsequently to the Histories of Tacitus, as many parallelisms of language may be traced in them ; still his sources of information are quite independent of Tacitus. He quotes from fasti edicts and inscriptions, and evidently himself con sulted original documents. Moreover, his situation at court afforded him many means of obtaining mate rials for his memoirs. Many of his biographies are those of his contemporaries ; some of the events recorded were matters of public notoriety, and his anecdotes were, most probably, topics of gossip and scandal in all circles of Roman society. As a biographer he is honest and truthful ; the terrible pictures which he draws of moral depravity are fully supported by Juvenal and Tacitus, but his mind was not of that comprehensive or philosophical character which would have qualified him for the work of a historian. It would have been well if he had touched more lightly, and not described with such revolting faithfulness, the wickedness and crimes of the most profligate emperors. The brief epitome of Roman history by L. Ann\u00e6us Florus probably belongs to the reign of Trajan. The * a.d. 68."], [79, "71 HISTORY OF ROME. author of it was either a Spaniard or a Gaul. It is inaccurate and uninteresting, compiled without taste or spirit, and its declamatory style is characteristic of the rhetorical spirit of the age. Sextus Julius Frontinus deserves a place amongst the prose writers of this period as the author of two works still extant. One was a treatise on military tactics in the form of precepts and anecdotes of celebrated generals, the other, an architectural work descriptive of those wonderful monuments of Roman art \u2014 the aqueducts. Besides these, fragments of other treatises remain on land-surveying, and on the laws and customs relating to landed property. They are partly of a scientific, partly of a jurisprudential character. Of Frontinus himself but little is known; he was city pr\u00e6tor in the reign of Vespasian, and, as governor of Britain, made a successful campaign against the Silures. He had subsequently a seat in the College of Augurs, in which, after his death,* he was succeeded by the younger Pliny. The noble satirist Juvenal lived to see those awful times pass away which he described in such appalling terms. He had himself been a martyr to his brave sincerity, and because he had not spared the profligacy of the court favourite, Paris, had been exiled to Egypt. But after the period of political horrors and moral degradation in which the prime of his life had been passed, his spirit revived when he saw the promise of national honour and prosperity in the reigns of Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian. Nor did he lose the opportunity of giving utterance to his burning * About A.D. 106."], [80, "72 HISTORY OF ROME. indignation when Rome, wisely governed, enjoyed security and peace. Noble as was Juvenal's hatred of vice, he is a stern and misanthropic moralist. His truthful words must have made the guilty tremble; but he was not one to recall the erring to a love of virtue. He was evidently deficient in the softer affections. Of his sixteen satires the two finest are the third and tenth, which our own Johnson has thought worthy of imitation, the latter of which Bishop Burnet, in his pastoral Charge, recommended to his clergy ; and the noblest passage in them is that in which he describes the fall of the infamous Sejanus.* The conclusion of the thirteenth satire is almost Christian. Juvenal closes the list of Roman satirists, properly speaking, but the same spirit animates the epigrams of his friend Martial ; their purpose, however, is not moral or didactic ; they sting the individual, and make him an object of scorn and disgust, but they do not hold up vice itself to ridicule and detestation. M. Valerius Martialis was a Spaniard who migrated to Rome in the reign of Nero. Domitian conferred upon him many favours, appointed him court poet, and assigned him a town and country house, as well as a pension. Nevertheless, he was always complaining of his poverty, and, like many literary men, he thought that every one was better paid than himself. Late in life he married a rich Spanish heiress, whom he praises for her rare genius and sweet manners. But his discontented temper prevented him from enjoying her wealth and beautiful estate, for when at Rome he pined for Bilbilis, when at Bilbilis he regretted Rome. * Sat. x. 56\u201467."], [81, "HISTORY OF ROME. 73 Although Martial unsparingly attacks the loathsome profligacy of his times, his own moral taste must have been thoroughly depraved, as he evidently delights in the description of impurity. Not all his poems, however, are spiteful or obscene ; here and there are to be found pleasing descriptions of the beauties of nature, and the various couplets which he wrote to accompany trifling offerings of friendship, such as pin-cases, tablets, toothpicks, &c. are graceful, com plimentary, and kind-hearted. The Punica of C. Silius Italicus is the dullest and most tedious poem in the Latin language, although to such an extent does care and polish compensate for want of genius, that his versification is harmonious and Virgilian, and some of his episodes are beautiful.

He was a native of Italica, in Spain, commenced life as an advocate, was an intimate and favourite of Nero and Vitellius, and retired after a prosperous public career to enjoy his ease and affluence in the delightful vicinity of Naples. Trajan endeavoured to entice him to court, but in vain ; he would not leave the villa of Virgil, where he resided surrounded by a large collection of books, busts, and statues, which he almost worshipped. He kept Virgil's birthday more religiously than his own, had more busts of him than of any one else, and habitually visited his tomb as if it was a temple. He attained the age of seventy-five, and being afflicted with carbuncle, starved himself to death because he could not bear the pain of disease. E"], [82, "74 HISTORY OF ROME. To this catalogue must be added the name of the Emperor Hadrian himself, if it were only for the sake of the beautiful address to his soul which Pope has imitated in his \" Dying Christian : \" \u2014 \" Animula vagula blandula, Hospes comesque corporis, Qu\u00e6 nunc abibis in loca ? Pallidula rigida nudula, Nee ut soles dabis jocos.\" To the most distinguished teacher of rhetoric in this peculiarly rhetorical age, M. Fabius Quintilianus, Rome owed the temporary restoration of a purer taste. He was a native of Calabria, in Spain, and was tutor to the great nephews of Domitian, and to the younger Pliny. As he held one of the professorships endowed by Vespasian for twenty years, and died in A.D. 118, he was most likely writing and lecturing during the reigns of Nerva and Trajan. In his great work, the Institutiones Oratori\u0153, he traces the progress of the orator from the cradle until he arrives at perfection. His views on the subject of education are especially interesting. After analysing carefully the sciences of grammar and rhetoric, he reviews rapidly the whole history of Greek and Roman literature, his remarks on which, though brief, are marked with clearness, taste, and judgment; there are, in fact, few specimens of criticism so suggestive and attractive as this portion of his work. The remainder of it is occupied with a discussion of the range of subjects to be studied, and the twelfth book, which he desig nates as the most important part of the whole, has for its subject the moral qualifications necessary for the complete orator. His noble dictum is, \" Neque erit"], [83, "75 HISTORY OF ROME. perfectus orator nisi qui honeste dicere et sciet et audebit. ' {No one will be a perfect orator unless he knows how to speak honestly and dares to do so.) Quintilian has exhausted his subject, and left, as a monument of his taste and genius, a text-book of the science and art of oratory, as well as a masterly sketch of the eloquence of antiquity. Roman jurisprudence in the reign of Hadrian attained the dignity of a science, and was reduced to that systematic form which it has ever since exhibited. This branch of knowledge, together with its kindred subjects, statesmanship and oratory, naturally engaged the attention of every enlightened Roman. The con- stitutional relation which subsisted between patron and client rendered the knowledge of its principles, to a certain extent, absolutely necessary. Protection from wrong was the greatest boon which the learned could confer upon the unlearned ; it was the best method of gaining friends, and by their support the highest political positions. Eminence as a jurisconsult opened a direct path to eminence as a statesman. In the reign of Hadrian, the first systematic work on Roman law was published, viz. the Enchiridion or Manual of Pomponius, and the laws were codified under the title of \" Edictum Perpetuum,\" by which the imperial edicts or proclamations were made of final authority in the reign of S. Severus. Papinian enriched legal literature with several works, and in the reign of Antoninus Pius, owing to the compre- hensive genius and unwearied industry of Gaius, jurisprudence reached its golden age. Owing to Hadrian's long residence in Athens, and e 2"], [84, "76 HISTORY OF ROME. his consequent taste and admiration for Greek, the lite rature of Rome became Hellenized, and at length the Romans forsook the use of their native tongue and wrote in Greek, as they had in the infancy of the national literature. Nevertheless, the age of the Antonines could boast of such writers as A. Gellius and L. Apuleius. The pedantic rhetorician Cornelius Fronto, the tutor of M. Aurelius, is scarcely worth mentioning, as his letters are only valuable for the light which they throw upon the character of his imperial pupil. The Nodes Attic\u00e6 of A. Gellius is a commonplace book of historical, literary, and arch\u00e6ological recollections, the result of study and conversation, put together without order or arrangement, for the instruction and amusement of the author's children. It is amusing and learned, and the original remarks and discussions which are interspersed are ingenious and clever ; but Gellius was not an acute or accurate observer, he misunderstood contemporary events, and was ignorant of the history of past times. His work bears marks of the rhetorical and grammatical taste of the times in which he lived. It was written in the latter part of the reign of M. Aurelius, and owes its title to its having been the employment of the author's winter evenings during a residence at Athens. L. Apuleius was an African by birth, and is best known as the author of the romance entitled \" Meta morphoses, or the Golden Ass.\" (Metamorphoseon sive de Asino Aureo, Libri XL) This work, as well as the Ass (6'vo?) of Lucian, was founded on a similar work by Lucius, a native of Patr\u00e6, and belongs to a class of fictions commonly called Milesi\u0153 fabul\u0153. It"], [85, "HISTORY OF ROME. 77 is a satire upon the profligate manners of the times, and particularly on the hypocrisy of certain priestly orders. The most beautiful portion of it is the well-known allegory of Cupid and Psyche in the fourth, fifth, and sixth books, which metaphorically portrays the onward progress of the immortal soul. Many people supposed that the contents of the \"Golden Ass \" were true history, and it is said that even St. Augustine was not quite certain on this point. Not withstanding his sprightly humour and lively fancy, the style of Apuleius is disfigured by unnatural con ceits and studied affectation. Although he had the advantage of residing both at Athens and Rome, he belonged to the African or Carthaginian school of literature, which in the next generation produced the eloquent Tertullian. Its characteristic blemish was a parade of archaism, or delight in obsolete words and phrases culled from the old Latin literature. Pro bably at Carthage, as all the neighbourhood still spoke Punic, Latin was taught almost as a dead language, and therefore that school affected an archaic style, imagining it to be purer than later Latin. With the exception of this fault, the writings of Apuleius show graceful eloquence and a vivid imagination. Having a great thirst for knowledge, Apuleius spent all his means in travelling, but repaired his shattered fortunes by marrying a rich widow much older than himself, at whose house he lodged. The relations accused him of having gained the lady's affections by sorcery, and his defence {apologia) which he delivered on this occasion is more natural than his other com positions, and is very ingenious and eloquent. \"Are"], [86, "78 HISTORY OF ROME. you surprised,\" said he, \" that a lady should marry again after having been a widow thirteen years ? The wonder is that she did not marry sooner. You ima gine that magic alone can account for a widow of her age marrying a young man ; why, this circumstance of itself proves that no magic was necessary.\" Such were the authors, possessing various degrees of merit, who flourished during the period which commences with Nerva and terminates with the death of the second Antonine. An account of the contem porary Greek literature does not fall within the scope of this history. It was full of brilliance and cheer fulness, it flourished in the Eastern Empire, which was more Greek than Roman in its tastes and sentiments, and it boasted of such contributors as Pausanias, Galen, Lucian, Plutarch, and Dio Chrysostom."], [87, "79 HISTORY OF ROME.

It was thus that during a period of eighty-four years the heterogeneous elements which composed the vast fabric of the Roman Empire were held together and prevented from crumbling to ruin, by the virtues and abilities of five successive emperors. The Roman people itself had long become a cypher in the great sum total. It had long ceased to value liberty ; it was pleased with the image of it and the mere un substantial shadow of the constitution. The titles of consul, pr\u00e6tor, tribune, satisfied the popular re quirements, and it mattered not in whose hands the real power rested. Crushed by civil cruelty and military despotism, taught by experience the peril of interference in politics, demoralized by amusements of the most brutalizing kind, and coveting only the daily bread which the constant largesses provided,"], [88, "80 HISTORY OF ROME. the citizens of Rome were only too glad to find breathing time from the wanton cruelties of sensual tyrants. The senator, whose life was never safe for a single day, hailed the advent of emperors who solemnly promised never to put a senator to death, and were found to keep their word. The quiet re spectability of Nerva, the soldierlike decision of Trajan, the Augustan peacefulness of Hadrian and Anto ninus Pius, and lastly the tenderness of M. Aurelius, and the resemblance of his sway to a limited monarchy and to responsible government rather than to an absolutism, furnished precisely the condition which prevented the huge frame from falling to pieces by its own weight. The foundation had long been unsound, the materials of the superstructure were too various to be secure, and hence, when the props which sup ported it were removed, it began to experience the sure though gradual process of decay. COMMODUS. BORN A.D. 161; DIED A.D. 192. L. \u00c6lius Aurelius Commodus was born August 31, A.D. 161, and was therefore less than nineteen years of age when he assumed the purple. He was handsome and athletic in body, but weak in disposition, easily led, prodigal and extravagant, and, as a consequence, grasping and avaricious ; and experiencing the satiety of licentiousness, like other voluptuaries he sought satisfaction in the excitements of savage cruelty. He commenced his reign under the most auspicious circum stances. All were ready to respect him for his father's sake, and to welcome him with joy and affection."], [89, "HISTORY OF ROME. 81 At first he seemed inclined to follow the advice of those counsellors to whose care his father on his death bed had recommended him ; for when his flatterers TOMMODUS. tried to persuade him to exchange the hardships of a German campaign for the pleasures of the capital, he took the advice of his brother-in-law Pompeianus, and remained in Pannonia. He did not take the field in person, but some victories which were gained by his generals entitled him to assume the title of Imperator for the fifth time. He then readily granted peace to the Quadi, Allemanni, and Marcomanni, on condition of their approaching the Danube no nearer than six miles, at which distance the Romans had constructed a line of forts. Although he concluded this peace, he by no means terminated the war, for he was in a hurry to return to Rome. He entered the city in triumph with universal acclamations, conferred a liberal largess upon the army and the people, and received from the Senate the surname of Pius, and that of Felix in the following year.* * A.D. 181. e3"], [90, "82 HISTORY OF ROME. His life of dissolute pleasure commenced imme diately, but for three years he entrusted the adminis tration of public business to the eminent statesmen who had been his father's friends. One instance of generosity is recorded of him during this period. Manilius, the secretary and confidant of Avidius Cassius, had fled upon the discovery of the con spiracy, and had remained in concealment ever since. In order to gain favour with Commodus, he offered to disclose the names of many who were implicated in the revolt, but Commodus refused to listen to him, and burnt the letters without reading them. A rising of the Dacians was speedily quelled by Albinus and Niger,* who are subsequently known in history as the rivals of Severus; but the most im- COMMODUS. portant war of this reign was that in Britain.t The northern tribes forced a passage across the wall of Hadrian, laid waste the country, and cut to pieces a division of the Roman army of occupation. Com modus forthwith sent thither Ulpius Marcellus, a *a.d. 182. +a.d. 183."], [91, "HISTORY OF ROME. 83 rough and rude soldier, a rigid disciplinarian, a man of unwearied vigilance, incorruptible integrity, and self-denying temperance. It is said that he had his bread sent ready made from Rome in order that it should be so stale as not to tempt him to eat more than was absolutely necessary. This general appears to have carried on the war with great skill and suc cess, and to have gained such universal esteem that his valuable life was almost sacrificed to the petty jealousy of the Emperor. The mutiny was finally quelled by Pertinax, who was afterwards the successor of Commodus on the throne. Three years had scarcely passed away when the youthful Commodus, absorbed in licentious pleasures, neglected his wise counsellors, became utterly in different to his public duties, and left the affairs of state to his pandars and flatterers. The commands of armies were distributed at the will of an athlete named Narcissus ; freedmen sold the imperial patron age, insolence and corruption were supreme, and soon the executioner began to remove out of the way those who from their honesty and patriotism became ob noxious to the jealousy of the Emperor or the hatred of his vicious favourites. This course of conduct pro voked the enmity of the Senate, and his sister Lucilla, jealous of the precedence of the Empress Crispina, took advantage of this hostility to organize a conspiracy against his life. Many senators readily became accomplices in the plot. One day, as Commodus was entering the Amphi theatre by a dark and narrow passage, one of the conspirators rushed upon him with a drawn dagger,"], [92, "84 HISTORY OF ROME. exclaiming, \" See what the Senate sends you ! \" Be fore he struck the blow the guards seized him. The assassin and several of his accomplices were executed ; LUCILLA. Lucilla was banished to Capre\u00e6, and some time after put to death. Hatred towards the Senate, which the words of the assassin inspired, fixed for ever the character of Commodus. The sanguinary scenes of the worst reigns were re-enacted. Those bloodhounds, the public informers, encouraged by the suspicions of the Emperor, revived ; all whom their fingers pointed at were condemned and executed, and each innocent man who suffered involved many others equally innocent in his ruin. In the long catalogue of those who fell victims to his remorseless cruelty appears the name of his empress Crispina, who was, like Lucilla, first banished to Capre\u00e6 and then put to death. The most influential in corrupting the young Emperor was Perennius or Perennis, whom he had elevated to the dignity of second prefect of the Pr\u00e6torians. He was a brave soldier, but a wily intriguer, and encouraged Commodus in his profligate"], [93, "HISTORY OF ROME. 85 habits in order to get the political power into his own hands. By his unscrupulous calumnies he alienated Commodus from his early counsellors and became absolute master of the empire ; but the reign of this favourite was not of long duration,\u2014 he soon fell a CRisn.s,. victim to his imperial master's suspicions. When Commodus was at the theatre witnessing the cele bration of the Capitoline games,* suddenly a person habited like a cynic philosopher came forward, and with a loud voice said to him, that whilst he was wasting his time in folly, his throne and his life were in danger from the treasons of Perennius and his family. The man was arrested and burnt to death, but nevertheless his words awoke suspicions in the mind of Commodus which could not be allayed. The truth of the accusation was afterwards confirmed either by the army in Britain, who, because he had caused them to be punished for their mutinous spirit, or on some other grounds of offence, accused him of designing to confer the empire on his son, or by some \u2022 a. d. 185."], [94, "HISTORY OF ROME. 86 soldiers who came from Illyricum and showed the Emperor some medals engraved with the head of the son of Perennius. Whatever immediately led to his ruin, he was put to death, together with his wife and two children. The crafty Emperor wrote a friendly letter to the eldest son, who was commanding the forces in Illyricum, summoning him to Rome. No sooner had he landed in Italy than the soldiers who accompanied him received the imperial order to put him to death.* The favourite who succeeded Perennius as prefect of the Pr\u00e6torians was Cleander, a Phrygian by birth, whom the Emperor had gradually raised from the condition of a slave to the confidential office of chamberlain. He was so corrupt and unscrupulous, that under his administration all the great offices of state and all the imperial favours were made matters of traffic, and in one year he is said to have created twenty-five consuls. The only man found courageous enough in these degenerate days to denounce this villain's flagrant iniquities was Antistius Burrhus, who had married the sister of Commodus ; but the influence of the favourite was too strong, he brought against Burrhus a counter-accusation of endeavouring to usurp the throne, and caused him to be put to death. The cruelty and corruption of the unworthy favourite at length aroused the just indignation of the people. Pestilence, and its coadjutor, famine,f had decimated Rome and Italy. Taking advantage of the scarcity, he bought up large quantities of corn in order to * A.D. 186. t A.D. 188."], [95, "HISTORY OF ROME. 87 gratify his avarice by selling it at an exorbitant price, or his ambition, by a profuse distribution of it to the army and the people.* The starving citizens attributed the increased deaths to his dishonest selfishness. .One day, whilst this intense feeling against him prevailed, the Circensian games were being exhibited. In the circus there entered a procession of children, at the head of which walked a female, taller than the rest, with a fierce and angry countenance, like some minister of Divine wrath. The little band uttered loud outcries against Oleander, to which the audience responded ; all at once they arose from their seats and rushed to the palace in the Quintilium without the walls, demanding that Commodus should give up the favourite to their vengeance. The wretched man, who was with the Emperor at the time, seeing that all was lost, called out the Pr\u00e6torian cavalry, who charged the people and drove them with terrible slaughter back to the city, where the fugitives barricaded them selves in the houses and attacked the troops with stones and tiles. The foot-guards of the city, jealous of the Pr\u00e6torians, joined the incensed people. It was now the Pr\u00e6torians' turn to fly, and the people did not cease from the pursuit until they reached the palace where Commodus, designedly kept in ignorance of what was going on, was engaged in voluptuous enjoyment. How ominous was this first victory of the troops of the city over the royal guards of the unsound state of the imperial authority! Marcia, the favourite mistress of the Emperor, whom * a. D. 189."], [96, "88 HISTORY OF ROME. he treated with the respect due to a wife and an empress, rushed into his presence with his sister Fadilla, and entreated him to surrender Cleander to the popular fury. The cowardly Emperor, therefore, alarmed, ordered his head to be cut off and sent to the people. Indignities of every kind were offered to his remains, his wife and children were killed together with his chief partisans, their bodies were dragged through the streets of Rome, and then cast into the common sewers. The bloodthirstiness of this monster now became a complete insanity ; * the illustrious of both sexes were put to death, not merely by false accusation, or judicial process, or the public executioner, but by secret poisonings, and by the hand of hired assassins. It is, however, remarkable that the thirteen years of the reign of Commodus were years of uninterrupted peace and tranquillity to the Christians ; so far from being persecuted, they received marks of imperial kindness. Many of those whom the philosophic and humane M. Aurelius had ignorantly oppressed, and who were still working in the mines of Sardinia, were permitted to return to Rome through the influence of Marcia, at the intercession of Victor the Bishop. Marcia was favourable to the Christians, and did not hesitate to exert the power which she had with Com modus in their behalf. It is not known whether she was herself a believer in the Gospel. Amongst the misfortunes which befell the ill-fated empire during this reign, may be reckoned the con flagration which consumed the temple of Peaces It * a.d. 190.

Built by Vespasian after the taking of Jerusalem, it was the depository of the most valuable spoils of the Temple, and it was itself the most beautiful and most richly decorated building in Rome. In it merchants kept their stores and private persons their valuables. It was the place of meeting for the literary and scientific world at SPOILS OF THE TEMPLE AT JLHIM1L1I Rome, and the library in which their manuscripts were preserved. The fire spread to other parts of the town, and among other beautiful edifices destroyed the temple of Vesta. The Vestal virgins fled to the palace, bearing with them the Palladium, which was said to have been brought from Troy ; the flames pursued them even there, and part of the royal resi dence was reduced to ashes. All efforts to extinguish the flames were useless ; at length they began spon taneously to subside, and a violent rain which con tinued for many days put a final stop to them. Pleasure and cruelty at length began alike to"], [98, "90 HISTORY OF ROME. pall upon the sated appetite of this monster in human form. His madness reached its climax. He deter mined on New Year's-day * to put to death without trial the consuls elect, to assume that office himself, and then to disgrace the imperial and consular dig nity, by appearing publicly in the Capitol attired as a gladiator. This design he confided to Marcia. She threw herself at his feet, and besought him not to risk his life by trusting it to the hands of men without honour or principle. L\u00e6tus the prefect of the Pr\u00e6torians, and Eclectus his chamberlain, added their earnest entreaties, but in vain. He retired to his chamber about noon, and wrote out a list of illus trious persons whom he intended to put to death. At the head of it were Marcia, L\u00e6tus and Eclectus. A child who was brought up in the palace found the list, and Marcia met him with the paper in his hand. Thinking it might be some important document, she took it from him, and, horror-struck at its contents, showed it to L\u00e6tus and Eclectus. There was no time to be lost, and the death of the tyrant alone could save their own lives. They determined there fore to give him poison, which was administered by Marcia, but as for some reason it did not take effect, but only threw him into a state of stupor, they sent for the favourite athlete Narcissus, who seized him in his powerful grasp and strangled him. Commodus was assassinated at a palace on the C\u0153lian hill in the thirty-second year of his age, and the thirteenth of his reign. A report was spread that he had died of apoplexy or paralysis, an event * A. D. 192."], [99, "91 HISTORY OF ROME. by no means improbable, considering his inordinate devotion to the pleasures of the table. The intelli gence was received with unmixed joy ; the Senate met and declared him an enemy to Rome, ordered his statues to be thrown down, the inscriptions which contained\" his name to be effaced, and his body to be cast into the Tiber. It was too late to execute this last order, for his remains had already been buried by order of Pertinax. P. HELVIUS PERTINAX. BORN A.D. 126; DIED A.D. 193. From the chamber of the murdered Emperor the prefect and the chamberlain proceeded straight to Pertinax, who was prefect of the city, and the only one now surviving of the ministers of M. Aurelius. As he was not aware of what had happened, he imagined from their arrival in the dead of the night attended by a guard of soldiers, that they were come to kill him by order of Commodus. Without rising from his couch, therefore, he bid them execute their"], [100, "92 HISTORY OF ROME. commission, for there was no night in which he felt sure that his life was safe until morning. L\u00e6tus informed him of the death of the Emperor, and that their object was to offer him the empire. He there fore consented, not without reluctance, to accompany L\u00e6tus to the camp of the Pr\u00e6torians. The guards were astonished to see their prefect at that untimely hour, but he presented Pertinax to them as one who from his reputation as a general, and his unblemished character, would be worthy of their choice, and be highly acceptable to the army. Perti nax then addressed them and promised them a liberal largess of 3,000 drachmae (120?.) each, a promise which he was able to perform by melting down the silver images of Commodus, and by selling his pro perty. But when he spoke of reforming abuses, they began to think their own privileges were in danger, and but a few voices hailed him as Augustus.* By this time, however, the news had spread through the city, and a large concourse of people had assembled at the camp to support him ; and the soldiers, awed by their presence, concealed for a time their displea sure, took the oath of fidelity, and conducted him to the Senate-house to receive the confirmation of the Senate. The same modesty which led Pertinax to accept the purple with reluctance, prompted him also to decline the title of Augusta for his wife, and that of C\u00e6sar for his son;\u2014\" Let him,\" said he, \"receive that title when he has earned it by his merits.\" From the very moment of his accession, the new Emperor devoted his energies to the duties of his * A. D. 193, January."], [101, "HISTORY OF ROME. 93 high position, and to the reformation of those abuses which had been caused by the misgovernment of his predecessor. Taking M. Aurelius for his model, he severely punished the delators, and did his utmost to put an end to their infamous trade. He recalled and reinstated in their possessions those who had been banished for high treason, a crime which was so powerful an engine of tyranny, when a mere expres sion was considered a violation of the law. He con trolled the public expenditure with rigid economy, and thus was in a position to repeal the ruinous taxes which the extravagance of Commodus had imposed. He wisely set commerce free from all unnecessary restrictions, and granted the waste lands of Italy and the provinces rent free for ten years, to any one who would undertake to cultivate them. His short reign was devoted to the estabbshment of civil order and military discipline. The general satisfaction which was felt at home on the accession of Pertinax was shared by the pro vincials, nor was there any exception, but on the part of the Pr\u00e6torians and the freedmen of the court. The former missed the disorderly license to which Commodus had accustomed them, and dreaded the restoration of the old Roman discipline ; the latter regretted that thoughtless extravagance which had exhausted the imperial treasury. L\u00e6tus himself, although he had been instrumental to the elevation of Pertinax, encouraged the hostile feelings of the Pr\u00e6torians, because he was disappointed in gratify ing his own selfish ambition. One of the consuls for this year was Q. Sosius"], [102, "94 HISTORY OF ROME. Falco, apparently an upright and independent man, for although he had joined the other magistrates in congratulating Pertinax on his accession, he did not hesitate to reproach him for eulogizing L\u00e6tus, who had been the creature of so vicious a prince. He was, moreover, a man of illustrious birth and great wealth. The Pr\u00e6torians therefore, discontented with Pertinax, took advantage of his temporary ab sence from Rome, and were just upon the point of pro claiming Falco Augustus, when the prompt return of the Emperor disconcerted their plans. It is not known whether Falco was privy to their design, but the Senate were inclined to punish him for his treason, and nothing but the intercession of Pertinax procured his pardon. The mutiny amongst the Pr\u00e6torians spread, and, aided by the courtiers, two or three hundred of them effected their entry into the palace without meeting with any opposition. Pertinax was recommended to conceal himself until succour should arrive, but he bravely faced the mutineers, and with undaunted countenance demanded what they wanted, and whether they, whose duty it was to guard their prince, were prepared to betray and assassinate him. For some time the soldiers listened to him in silence with down cast eyes. They were just sheathing their swords when one of them, named Tausius, rushed upon him, struck him with his sword and exclaimed, \" This is what the soldiers send you !\" The rest then overpowered him, for he made no resistance, but simply covered his face, and prayed to heaven to avenge his murder* * A. D. 193, March."], [103, "95 HISTORY OF ROME. All his attendants fled ; Eclectus alone was faith ful; he defended him to the last, and was himself slain after having killed two of the assassins. The Pr\u00e6torians cut off his head and bore it in triumph to their camp on the point of a lance. The city was filled with grief, tears and lamentations prevailed on all sides ; it was indeed a fearful prospect that the soldiery held the future destinies of the empire, and would be reigned over by none but tyrants. Pertinax died aged sixty-six, after a promising reign of less than three months. Pertinax had arrived at the high position for which his virtues and prudence so eminently qualified him, solely by his own merits, without the adventitious aids of birth or fortune, or by the tortuous paths of intrigue. He was the son of a dealer in wood, Helvius Successus, who had either been a slave, or was at any rate the son of one. Having received a good education, he began life by teaching grammar at Rome, but not succeeding as a schoolmaster, he embraced the profession of arms, in which he soon distinguished himself. He served in Syria during the reigns of Ti. Antoninus and M. Aurelius. He was with L. Verus in Parthia, who also employed him in Britain, M\u0153sia, Germania, and Dacia. Once he was cashiered on a false accusation, but Pompeianus, the son-in-law of M. Aurelius, having a high opinion of his merits, took him with him in the war against the Marcornanni, and the Emperor, con vinced of his innocence, conferred on him senatorial rank, the pr\u00e6torship, and the command of a legion in Rh\u0153tia and Noricum {the Tyrol, Suabia and Bavaria)."], [104, "96 HISTORY OF ROME. He then, after having invested him with the consul ship, sent him to Syria to quell the revolt of Cassius. After this he served, with distinguished reputation, on the Danube and in Illyricum, administered the governments of M\u0153sia, Dacia, and Syria in suc cession, was then charged by Commodus with the suppression of the mutiny of the legions in Britain, and lastly discharged the duties of prefect of Rome. He united in himself the qualifications, both bodily and mental, for civil office and military command. His constitution was healthy and robust, his figure commanding, his venerable beard gave a majestic expression to his calm and serious features. His manners were courteous, \u2014 so much so that some even doubted his sincerity, \u2014 he had a ready native eloquence, and was simple and unostentatious in his manner of living. He was a great lover of order and a strict disciplinarian, so economical in the manage ment both of private and public resources as to incur in an extravagant age the charge of avarice and parsimony; he was just, upright, and prudent, and in his application to business indefatigable.

That body whom Augustus had intended to be the servant of the emperor and the instrument of maintaining an unconstitutional domi nion, had become in its turn the emperor's master. The guard of the imperial person was now like a gaoler, the controller of the sovereign's freedom. This privileged and well-paid force, congregated together in a fortified camp, commanding by its posi tion the comparatively unarmed and defenceless city, soon learned their own strength and their power to overawe the unpatriotic and spiritless citizens of Rome. They soon perceived that to their arms the emperor himself owed his power to make the Senate and the magistrate subservient to his will, and com pelled him to purchase their attachment by relaxa tion of discipline, by permission of disorder, and by largesses, which were now looked upon as a right instead of a favour. As the office of emperor was purely military, and his civil powers an accident of it, claimed and maintained by his own might and in virtue of his military position, they, with some show of justice, asserted the right of assenting to the appointment of their own leader and commander, from whom they received pay and to whom they swore allegiance. Nor was there any one found to dispute that claim. Corrupt and unscrupulous persons have always as sumed that the right to confer patronage implies also the right to dispose of it for money. It has been assumed on a smaller scale in all countries and all ages ; and it is not surprising that the base Pr\u00e6torians degraded the imperial purple by selling it to the F"], [106, "98 HISTORY OF ROME. highest bidder. There were two candidates for the empire, \u2014 M. Didius Severus Julianus, a wealthy and vain man, and Sulpicianus, the father-in-law of Per tinax. The latter had already sent to the camp and offered a largess of twenty thousand sesterces {one hundred and sixty pounds) to each man ; but the former not only promised to restore the lax system of Commodus, and warned the Pr\u00e6torians that his rival would probably avenge his son-in-law's death, but at once offered twenty-five thousand sesterces {two hundred pounds). His offer was immediately ac cepted, and he was proclaimed Augustus. The cringing Senate without hesitation confirmed the election of the Pr\u00e6torians. The new Emperor was descended from a noble Milanese family : he was born January 30th, A.D. 133, and under the patronage of M. Aurelius was raised"], [107, "99 HISTORY OF ROME. to senatorial rank and filled the office of consul. He is accused of having amassed his wealth by grasping avarice, and of having applied the public resources of the state towards the purchase of the empire. He is said to have discharged his public functions with integrity during the reign of Aurelius, but not so under Commodus. He was honest, not from fixed principles, but according to the tone and fashion of the times. After having received the confirmation of the Senate, the guards conducted him to the palace. One account relates that he found the corpse of Per tinax and the frugal supper prepared for him ; that he allowed the body to lie neglected, ordered a luxurious banquet to be served, and spent the night in gam bling and in watching the performance of a ballet dance. Others maintain that he buried Pertinax with honour, and passed a sleepless night in trouble and anxiety. Although the morrow witnessed the saluta tions of the obsequious Senate, the gloom of discontent and shame pervaded all faces. In vain was the promised largess, the people cursed the Pr\u00e6torians and pelted Julian with stones as a usurper and a parricide. The soldiers attacked the crowds and killed and wounded many, whilst the citizens passed a night and a day in the circus under arms. The wretched Emperor tried to gain favour by a mild and gentle rule, by courting the nobles, and by relaxing the discipline of the Pr\u00e6torians, but his treasures were exhausted before he could pay the price which he had promised for the throne, and he tried to drown the cares of government in pleasure and debauchery. The Pr\u00e6torians were disappointed f2"], [108, "100 HISTORY OF ROME. of their bribe and ashamed of the object of their choice, and the distant armies of the empire indig nantly refused to sanction the bargain of the house hold troops. Superstitions presaged the downfall of Julian. Three brilliant stars appearing round the noon-day sun, were thought to point to the three great generals commanding the legions in the eastern, western, and northern portionsof the Roman dominions. Clodius Albinus was in Britain, C. Pescennius Niger (who owed his position to the athlete Narcissus) in Syria, and L. Septimius Severus in Pannonia and Illyricum. Each thought that he had an equal claim to the purple, and each determined to make use of the roused indignation of the army which he commanded to accomplish his own ambitious views. Niger was much beloved throughout the wide extent of country comprehended under the name of Syria, and therefore, having assembled his legions together wTith a nume rous concourse of people at Antioch, he caused himself to be proclaimed Augustus, and to be invested with the purple. The whole of the East rang with joy, and the inhabitants of his vast province hailed him as a second Alexander. This was too great a trial for his vanity, and he wasted the time in festivities and rejoicings which he ought to have employed in hastening to Rome. Had he done so, he would have found the people and a portion of the Senate favour- able to his pretensions. As it was, Julianus was already dead when he reached Terni. Severus proceeded cautiously in the execution of his design. He first contented himself with bewailing the condition of the empire under so mean a prince"], [109, "101 HISTORY OF ROME. as Julian, and with expressing his anxiety to avenge the murder of Pertinax, who was most popular in Illyricum. Having thus felt his way, he summoned his legions and harangued them, and as soon as he was proclaimed, made the necessary arrangements for guarding the Danube, and marched for Rome with all possible diligence. His first care was to neutralize the opposition of Albinus. He therefore wrote him a letter full of assurances of friendship, conferring upon him the rank of C\u00e6sar and adopting him as his son. This satisfied his ambition, and Severus was relieved from a formidable rival. He now met with no obstructions, every place in Europe except Byzan tium acknowledged him, the Gauls took the oath of allegiance, the towns opened their gates with joy. Julian in despair succeeded in scraping together sufficient money to pay the arrears due to the Pr\u00e6to rians. They advised him to meet Severus in the passes of the Alps, but he had not resolution to leave Rome, and the way in which he fortified and barri caded his palace in order to secure his personal safety excited universal ridicule. Besides this, like a mean coward, he put Marcia and L\u00e6tus to death, because, owing to the influence of the latter with Commodus, Severus had obtained the command in Pannonia. He also sent hired assassins to take the life of Severus himself, who meanwhile had entered Italy, and had taken Ravenna and the fleet stationed there, and had advanced to Interamna, seventy miles from Rome. When there, he sent word to the Pr\u00e6torians that if they would surrender Julian and the assassins of Pertinax, he would hold them harmless. These"], [110, "102 HISTORY OF ROME. pampered and treacherous troops, dreading the perils of real warfare, at once accepted his offer. Not one of the Emperor's purchased partisans struck a blow in his defence. Julian, as a last resource, persuaded the Senate to make Severus his colleague. When, however, they found that his guards had deserted him, they deposed him, condemned him to death, declared Severus emperor, and deified Pertinax. In a private chamber of the royal baths Julian was beheaded like a criminal by the sword of a private soldier, uttering vain protestations against the injus tice of his sentence. Thus died this wretched man in the sixty-first year of his age, having spent all that he had to purchase the privilege of reigning in misery for sixty-six days."], [111, "HISTORY OF ROME. 103 CHAPTER VI.

L. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS. BORN A. D. 146 ; DIED A. D. 211. The approach of Severus to Rome more resembled the march of a hostile invader than a sovereign entering the capital of his dominions. The Senate were alarmed, and sent a deputation of one hundred of their body to meet him at Interamna {Terni), in Umbria. He received them with kindness, and bestowed upon them marks of his favour. He sent orders to Rome that the murderers of Pertinax should be put to death, and summoned the Pr\u00e6torians to attend him without their arms ; when they arrived he surrounded them with his troops, and ascending the tribunal, he reproached them for their treason to so good an emperor as Pertinax, and their disgraceful auction of the empire. He told them that although"], [112, "104 HISTORY OF ROME. no punishment was too severe for them, he gave them their lives on condition that they surrendered their horses, and retired forthwith one hundred miles from Rome. Resistance was in vain, for they had no weapons but their side arms, which were short dag gers, and they were completely surrounded by armed men. One gallant steed refused to be separated from his master ; closely he followed the disgraced guards man's footsteps until he was forced to transfix the faithful animal with his dagger, and then, stabbing himself, both expired together. After having disbanded the Pr\u00e6torians, Severus entered Rome surrounded by that army which had placed him on the throne, and preceded by the Sena tors bearing crowns of laurel. The people were in holiday attire, the houses were wreathed with festoons of flowers, and there were all the outward demonstra tions of a nation's joy. But the soldiers soon showed that they were the masters of the empire by their insolent and disorderly conduct towards the citizens, and by demanding of the Senate with seditious cries the enormous largess of ten thousand sesterces each. Severus was glad to purchase quiet by giving them the tenth of that sum. After remaining a month at Rome Severus marched against Niger, in order to surprise him in an unpre pared state. His rival meanwhile was diverting him self at Antioch, but the news soon reached him that Severus was approaching with a powerful force both by land and sea. He immediately took decisive measures, ordered the governors of the neighbouring provinces to guard the passes of Mount Taurus, levied"], [113, "HISTORY OF ROME. 105 fresh troops in Antioch, and demanded contingents from the neighbouring princes. He then made the rich and well-fortified city of Byzantium his head quarters, and the first engagement between the forces of Niger and Severus took place near Perinthus {Heraeleia), in which the former gained the advan tage.* This was the first overt act of hostility, and the Senate forthwith declared Niger and his lieute nant-general \u00c6milianus, who was proconsul of Asia, public enemies. The first great engagement in which the army of Severus was victorious was fought at Cyzicum, near the Hellespont. The carnage was very great, and \u00c6mi- lianus was taken prisoner and put to death. A second was fought at Nic\u00e6a in Bithynia, in which Niger commanded in person and was opposed by Candidus. The field was contested with extreme obstinacy, but Niger was obliged to retreat beyond the Taurus. Severus followed him to the foot of the ridge, but the passes were too strongly fortified to continue the pursuit. It was, however, now winter ; a tremendous storm washed away a portion of the lines of Niger, and the victorious army of Severus forced their way into the plains of Cilicia. Niger now rallied his defeated troops for a final effort. They were raw and inex- perienced, but full of zeal and devotion to his cause. The armies met near Issus, in a confined plain, bor- dered on the one side by the mountains of Cilicia, on the other by the sea.f It was the old battle-field of Darius and Alexander. This battle was the most bloody of the three, for Niger lost twenty thousand * a.d. 194. t a.d. 195. f3"], [114, "106 HISTORY OF ROME. men. It is said that he had almost gained the victory, but a fearful storm, in which the rain beat and the lightning flashed in the faces of his soldiers, turned the scale in favour of the enemy. Severus assumed the title of Imperator, in consequence of this decisive victory, and Niger fled to Antioch. He was soon deprived of this refuge by its surrender, and, again taking to flight, he was overtaken by his pursuers, and his head was cut off and sent to Rome. He was an able general and a strict disciplinarian, but the gentleness of his temper made him a universal favourite. The conqueror treated the partisans of his rival with savage ferocity. Vast numbers were put to death. The property of others was confiscated. The wife, children, and relatives of Niger fell victims to his vengeance, and it is said that no fewer than six persons who bore the name of Pescennius fell by the hands of the executioner ; many persons entirely innocent were involved in this inhuman persecution. Revolts in Osrhoene and Adiabene showed how as sailable was the power of Rome over the extremities of her unwieldy empire ; the energy, however, of Severus and his generals was able to crush the re bellion in the outset, and assert the supremacy of the mistress of the world. During the three years in which the events above narrated were passing, By zantium was in a state of siege. It had been the head-quarters of Niger and the city of refuge for his defeated generals. The garrison and inhabitants ex hibited many instances of self-sacrifice in the defence of the place. They broke up their valuable statues"], [115, "107 HISTORY OF ROME. to furnish missiles, and the women gave their long hair to make cords for the military engines. Nor did they surrender until they had been reduced to the extremity of famine. Severus displayed on this occasion the stern cruelty which was the only blot upon his character. The civil magistrates and the whole of the garrison were put to the sword, except the celebrated engineer Pris cus, whom Severus prudently reserved for his own service. The fortifications, which had been deemed impregnable, were dismantled ; the town, with its beautiful theatres, baths, and public buildings, was razed to the ground. The inhabitants were deprived of their municipal privileges, and subjected to a humiliating dependence upon the neighbouring petty town of Perinthus, just as Antioch had been subjected to the jurisdiction of her jealous rival Laodicea. The insults heaped upon Byzantium by the folly of Seve rus were well avenged when that key of the Bos phorus no longer existed to stop the course of the Gothic fleets from the Euxine to the Mediterranean.* Although the warlike spirit and military successes of Severus contributed to the prosperity and security of the empire, still the higher classes, who are usually the first victims to the cruelty of a tyrant, beheld with dread the numerous examples of his severity. Albinus became more popular, and some leading senators even wrote to him in secret to come to Rome during the absence of the Emperor. Severus, there fore, seeing his own danger, determined upon his ruin, and in his case added treachery to cruelty. He * a.d. 196."], [116, "108 HISTORY OF ROME. sent a letter to him, full of expressions of regard, and ordered the bearers to request a private interview and assassinate him, either with the dagger or by poison. By some means, however, the suspicions of Albinus were aroused ; he arrested the messengers, put them to the torture, and thus wrung from them a confession of the truth. Albinus saw that there was but one course for him to pursue. He raised a large army in Britain, and crossed over into Gaul, which, as well as Spain, showed an inclination to support him, levied contri butions of money and provisions upon those provincial governors who were not willing to aid him, and marched as far as Lyons. The news of the rebellion of Albinus speedily reached Severus, and, by a rapid march, to which neither the severity of winter nor the Alpine snows proved obstacles, he appeared be fore the eyes of his astonished opponent.* On the 19th of February, a sanguinary battle was fought at Trivurtium {Trevoux), about ten or twelve miles from Lyons, on a plain which lies between the Rhone and the Saone. One hundred and fifty thousand Romans were engaged, and the two Augusti commanded in person. For a long time the fight was contested with equal courage and success ; at length the left wing of Albinus gave way and fled to the camp. So hot was the pursuit, that victors and vanquished entered it in one body. On the other hand, his right wing gained some advantage, and Severus, coming to the rescue with his Pr\u00e6torians, was himself forced to fly, and his horse having been killed under him, his life was * A.D 197."], [117, "HISTORY OF ROME. 109 in imminent danger. Sword in hand, however, he rallied his men, aud, supported by the cavalry under the command of L\u00e6tus, he turned the fortune of the day and gained a complete victory. It was a bloody victory for Rome, for both the conquerors and con quered were her children. Albinus fled to Lyons, and took refuge in a house on the banks of the Rhone, and seeing no means of escape, committed suicide. The usual wholesale mas sacre annihilated the family, relatives, friends, and partisans of Albinus ; neither age nor sex were spared by the ruthless Severus, and many illustrious natives of Gaul and Spain suffered as well as Romans. The imperial treasury was enriched, and the means pro vided for gratifying the hungry soldiers, by the confiscation of the property of the condemned. Whilst the Emperor thus indulged his cruelty, (for there is no word which so well expresses the tiger-like appe tite for blood which seems to have been almost natural to the Roman temper when invested with despotic power,) and praised publicly in the Senate the savage proscriptions of Sulla and Marius, he defended his butcheries on the ground of prudent precautions, and represented himself as a model of clemency and mercy. It must be granted that, in his civil administration, his military severity was tempered by wisdom ; that he was firm and fearless in the reform of all abuses, and just and impartial in his judicial decisions. No one, however high his rank might be, dared offend either the supremacy of law, or the imperial pre rogative. His inflexible rigour at home, and his"], [118, "110 HISTORY OF ROME. reputation as a warrior abroad, calmed civil strife, and established peace and tranquillity on the most distant frontiers of the empire. As soon as the re moval of his formidable competitors permitted, he applied himself resolutely to his work as a sovereign. He apportioned Italy into districts or circuits for the administration of justice, and placed each under the jurisdiction of an officer of rank, with the title of corrector. He divided Britain, which had now be come too extensive for a single government, into two provinces \u2014 made an expedition against the Parthians, accompanied by his two sons, Caracalla and Geta, and crushed the pretensions of his enemies, without meeting with the slightest resistance. In this campaign he took and plundered the royal capital of Ctesiphon (Al-modain)* which the Parthians had built as a rival to Seleucia. The necessity for constant war, in order to maintain the discipline of the army, appa rently alone prevented him from at once reducing the country to a Roman province. He considered it sufficient, therefore, that the supremacy of Rome should be acknowledged in Arabia and Mesopotamia, whilst the native princes retained possession of their thrones. As a compliment to these brilliant successes, the adulation of the Senate conferred upon the Emperor the title of Parthicus Maximus ; and the soldiers, in the enthusiasm of victory, associated Caracalla with him as Augustus, and gave Geta the title of C\u00e6sar. The former was then twenty-two years of age, the latter a year younger. Geta was the first to whom * A. D. 19S."], [119, "111 HISTORY OF ROME. the title of Nobilissi'mus was given, a title which sub sequently, in the Byzantine writers, is so common a synonym for C\u00e6sar. Both the young princes also assumed the honoured name of Antonine; and ten years afterwards, Geta was also raised to the rank of Augustus. The only drawback to the Oriental triumphs of Severus was a rising of the Caledonians and Meat\u00e6 in Britain, who made such a fearful on slaught on Virius Lupus, the governor, that he was compelled to purchase peace and a return of prisoners. In the course of his Eastern campaign, Severus visited Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, and thoroughly exam ined all the wonders of that marvellous country.* On his return to Rome he sought to gain the hearts of his subjects by that which his shrewd discernment saw was the surest road to their affections. f During seven days he exhibited a continual succession of splen did spectacles. He distributed amongst the Pr\u00e6torians and those of the people who had been accustomed to receive donations of corn, the enormous sum of twenty five millions of sesterces {two million sterling) ; he repaired the public buildings which embellished Rome, and also erected new ones, such as the Therm\u00e6, which bore his name, and the Septizonium or Septizodium, which he built over his family sepulchre on the Appian Way. The decay of the arts had made rapid strides since the days of Trajan. Hadrian's buildings were rather splendid and magnificent than tasteful: the sculptures on the arch of M. Aurelius show decline, and the arch of Severus and the Septizonium are inferior still. t a.d. 203. * a.d. 202."], [120, "112 HISTORY OF ROME. After all that can be said in favour of Severus, he was a military despot, and considered the citizen as altogether secondary to the soldier. His favourite maxim was, that you must enrich the latter, and then nn. u OF 8. SEVERUS. you need take little care about the rest. On this principle he acted universally. He reorganized the Pr\u00e6torians and quadrupled their number, making it fifty thousand. He constituted their prefect a poli tical as well as a military officer \u2014 the personal repre sentative, and, as it were, the chancellor of the Emperor. His prime minister, Plautianus, the father in-law of Caracalla, was first invested with this dignity ; and, after his death, his successor was the"], [121, "HISTORY OF ROME. 113 celebrated jurist Papinian. Instead of enlisting his guards in Italy, he reinforced their ranks with the distinguished, but half-barbarian legionaries of the frontier : thus the rising generation nearer Rome lost their military training, and the capital was filled with a rude but brave soldiery, ready, with unscrupulous fidelity, to execute every command of their master. Nor did he only pamper thus these spoiled children of despotism. He increased the pay of the army at large, distributed largesses on every extraordinary occasion, allowed them the decoration of the gold ring, formerly the insignia of knightly rank, and to have their wives with them in quarters, a privilege which they had not previously enjoyed. In vain he endeavoured to counteract the demo ralization which was the result of this policy, by strictness in enforcing discipline : the troops became insubordinate themselves and tyrannical to others. Disaffection had by this time made such rapid strides in Britain,* and the ravages committed in the northern part of the island had become so alarming, that the governors urged upon the Emperor the neces sity of his personal presence in the province. Severus gladly embraced this opportunity of withdrawing his indolent sons from the effeminate pleasures of Rome, of accustoming them to the self-denial and fatigues of a soldier's life, and of awakening in them, if possible, an honourable and princely ambition. Accordingly, notwithstanding his advanced age and his gouty constitution, he set out for Britain,t taking with him the two princes and his empress, Julia Domna, * a.d. 207. t a.d. 208."], [122, "114 HISTORY OF ROME. a lady of sound judgment, amiable disposition, and resolute firmness, although, like so many of the em presses, of lax morals. She was a Syrian by birth, a favourer of Christianity, which she could not understand, but mistook its ceremonies for magical rites. Severus, who had great faith in divination, married her by the advice of astrologers, who pre dicted that the connexion would be a fortunate one. Severus, on his landing, made vigorous preparations for a campaign, and especially constructed pontoons for traversing the fen country. The British, alarmed, sent to sue for peace, but he refused to accept their submission. Leaving, therefore, Geta and the older ALTAR TO SEVERUS AND CARACALLA, ERECTED BY FOURTH GALLIC COHORT members of his council to regulate affairs in the tran quil parts of the island, he, with Caracalla, his eldest son, marched northward through the territory of the Meat\u00e6, into that of the Caledonians.

The principal obstacles which he met with were the natural diffi culties of mountain, forest, fen, and river ; nor did he complete the subjugation of the northern part of the island until the following year, and this too at the cost of fifty thousand men.* The energetic Emperor, who was compelled, by infirmity of health, to perform the whole of this campaign borne in a litter, assumed the title of Britannicus Maximus, and conferred that of Britannicus on both his sons.f When his con quest was complete, he protected the northern frontier of the country ceded to the Romans by a fosse and earthwork, with a revetment or palisade of timber. WALLS OT HADRIAN AND 9EYERUS IN BRITAIN. The career of the conqueror was now drawing to a close, and nothing remained to him but sorrow and suffering. After he had finished his rampart, he re turned to Eboracum (York), from which city he never removed. Gout caused him excruciating anguish, and his bodily sufferings were embittered by the unnatural conduct of his eldest son. The implacable discord, which had prevailed between the brothers * A.D. 208. T A.D. 210."], [124, "116 HISTORY OF ROME. from their earliest years, had now reached such a height, that Caracalla could not bear the idea of having Geta for a colleague, and meditated his assassination. This monster, in the presence of the army, drew his sword upon his aged father. The bystanders uttered a loud cry, and Severus instantly turned round. He uttered no reproaches at the time, but when he had returned home, he thus addressed his son: \u2014 \"If you will be a parricide, accomplish your design now, and not in the face of the assembled army ; and if the murder of a father horrifies you, give your commands to Papinian. You are his emperor, and he dare not disobey you.\" The absence of the dying Emperor emboldened the Caledonians to break the treaty of peace which Severus had just ratified. In his rage he issued orders to massacre them all, sparing neither sex nor age. He would also have put his undutiful son to death, had he not been dissuaded by his generals. Death, however, arrested him in his plans of ven geance. His agonies were so intense that he frequently called for poison. On the fourth of February* he expired, in the sixty-sixth year of his age and the eighteenth year of his reign. His ashes were placed in an alabaster urn and deposited in the tomb of Hadrian. In the tenth year of his reign, Severus commenced the fifth persecution of the Church by proscribing alike the faith of the Jew and the Christian. During the earlier half of his reign the Christians had enjoyed uninterrupted tranquillity, partly because the * A.D. 211."], [125, "HISTORY OF ROME. 117 civil wars completely occupied the attention of. Seve rus, and partly because their gentle blameless lives, and non-interference in political factions, rendered him favourably disposed towards them. \" They had,\" says Tertullian, \"become so numerous that they were to be found in every rank and condition of civil and military'life. There were Christians at court, in the Senate, everywhere in short except in the temples and the theatres. Had they left Rome, it would have been a perfect solitude.\" The old laws which forbade the profession of any faith except the national one, were sufficient to authorize a perse cution, if the magistrates thought proper to enforce them, without any special edict issued by the Em peror. On the return of Severus to Rome* after the defeat of Albinus, the Christians incurred public odium by not sympathising with and joining in the general rejoicings and festivities. Probably some of them were of an idolatrous nature, and involved excess and debauchery. The people were excited, the cry was, \" The Christians to the lions ! \" and the Senate seconded the clamours of the people. What induced Severus to interfere is unknown, but when he was in Palestine in the tenth year of his reign, he forbade, under severe pains and penalties, both Judaism and Christianity. There were also martyrdoms in Italy, Egypt, Gaul, Cappadocia, and Carthage. * A. D. 197."], [126, "118 HISTORY OF ROME. ANTONINUS CARACALLA. BORN A. D. 188 ; DIED A. D. 217. ANTONINUS GETA.

Their mutual discord rendered it impos sible for them to act in harmony, and their equality still more embittered their natural jealousy and ani mosity. The elder brother is said to have shown in GETA. his childhood indications of an amiable and even tender-hearted disposition, but he grew up passionate, fickle, haughty, and self-willed. He was not defi cient in liveliness of talent and felicity of expression, but he was illiterate and despised learning, and was utterly wanting in judgment and solidity. As to his bodily powers historians differ ; some say that he was robust, others feeble. But all agree that he was small in stature, of delicate health, and a great eater and drinker. Geta was rude and boisterous in child-"], [127, "HISTORY OF ROME. 119 hood, covetous, stingy and greedy; but although, morally speaking, he was but little better than his brother, education corrected some of his childish faults, aud his cheerfulness and affability made him the favourite both with the soldiers and the public generally. Abandoning the conquests which Severus had made and the territories ceded to him by the Britons, the two Emperors concluded a treaty with the Caledonians and hastened to Rome.* Daily their mutual hatred became more implacable, and they even entertained ideas of dividing the empire between them, Geta taking Asia and Egypt, and holding his court at Alexandria and Antioch ; but their mother averted this dismemberment by her tears and entreaties. Caracalla, after several fruitless attempts upon his brother's life, at length succeeded in his fratricidal design. He proposed to his mother that they should meet in her private apartment, and that she should exert her influence to effect a reconciliation. The unsuspecting Geta fell into the snare, and some centurions, whom Caracalla had placed in conceal ment, rushed into the room and attacked him. The murdered prince threw himself into his mother's arms ; she was covered with his blood, and was herself wounded in the hand in her vain efforts to save him.f As soon as he was dead, Caracalla rushed from the chamber, crying out that he had with difficulty escaped assassination, and hastening to the camp, informed the soldiers that he was sole emperor, without entering into further details. Their * A. D. 211. t A. D. 212."], [128, "120 HISTORY OF ROME. support was secured by doubling their pay and by a largess of fifty pounds each. Thus he squandered in a single day the treasures which Severus had been amassing during eighteen years by oppression and bloodshed. The fratricidal act was fearfully avenged. The murderer became a prey to the terrors of a guilty conscience ; often he dreamed that the wrathful manes of his father and brother pursued him with drawn swords, threatening him with instant death. Supersti tious as well as sanguinary, he first tried to appease their shades by magical arts, and next to blot out from his memory the recollection of his sin by re moving all those who reminded him of it. Twenty thousand persons of both sexes, who had been con nected with Geta as friends, domestics, or soldiers, were his first victims. L\u00e6tus was put to death because he recommended the murder; Fabius Cilo, his father's dearest friend, and the jurist Papinian, because their most anxious wishes always were to bring about a reconciliation ; and a daughter of M. Aurelius, because she had shed tears for the murdered emperor. The slightest act was made a pretext for arrest, and the very utterance of the name of Geta was treasonable and criminal. Some of his victims he sent to die in unhealthy climates under the pretence of investing them with honourable and lucrative employments. On one occasion all the spectators in a crowded circus were massacred by his orders, because some of them had laughed at a favourite charioteer. With such bitter and implacable hatred did he"], [129, "121 HISTORY OF ROME. pursue the murdered Geta even after his death, that he caused his name to be erased from every inscription and monument throughout the whole extent of the empire. In a similar manner the jealous tyrant, Henry VIII. of England, resented the resistance of Thomas-a-Becket to the royal prerogative, and ordered that the name and effigy of the archbishop should be blotted out from every psalter and service-book in the realm. The exactions of this odious tyrant were equal to his cruelties. He taxed the towns and provinces to the verge of ruin, and demanded vast sums under the name of crowns, which it was the custom to offer to the Emperor. He raised the legacy and succession duties from five to ten per cent. When on a cam paign or progress, he put the richer senators to ruinous expense in lodging and entertaining him, and by billeting his soldiers in private houses, sub jected the inhabitants of the towns to vexatious persecutions. The administration of justice was totally neglected, and the interests of literature and literary men treated with contempt; for his sole pleasures were sought in sensual debauches, in the spectacles of the circus and amphitheatre, and in gratifying his vulgar taste of driving racing chariots, or in exhibiting himself in combats with wild beasts or with common gladiators. One monument only he left behind him worthy of his position \u2014 the Therm\u00e6 or baths which bear his name. His most celebrated act was the edict by which he conferred the Roman citizenship on all the free inha bitants of the empire: but the privilege was now a G"], [130, "122 HISTORY OF ROME. worthless one, and the recipients owed the empty honour not to the good-will but the avarice of the giver ; for, together with the name, they were obliged to submit to the burdens and taxation of citizens. The pleasures of the capital appear at length to have BATHS OF CARACAL palled, and Rome itself not to have furnished a field wide enough for the exercise of his savage cruelties. During the remainder of his reign he roamed from province to province,* gratifying his insatiable avarice and cruelty. The tyranny of other bad emperors was principally felt at Rome \u2014 the provinces were comparatively free from its effects ; but Caracalla exercised his cruelties in the provinces in person. \u2022 A.D. 213."], [131, "HISTORY OF ROME. 123 Gaul was the first scene of his rapacious tyranny.* Next, he found a pretext for disturbing the peace of Germany, and, after a sanguinary war, assumed the title of Germanicus.f From Europe he proceeded to the East, pursuing the same course of oppression in Parthia, Armenia, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. The fertile little kingdom of Osrhoene tempted his cupidity. He therefore invited the king Abgarus,| who was a staunch friend of Rome, to pay him a friendly visit, and then arrested and sent him a prisoner to Rome, together with his two sons. Thus, without difficulty, he reduced Osrhoene to a province of the empire, and established a colony in the capital Edessa. When he arrived at Alexandria, he ordered a wholesale butchery of its inhabitants, simply be cause some of them had made his crimes, especially his brother's murder, the subject of their satirical remarks. From the temple of Serapis his eyes gloated over this bloody massacre, and his despatch to the Senate said nothing of the numbers or qualities of the murdered, because he said no distinction could be made, all were equally guilty. From Alexandria he returned to Antioch, where this enemy of the human race was guilty of an act of more than Asiatic treachery. He demanded the daughter of Artabanus, king of Parthia, in marriage, fully expecting that he should be refused, and should thus have a pretext for war. With great reluctance the king granted his request, and Caracalla and his *a.d. 214. + a.d. 215\u2014 216. % Abgarus appears to have been a name common to the sovereigns of Edessa, like Pharaoh in Egypt, and Abimelech in Philistia. g2"], [132, "124 HISTORY OF ROME. army were received with Oriental pomp and magni ficent hospitality. On a sudden, the Romans rose upon the unsuspecting Parthians, slaughtered them by thousands, laid waste their country, pillaged their towns, razed their fortresses to the ground, destroyed the royal sepulchres at Arbela, and scattered to the winds, in their insolence, the bones of the Parthian kings. Returning to winter at Edessa, the tyrant wrote pompous despatches to the Senate, narrating how that he had vanquished Parthia, and subjugated the whole East. The Senate were fully aware of the real state of the case, but in their fulsome adulation, they decreed to him the honours of a triumph, and the titles of Parthianus and Armeniacus. It is not impro bable that one of his objects in overthrowing the Parthian empire was his ambition to imitate Alex ander the Great, for whom he entertained the highest admiration. The days of this monster were now numbered. The profuse liberalities which he had showered upon the army failed to attach its affec tions to him. All the soldiers detested him, except the Pr\u00e6torians, and even from that favoured corps the fatal blow came. The prefecture of the Pr\u00e6to rians, which was now a civil as well as a military office, was held in commission by Adventus and Opilius Macrinus. The former undertook the mili tary command, and the latter the civil administration. It happened that an African pretender to the gift of prophecy said publicly that Macrinus and his son Diadumenianus were destined to be emperors. The soothsayer was sent to Rome, and repeated his"], [133, "HISTORY OF ROME. 125 prediction to Flavius Maternianus, the prefect of the city. Caracalla placed great confidence in this magis trate, and had instructed him to gain all the informa tion possible respecting future pretenders to the throne. The letter of Maternianus containing the intelligence was delivered to the Emperor, together with others, whilst he was engaged in a chariot-race. He accordingly put the packet in the hands of Macrinus to read and report upon. Macrinus saw that he was ruined. He therefore formed a con spiracy with some discontented officers of the guards, and employed Martialis, to whom the Emperor had refused a centurion ship, as the instrument of assassi nation. On the 8th of April,* Caracalla went with a small retinue to Carrh\u00e6, to offer sacrifice in the Temple of the Moon. On the way thither, the assassin, watching his opportunity when Caracalla was separated from his escort, stabbed him mortally just above the collar-bone. He then mounted his horse and fled, but was shot down by a Scythian archer. Thus died this monster in human form, in the seventh year of his reign, and at the early age of twenty-nine. He was the last emperor who inscribed upon his medals the title of Imperator. A.D. 217."], [134, "126 HISTORY OF ROME. CHAPTER VII.

M. OPILIUS MACRINUS. born a.d. 163 or 164; died a.d. 218. The intelligence of Caracalla's death was received at Rome with unmixed joy; and although the Senate were compelled, by the resistless will of the army, to decree to him divine honours, they assailed his memory with contemptuous epithets, and ordered his statues of gold and silver to be pulled down and melted. Julia Domna, who had risen from a low estate to the highest dignity in the world, saw herself reduced, by the extinction of the family of Severus, from the condition of empress-mother to private life. This mortified her more than the death of her son. Her life had been a life of sorrow ; she had seen one son murdered in her own arms by his brother, and the fratricide die a bloody death. Macrinus treated her with insolence, and expelled her to Antioch. She herself suffered the mortal disease of cancer, and"], [135, "127 HISTORY OF ROME. oveixome by her miseries, she refused all nourish ment, and died a voluntary death. During three days the friends of Macrinus were engaged in gaining the support of the army in Meso potamia ; for at first the troops were hesitating whom to nominate as emperor, and on the fourth day the Pr\u00e6torians, though reluctantly, declared in his favour : the usual largesses were promised, and he was pro claimed. Thus, as is frequently the case, the predic tion of the African wrought its own fulfilment. He had no competitor, unless his colleague Adventus may be considered so ; but, although he was a good soldier, he was as low born as Macrinus, of advanced age, mean capacity, and utterly illiterate. The new Emperor was an Algerine by birth, and had discharged the duties of the high positions which he had occupied with credit and ability. He had a fair knowledge of law, and a great respect for it. His first acts were acts of justice. He reduced the legacy and succession duties again to five per cent., punished the delators with exile or death, stopped all the irregular pensions which Caracalla had granted, burnt the immense quantities of poisons which he found stored up in the palace, and displaced all magistrates who had exceeded the power entrusted to them. He projected a complete codification of the Roman laws, but his short reign did not give him time to put his design into execution. If he erred at all, it was in the extreme severity with which he punished crime. But sternness was the characteristic of the age, as well as of Roman discipline, and the demoralization of the troops, by the indulgence of"], [136, "128 HISTORY OF ROME. Caracalla, as well as the vices of the times, demanded rigour. Sometimes criminals were immured between four walls. Adulterers were burnt alive with the partners of their guilt. In the conduct of foreign wars Macrinus exhibited neither courage nor ability. Artabanus, king of Parthia, marched against him with a powerful army, vowing to avenge the wrongs done to him by Cara calla. The timid Macrinus sent ambassadors to treat for peace, and to restore the prisoners taken in the former war. The indignant Parthian spurned his proposals with disdain, and left Macrinus no time for deliberation. But his troops were undisciplined and demoralized by luxury. The armies met near Nisibis, a fortified town held by a Roman garrison ; the battle raged from morning until night, and was so bloody that the corpses formed a wall be tween the two armies. Both retired without gaining any advantage. Dio asserts that once Macrinus was defeated, but, fortunately for him, the Par thians found their provisions began to fail in the moment of victory, and both sent to make proposals of peace. Notwithstanding this miserable result, the cringing Senate decreed him the honours of a triumph and the title of Parthicus, but Macrinus was too just to accept them. A war with the Arme nians which followed was soon concluded, and Macrinus sent Tiridates the diadem, and restored him his mother, whom Caracalla had detained in prison eleven months, together with his hereditary estates in Cappadocia. He then returned to Antioch, and committed that"], [137, "HISTORY OF ROME. 129 fatal mistake of retaining his army in luxurious win- ter quarters in Syria, instead of distributing them through distant provinces. Amidst the temptations of indolence the corrupted mass seethed and putrified, and Macrinus attempted to restore it to a wholesome condition. It was not likely that a reformer should retain the affections of a dissolute and licentious soldiery, when he began to apply his reform to them- selves ; although he used extreme caution with the older soldiers, he subjected the recruits to a severer discipline. The army was sulky from defeat, and offended with the new order of things : at length the murmurs of discontent were ready to break out into the clamour of open mutiny. It wanted but a spark to kindle the flame, and this was soon supplied. Julia M\u00e6sa, sister of the Empress Julia, had two widowed daughters, So\u00e6mias and Mam\u00e6a, who had each a son. Avitus Bassianus, the son of the former, was high-priest of Elagabalus, who was worshipped at Emesa as the god of heavenly bodies or meteors.* The commanding stature and graceful figure of Bas- sianus, now a. handsome youth of fourteen years, set off by his magnificent robes of office, attracted the admiration of the soldiers. They saw in him a likeness to Caracalla, whom probably, owing to his relationship, he may have somewhat resembled. M\u00e6sa, a clever and artful woman, taking advantage of this opinion, gave out that he was the natural son of Caracalla. The immense fortune which she had accumulated at court, and which she promised to the * Perhaps from some supposed connexion with Helios {yAios), the sun, the name became corrupted into Heliogabalus. 6 3"], [138, "130 HISTORY OF ROME. army as the price of the empire, aided her in her design. Without much persuasion, therefore, the army proclaimed him Emperor, invested him with the purple, and gave him the honoured name of M. Aurelius Antoninus.* Macrinus heard at Antioch that Bassianus was declared Augustus, and accord ingly sent Ulpius Julianus with a small detachment to the fortified camp of the rebels. He foolishly delayed the assault, thinking that the pretender's troops would capitulate ; this gave them time to strengthen their position, and to tamper successfully with the fidelity of Julian's soldiers, who rose upon their officers and killed them, and joined the rebels. Julian fled, but was afterwards taken and slain. MACRLNUS AND DIADUMENIANUS. Macrinus then marched against the pretender in per son, after declaring his son, Diadumenianus, Augus tus, and distributing to his soldiers a liberal largess. A letter which he wrote at the same time to the Senate betrayed his alarm and timidity, and he displayed the same cowardice as a general ; for before he had reached Emesa he retreated again to Antioch. * May 16, a.d. 218."], [139, "HISTORY OF ROME. 131 It was now the new emperor's turn to attack, and he obliged Macrinus to give him battle.* The Pr\u00e6 torians fought bravely, but the day was lost by the pusillanimity of Macrinus. He fled ignominiously in disguise, and had already traversed Asia and reached Chalcedon, when he was overtaken ; his head was cut off and sent to his successful adversary. His son was killed soon after; the poor child was only fen years old, when he fell by the hand of the execu tioner. Macrinus was fifty-four years of age, and had reigned fourteen months. M. AURELIUS ANTONINUS ELAGABALUS. born a.d. 204; died a.d. 222. The degenerate namesake of M. Aurelius assumed the name of Elagabalus from that of the idol which he served as priest. It was a black stone, round at the base and terminating in a cone. That name, by which this hideous compound of superstition, sen suality, and cruelty, has been handed down to after ages, was more highly valued by him than the noblest appellations which have embellished the page of history. Commencing his reign with the murder of some of the provincial magistrates, he left Syria for Rome ; and when he arrived there, his first care was to establish the supremacy of his favourite deity. The streets were powdered with gold dust, along which a chariot drawn by milk-white steeds bore the black stone. He erected a splendid temple to the idol's honour, and conveyed thither the eternal fire of * June 7."], [140, "HISTORY OF ROME. 132 Vesta, the statue of Cybele, the Ancilia of Mars, and the Palladium .* He brought from Carthage the idol of the moon, and all the treasures of her temple, and celebrated a solemn marriage between her and the M. UFRBUUa ANTONINUS ELAGABALU-**. Syrian deity. Whilst the public rites were cele brated with the utmost magnificence, the private worship was conducted with infamous and licentious ceremonies. No event of historical importance marks the four barren years of this youthful monster's reign. Lapped in Oriental self-indulgence, he was a slave to the grossest licentiousness ; his character was made a.d. 219."], [141, "133 HISTORY OF ROME. up of the follies of youth, the effeminacy of the Asiatic, the cruelty of the despot, the pollution of the heathen temple. He was the first Roman who wore silk robes, and a diadem set with pearls ; he compelled his subjects to prostrate themselves before him in Oriental fashion, and he supplied means for his profuse extravagance by murder and confiscation. He married during his short reign at least as many wives as were the years during which he wore the purple. His grandmother M\u00e6sa saw plainly that such a state of things could not long continue, and ALTAR TO ALEXANDER AND MAM-EA. therefore persuaded him to adopt his cousin, Alex ianus, the son of Mam\u00e6a, a boy of twelve or thirteen years of age ; yielding to her influence, but pretend ing that he was acting under the commands of his god, he proclaimed him C\u00e6sar, and gave him the"], [142, "134 HISTORY OF ROME. name of Alexander* This act, perhaps, deferred for a time his deserved punishment. At first he liked the boy, and tried to corrupt him ; but the natural disposition of Alexander, and the education provided for him by his mother, Mam\u00e6a, preserved him from contamination. His virtues gained the affections of all who knew him ; and the more others loved him, the more Elagabalus hated him. So intense his dislike became, that he made many attempts upon his life, but in vain, for all were faithful to Alexander. At last, he resolved to degrade him from his rank of C\u00e6sar, and despatched a missive to the Senate to that effect. When the letter was read, the Senate maintained an ominous silence ; the soldiers, long disgusted with the effeminacy of Elagabalus, and won by the promising character of the young C\u00e6sar, tumultuously rushed to the palace. Their wrath was appeased for a time, but the un popular Emperor was obliged to take Alexander with him to the camp of the Pr\u00e6torians, and deprecate their anger. He promised to abandon his com panions in his licentious pleasures, his players, and his charioteers ; for even in the period of their deepest degradation, the grave Romans saw the in decency of their Emperor driving the racing chariot, or associating with jockeys. It was thus, though not without difficulty, that Elagabalus saved his life and his throne.t His mind was henceforward occupied with com passing the death of his cousin ; and in order to try the real feelings of the soldiery, he kept him close * a.d. 221. f a.d. 222."], [143, "HISTORY OF ROME. 135 shut up in the palace, and spread a report that he was at the point of death. The Pr\u00e6torians suspected foul play, and refused to mount guard or to leave the camp ; nor were their suspicions allayed, until by his personal presence they were assured of his safety. The cold reception which Elagabalus met with from his guards, contrasted with their enthusiasm in favour of Alexander, irritated his jealousy to the highest pitch ; and he resolved to punish as mutineers those who were most forward in their expressions of affection towards his cousin. This resolution proved his death-blow ; for the guards, seeing their own danger, commenced a massacre of his partisans. The Emperor endeavoured to escape, and concealed himself in a place where was collected all the filth and refuse of the camp. He was discovered and slain, together with his mother, who held him to the last moment in her arms ; his corpse was dragged through the streets to the \u00c6milian bridge, and after being treated with the greatest indignity, was thrown into the Tiber. This slave to his passions only at tained the age of eighteen years, and reigned three years and nine months. ALEXANDER SEVERUS. born a.d. 208 ; died a.d. 235. Elevated to the purple by the affections of the Pr\u00e6torians, the youthful Emperor Alexander dis played a character the exact opposite to that of his predecessor. His mother, Mam\u00e6a, had taken care that his naturally good talents and disposition should be cultivated by education. Christian and Pagan"], [144, "136 HISTORY OF ROME. authors alike agree in describing her as a wise and virtuous lady. When she was at Antioch, she sent for Origen, and received and treated him with great ALEXANDER AND MAM\u00c6A respect. As he remained some time with her, there can be no doubt but that he conversed with her frequently on the subject of Christianity. Whether she became a believer in the Gospel is uncertain ; but this is maintained by many authors. There is no doubt that she befriended the Christians, and that her son had an intimate acquaintance with their doctrines and manners, and openly showed marked respect for the Author of our faith. In accordance with the principles of that hero worship, which was the essence of Roman paganism, he erected in his private chapel a statue of Jesus Christ in the company of Abraham, Apollonius Tyan\u00e6us, Orpheus, and Alexander the Great. To a fair ac quaintance with literature and skill in military exer cises, he added the accomplishment of music, both vocal and instrumental. His disposition was gentle and compassionate, and directly opposed to cruelty"], [145, "HISTORY OF ROME. 137 and bloodshed. His temper was cheerful and equable. His manners were courteous and affable, and his morals irreproachable. He disliked pomp, state, and adulation ; was modest and simple in his attire ; appeared in public like a private individual ; and was accessible to those who demanded audience. For his friends and counsellors he selected the best of his contemporaries, such as Ulpian, the learned and upright jurist ; Sabinus, who was considered the Cato of his day ; and Serenianus, whom men called the \" holiest of all.\" Like Severus, whom he had taken as his model as well as his namesake, he apportioned each hour of the day to its especial employment. He commenced the day with the transaction of public business ; the rest of the morning he devoted to study, especially to reading the Republics of Plato and Cicero, and the poetry of Horace. He then took exercise, bathed, and dined. His evenings were employed in his correspondence, and in giving directions to his secre taries ; and the day was closed in the society of his friends. The simplicity of his tastes, the frugality of his habits, and the economy of his financial administra tion, enabled him to diminish considerably the public burthens both at Rome and in the provinces. He was liberal where poverty required aid, and although he could not venture to retrench the usual presents to the soldiery, he nevertheless ceased to squander the resources of the treasury on comedians and charioteers, and other unworthy minions of a court. He was patient and impartial in the administration"], [146, "138 HISTORY OF ROME. of justice, but inflexibly severe towards incorrigible criminals. Shrewd and discriminating in judging of character, he was careful to appoint to civil and military employments by merit, and not by interest or favour ; and, previously to conferring on any can didate a provincial government, he invited, by public notice, any one to declare if they knew any just cause or impediment to the appointment. This practice, says a heathen author (Lampridius), he derived from the custom of the Christians, in regard to those who were candidates for the priesthood. With respect to the army, he paid strict attention to all the details which affected their discipline or their happiness. When they were sick he visited them personally, and distributed medicines and com forts. On the march he took care that provisions should be ready for them whenever they halted, instead of carrying with them sufficient for seventeen days ; and whilst they were in an enemy's country, he provided them with a sufficient number of mules and camels. When their period of service was over, he not only distributed to the officers and soldiers the lands taken from the enemy, but also furnished them with stock and with slaves to assist in cultivation. These estates, somewhat like the military fiefs of feudal times, he made hereditary on the condition of the holders embracing the profession of arms. With all this affectionate kindness he was an unflinching maintainer of discipline. He kept regis tered reports of each man's conduct ; with fearless vigour he corrected the demoralization and license which prevailed, owing to the luxury with which"], [147, "HISTORY OF ROME. 139 Caracalla had petted and pampered them. He never feared to punish offenders ; he never forgave extor tion ; and would even, like Julius C\u00e6sar, disband whole legions if they exhibited signs of insubordi nation. But the task of refining so powerful and licentious a body was one of almost superhuman difficulty. It will be seen that all the firmness of the Emperor was unable to save the patriotic jurist, Domitius Ulpianus, from their rage, or to maintain the historian, Dio Cassius, in his command of the Pannonian army. Lastly, he showed his apprecia tion of learning by establishing schools of the arts and sciences, by founding salaried professorships and exhibitions for poor scholars of respectable family, and his love of the beautiful by completing the magnificent Therm\u00e6 of Caracalla, and by embellish ing Rome with new buildings, and monuments, and statues. The only error of which he has been ac cused is the not maintaining sufficient independence of his mother Mam\u00e6a, who, taking advantage of his youth, acted as if she were regent of the empire. No great historical events mark the first three years of the reign of Alexander : but in the fourth year the powerful dynasty of the Arsacid\u00e6 in Parthia was overthrown, which had engaged the Roman armies in many a hard struggle ever since the ac cession of M. Aurelius.* This powerful monarchy, which was alone able successfully to resist the strength of Rome, was founded by Arsaces, who revolted against the successors of Alexander on the throne of Syria, in the time of the first Punic war.f * A.D. 226. t About B.C. 250."], [148, "140 HISTORY OF ROME. His descendants had therefore worn the diadem during nearly five centuries. The present monarch was Artabanus, who nine years before had compelled Macrinus to purchase a humiliating peace. He styled himself the Great King, and claimed two diadems, that of the Medes as well as that of the Parthians. The latter \u2014 of whom after this revolution history knows no more \u2014 were a rude and warlike race ; but their spirit had been gradually softened and deteriorated by the luxurious habits of the Oriental races which they had conquered. The defeats which they had experienced in the reigns of M. Aurelius and Septimius Severus, followed by the fall of Ctesiphon, were at once indications of their growing weakness, and a cause of their inability to maintain their supremacy. The Persians of Iranian race, who lived in towns, and whose civilisation therefore was far in advance of their barbarian masters, saw that there was an opportunity of re covering their independence, and re-establishing their ancient faith and institutions. They found a leader in Artaxerxes, or Ardshir, as he is called by the Oriental historian, Abulfaraje. He was a Persian, whose father or grandfather was named Sasan ; and hence the dynasty which he founded, and which held the throne of Persia during more than four centuries until the Mahommedan invasion, bore the name of Sasanid\u00e6. His talents and his ambition were such as both to tempt and to qualify him to be a leader of a revolution. After fighting three battles he succeeded in completely vanquishing the Parthians. Artabanus was slain ;"], [149, "HISTORY OF ROME. 141 the Persian monarchy re-established, together with the religion of Zoroaster and the Magi. Elated with this success, he appeared with a powerful army on the frontiers of Syria and Mesopotamia, menacing- Rome with the loss of all her Asiatic possessions, and laying claim to the whole empire of Cyrus. He asserted that Asia as naturally belonged to Persia as Europe did to Rome. His threats were the more formidable because of the demoralization of the Roman army. Some of the soldiers even deserted to him. His first attempt was to take the city of Atra ; but it proved too strong for him, as it had before for Trajan and Severus. He succeeded in breaching the walls, but was eventually forced to retreat with loss ; and, contenting himself with compelling the sub mission of the Medes and other weak foes, he re turned to Armenia, in order to raise reinforcements.* As the history of Dio Cassius concludes at this period, we lose sight of Artaxerxes for some years. The most eminent amongst the privy councillors of Alexander Severus was the celebrated jurist Domi tianus Ulpianus. As the joint Prefect of the Pr\u00e6torians, to whom the civil administration was confided, and subsequently the sole Prefect, he was in fact his prime minister, the president of the privy council, which was originally instituted in the time of Hadrian. One great object, to which he bravely devoted himself, was the curbing the license of the Pr\u00e6torians. It was an honourable task, but he found it beyond his power. Whatever his policy was, it was ill-contrived : its result was a bloody conflict between the citizens * a. D. 229."], [150, "142 HISTORY OF ROME. and the soldiers. Three days the struggle continued, and at length, when the latter began to fire the city, the people were obliged to succumb to these armed ruffians. Even the Emperor was powerless to pro tect his unpopular minister from the fury of the excited guards ; in vain he threw around him the imperial purple, he was slain in the very presence of Alexander himself* After the assassination of Ulpian the Pr\u00e6torians became more and more in subordinate, and a mutinous spirit showed itself even amongst the legions quartered in the distant pro vinces of the empire, which was sometimes crushed not without difficulty. The Emperor in fact only wore the purple at the will and pleasure of his guards. When the ravages which Artaxerxes committed in Mesopotamia and the urgent despatches of the pro vincial governors rendered a Persian war inevitable, Alexander was obliged to animate the guards with glowing descriptions of conquest, and to bribe them by an extraordinary donative in order to induce them to exchange the luxurious idleness of Rome for the hardships of an Asiatic campaign, f On their march to the distant scene of war the Emperor was un wearied in the performance of his duty as a general. He lived as the private soldier lived. He would not suffer the slightest infringement of discipline, or any acts of cruelty or injustice towards the inhabitants of the countries through which he passed. At Antioch he wintered, and at the news of his advance the Persians retired from Cappadocia, which they had succeeded in occupying. * a.d. 228. f a.d. 232."], [151, "HISTORY OF ROME. 143 Before proceeding further Alexander sent an em bassy to Artaxerxes, but the proud and contemptuous answer of the Oriental monarch was, that the Romans should evacuate Asia and confine themselves within the limits of Europe.* All negotiations failed, and the Roman army marched into the enemy's country. According to the account given by Herodian, the Emperor divided his army into three brigades : one of these, which he commanded in person, remained inactive in Mesopotamia, and was decimated by sick ness ; the second was cut to pieces in Parthia ; the third, which was ordered to invade Media, was re called, and almost entirely perished during the winter in the mountain passes of Armenia. Notwithstanding these disasters the Persians suffered great losses ; their ambitious designs were overthrown, and they remained at peace for two or three years. This is the most probable account, but if credit is to be given to the tale told by the Emperor himself to the Senate, he put to flight Artaxerxes himself together with the whole of his cavalry ; and ten thousand men and two hundred elephants were left dead upon the field. With the relics of his shattered army Severus re mained a short time at Antioch, and then returned to Rome. He was welcomed with a magnificent reception, eighteen elephants graced the procession, and four drew his triumphal car.f He was not long permitted to enjoy peace. Since the Marcomannian war, the German tribes had not ventured to cross the wall and fosse {limes) which stretched from the Main to the Danube in the * a. D. 233. t a.

Severus assembled all the military resources of the empire, including some Oriental contingents, especially Moorish and Parthian archers. On the news of the approach of so formidable a force the Germans at once retired beyond the Rhine, but Alexander did not push his advantage further, either owing to the sullen discontent of the soldiery, which had now reached an unmanageable height, or to that want of energy and of warlike spirit in which the character of this gentle prince was manifestly deficient. There was at this time in the Roman army a soldier of Thracian birth, named Maximin. His father Micea was a Goth, his mother Abala an Alan. At the athletic sports which Septimius Severus cele brated in Thrace on the birthday of his second son Geta,* his extraordinary strength and gigantic stature (for he was more than eight feet in height) attracted the notice of the Emperor, who placed him first in the cavalry and next in the imperial body-guard. There he remained during the reigns of Severus and Caracalla, but he would not serve Macrinus, who had risen by the fall of his patron's family, nor would he attach himself to the sensual and effeminate Elaga balus. This period of his life he passed in the service of his countrymen the Goths and Alans, but on the accession of Alexander he accepted the com mand of the fourth legion, and was entrusted with * Probably A.

His guards fled, either intimidated or bribed. Mam\u00e6a rushed in with the Prefects of the Pr\u00e6torians to defend him, but they were overpowered and slain. Alexander, seeing that resistance was hopeless, covered his face with his robe and submitted to the swords of his murderers.* He fell in the twenty-seventh year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign. He was a virtuous but timid prince ; he saw the evils of military insubordination and oppression, and was firm in his righteous opposition to the abuse of power by the Pr\u00e6torians, but his efforts were applied too late. Their despotism over prince and people was too firmly rooted. His reign was a happy one, because the happiness of the Roman people under the empire con sisted not in the consciousness of personal independ ence or national freedom, but in the purple being worn by an emperor who was an enemy to carnage and extortion.

The newly raised Pannonian legions which Maxi min commanded, and his fellow-countrymen the Thracian troops, were the first to proclaim the bar barian-assassin Emperor, and their example was immediately followed by the rest of the army. The obsequious Senate confirmed the choice of the soldiers, and Maximin associated with himself his son, con ferring upon him the titles of C\u00e6sar and Princeps Juventutis. His first act was to dismiss all who had enjoyed the favour of his predecessor both in court * March 19, A.

A plot, of which a Roman of noble birth named Magnus was the ringleader, awoke his dark sus- picions and developed the savage barbarism of his cha racter. All who were sus pected of being accomplices were executed without trial or hearing, and the blood of four thousand persons was shed on this occasion. As is often the case with ignorant and illiterate brutality, he seemed to have an instinc tive hatred against every one who was well born, educated, and refined. Thus commenced his barbarous career of cruelty. The pub lic delators were petted and encouraged in their infamous ALTAR TO MAXIMIN. (CORBT CASTLE.) trade, and all whom they pointed out as suspicious persons became his victims. Some were beaten to death, others, sewn up in the skins of beasts, were thrown to the lions. His avarice was equal to his cruelty. The property of the wealthiest and most illustrious Romans was confiscated ; even the treasu ries of the provincial towns were plundered, and the holiest temples stripped of their statues and offerings. \" He slew,\" says Herodian, \" more citizens than ene mies, and plundered Romans more than barbarians h2"], [156, "148 HISTORY OF ROME. His fury raged against the Christians, so many of whom, owing to the tolerant disposition of Alexander, he found filling situations at his court. During his whole reign he never visited Rome or even Italy ; it was all passed in the camp and in spreading desola tion along the banks of the Rhine and the Danube. No records remain of his military prowess ; although he had the vanity to tell the Senate that he had waged more wars than any of the ancients. An apparently slight cause gave the first shock to his power.* The procurator of Africa had unjustly inflicted a fine on two young men of rank, so extor tionate as utterly to ruin them. They, at the head of the peasantry who inhabited their estates, gained over most of the legionaries who were quartered in the province, and assassinated the procurator. The pro consul of Africa was Gordianus, a venerable Roman, fourscore years of age, of illustrious birth and great wealth, universally beloved and esteemed. His son, who was his lieutenant, was equally popular. The choice of the insurgents, therefore, fell upon the two Gordians, and they were invested with the purple. Their family connexions \u2014 for they were descended from the Gracchi, as well as from the imperial house of Trajan \u2014 at once recommended them to the Senate, who confirmed their election, declared Maximin a public enemy, and set a price upon his head. These acts were followed by immediate measures for fortify ing and defending Italy from any attack on the part of Maximin ; but meanwhile, Capelianus, who had been * a.d. 237."], [157, "149 HISTORY OF ROME. appointed governor of Mauritania by Maximin, and had been superseded by Gordian, induced the natives, by the hopes of rich spoil, to join his standard ; thus reinforced, he attacked the new Augusti before the walls of Carthage, and defeated them in a pitched battle. The younger Gordian fell fighting valiantly. His venerable father, after a reign of thirty-six days, put an end to his existence by strangulation. The Senate, dreading the fury of Maximin, who was now leading his legions against Rome, conferred the empire without delay on M. Clodius Pupienus Maximus and Decimus C\u0153lius Balbinus, , It is pro bable (as Niebuhr supposes) that two emperors were chosen, because there were two parties in the Senate, neither of which would be satisfied without such a com promise. The former was the son of a smith, but had been a successful general in Illyricum, and had filled the office of proconsul in several provinces. The latter was of ancient and illustrious birth, honest and upright, harmless and timid. His talents were fitted for civil rather than military administration, and in the numerous provinces which he had governed, not a word of complaint had ever been uttered against him. Whilst the new Augusti were offering a solemn sacrifice in the Capitol on occasion of their elevation, the people rose in arms and demanded a prince of the house of Gordian. They were, therefore, constrained to satisfy their clamour by associating with them a grandson of the elder Gordian, a boy of twelve years of age. So popular was the young C\u00e6sar, that a civil war which raged during this year between the citizens and the soldiers, and which threatened the destruction"], [158, "HISTORY OF ROME. 150 of Rome itself, was only quelled by his appearance amongst the combatants, clothed in the imperial purple. In the ensuing spring, as soon as the passes of the Alps were open, Maximin entered Italy without opposition. But in a short time, a mutinous spirit showed itself in his legions, when they found scarcity instead of the abundance which they had expected in that luxuriant country. It was quelled by severity, but it rendered the hatred which they felt against Maximin still more bitter and implacable. The town of Aquileia presented the first obstacle to his advance. It was well supplied and obstinately defended, and Maximin besieged it in vain. The ardour of Maxi min's troops gradually cooled, and, irritated by their backwardness and by the taunts of the besieged, he gratified his vengeance by the execution of some of his officers. Then burst forth the pent-up wrath of his army, and the sentence which all were ready to pronounce was carried into effect by the soldiers from the camp at Alba. Maximin and his unoffending son were sleeping at noon-day in their tent, when they were awoke by the tramp of men. Deserted by their guard of honour, they rushed out to parley with the mutineers, but they were immediately slain : first the son, then the father. Their heads were sent to Rome, and their bodies cast to the dogs and birds. The legions laid down their arms, and announced to the Aquileians the tyrant's death. Although they would not open their gates, they sent the starving soldiers clothes and provisions ; and on the next"], [159, "151 HISTORY OF ROME. day, took the oath of allegiance to Balbinus and Maximus.* In four days the joyful intelligence reached Rome. The courier passed through Ravenna, and there found Maximus in the act of collecting his forces for the cam paign. His only task now was to send to the Senate his despatches wreathed with laurel. The Roman people were assembled by thousands in the vast amphitheatre, when the bearer of the despatch appeared before them. They read at once in his countenance the glad tidings. The air was rent with acclamations ; the temples were filled with grateful worshippers, and the Senate met and accumulated fresh honours on the three princes. But the universal joy was polluted by barbarism. The senseless heads of the Maximins were paraded through the streets on spears, and, after a thousand insults, were burnt in the Campus Martius. Maximus met the army at Aquileia, and was received with every outward mark of satisfaction. The Senate sent a deputation of twenty of their body, all of whom had been either consuls, pr\u00e6tors, or qu\u00e6stors, to escort him to Rome. His imperial col leagues met him at the gates, and conducted him to the palace in a species of triumph. The choice of the Senate proved a wise one, but they were unable to support and protect the objects of it against the military power. They ruled with prudence and equity, restored discipline, repealed excessive and extortionate taxes, paid proper deference to the Senate, and seemed anxious to restore the balance between the legislative * a.d. 238."], [160, "152 HISTORY OF ROME. and the executive power. These very qualities pro voked the enmity of the Pr\u00e6torians. Their absolutism was evidently in danger. Maximin, detested as he was, had been their own choice ; whilst it was the civil power which had elevated the present Emperors to the purple. It was the crisis of their fate, and they determined to strike a decisive blow. It was the celebration of the Capitoline games : every one was engaged, and Maximus and Balbinus GORDIAW. were almost alone in the palace. A party of the Pr\u00e6torians rushed in. Maximus would have sent for the Rhenish guards, on whose fidelity he could rely ; but, in those awful times, even imperial col leagues could not trust one another, and Balbinus opposed. The Pr\u00e6torians, therefore, dragged the two emperors from the palace, and would have treated them with insults and tortures ; but, fearing a rescue on the part of the German guards, they slew them and left their corpses in the street. In another quarter of the palace they found the young Gordian, and thinking him the fittest person to be invested with"], [161, "153 HISTORY OF ROME. the purple, they carried him to the camp and pro claimed him Augustus.

Being invested with the prefecture of the Pr\u00e6torians, he corrected abuses, both civil and military, without forfeiting his popularity with the army. It was not long before the genius and talents of Timesicles were called into action. Sapor, the first son of Artaxerxes, King or Shah of Persia, declared war against the Romans. He took Nisibis and marched against Antioch. Gordian solemnly opened the temple of Janus, for the last time mentioned in history, and marching through M\u0153sia and Thrace, landed in Asia. Sapor retired before him and eva cuated Mesopotamia. The Senate decreed to him a Persian triumph, i. e. that his chariot should be drawn by elephants, and also to Timesicles a tri umphal car, together with an inscription in which he was styled \" Guardian of the Republic.\" * The following year, this great and good man died of dysentery, and his death put an end to the pro sperity of Gordian. He was succeeded as prefect by M. J. Philippus, who was suspected of having caused his death, by purposely administering a wrong me dicine. Philip's bold ambition did not stop here; he persuaded the turbulent soldiers that Gordian was too young to command, and having first induced them to declare him Gordian's colleague, he soon after compassed his death. | A tomb, bearing an inscription in five languages, marked the spot on the banks of the Euphrates, where the ill-fated and inno cent youth was slain. * a.

He is com monly called an Arab ; but this could not have been the case, or he would not have been admitted into a Roman legion. His father had adopted Arab habits, and was a captain of a horde of banditti ; but he was a Roman subject, and Bostra, his native town, was a Roman colony. There are strong grounds for believing that he was a Christian, as well as his wife and son.* There is no doubt that Origen wrote letters to him on the sub ject of Christianity ; and the fact that Bostra was near Pella, where there was a large number of Jewish Christians, increases the probability. The murder of Gor dian was his last great crime ; for his private life was not stained by vice, nor his public adminis tration by cruelty.

Eusebius relates, as a tradition of his times, that ONCOP.DIA AVGUoTORV he arrived at Antioch just betore Easter, and wished to participate in the ceremonies of the Church. The Bishop, however, refused to admit him unless he previously did penance for the murder of the Emperor, to which order both he and the Empress voluntarily submitted. The same Church historian asserts that Christianity made rapid progress during the reign of Philip, enjoyed his favourable counte nance, and was preached everywhere with great freedom. In the fourth year of Philip's reign occurred the thousandth anniversary of the building of Rome.* On this occasion the Emperor courted popularity, by celebrating the secular games with extraordinary mag nificence. During ten days there were spectacles of various kinds \u2014 hundreds of wild beasts were slain in combat, and amongst them was exhibited a hy\u00e6na, * April 21st, A.D. 248."], [166, "158 HISTORY OF ROME. which had never before been seen in Europe, and choirs of noble youths and maidens sang the praises of the gods in hymns, such as that which Horace wrote on the occasion of their first revival by Augustus. * Mutiny and revolt disturbed the remainder of Philip's short reign. f One in the East was soon quelled, and its ringleader Papianus slain ; but the legions in Pan nonia and M\u0153sia forced him to succumb. They chose as emperor P. Carvilius Marinus, a centurion ; and a man of many names, C. Messius Quintus Trajanus Decius, was selected by Philip to subdue and punish the insurgents. He accepted the difficult task with great reluctance, and warned the Emperor that treason might be forced upon him. The event turned out as he anticipated. The legions compelled him, on pain of death, to accept the purple. Placed in such a position, he had no alternative but to put himself at their head and march against Philip ; a battle was fought near Verona, in which, according to some ac counts, Philip fell, according to others, he was put to death. His son was slain by the Pr\u00e6torians imme diately on the arrival of the news of his defeat. C. TRAJANUS DECIUS. BORN A. D. 191 ; DIED A. D. 251. The name of Decius is deeply fixed in the memories of all Christians, by the persecutions which raged against the Church in his reign. The pow\u00e6r and influence of Christianity had greatly increased during the long interval of rest which the Church had pre- * Carmen Sec. f a.d. 249."], [167, "159 HISTORY OF ROME. viously enjoyed. Few, indeed, of the higher orders had embraced the Gospel. Not many great, not many noble, had been called ; but it had taken deep DECIUS. root amongst the middle classes of society : and although the illiterate inhabitants of the rural dis tricts (Pagani) were generally heathen, the Christian faith was professed by many in the principal towns and cities of the empire. The death of Philip deprived the Christians of a protector; and ecclesiastical historians attribute the bitterness of the persecution under Decius to his jea lousy of the favourites of his predecessor. An edict is attributed to the Emperor and his son, ordaining that all Christians who refused to abjure their creed should be punished with the most savage torments and the most cruel kinds of death. It appeared for the first time in print at Toulouse, a.d. 1664, without setting forth any grounds for its genuineness or au thenticity. The style in which it is written and other internal evidences combine to prove, beyond a doubt, that it is spurious ; but, nevertheless, the author of it"], [168, "160 HISTORY OF ROME. has probably described faithfully the horrible tortures to which the disciples of Jesus were exposed. * During a whole year every corner of the empire was deluged with their blood : Italy, Sicily, Spain, Syria, Antioch, Asia Minor, Greece, Egypt, Africa, all were witnesses to the constancy and sufferings of those who cemented with their blood the holy edifice of which Christ is the chief Corner-stone. Every species of diabolical cruelty which the depravity of man could conceive was inflicted upon their innocent victims of both sexes and of the tenderest age. They were torn to pieces by wild beasts ; placed in chains of red-hot iron ; cut and slashed with blades of steel ; smeared with honey, and exposed to be stung to death by insects in the burning rays of the noonday sun. The ties of family affection were snapped asunder. The world was filled with distrust; for the nearest relatives discovered and betrayed each other. The prophetic words of Jesus Christ were fulfilled to the letter. Notwithstanding the firmness with which, as a general rule, the bishops and pastors of the Church embraced martyrdom, there were some who could not face the fiery trial. In Carthage and Alexandria, Rome and Aries, many renounced the Saviour ; and, as a symbol of their faithlessness, offered incense publicly on heathen altars. Even bishops, such as Jovinus and Maximus in Africa, Basilides in Spain, and Eu demon in Smyrna, were convicted of sacrificing to idols, and were deposed and excommunicated. An other class of \" the fallen\" {lapsi), as they were * a.d. 251."], [169, "161 HISTORY OF ROME. termed, were the Libellatici. These prevaricating self-deceivers were so called because they bribed the magistrates to give them a false certificate {libellum), that they had sacrificed at heathen altars. In the Decian persecution perished Fabianus, the first bishop of Rome who suffered martyrdom.* At his death Rome remained without a bishop for a year and a half ; either no presbyter dared accept the office, or the Church itself feared to elect ; for the Emperor had been heard to say, that he would more patiently endure a competitor for the purple than a bishop in the capital. Persecution, however, \u2014 such is the merciful effect of God's chastisements \u2014 promoted unity and concord within the Church : the intolerance of schism, and the strife of party spirit, had done more harm to the vital interests of Christianity, during the prosperity which the Church enjoyed under tolerant emperors, than the intolerant bigotry of the most fanatical emperors had power to effect. Differences were forgotten under the pressure of common dangers, and similar sorrows were the parent of mutual sympathy. Carthage, the metro polis of Africa, under its great leader Cyprian, was brought into close communion with Rome, and the Decian persecution led to the consolidation of that internal strength which the Western Church soon began to display. Decius was a native of Illyricum, and therefore the first of a long list of princes which that country gave * Unless the tradition is trustworthy, that Pontianus, who was bishop A.D. 235, and who was exiled to Sardinia together with Hippolytus, the celebrated Bishop of Porto (the port of Trajan), suffered martrydom in that island."], [170, "162 HISTORY OF ROME. to the empire. He is described as enlightened and courageous, equally well qualified to govern a state and to command an army. The troubles of his short reign commenced with a civil war in Gaul, which he quelled probably in person ; for an inscription of this year gives him the title of proconsul.* A greater danger now threatened the empire. An unsuccessful invasion of M\u0153sia by hordes of Scythians, Carpi, and other barbarians, as early as the reign of Alexander Severus, is spoken of by historians; again emboldened, apparently, by the death of Maximin, they a second time passed the Danube, and destroyed the town of Istria at the mouth of that river ; thirdly, in the reign of Philip, thirty thousand of them laid siege to Mar cianopolis; and Decius, then Philip's general, was obliged to purchase their retreat : but now, for the first time, the storm burst which ended in the dissolu tion of the empire. The Goths, a branch of that great roaming race of Northmen, who seem destined to be the colonisers of the world, now occupied the vast and fertile country of the Ukraine, its dark forests, and broad rivers. Originally natives of Sweden, they had lined the coasts of Pomerania aud Prussia before they reached their present settlements They were a warlike people, and other tribes of Teutonic and Sclavonic origin fought in their armies. They were divided into three great tribes, Eastern or Ostro goths, Western or Visi-goths, and Gepid\u00e6. The province of Dacia, lying between the Dniester and the Danube, well-cultivated, but still unsettled, was a strong temptation to so warlike a people ; and * a. D. 250. f See Gibbon, ch. v."], [171, "HISTORY OF ROME. 163 when this was overrun, it was easy to cross the Danube and plunder M\u0153sia, the inhabitants of which neither anticipated nor were prepared for an invasion. Under their king, Cnida, an army seventy thousand strong appeared at Nicopolis, on the Danube : they were routed by Decius with the loss of thirty thousand men, and the remainder marched into Thrace, hoping to take by surprise Philippopolis, a city at the |foot of Mount H\u00e6mus. Decius pursued them, and had pitched his camp at Ber\u0153a, when suddenly Cnida turned upon him, put the Romans to flight, and plundered the camp. They then laid siege to Philip popolis ; * and, though the garrison made a gallant resistance, it was taken by storm, and a hundred thousand inhabitants massacred before Decius could relieve it. Some historians assign this inglorious campaign to the son of Decius, whom his father had declared C\u00e6sar in the previous year ; and add, that the dis astrous intelligence summoned the Emperor to the command of his army at the commencement of the following year.f Fortune at first favoured him. The Goths were exhausted by the length of the siege ; and successive defeats so reduced them, that they were obliged to surrender their booty, restore their pri soners, and evacuate the country. But Decius, elated by success, resolved to exterminate them. Despair, however, nerved the arms of the barbarians, and the Romans were vanquished, either in their retreat or in a second battle, which Decius, as some say, was treach erously advised by his successor, Gallus Trebonianus, * A.

Niebuhr compares the position of Decius to that of Frederick the Great at Kuners dorf; the Gothic troops being drawn up on narrow causeways intersecting the morass, which secured them against the assault of the Romans. Thus their total defeat was accomplished. They were drowned and smothered in the mud, and the body of the Emperor could never be found. C. VIBIUS TREBONIANUS GALLUS. BORN A. D. 194 ; DIED A. D. 253.

After concluding this disgraceful peace, he returned to Rome, and held the reins of government with such laxity, that although the gentleness of his rule rendered him sufficiently popular, he was universally despised, both in the pro vinces and the capital. He found that in his absence Hostilianus, a son or nephew of the deceased emperor, had been invested with the purple by the Senate; he therefore prevented any hostility on the part of a rival, by acknowledging him as his colleague. Hos tilianus, however, died shortly after. As might be expected, the pusillanimous policy of Gallus proved no less dangerous than it was disgraceful.

Gallus, when informed of this insurrection, and that \u00c6milianus was marching to Rome, sent Valerianus, who was afterwards emperor, at the head of the Gallic and German contingents, to give him battle. He himself followed with his son Volusianus, whom he had previously made C\u00e6sar and Augustus. The armies met at Interamna ( Terni) ; but the troops of Gallus, ashamed of themselves, as well as of their Emperor, would not face their victorious brethren, but put to death Gallus and his son,* and joined the forces of his opponent.

BORN A.D. 190; DIED A.D. 260. P. LICINIUS GALLIENUS. BORN A.D. 190 ; DIED A.D. 26S. The Emperor Valerian, who without resorting to intrigue or violence was called to his high dignity by the free consent of the Senate and the army, was a Roman of illustrious birth and high character. In fact, the anticipations formed of him were higher VALER.1A1 than he was able to realize. Although his intel lectual capacity was but moderate, and he was deficient in quickness to conceive and in vigour to execute, still his moral conduct was without reproach, and from his earliest years he had been a model and an example. \" If the whole world,\" says Tillemont, quoting some ancient historian, \" had"], [176, "168 HISTORY OF ROME. been free to choose an emperor, they could not have elected any other.\" The Emperor Decius had re quested the Senate to nominate a Censor, in order to curb the extravagance of the higher classes, which office, with this exception, was in abeyance from the reign of Claudius to that of Constantine. The Senate unanimously fixed upon Valerian as the only man qualified to recall to life the rigid principles of the old Roman virtue. The uprightness with which he administered public affairs, both civil and military, was in accordance with this opinion respecting his moral character ; and it is a remarkable proof of his judgment, that all whom he selected to command his armies were afterwards elevated by those armies to the imperial dignity. The Senate, in their imprudent adulation, conferred on his unworthy son Gallienus the rank of C\u00e6sar ; and Valerian, with more pardonable partiality, gave him GALLIENUS. the title of Augustus, and made him his colleague in the empire.

The Alemanni, a mixed race, as their name {all-men) implies, from the interior of Germany, had threatened the Roman frontier as early as the reign of Caracalla. The armies of the empire had as yet checked their advance ; and it is said that Gallienus, with a force of ten thousand, routed thirty thousand of them in the neighbourhood of Milan.* This defeat, however, did not prevent them, three years afterwards, during the absence of Valerian in Persia, from making another inroad into Lombardy, and pursuing an un resisted career of conquest as far as Ravenna. j\" The Senate, seeing the imminent danger, filled up the ranks of the Pr\u00e6torians with plebeian volunteers ; and thus raised so large a force, that the Alemanni, whose object was booty rather than a permanent settlement, evacuated Italy. In the ensuing year the health of Ulpius Crinitus, who commanded the legions in Illyricum and Thrace, failed, and the Emperor sent Aurelian to succeed him, and to carry on the war against the Goths, who were harassing Lower M\u0153sia. In the same war were also employed Claudius and Probus, who were after wards emperors. Valerian drove the Goths beyond the limits of the empire, but their principal strength was exerted in a different direction. Having achieved a permanent settlement in the Ukraine, they extended their conquests to the north coast of the Euxine, and poured into the Chersonesus Taurica, the now well known Crimea. These hardy and enterprising North men then became a naval power, and the waves of *\u2022 B- 256. f a.

The populous and well-fortified city of Trebizond was taken by them owing to the cowardice of the garrison,* the inhabitants put to the sword, and a vast booty captured ; the whole of Pontus was ravaged and plundered, and the conquerors sailed back to Europe, to prepare a second and more powerful arma ment.t On this occasion they landed near Chalcedon, and overran Bithynia ; and all its cities, including its wealthy capital Nicomedia, were burnt and plundered. As far as can be learnt from the confused state of this portion of history, it appears that Valerian, early in his reign, was induced to take the command in Asia, owing to the threatening aspect of affairs in Persia. Sapor, of whom mention has been already made, not content with the undisputed possession of Armenia, invaded Mesopotamia, and took the cities of Nisibis and Carrh\u00e6. Edessa alone held out, and he was obliged to raise the siege. He then committed great ravages in Syria, took and burnt Antioch, and massacred and made prisoners of all the inhabitants. The pleasure-loving citizens were all assembled in the theatre, when on a sudden an actress on the stage exclaimed, \" Either I dream, or I see the Persians ! \" The eyes of all the spectators turned, and beheld the long lines of the invading host descending the hill sides.

He it was who had urged Sapor to undertake this expedition, and who had acted as his guide to the ill-fated Antioch. After the sack of Antioch, Cyriades had the audacity to assume, first, the title of C\u00e6sar, and next that of Augustus ; but, on the arrival of Valerian, he was put to death by his own partisans.

Sapor treated his fallen rival with oriental insolence ; exhibited him in chains, clothed in mockery in the imperial purple, and when he mounted on horseback was wont to place his foot upon the neck of his imperial captive. How long he lived a prisoner is unknown ; but when he died, it is said that his skin, stuffed with a.

His misfortunes were bewailed by all except his surviving colleague, who, with hypocritical stoicism, received the intelligence of his downfall, saying, \" I knew that my father was a mortal man. He has acted a courageous part, and I am satisfied.\" Nor did this unnatural son, who permitted his father to linger in captivity without attempting to release him, want flatterers to praise his philosophy. During three years of this reign,* persecution raged against the Church. At the commencement of it, Valerian treated the Christians with tolerance and clemency; but, under the influence of Macrianus, \u2014 whose bigotry and superstition were so great, that he endeavoured by magical arts to possess himself of the empire, \u2014 his conduct totally changed. Not only ecclesiastics were subjected to the severest penalties, but women and children were cruelly scourged, and condemned to prison or to hard labour in the mines. The Roman Martyrology gives us a long list of those who, in all parts of the empire during this perse cution, sealed their faith with their blood ; amongst whom were Xystus, the Bishop of Rome, and Cyprian, the celebrated Bishop of Carthage; but, notwith standing human counsels, the faith of Jesus Christ became more widely known, and the Christians who were taken captive by the Goths and other barbarous nations, were the instruments of disseminating Gospel truth, and converting and civilising their conquerors.

Each army, isolated from the rest and beyond the influence of Senate or people, chose its own ephemeral emperor, destined to wear the purple for a short space, and then to vacate the throne by a bloody death. So numerous were these usurpers (for there were eighteen), that historians, misled by an imaginary resemblance to one of the most disastrous periods of Athenian history, have called them \" The Thirty Tyrants ;\" * but the analogy fails in every respect. Nor was any one of them even invested with supreme authority by the Senate, with the exception of Gallienus. The first of these who raised the standard of revolt, was Ingenuus, who was proclaimed Augustus by the legions in Mcesia ; but Gallienus, who was in Gaul when Valerian was taken prisoner, inarched against him and defeated him, and he was slain by his own soldiers.

Solomon, whose wisdom saw its fitness for a commercial station between India and Palestine, founded the first settlement there,* which gradually increased in wealth until the Asiatic triumphs of Trajan reduced it to be part and parcel of the Roman empire. What the real rank and position of Odena thus were is doubtful ; for as Palmyra, originally a great republic, was then a Roman colony, it must have recognised no prince but the Emperor. He may possibly have been a prince or sheik of the neighbouring Arab tribes. He was evidently of princely race, as his wife Zenobia claimed descent from the royal house of Ptolemy. Odenathus, alarmed at the success of Sapor, wrote him a respectful letter soliciting his favour, and sent at the same time magnificent presents. Sapor treated his messengers with scorn, and ordered that his presents should be cast into the river. Odenathus immediately threw himself into the arms of the Romans, joined his forces, which were considerable, to those of Balista, and compelled Sapor, after experiencing great loss in men and treasure, to retire beyond the Euphrates. He then besieged him in Ctesiphon, but respecting the result of this siege history is silent.f The Romans gratefully appreciated this help in time of need.

To her counsels and power of endurance history ascribes much of the success which attended the arms of her husband. On three occasions* during this reign, the Gothic tribes burst like an overwhelming torrent over Greece and Asia Minor. The ineffectual siege of Thessa lonica gave notice of their approach, and the Greeks garrisoned the passes of Thermopyl\u00e6. Athens rebuilt her ruined walls, and the Peloponnesians fortified their isthmus ; but the barbarians, never theless, penetrated into Achaia, and, although defeated by Macrianus, succeeded in carrying off a valuable booty. Another horde crossed the Hellespont, sacked and plundered many Asiatic cities, especially Ephesus and its rich temple ; and after desolating the country they destroyed on their way back the relics of ancient Troy.f Four years had given the rich province of Asia Minor time to recover from the ravages of these barbarian plunderers, when they again made a descent upon the Asiatic coasts of the Euxine at Heraclea, and did not return to Europe until the ensuing spring. The gallant Odenathus had heard of the deplorable state to which they had reduced Asia, and resolved to execute vengeance on the invaders, but they antici pated him in their retreat. They did not, however, long leave the Romans in repose. A tribe of them called Heruli (\"EpouXot or A'lpovXoi), sailing from the Palus M\u00e6otis into the Euxine in a fleet of five hundred ships, commanded by their chieftain Naulo batus, came straight to Byzantium and Chrysopolis, {Scutari), and plundered this opulent town.

Gallienus, who had just returned from Gaul, met the marauders in Illyricum : Naulobatus surrendered, and received the consular dignity. He was the first barbarian on whom that honour was conferred.

The appearance of the Goths so near the con fines of Italy had awoke the indolent Emperor"], [190, "182 HISTORY OF ROME. from his state of apathy, for, although naturally self-indulgent, his energies only required arousing. Rebellion forced him to still further exertions. The army of the Upper Danube proclaimed Aureolus emperor, who made himself master of Milan. Gal lienus defeated the usurper in the open field, and besieged him in that city. Aureolus, thinking that all was lost, forged a memorandum, purporting to be drawn up by Gallienus, and containing the names of the principal officers of his army as marked out for death. He then took measures that the document should fall, as if by accident, into the hands of the persons threat ened. A conspiracy was formed, and the same night an alarm was given of an intended sortie from the town. Gallienus immediately rode forth almost unattended, and in the confusion and darkness he received a mortal wound from an unknown hand. The con spirators, at his dying request, sent the imperial robe and insignia to M. Aurelius Claudius, who was commander-in-chief at Pavia. Whilst civil discord and the inroads of barbarism were distressing the empire during this disastrous period, the phenomena of the natural world were spreading alarm and destruction. For many days the light of the sun was totally obscured. The shocks of an earthquake were felt in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The sea rose, and engulfed whole towns. The waste caused by domestic and foreign war produced famine, and famine was followed by pestilence, which raged during fifteen years without intermission* How terrible the mortality must have been, can easily * A.

Whilst, how ever, the empire was distracted, the Church was at peace. The attention of statesmen was diverted from her internal affairs by affairs of more immediate interest. Those edicts which had imposed pains and penalties, though not abrogated, were not enforced until the persecution again broke out under Diocle tian ; the Christians enjoyed almost uninterrupted rest.* In the reign of Gallienus, an edict tolerating the free exercise of the Christian faith was actually addressed to the bishops, and thus the state for the first time recognised their official authority. * Aurelian, by an imperial act, invested the Bishops of Rome and Italy with power to pronounce judgment on Paul of Samosata, and although he framed an edict against the Christians, he died before it could be put in force. The cases of persecution, therefore, which occurred in distant provinces, in what is commonly called the Christian persecution, took place without imperial sanction. \u2014 (See Milman's History of the Church, ii. p. 257, and Hist, of Lat.

On the accession of Claudius,* brighter days dawned upon the oppressed empire, and for a few years the Roman world, cheered and invigorated, seemed to breathe again. He was a native of Dalmatia, of obscure birth. He was brave and patriotic, wise and impartial, of pure morals, and an enemy to luxury and extravagance. As a soldier he had won his way to the highest position, by his services and his abilities, and he owed his elevation to the purple to the esteem in which he was universally held. The Emperor, as a dying man, recognised in him his worthiest successor. He had to maintain his newly acquired rights by the might of his arm, for Aureolus still held out at Milan. Tetricus was in possession of Gaul and Spain, and Zenobia looked upon Palmyra * a.d. 268."], [193, "HISTORY OF ROME. 185 as an independent kingdom. Aureolus, after in vain proposing a partition of the empire, surrendered at discretion, and was put to death by the unanimous verdict of the army; but the invasion of the Goths rendered it impossible for Claudius to direct his attention to the designs of Tetricus or Zenobia. The first year of the new reign was occupied in salutary military reforms, which the insolence of the Goths rendered so necessary. These formidable ene mies were also simultaneously making preparations for invasion. They collected on the banks of the Niester a large number of chariots, and a fleet of two thousand vessels ; on board of these embarked three hundred thousand men. Of this vast armament they lost many in the narrow and rapid currents of the Bosphorus, but with the rest they anchored off Mount Athos, and laid siege to Thessalonica.* At the news of Claudius's approach, they raised the siege, and continued their marauding course along the banks of the Axius, until, near Naissus, a city of Upper M\u0153sia, the Emperor encountered them. The battle was for some time doubtful, but he ultimately gained a brilliant victory ; fifty thousand Goths were left dead upon the field ; three thousand had previously fallen in a skirmish with a body of Dalmatian cavalry. The Romans occupying the road to Macedonia, forced them to make a detour into H\u00e6mus {the Balkan), where cold and hunger still more diminished their numbers, and pestilence completed their ruin. But this pesti lence proved a scourge to the Romans as well as to their enemies.t Many of the army were carried off * a.d. 269. t a.d. 270."], [194, "186 HISTORY OF ROME. by it, and Claudius himself, who by his victory had gained the surname of Gothicus, fell a victim. He died at Sirmium {Sirmich), and his last act was to summon his generals around him, and to recommend Aurelian as most worthy of being his successor. L. DOMITIUS AURELIANUS. BORN SEPT. 9, A.D. 212; DIED A.D. 275. Aurelian was a native of M\u0153sia or of Lower Dacia. From his earliest years he exhibited a decided love of military exercises, and his deeds of prowess were celebrated when he served in the armies of Valerian. He is said to have slain nearly one thousand men with his own hand, and at the head of three hundred soldiers, to have cut to pieces an army of Sarmatians who invaded Illyricum. He saw that the greatest strictness was necessary in order to restore the disci pline of the army, and his success in repressing its licentiousness proved the foundation of his victorious career. Rapine and violence he never overlooked. If a soldier stole a single grape he was scourged, and one who had offered violence to a woman was tied between two branches of a tree bent forcibly to meet each other, which by their recoil tore him asunder. The result of his severity was, that a crime once punished was seldom committed again. This severity, however, carried as it was to such an excess as to become cruelty, was the one dark spot in his civil administration ; it might have been necessary in order to curb a licentious camp, but it was unsuited to the council chamber. He was fitter to command an army"], [195, "187 HISTORY OF ROME. than to govern an empire. It was this sternness which deterred Valerian, notwithstanding the high opinion he entertained of him, from entrusting the youthful Gallienus to his care. It prompted him to issue an edict against the Christians, whom he had favoured and patronised, which his death alone prevented from being carried into execution. From Sirmium, where he had been invested with the purple, Aurelian hastened to Rome, and having established his authority there, marched into Pannonia to oppose an invasion of the Goths and Vandals. He first destroyed everything which could support and maintain an invading army, and then gave them battle. Night fell upon a bloody and well- fought field, but the combat was yet undecided. In the darkness, the barbarians re-crossed the Danube, and on the morrow sent to sue for peace.* It was granted on very advantageous terms. Northern Dacia was ceded to them ; for the Emperor, whose bravery was beyond controversy, with a wise and truly Augustine policy, thought it no disgrace to strengthen the em pire by drawing the frontier line nearer home. The province of Dacia had therefore thenceforward the Danube for its northern boundary, and received an accession of strength by the removal to it of the inhabitants of the northern bank of the river. Northern Dacia ( Wallachia) amply repaid the gift of independence, by interposing a formidable barrier to future barbarian invasions. This war was followed by one waged with equal success against the Alemanni and other cognate tribes. * a.d. 270."], [196, "188 HISTORY OF ROME. Aurelian met their advancing hordes in Vindelicia {Bavaria, and part of Suabia) , vanquished them with great slaughter, and refused to grant them peace. But in the enthusiasm of victory, he thought more of cutting off their retreat than of impeding their ad vance; consequently, they entered Italy, laid waste the neighbourhood of Milan, marched as far as Fanum Fortun\u00e6 (Fano), in Umbria, and spread consternation in Rome itself. As however their forces were scat tered, Aurelian cut them off to a man in three decisive battles at Placentia, Pavia, and Fanum Fortun\u00e6, almost on the very spot where, in the battle ot Metaurus, the Romans had defeated Hasdrubal. An inscription at Pesaro still celebrates these victories.* To Rome, with her distant frontier, walls intended as a defence against her neighbours had long been useless ; the city had expanded far beyond them, and they had fallen into ruin. But now that barbarians were seen in Italy itself, fortifications were again necessary. The Emperor therefore commenced a long line of fortifications, enclosing a space nearly twelve miles in circumference. The work was con tinued by Probus, and completed by Diocletian. Having crushed the barbarian enemies of the empire, the Emperor's next task was to depose those usurpers who still maintained their authority in opposite quarters of the Roman world. In Gaul, Victoria, the mother of Victorinus, had raised first Marius and then Tetricus to the nominal dignity of the purple, whilst she herself, with the title of Augusta, exercised the virtual authority. At her death Tetricus, the con- Gruter Inscr. p. 276."], [197, "HISTORY OF ROME. 189 temptible creature of a licentious army, as he had been the tool of an ambitious woman, called himself Emperor of Gaul, Spain, and Britain. Weary at length of being the slave of those whom he was said to govern, he secretly offered submission to Aurelian, and pretending to meet him in battle, deserted with his partisans, and left the Emperor master of the field. Having thus rid himself of his western rival, he marched eastward against Zenobia, who, since the death of her husband, had firmly and wisely governed Palmyra, with the title of Queen of the East. She invested her three sons with the purple, and the title of Augustus, and like eastern princes wore a diadem. Whether she was content with a titular monarchy subordinate to Rome, or meditated the assertion of independent power, is uncertain, but Aurelian could not brook the appearance of a divided empire. On his march to the east, Aurelian gained another bril- liant victory over the Goths, in which their chieftain fell. On this occasion he took a chariot, drawn by sour stags, which he afterwards introduced in his triumphal procession, and also ten female warriors, who with them had fought in the arms and accoutre- ments of men, like the modern Amazons, in the service of the emperor of China, and the king of Dahomey. Crossing to Byzantium he entered Bithy- nia, which submitted without resistance ; took Tyana, through the treachery of a citizen, whom he put to leath as a traitor, whilst he spared the rest of the inhabitants. Zenobia was awaiting him in great force at Antioch, and gave him battle on the banks of theOrontes, but she"], [198, "190 HISTORY OF ROME. was defeated with great slaughter, and retreated upon Emesa. Antioch opened its gates to the conqueror, who then pushed on to Emesa, where he gained a second battle against seventy thousand Palmyreans. The queen shut herself up in Palmyra, and made imUHPIl OF Al'REI.IAN. vigorous preparations to sustain a siege. Whilst Aurelian was pursuing this victorious career, Probus was equally successful in Egypt, of which, after sustaining a reverse, he succeeded in effecting the reduction. Wearied with the protracted length of the siege, Aurelian wrote to Zenobia, inviting her to capitulate on honourable terms ; but the haughty queen proudly refused, reminding him of the example of Cleopatra, who preferred death to purchasing life by yielding. Famine at length opened the gates of the besieged city, and Zenobia and her suite fled on"], [199, "HISTORY OF ROME. 191 the backs of camels, to seek succour at the Persian court. She had just reached the Euphrates when she was overtaken by a picked squadron of Roman cavalry, and brought back a prisoner of war :\u2014Aure lian demanded how she had the audacity to resist the emperors of Rome. Her reply was marked by tact as much as by courage. \" You I acknowledge really as an emperor, but Gallienus, and such men, I deem unworthy of the name.\" Aurelian plundered the conquered city, but spared the lives of the inhabitants. The soldiers were clamorous for the blood of Zenobia, but even the pitiless Emperor was too manly to wreak his vengeance on a woman. Taste and learning, however, had not power to soften his heart, and the accomplished Longinus fell a victim to his cruelty* The whole of the east submitted to his victorious arms, and even India and China sent ambassadors with pre sents. Sapor, after a reign of thirty years, died this year, and thus Rome was relieved by the hand of death from a formidable enemy. The Palmyreans illrequited the clemency which they had experienced, for they rose upon the Roman garrison, and put them all to the sword. The news reached the Emperor at Antioch; punishment therefore soon overtook the revolters. Men, women, and children were all mas sacred, the city was razed to the ground, and nothing was left to future ages but the ruins of its ancient splendour. His task was not yet accomplished, for Firmius, a wealthy merchant and ship-owner, pro fessing to espouse the cause of Zenobia, had raised * a.d. 273."], [200, "192 HISTORY OF ROME. the standard of revolt in Egypt, and usurped the title of Augustus. This pretender was soon crushed, notwithstanding his boast that he could support an army from his profits on papyrus alone. The victory was the more important, because the valley of the Nile was one of the granaries of Rome. Thus did this resolute and energetic soldier in three short years restore the prestige of the Roman arms. His triumph on his return home was a gorgeous repre- sentation of his exploits. In the train of captives which adorned the procession, every nation which he had conquered had its representatives. The procession itself occupied nine hours in passing. The most dis- tinguished objects were Tetricus, who was a senator, and had been consul; and Zenobia, bound with golden chains, and so loaded with pearls, that she was obliged to stop and rest occasionally. To add to the general joy, large quantities of provisions were dis- tributed to the people, all debts due to the exchequer were forgiven, and criminals guilty of political offences pardoned. As a mark of gratitude for his victories he dedicated a magnificent temple, on the Quirinal hill, to the Sun, of which deity, a Greek authority tells us, his mother was a priestess, and enriched it with pearls and 15,000 pounds weight of gold, the produce of his Oriental spoils. To his imperial rivals he behaved in a generous spirit. Tetricus and his son were permitted to enjoy their rank as Roman patricians ; and an estate was given to Zenobia, at Tivoli, near the palace of Hadrian. In that delightful retreat she lived with her family as a Roman matron, and saw her daughters married into patrician families."], [201, "HISTORY OF ROME. 193 Some of her name and race survived at Rome at the close of the 4th century, and Baronius believed that Zenobius, Bishop of Florence, in the time of Ambrose, may have been one of her descendants. The peace which was the reward of Aurelian's inde fatigable exertions was soon disturbed by civil war.* The moneyers {monetarii), had made considerable profits out of the debased coin, which had been issued regularly in the time of Valerian. Aurelian wisely attempted to restore the legitimate standard ; accord ingly, headed by Felicissimus, the master of the mint {rationalis) they broke out into so violent an insur rection, that in a conflict on the C\u0153lian hill, seven thousand soldiers were slain. The insurrection was quelled, and Aurelian punished the guilty with his usual severity. Some persons of high rank were undoubtedly implicated with the guilty, many who were only suspected suffered, and the best blood of Rome was shed without mercy. A declaration of war by Persia summoned Aurelian from Rome. On what pretext war was declared history does not record ; perhaps Aurelian sought and provoked it, feeling the necessity of constant employment for his lawless army. He had marched as far as Byzantium, when he threatened to punish Mnestheus, a freedman, and his private secretary, for some act of extortion or forgery. The man, to save his life, had recourse to the old artifice of fabricating a paper, in which the names of himself and other officers were set down for capital punishment. A conspiracy was immediately formed, and on the * a. D. 274. K"], [202, "194 HISTORY OF ROME. march, half-way between Byzantium and Heraclea, the Emperor was assassinated.

Accord ingly (strange to say), they sent a deputation to the Senate, requesting them to elect a new Emperor. The reluctant Senate referred the matter back again to the army. Three times at least each in turn declined the responsibility. The throne had been vacant nearly eight months, when the Senate raised to the purple M.

When Tacitus joined the army in Thrace he found that the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, Galatia, and Cilicia, were ravaged by some Gothic tribes, whose settlements were in Colchis, and on the borders of the Palus M\u00e6otis. Part of these invaders he bribed to retire; over the rest he gained a decisive victory, and dispersed them with great slaughter. Notwith standing this success, the anxious consciousness of un fitness for so laborious a life, added to the hardships of a winter's campaign, were fatal to a constitution enfeebled by age; and even if he escaped assassina tion, which is doubtful, it is certain that his spirit was crushed by the factious murmurs of his army.

He was a native of Sirmium in Pannonia, of poor but respectable parentage, and had won his way to dis tinction by his own merits. He began his military life as a youth under Valerian, and after signalising himself in various campaigns, conquered Egypt in the war with Zenobia. His first care was to punish all who had taken part in the murders of Aurelian and Tacitus, whilst with a generous clemency he pardoned his own personal enemies, the partisans of Florian. Since the death of Aurelian,* the Germans had treated Gaul as if they were absolute masters of the country, and Alani, Burgundians, Franks,f Vandals, and Alemanni, spread havoc and desolation over that part of the province which bordered on the Rhine. Probus crossed the Rhine with a powerful army, won battle after battle in rapid succession, cleared the country of the barbarians ; and seventy grateful cities which he restored to independence, laid at his feet crowns of gold. The Vandals he transported to Britain, where a trace of their name is found in that of Wandlesbury, in Cambridgeshire ; as for the rest, he recrossed the Rhine, and carried the horrors of war into their own country, and reduced the terrified Germans to complete submission. To protect the empire against future inroads, he adopted the un availing expedient of building a high and strong stone wall, with towers at intervals, reaching two hundred \u2666 a.

But a fortifica tion too extensive to be garrisoned is no defence at all, and after a few years the wall of Probus was in ruins. From Germany, the active and indefatigable Emperor led his conquering legions to the remote frontiers of the empire, and his success was in all cases owing to his personal influence and courage. He established peace and confidence in Rh\u00e6tia, delivered Illyria from the raids of the Sarmatians, and march ing thence into Thrace, forced the Gothic tribes to submit to his power and to court his friendship.* Directing his course eastward, he cleared the Isaurian mountains of the brigands which infested them, trampled out the dying embers of the rebellion of Firmius, in Egypt, and put to the sword the savage Blemmyes, who were in possession of the Thebaid, and spread terror through the neighbourhood. The defeat of these barbarians alarmed Persia, and Varanes II. humbly sued for peace. This was at first refused, but subsequently accorded. When the Persian ambassadors arrived, the Emperor was seated on the turf, eating his supper, which consisted of parched peas and bacon.

Emperor, he visited him in person, and made all the concessions which he demanded. On his return to Rome, after these glorious and wonderful campaigns, he was welcomed with the triumph which his suc cessful exploits so well deserved, the only triumph which he ever claimed. Whilst engaged with foreign foes, the safety of Probus and the empire was threatened by civil war. JSextus J. Saturninus, a Moor by birth, was one of the cleverest amongst Aurelian's generals. He was at this time general of the army on the eastern frontier, and Aurelian, knowing the fickle levity of the Alexan drians, had expressly forbidden him to visit that city. Notwithstanding that prohibition he went thither, and the inhabitants saluted him Augustus. Thinking that their treason rendered his position no longer safe, he in self-defence assumed the purple. Probus was so fond of him that he would not at first give credit to the news of his revolt, and it was with great reluctance that he signed his death warrant. His death extinguished the rebellion, and restored tranquillity to the East. Another revolt broke out soon after in Gaul, under Proculus and Bonosus.* The former was a Frank, brave, but profligate ; the latter a Briton, of Spanish descent, who had at the request of Aurelius married a Gothic princess, in order that he might discover the secrets of that nation, for he could drink to excess without being intoxicated. This rebellion was soon quelled. Proculus was betrayed by his slaves, and both were executed. Probus was a wise as well as a * A.

As might be expected, this gave offence to the army, who looked for the indulgences of peace to compensate for the labours and fatigues of war. Provoked therefore at being com pelled to drain the marshes of Sirmium, they rushed upon him with their swords. He sought refuge in an observatory which he had erected to survey the works, but it could not protect him from their fury, and he was slain after a glorious and successful reign of six years and four months.* He had deserved and won prosperity, and is entitled on the medals of the time, the Good Emperor, {Bonus Imperator).

The legions, as soon as their fury cooled, repented of their precipitate rage, and elected Carus, the Pr\u00e6 torian prefect, Emperor. He was an upright man and a good soldier, but of a sullen and austere dis position. The warlike reign of Probus had so nulli fied the power of the Senate, that the new Emperor did not think it necessary to ask their sanction, as Probus did, but simply announced his election. He * a.

During eight months the Roman army was returning to Heraclea, in Thrace. Numerian, suffering from weak eyes, tra velled in a close litter, and Aper, taking advantage of this circumstance, assassinated him. The soldiers, whose suspicions were aroused, were clamorous to see him ; Aper put them off with excuses until the smell of the corpse discovered his crime. He was imme diately arrested, and the soldiers elected Diocletian Emperor, who plunged his sword into the traitor's heart. He professed that he had been told some years before, that if he killed a boar {aper) he should be invested with the imperial purple.

Aristobulus, the prime minister of Cams, in his office of Pr\u00e6torian pr\u00e6tor. A war with the Germans and some victories gained by his generals in Britain, which conferred on him the titles of Britannicus and Germanicus, occupied the first year of his reign, the winter of which he passed at Nicomedia, on his way to the East.* He there took as his associate M. Valerianus Maximianus. He was a peasant of Sirmium (born A.D. 250), rude and illiterate, of dauntless courage and pitiless cruelty. The rich and the noble were the principal victims of his hatred, because he envied the high birth of the latter, and coveted the wealth of the former. His brutal violence was at once a foil to the Emperor's gen tleness, and an instrument by which he could gratify his love of cruelty, without forfeiting his character for clemency. The two friends, for they were firm ones, assumed the names of Jovius and Herculius, to typify vigorous strength and profound wisdom. The long-sighted Diocletian saw the tendency there was to the separation of the East from the West. He therefore adopted the expedient of having two centres of government, without actually dismembering the empire. His plan delayed the evil which he foresaw during the continuance of his own reign, f To aid the two Augusti, two C\u00e6sars were appointed by himself as senior Augustus, who were to succeed to the purple. Thus there would be no vacancies and no elections. The two C\u00e6sars whom he appointed were both Illyrians ; Galerius, a herdsman, and there fore surnamed Armentarius, whose character was a * a.d. 286. t a.d. 292."], [215, "HISTORY OF ROME. 207 counterpart of that of Maximian ; and Constantius, a nobleman, whose mother was a niece of Claudius. He was surnamed Chlorus by the Byzantine his torians, but the origin of the name is unknown. His disposition was really distinguished by that gentleness which Diocletian only assumed. In order to unite the C\u00e6sars with the Augusti by the tie of family, both Galerius and Constantius divorced their wives, and married, the former a daughter of Diocletian, the latter a daughter of Maximian. The empire was divided in the following manner : \u2014 Diocletian took the East, including Thrace, Egypt, and Asia, and fixed his capital at Nicomedia. To Maximian he assigned the West, namely, Italy and Africa ; Milan, a city occupying a most favourable position for the purpose, being the chief centre of his jurisdiction. Strange to say, Diocletian did not appreciate the important position of Byzantium as a capital for the East ; and Rome herself, the mother city, was overlooked and forgotten by both Augusti. Galerius presided over the vast provinces of Illyricum ; and Constantius over Gaul, Spain, and Britain, a district which received the name of the Prefecture of the Gauls (Pr\u0153fectura Galliarum). In fact, this dis tribution was the foundation of the four prefectures of the empire. Aurelius Victor asserts that the motive which induced Diocletian to elevate Maximian to the purple, was the state of Gaul. There was a general rising of the peasantry, who, calling themselves Ba gaud\u00e6, laid waste the country. According to an old French tradition, they occupied a fortress on an island in the Mame, at a short distance from Paris, after-"], [216, "HISTORY OF ROME. 208 wards called St. Maur des Fosses, which had been built by Julius C\u00e6sar. The revolt was soon crushed by the energy of Maximian, who was equally successful against the inroad of a mixed horde of barbarians, consisting of Alemanni, Heruli, and Burgundians. The coast of Gaul was also harassed by the piratical descents of the Franks and Saxons, to oppose whom Maximian commissioned Carausius, a native of Me napia {Flanders), who, from his earliest years, had been accustomed to a seafaring life, organize and command a fleet at Gessoriacum {Boulogne).* This man, a pirate from his youth, permitted the marauders to commit depredations, and then attacking them, confiscated their spoil to his own use. His life being thus forfeited, he boldly assumed the title of Augustus, crossed the Channel, and having gained over the legion which garrisoned Britain, made himself absolute master of the island. Although Maximian sent a powerful fleet to arrest him, he maintained his position both in Britain and Boulogne ; and the fear of this sea-king and his piracies extended from the mouth of the Seine to the Straits of Gibraltar, f So formidable did he become, that at length Diocletian abandoned Britain to him on condition of his under- taking its defence, and even recognised his usurped title of Augustus. During six years he retained his sovereignty, at the conclusion of which period the two C\u00e6sars had just received their appointment. Con- * a.d. 287. t a.d. 289."], [217, "HISTORY OF ROME. 209 stantius therefore blockaded the harbour of Boulogne and laid siege to the town. The town surrendered, and the fleet of Carausius was captured, and his assassination by his prime minister Allectus* spared Constantius the trouble of deposing the usurper. During three years the assassin had held his own unopposed, when a Roman armada, under the command of Asclepiodotus, the Pr\u00e6torian prefect, made the Isle of Wight, and concealed by a thick fog, suddenly attacked and conquered the fleet of the enemy. Con stantius simultaneously landed in Kent, where Allectus was encamped ; but the latter, fearing to engage the C\u00e6sar in person, retreated, and meeting with the troops of Asclepiodotus, was defeated and slain. f The same fog which favoured the fleet of the prefect, separated a portion of that of Constantius from the main body, which, entering the mouth of the Thames, sailed up to London, and rescued the city from the auxiliary troops of Allectus, who had marched thither after the defeat, and had intended to plunder the place, and then leave the island. Thus Britain was reunited to the empire after a separation of ten years. The successful braveiy of the C\u00e6sars being suf ficient to ensure the security of the West, the Augusti concentrated their energies upon the wars which endangered the Eastern division of the empire. Mauritania and Egypt were in open rebellion, but the former was speedily reduced by Maximian, and the latter was terrified into submission by the indis criminate massacre J with which the wrath of Diocletian visited the ill-fated city of Alexandria. Rome had * a. D. 293. t a. D. 296. t a. D. 297."], [218, "210 HISTORY OF ROME. now to contend with a still more formidable foe. Diocletian, in open defiance of Persia, had placed Tiridates, the heir of Chosroes, on the throne of Armenia ; but Narses, who was now king of Persia, was too strong for him, and drove him into exile to the court of Diocletian. Rome, as in honour bound, espoused the cause of the deposed princes, and Diocletian took up his position in Antioch, whilst Galerius was summoned from the Danubian provinces. Brave as the former was, he suffered a signal defeat in Mesopotamia, on the same battle-field which had witnessed the mournful slaughter of Crassus and his legions. In the ensuing campaign* he gloriously redeemed his character, for instead of hazarding a pitched battle, he made a night attack upon the Persian camp, and routed the enemy with great slaughter. Narses escaped, severely wounded, but many members of his family were made prisoners. Galerius, with that European chivalry which is unintelligible to Orientals, treated the Persian princesses with the greatest respect and delicacy. The spoil was of enormous value, and Aminianus relates, as a proof of Roman simplicity, that a soldier, having found a bag, of beautifully embroidered leather, full of pearls, kept the bag, but threw away the jewels. Narses was compelled to sue for peace, which was granted on the following terms : \u2014 Five provinces were ceded, including the mountain homes of the free Carduchians, who, like the Swiss in Europe, maintained their independence among the sovereign powers of Asia. The Tigris was made the * A. D. 298."], [219, "HISTORY OF ROME. 211 frontier of the two empires. Tiridates was restored, and it was agreed that the Iberian kings who com manded the passes of the Caucasus, should receive their diadems at the hands of the Emperor of Rome. This peace, so advantageous to Rome, continued forty years, until the close of the reign of Constantine. The repairing and garrisoning the lines of forts on the Rhine, Danube and Euphrates, completed the military life of Diocletian, and the empire was restored to the enjoyment of peace and security. He then, with his colleague, sought the hardly-earned reward of their labours, and in a magnificent triumph visited, for the first and last time, the ancient but now deserted capital of the empire.* On the 23d of February in the same year in which he triumphed, commenced the tenth persecution of the Christians. Lactantius asserts, that he set fire to his palace at Nicomedia, and, like a second Nero, accused the Christians of the crime in order to have a pretext for punishing them. Con stantine, however, who was present, with greater pro bability attributes the conflagration to lightning. During nineteen years the Church had enjoyed the most liberal toleration. Its doctrines were respect fully listened to by Prisca the wife, and Valeria the daughter of Diocletian. The principal officers of the court were .Christians, and the bishops were treated with respect. This court favour increased the number of converts, but, at the same time, corrupted the meek purity of the Church. Prosperity made the Church worldly, bishops became secular, and priests am bitious. The progress of Christianity awoke the * a.d. 303."], [220, "212 HISTORY OF ROME. jealousy of the Pagans. The philosophers ot the day had already, as may be seen by the treatise of Porphyry against the Christians,* taken up the con troversy, and written attacks upon the doctrines of the Gospel. Maximian and Galerius, as is always the case with ignorant and illiterate men, were as superstitious as they were cruel, and notwithstanding the urgent remonstrances of the reluctant Diocletian, prevailed on him to summon a council to debate the question of persecuting the Christians. In that council the violent bearing of Galerius prevailed, and on the festival of the Terminalia^ the noble cathedral of Nicomedia was broken open, the Holy Scriptures burnt, and the church itself razed to the ground. On the next day the imperial edict was published, wdiich enacted that the churches should be destroyed, and the sacred books burnt; all who held secret meetings for religious worship be put to death, and all Christians outlawed and declared incapable of holding any employments. Immediately the edict was posted up, it was torn down by a Christian, who was seized and roasted to death by a slow fire.

It did not reach Syria for fifty days, nor Africa for four months. Even then the magistrates were forbidden to resort to capital punishment; but the refusal of Felix, an African bishop, to deliver up copies of the Scriptures being visited with the punishment of death, this became a precedent, and such refusal was made capital. Some bishops and presbyters escaped martyrdom by giving up the Scriptures, and received in consequence the name of Traditors.

His disease appears now to have become perfect madness ; his apparent gentleness gave place to fury, and he issued fresh edicts enjoining the authorities to search for, imprison, and inflict the severest tortures on all who professed belief in Christ. Immediately after the publication of these edicts, Diocletian, terrified by the menaces of Galerius, rather than persuaded by his arguments, abdicated the empire and prevailed upon Maximian to do the same. \\ The nine years which remained of his life he spent in peaceful retirement, amusing himself with building his magnificent palace, and laying out his gardens. When the ambitious Maximian urged him to re sume the purple, he observed, that if Maximian saw the cabbages which his own hands had raised, * A.D. 1849. t Dec. 19 or 20.

One account states that he died mad, another,* of a long and lingering disease ; and Lactantius affirms that he sought relief in suicide from that melancholy and weariness, which generally attack those who exchange the occupations of an active life for retire ment and solitude. One great weakness in the character of Diocletian was a love of pomp and ceremony. His purple robes were of silk and gold, embroidered with pearls to his very shoes. He compelled those who attended his court to prostrate themselves before him, and to adopt the abject etiquette of Oriental sovereigns. The architectural magnificence with which he adorned Rome, and the * Euseb. Lib.

What was the condition of the ancient metropolis, now deserted by its imperial rulers, there are no means of knowing. In the personal history of the emperors, Rome is forgotten. To fill the vacant dignities of the C\u00e6sars, Galerius, presuming probably on his relationship to Diocletian, and on the mildness of his colleague, nominated Maximinus Daza, his nephew, C\u00e6sar of Syria and Egypt; and Flavius Severus, C\u00e6sar of Italy and Africa.

Galerius had a still more formidable rival in Constantine, the son of Constantius by his divorced wife Helena. This distinguished prince, whose bravery had gained the affections of the legions, and whose wisdom enabled him to profit by it, was likely to be a successful aspirant to the rank of C\u00e6sar. Galerius, therefore, made more than one attempt upon his life. On one occasion he matched him with a lion ; on another he made him engage in single combat with a Sarmatian champion of great strength and bravery. Constantius saw that his son's life was in danger, and urged him to come to him. Constantine ob tained the permission of Galerius with difficulty, and travelling from Nicomedia to Boulogne, night and day, joined his father just as he was on the point of embarking for Britain. The result of this expe dition was an easy victory over the Caledonians. Shortly afterwards Constantius died in the imperial palace at York.* The legions forthwith proclaimed Constantine Augustus, who sent a despatch to Gale rius, informing him that the imperial dignity had been forced upon him by the army. The rage of the Eastern Emperor knew no bounds, but as he dared not refuse his recognition, he gave * July 25, A.D. 306."], [227, "219 HISTORY OF ROME. him the title of C\u00e6sar, aud conferred upon Flavius Severus that of Augustus. Severus thereupon marched for Rome to crush the rebellion of Maxentius and Maximian, but he was obliged to retreat to Ravenna. Deceived by a promise that his life should be spared, he capitulated, but the treacherous Maximian con veyed him to Rome, where he was bled to death.* Constantine accepted the title of Augustus at the hands of Maximian, and married his daughter Fausta as an additional bond of friendship and union. Galerius, determined to avenge the murder of Severus, marched into Italy as far as Narni at the head of a large army, but he could not cope with the tactics of Maximian, and consequently, after in vain attempting a reconciliation, he retreated, but Maxentius could not prevent him from ravaging Italy with fire and sword. As successor to Severus, Galerius appointed C.

Franks and Alemanni, who had taken advantage of the absence of Constantius in Britain to disturb the peace of Gaul. With a cruelty unworthy of a Christian he exposed two of their princes, Ascaric and Gaisus, to the wild beasts during the shows which he exhibited in the amphitheatre of Treves. This act, however, was an exception to his general admi nistration, which was gentle and liberal. But whilst Gaul enjoyed peace and safety under his rule, Italy was crushed and Africa became a desert under the avaricious tyranny of the profligate Maxentius. At Rome large sums were extorted under the name of free gifts from the wealthy patricians. Roman ladies were made victims to his lust, and one, a Christian, could only save her honour by committing suicide. The worst days of the worst emperors returned. His army was as licentious as the Pr\u00e6to rians of old times, and his own life was that of an indolent sensualist. At length the property of the wealthy nobles of Africa, confiscated by the false accusations of delators, failed to supply his prodigality, and he imposed a laud-tax and poll-tax upon the Italians. The spirit of the people was roused to resistance, and they called in the aid of Constantine. Unwilling to plunge the empire in civil war, he at first tried negotiation ; but when this proved fruitless, he listened to the ambassadors of the senate and people of Rome. The army of Maxentius amounted to one hundred and seventy thousand infantry and eighteen thou sand cavalry, but it consisted principally of worn-out veterans and raw recruits. That of Constantine did"], [230, "222 HISTORY OF ROME. not reach one-fourth of that number, but they were efficient troops, and his movements were so rapid and decided that although he could not spare more than forty thousand men from the banks of the Rhine, he at their head crossed the Cottian Alps (M. Cenis) and appeared before the walls of Susa before his adversary was aware of his having left the Rhine. Susa was stormed and taken, and Constantine, marching onward without further impediment, en countered the generals of Maxentius in the neighbour hood of Turin. They trusted principally to their heavy cavalry, who were clad in full armour, but they could not cope with the rapid evolutions of the more lightly equipped troops of Constantine, and, being utterly routed, fled to Turin. That city closed its gates against the fugitives, and they were almost all cut to pieces. Milan and the principal cities of Lombardy submitted to the conqueror. Marching onwards by the \u00c6milian and Flaminian roads, he de feated the cavalry of Rurius Pompeianus near Brescia, and drove them before him to Verona. He then left a division to besiege that city, and with the flower of his troops pushed on to give battle to Pompeianus, who had left Verona, though not until he found that its defence was impracticable. In this engagement, which was fought principally by night, Constantine displayed great gallantry, and exposed his life to imminent peril ; and although the number of the foe was far greater than that of his army, he gained a complete victory, and the brave Pompeianus was stretched upon the bloody field. Meanwhile the sensual Maxentius unwillingly woke"], [231, "223 HISTORY OF ROME. from his dream of false security, and, instead of placing himself at the head of his army, with cowardly superstition consulted the Sibylline books ; they, with the usual caution of oracles, vouchsafed only a dubious and safe answer : \" That on the day of battle the enemy of Rome should perish.\" At length, yielding to the indignant contempt of his subjects, he led his army from the gates of Rome and drew them up in battle array at Saxa Rubra, on a broad plain nine miles from the city, close to the Cremera, already consecrated by the glorious death of the 300 Fabii.

The merciful conqueror did not follow up the victory with the proscription of his partisans, but resisted the popular cry of vengeance and published a general act of amnesty. So rapid had been the advance of Constantine that scarcely two months had elapsed between the capitulation of Verona and his final victory. From this period Constantine may be con sidered as supreme ruler of the Roman empire, for the grateful senate conferred upon him precedence over the two Augusti, Maximin and Licinius. Public games celebrated his conquest, and an arch of triumph perpetuates his fame. This monument affords a sad proof of the decline of Roman genius, for since there was no living sculptor qualified for the task, the arch of Trajan was stripped of its bas-reliefs to decorate that of Constantine. The supremacy of Constantine was the ruin of the Pr\u00e6torians. They were drafted into the legions on the frontiers, and their camp was destroyed ; but whilst a ready instrument of imperial tyranny was thus removed, the ancient capital of the world was thus rendered defenceless, and the way was prepared for its being supplanted by a new imperial city. l3"], [234, "226 HISTORY OF ROME.

In the year preceding his victory over Maxentius, Constantine had embraced Christianity, which he had previously learned to respect from the example CONSTANTINE. of his father. As might be expected, his faith was not unmixed with heathen superstitions, and some of his medals bear the inscription \" Sol invictus,\" and"], [235, "HISTORY OF ROME. 227 other marks of idolatry. The delay likewise of his baptism until the last moments of his existence shows how imperfect was his notion of religion. The exact date of his conversion is uncertain, but it is generally supposed to have taken place just before he crossed the Alps, to commence the war with Maxentius. The following is the account of this event as given by Eusebius. As he marched, a cross of light was seen by him and his army above the mid day sun, with this inscription, In this conquer. A dream which he had the same night interpreted the miracle. Our Lord appeared to him with the same sign, and bid him make a banner bearing a similar device, under which he should lead his armies to victory. This standard, which was termed the Laba rum, was preserved in the royal palace at Constan tinople, where it was to be seen in the ninth century, and a medal is still extant on which its form is"], [236, "228 HISTORY OF ROME. engraved. Having sent for eminent Christian teachers, he professed his belief in the doctrines of the Gospel. The rest of the imperial family followed his example, and amongst them his mother Helena, who though she had given her son a pious education, was as yet ignorant of the true faith. Before the commencement of the war Constantine had betrothed his sister Constantia to Licinius, and less than five months after the death of Maxentius the marriage was solemnized at Milan in the presence of the two Augusti.* But an invasion of the Franks demanded the immediate presence of Constantine on the banks of the Rhine, and Licinius marched simul taneously to oppose a threatened attack from Maxi min. The latter, although his march from Syria took place in the depth of winter, had already reached Byzantium and taken it by siege ; Licinius, however, interrupted his progress eighteen miles from Heraclea, with an army inferior in number to that of his adver sary, and though the fortune of the day was at first against him, he eventually gained a decisive victory.! So rapid was the flight of Maximin that in twenty four hours he arrived at Nicomedia, which was one hundred and sixty miles distant from the field of battle. Still he fled before Licinius until he reached Tarsus, where he took poison and died in excruciating agonies.:): The cruelty with which Licinius followed up his victory was that of a savage barbarian. The un offending children of Maximin, a boy of eight and girl of seven years old, were his first victims. Seve- * March, a.d. 313. + April 30.

Although cemented by a family union, the peace between the emperors of the East West was not of long duration, and the same year,* in which he assembled the council of Aries to restore peace to the church by healing the schism of the Donatists, saw discord arise between Licinius and Constantine. The latter was victorious in two battles, one at Cibalis {Swilei), situated fifty miles from Sirmium, in which, although his numbers were superior, Licinius lost twenty thousand men, the other on the plains of Mardia in Thrace. In both these engagements Con stantine displayed the abilities of a consummate general, and his rival, broken-spirited, sued for peace. The conditions on which it was granted were the surrender of Greece, Illyricum, and Macedonia. His empire, however, still extended over Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. This peace, which lasted nine years, gave Constantine time to dis play his talents as a statesman. His legislative enact ments exhibit an inconsistent mixture of humanity and severity. He abolished the punishment of cruci fixion, forbade the practice of branding criminals in the face, and ordered relief to be given to the poor and destitute who were driven by distress and starvation * a.d. 314."], [238, "230 HISTORY OF ROME. to expose or murder their infant children ; on the other hand, some of his penal laws were so cruel and barbarous that he was himself too tender-hearted to allow them to be carried into execution. Whilst the prevalence of infanticide was owing to the distress and privation caused by the oppressive cruelty and tyrannical extortions of Maxentius, it cannot be doubted that the humane measure by which Con stantine endeavoured to suppress it was due to the influence of Lactantius.* He had just published his \u25a0' Divine Institutes,\" which were dedicated to the Emperor, and in them he had denounced this un natural custom. It is worthy of remark that by one of his edictsf Constantine enjoined the closing of the courts of justice and the cessation of all occupations, except that of agriculture, on the Lord's day. At Rome he extended his protection to the Chris tians, and treated their bishops with kindness and respect, and amongst other churches which he built it is probable that the cathedral of St. Peter, which was pulled down to give place to the present building, may claim Constantine as its founder. The union between Constantine and Licinius was further established by the elevation of his son Licinius, together with Crispus and Constantine, the son of Constantine, to the rank of C\u00e6sars. Crispus was an amiable and brave young man, and distinguished him self by victories over the Franks and Allemauni on the Rhenish frontier. Licinius was an infant of twenty months old. Eight years of peace had passed away, when the Goths, who had recovered their strength and * See Milman's Gibbon, II. 245. t March 7, a.d. 321."], [239, "231 HISTORY OF ROME. spirits, invaded Illyricum.* Constantine, after many severe struggles, drove them over the Danube, and himself crossing by the bridge of Trajan, which he repaired, vanquished them so completely, that they only obtained peace on condition of furnishing a con- BASILICA OF COSSTANTLNE, BOME tingent of forty thousand men, whenever required, to reinforce the armies of Rome. The following years Constantine, confident in his strength, determined to crush his colleague. Licinius, aged as he was, delayed not to meet the danger which threatened. He assembled a vast army in a fortified camp at Hadrianople, and a fleet, such as no Roman emperor had ever possessed since the battle of Actium. a.d. 322. t a.d. 323"], [240, "232 HISTORY OF ROME. floated on the waters of the Hellespont. Constantine encamped at Thessalonica. His army and his fleet were both numerically inferior to those of his foe, but the western legions surpassed those of the East in steadiness and discipline. Constantine, at the head of his legions, forced the passage of the Hebrus, and after performing prodigies of valour, and receiving a slight wound, put the enemy to flight. Thirty-four thousand men were left dead upon the field, and the camp was stormed and taken.* Licinius threw himself into Byzantium. Crispus, who commanded the fleet of Constantine, engaged that of Licinius during a whole day, but owing to the wind being in the same direction as the current, he did not succeed in forcing the passage of the Hellespont. At noon on the second day the wind shifted to the south, and enabled him to gain a complete victory. Constantine then pressed the siege of Byzantium, but Licinius, seeing that resistance was useless, now that his adversary could receive provisions by sea, retreated to Chalcedon. The final battle, which decided the fate of Licinius, was fought with his reserve by Crispus on the heights of Chrysopolis (Scutari). \\ The interval, says Euse bius, between the two engagements was spent by Licinius in superstitiously consulting magicians, by Constantine in prayer. The capture of Byzantium and of Chalcedon immediately followed. With the relics of his army, the vanquished Augustus retired to Nicomedia, and the sister of Constantine came to the conqueror to beg the life of her husband. Her petition was granted. Licinius was received with * A. D. 323, July 3. f Sept. 18."], [241, "HISTORY OF ROME. 233 kindness, and sent to Thessalonica. Not long after he was strangled, either by order of the senate, or because Constantine weakly, if not perfidiously, yielded to the clamours of the soldiery. The young Licinius, an innocent child of eight years old, was also put to death.

By circular letters he urged his subjects to embrace the Gospel ; those municipal towns which were zealous in abolishing paganism received substantial marks of imperial favour, and the new capital to which he transferred the seat of government was Christian from its very foundation, and had never been polluted by the worship of idols. Under the patronage of one whose intimate friends were the philosophic Eusebius and Lactantius, the Christian Cicero, the legions were filled with Christian soldiers, and so numerous Avere the converts, that it has been said that at Rome in one year 12,000 men were baptized, besides women and children. Contemporaneously with the establishment of Christianity, Constantine conceived the idea of trans ferring the seat of empire farther to the eastward.* At first he thought of the broad plain which lies between the sea and the site of ancient Ilium, fasci nated, probably, by the legends which attributed to the royal race of Troja the origin of the Roman patricians. Afterwards he wisely preferred Byzantium as the spot on which to erect the new capital which bears his name. Its position was well chosen on the common confines of the eastern and western world ; equally distant from the extremities of the empire, it was the key of Europe and of Asia. From it, as a central point, the arm of the sovereign could reach, and his councils awe, the Gothic barbarians and the Persian despot. Besides these advantages, it pos- * a.

In order to sanctify SEW CITY OF CONSTANTINE. the choice which his wisdom had made, Constantine attributed it to the commands which he had received from the Deity. Like Rome, Constantinople could boast her seven hills, and the walls enclosed a space of more than three square miles, with a boundary of twelve. With that lavish prodigality which, whilst it had embellished the cities of the empire, and awed the world without by gigantic military establishments"], [244, "236 HISTORY OF ROME. crippled its resources and hastened its fall, Constantine expended two millions and a half sterling on the walls, aqueducts, and arcades. Young men were specially educated as architects, in order that the new city should not suffer from the decline of ancient art, and the cities of Europe and Asia, including Rome itself, were plundered of their best specimens MEDAE OT COLLISEUM. of Greek sculpture. Theatres, aqueducts, arcades, basilicas, churches, palaces, combined to embellish the city of Constantine. The Circus, or Hippodrome, far exceeded in size the gigantic Colliseum,* and was profusely adorned with statues and obelisks. In the centre of the forum was a column of marble and porphyry, 120 feet in height, the ruin of which is now called the Burnt Pillar. On its summit was placed a colossal statue of the emperor as Apollo, with the nails of our blessed Lord's passion substituted for the solar rays around his head.t When the city was * The Colliseum measured externally 1612 feet in circumference ; the Hippodrome was 400 paces long by 100 broad.

The founder of Constantinople introduced also a new form of administration, and new forms of court ceremonial, embodying an etiquette somewhat resem bling that of courts and monarchies in modern times. He substituted a titled nobility for the old patrician class. Each great official had his rank and order of precedence strictly defined. He introduced those forms of address barbarously embodying abstract qualities, to which modern ears are now familiar. The Notitia dignitatum \u2014 a document which belongs to the close of the fourth century \u2014 specifies the title belonging to each dignified office with the minute ness of a court-guide or a peerage. Each, according to his rank, was saluted as \" Your Highness,\" \" Your Eminence,\" \" Your Excellency,\" and so forth. The highest class of state officials were called Blustres, the second Spectabiles, the third Clarissimi or Right Honourable, an appellation which had been ap propriated to senators as early as the age of the Antonines. The Emperor appointed the consuls by his own authority, but their office was now a mere empty shadow, serving to mark the date of the year, as had been customary since the reign of Diocletian. The consulship was still considered a high honour, but only because of the glowing historical recollections connected with the name, or, perhaps, because it was a mark of imperial favour; and its duties were confined to conducting the celebration of the annual games."], [246, "238 HISTORY OF ROME. The patrician rank was conferred for life only on the old favourites at court. Four Pr\u00e6torian Prefects divided the empire amongst them as Viceroys of the Emperor, their provinces being arranged according to the policy introduced by Diocletian. The office of Prefect of Rome, which had been created by Augustus, was retained, and another similar office instituted at the new capital. These municipal Prefects were equal in rank with the Pr\u00e6 torian Prefects, and, like mayors, had the supreme authority, judicial and municipal. The empire was divided into thirteen dioceses. Of these the principal one was under the jurisdiction of the Count {Comes) of the East ; that of Egypt was presided over by the Augustal Prefect, and the rest by eleven vicars. The dioceses were again subdivided into 116 provinces, each administered by its own governor. The army was commanded by two masters-general, one for the cavalry, the other for the infantry. This number was subsequently quadrupled. Under these were thirty five general officers {duces), of whom ten had the title of Counts (comites) i. e. companions of the Emperor. The principal part of the troops being employed in the defence of the frontier, were called Borderers ; the rest formed a privileged corps called Palatines, or guards of the court, with higher pay and easier duties. This impolitic distinction was, as might be expected, fatal to discipline. The privileged troops became self-indulgent and luxurious ; the others felt them selves undeservedly degraded, and jealousy and dis content undermined their loyalty and patriotism. As to the military force itself, although the legion was"], [247, "239 HISTORY OF ROME. reduced to a number little greater than that of our own regiments, the standing army amounted to no fewer than six hundred and forty-five thousand men. Besides the great ministers of state, which have been already mentioned, there were seven who enjoyed the rank and title of illustrious, who were members of the im perial household. They performed the functions of lords of the bedchamber, chancellor, treasurer, and colonels of the household troops. To these were added a large body of secret police, who exercised so complete a system of espionage over every portion of the empire, that none were safe whose wealth or rank rendered them profitable victims. Nor were the poor and lowly free from the evils resulting from this multiplication of placemen. They were main tained at an enormous cost, and this expenditure was supplied by oppressive taxation. To the indirect sources of revenue which already existed in the shape of customs and duties, were added a land-tax and poll-tax, and even the former of these was levied in the obnoxious form of the latter, which has always been characteristic of tyranny and abso lutism. Both were called capitatio. Every fifteen years, which period was termed an indiction* a valua tion was made of the whole landed property of the empire, and the total divided into so many equal portions or capita. The number of capita which each proprietor was bound to pay was then assessed ac cording to the value of his property, and a correct \u00bb In the twelfth century the Papal Government adopted the indiction as a chronological period, and carried back this manner of dating to a.d. 1."], [248, "240 HISTORY OF ROME. return was ensured by laws more severe and inquisi torial than those by which the income-tax is protected in the present day. This was a landlord's tax. The poll-tax was imposed upon those who had no land, exceptions were gradually introduced, and at last the burden of this tax fell entirely upon the coloni and agricultural labourers. Some idea may be formed of the oppressive nature of the capitation tax, from the fact that the amount assessed in Gaul averaged twenty-five aurei per head, and was no less than seven even when reduced by Julian. Taking the population of the united king dom at twenty -five millions, and the average annual revenue at sixty millions, the taxation per head would amount to two pounds eight shillings sterling, whilst that of Gaul in the time of Constantine amounted to no less than thirteen pounds fifteen shillings.* Little remains to be told of the fourteen peaceful years which concluded the long reign of Constantine, and that little dims the glory of his former life. The illustrious Crispus, his eldest son, who had acquired universal esteem, became the object of his father's jealousy. Not content with conferring on his younger son Constantius the title of C\u00e6sar, together with the government of Gaul, which Crispus had administered with success since the age of seventeen, he listened to * The Roman pound = 5,040 grains Troy ; and the number of aurei coined out of a pound varied from 40 to 48 under the early Roman emperors. Constantine coined 72 aurei out of a pound of gold. The value, therefore, of the aureus in terms of the English sovereign, in his reign, would be nearly 12s. 6d. But as 5 aurei = one Roman pound of silver = about -jj of an English pound Troy, the value of the aureus reduced to a silver standard would = about Hi."], [249, "HISTORY OF ROME. 241 the calumnies of delators, who accused the friends of Crispus of treason.* On the twentieth anniversary of his accession, which was solemnized at Rome,f he ordered the innocent prince to be arrested, condemned without a trial, and sent into exile to Pola, and finally put to death by poison. The year before this parricidal act was committed, he had celebrated the same event with great pomp| at Nicomedia, had received the bishops of the Church, over whom he had just presided at the Council of Nice, with splendid hospitality at his palace, and had made a display of his charity by distributing alms to the poor, and large supplies of corn to the widows, virgins, and ecclesiastics. So little did the first Christian Emperor comprehend the moral prin ciples of the Gospel, \u2014 justice, mercy, and truth. In the obscurity and partiality of history, it is im possible to arrive at the truth, but it is probable that Constantine's jealousy of his son was excited by the Empress Fausta, and that she herself, not long after, was accused of adultery, and was either suffocated in a vapour bath, or contrived, though condemned, to escape her cruel doom. The suspicious fears of the Emperor then vented themselves upon many of his courtiers and supposed friends, whom he caused to be put to death. Besides investing his three sons by Fausta with the title of C\u00e6sar, he conferred the same dignity on his nephew Dalmatius, and distinguished his other nephew, Hannibalianus, with the title of most noble (nobilissimus). Thus there were five heirs to the * a.d. 325. t a.d. 326. X July 25. M"], [250, "242 HISTORY OF ROME. throne of Constantine. Great pains were taken to fit them by education for their high functions ; and whilst they were still youths, the Emperor divided his dominions amongst them. It is not quite clear what motives suggested the policy of associating his nephews with his sons as co-heirs to the imperial purple. Perhaps he hoped that if discord should arise between his sons, the influence of the cousins would give such a pre ponderating strength to the interest they espoused, as to prevent the evils of an unnatural civil war. But whatever his expectations were, they were unfortunately never realized. The only war which disturbed the close of the reign of this prosperous monarch was one in which he aided the Sarmatians against the Goths. The Sarmatians, from whom are descended the Sclavo nians of more modern times, were originally a nomad race, who lived in tilted waggons, and overspread the wide steppes between the Volga and the Vistula. In the first century of the Christian era, a tribe of them \u2014 probably the same with the Jasyg\u00e6 \u2014 esta blished themselves in Hungary on the banks of the Tibiscus (Teyss). Unable to withstand the aggres sion of the Goths, they besought the aid of Con stantine against their powerful foes. He had scarcely espoused their cause, when Araric, the Gothic king, crossed the Danube, and laid waste M\u0153sia. But Constantine, putting himself at the head of his legions, cleared the province of its barbarian invaders, and drove them back across the river.* The Sar- * a.d. 332."], [251, "HISTORY OF ROME. 243 matians, when their perils were removed, proved ungrateful, and Constantine withdrew his protection. But they had soon reason to repent of their folly, for the warlike Geboric, who was now king of the Goths, conquered them in a pitched battle with great slaughter. In their despair they entrusted their slaves with arms, who, conscious of their strength, rose against their former masters, and succeeded in driving them out of the country. The exiles threw themselves upon the mercy of Constantine, and obtained from him settlements in Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Italy.* Perfect peace now reigned throughout the Roman world, and the Emperor lived three years to enjoy it. In the sixty-fourth year of his age, and the thirty first of his reign, he expired at a palace in the environs of Nicomedia.f The corpse was removed to Constantinople, which had been completed ten years before, where it lay in state, adorned with the royal robes and diadems, and was then buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles. The character of this remarkable man is marked with lamentable inconsistency. To chivalrous courage he added the quick perceptions of a skilful general ; and mental powers of the highest order were rendered useful to his subjects by unwearied application and devotion to business. Without being a learned man, he was a munificent patron of arts and learning. His strong will, fearless spirit, and honest disregard of popular opinion, enabled him to overcome every difficulty. His morals were pure, his manners cour- * a. D. 334. + May 22, a. d. 337. M 2"], [252, "244 HISTORY OF ROME. teous. His noble figure and dignified bearing well became the exalted station which he was called upon to fill. Such was Constantine during the struggles of his early career: but he was spoilt by prosperity. His taste for splendour could only be satisfied by the most profuse expenditure ; and this could only be supplied by oppressive exactions from his people. Jealous of contradiction, he became cruel and arbitrary, and maintained submission to his will by a reign of terror and bloody executions. His manners were degraded by a love of vain pomp and effeminate ostentation. He wore false hair of different colours ; and his robes were richly set with gems, and embroidered with devices in silk and gold. Constantine, like Hadrian, degenerated in his latter years. He had all the natural qualifications for a hero, but wanted strength of character and calmness of temper to stand the test of wielding absolute power. His Christianity was of a very questionable kind, mixed up with a number of heathen super- stitions. He deferred his baptism till the last moment of his life, as though he thought the religion of Christ exercised a magical effect by spells and charms, instead of a moral and spiritual power. His notion of it was something resembling that of our own Anglo-Saxon Ethelbert, who would not hear the preaching of Augustine under the shelter of a roof, for fear he should be brought under the' influence of some supernatural agency."], [253, "HISTORY OF ROME. 245 CHAPTER XII.

The division of the empire which Constantine made before his death, was as follows : \u2014 On Constantine he conferred the prefecture of Gaul, on Constantius that of the East, and on Constans that of Italy and Illyricum. To his nephew Hannibalianus he gave the title of King of Pontus. The army, however, would have no successor to Constantine except his three sons, and the Senate, obedient to its will, pro claimed them Emperors and Augusti. This step was followed immediately by a military insurrection at Constantinople, and a general massacre of the brothers and nephews of the deceased emperor, together with his chief friends and ministers.* Constantius has been accused by some of instigating, or at least conniving at, these wholesale murders; but the obscurity of * a. d. 337."], [254, "246 HISTORY OF ROME. history renders it impossible to determine how far he was guilty. A Persian war, which had threatened the conclusion of the reign of Constantine, broke out immediately CONSTANTIUS, after his death. Sapor, after laying waste Mesopotamia, besieged Nisibis during two months; Constantius therefore hastened to the East to oppose him, and compelled him to retire.* A second and a third time this strong city successfully sustained sieges of eighty and one hundred days' duration ; on the last occasion, St. James, the brave Bishop of Edessa, like Walker at the siege of Derry, supported by his example and his harangues the spirits of the garrison. Sapor, de spairing of success, dammed up the river Mygdonius, and thus raised the water almost to a level with the ramparts. On its surface, vessels carrying engines assailed the walls, and at length a breach was made ; but the flood, swelled by the melting snow, drowned the heavy cavalry, whilst the terrified elephants increased the confusion ; the attack, therefore, could not be followed up, and during the night the per- * A.

Still, the ill fated city must have fallen, had not Sapor received intelligence that his frontier was invaded by the Massaget\u00e6, and he was therefore compelled to raise the siege. Notwithstanding this first success, the war, which lasted twenty-four years, was eminently disastrous. Constantius celebrated his return from one campaign with a triumph ; * but this fact affords no proof of victory, for he sometimes claimed this empty honour even when he had suffered defeat. In nine battles the legions, demoralized by Asiatic service, left the field worsted, or without gaining any advan tage over the enemy. At an engagement fought on the plain of Hilleh, near the small town of Singara, in Mesopotamia, Constantius commanded in person. f At the first charge the Persians were put to flight, and the Romans, eagerly pursuing, stormed and took their camp. But whilst the victors were engaged in plunder and revelry, the Persian archers pom-ed down upon them from the neighbouring heights, and the Romans were routed with great slaughter. The exasperated legions savagely avenged their defeat by putting to death with inhuman tortures the son and heir of Sapor, who had fallen into their hands. In a.d. 358, a negotiation was opened between the Romans and the Persian monarch ; but the demands of Sapor were so haughty, that although Constantius, fully occupied with the barbarians on the Danube, was anxious for peace, his ambassadors met with no success. t a.

This strongly fortified city had a well- supplied arsenal, and its garrison was reinforced with seven legions. The siege was pressed with vigour, and the attacks of the Persians repulsed in several sorties with equal gallantry. At length a deserter betrayed to Sapor some hidden steps which ascended the face of a rock overhanging the Tigris, and the city was taken.* The inhabitants, without distinction of sex or age, were cruelly massacred. In this siege, Sapor is said to have lost thirty thousand of his veteran troops ; but he was still strong enough to capture the two cities of Singara and Bezabde, the former of which he dismantled, the latter he garrisoned with veteran troops. Five Roman legions were made prisoners and sent into captivity. So disastrous were the results of this war to the European invaders of Asia. Nor does it form an exception to the universal testimony of history. Distant expeditions, unless the communication is complete with the country of the invaders, have always been failures, from that of Darius Hystaspes to the Russian campaign of Napoleon. Whilst foreign war was raging in the East, the empire was rent by civil discord. Unnatural strife broke out between the imperial brothers.f Constantine II. demanded of Constans the surrender of Africa, as an equivalent for the provinces of Dalmatia and Illyricum, belonging to the dominions of the latter ; on his refusal, he invaded his brother's province, and being treacherously led into an ambush, was slain. * a. d. 360. f a. d. 340."], [257, "249 HISTORY OF ROME. His subjects, forthwith, swore allegiance to the con queror. Constans was proud and feeble, and his fondness for his German minions rendered him, like our own Edward, still more odious. Magnentius, a CONSTANS. barbarian soldier, who, though he was so ignorant and illiterate that he could neither read nor write, had risen to the rank of a general officer, organized a conspiracy against him, and being furnished with funds by Marcellinus, the Count of the sacred largesses (Lord High Treasurer), seized the city of Autun, where the Count resided, and assumed the purple. Constans fled, but was overtaken at the foot of the Pyrenees and slain.* Italy as well as Gaul joined the usurper, and Vetranio, an old general, though at first loyal, brought over the Illyrian troops to the side of the rebels. Constantina, the daughter of Constantine the Great, placed the imperial diadem with her own hands on the head of her brother's murderer. The news of this revolution reached Constantius in the East, and caused his immediate return. At Heraclea he was met by ambassadors of a.d. 350.

By an artful appearance of kindness he persuaded the simple-minded Vetranio to desert his ally, and pro mised to make him his colleague in the empire. A grand meeting of the united armies was held in the plains of Sardica; and, on a raised tribunal, Constantius and Vetranio took their seats, surrounded by the armed multitude, prepared to listen with silent attention. Constantius commenced speaking, and in a skilful and eloquent harangue claimed the sole succession ; the army echoed his words, and Vetranio, alarmed, laid his diadem at the feet of Constantius. He with courtesy raised him from the ground, and assigned him the city of Prusa as a residence, where he ended his days in peace. 1IAGNEMTIUB. Meanwhile, Magnentius, at the head of a large army, marched into the fertile plains of Sclavonia and Lower Hungary* At first his arms were suc- * a. d. 351."], [259, "HISTORY OF ROME. 251 cessful, and Constantius, losing heart, sued for peace. Magnentius insolently refused, and encountered Con stantius in the neighbourhood of Mursa {Essek), which was situated on the river Drave. Constantius harangued his soldiers, and then left his generals to fight the battle.* He passed the day in a church in prayer with Valens, the Arian Bishop of Mursa. His army attacked that of Magnentius in flank, and although the field was hotly contested, by night the troops of Magnentius were broken and routed. Fifty -four thousand were left dead upon the field, of which thirty thousand belonged to the army of the conquerors. Magnentius fled to Aquileia, but he found no support or sympathy, the army and all the cities of Italy declared in favour of the son of Con stantine, and with the small remnant of his force which remained faithful, the usurper crossed the Alps into Gaul. It was now the turn of Constantius to refuse peace. His foe made his last vain struggle at Mons Seleuci, in the Cottian Alps (probably M. SaUon, twenty-four miles from Gap), and then threw himself on his sword. The civil war was thus ended, and Constantius became sole master of the Roman world. The feeble are generally cruel, and Con stantius showed no mercy. He had married Eusebia, a noble lady of Thes salonica, but by her he had no issue.

In the course of a few years they were removed from Constantinople to Macellum, a fortified palace of the old Cappadocian kings near C\u00e6sarea ; there they received a careful education, and when Gallus had attained the age of twenty-six, Constantius conferred upon him the prefecture of the East, the title of C\u00e6sar, and the hand of the princess Constan tina.* The disposition of Gallus, naturally harsh, was soured by seclusion, and rendered despotic and tyrannical by his life having been passed amongst slaves. The violence of his temper was still further embittered by the conduct of his wife, who was a perfect fury. His wretched Eastern subjects were crushed beneath his reign of terror. At length, ru mours of murder and torture reached Constantius, and he sent two commissioners to inquire into his administration. Gallus called upon his officers and the people of Antioch, where he held his court, to protect their prince ; and they took him at his word, as the assas sins of Becket did King Henry ; \u2014 slew the commis sioners, and threw their mangled corpses into the Orontes. This was a deed not to be forgiven ; but the wily Constantius dissembled his wrath, and in vited his cousin to Constantinople. Notwithstanding indications on his route of approaching disgrace, he reached Hadrianople. There he was deprived of his guards, and ordered to proceed to Milan with a small retinue. Hitherto he had been treated with the re spect due to his imperial rank, but the mask was now \u2666 a.d, 351."], [261, "253 HISTORY OF ROME. thrown off; he was arrested, and in the gloomy prison of Pola in Istria, already stained by the blood of Crispus, was beheaded. It is said by some that Constantius, as soon as he had signed the death warrant, sent an express to recall it ; but the eunuchs of the palace, who, at first the creatures of this weak prince and the instruments of his despotism, had now become his masters, detained the courier, and the sentence was executed. Julian, unlike his stupid and cruel brother, had profited by the education which he had received ; his taste was refined, he was a devoted admirer of the language and literature of Greece. He loved the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. In fact, he was much more of a Greek than a Roman. Since he left Macellum he had been permitted to reside in Ionia. He was now brought to Milan, where his life was only saved by the friendship and protection of the Empress Eusebia. Owing to her influence, the Emperor re ceived him kindly, and fixed his residence at Athens.* There he led the life so congenial to his taste, and it was his ardent love for his Alma Mater, and her learning, her genius, and her philosophy, that led to his adoption of her religion, and procured for him his well-known designation \u2014 Julian the Apostate {TlapaBarnt;.) It must not, however, be supposed that the pagan ism of Julian was identical with the nature-worship of ancient Greece. His philosophic mind did not descend from the spirituality of Christianity to the idolatry of heathenism. He did not believe, as if they * a.d. 355."], [262, "254 HISTORY OF ROME. were real truths, in the mythology of Homer or the theology of Hesiod. He did not place Jove's court upon the summit of Olympus, or people heaven and earth, and the sea, and the regions under the earth, with deities. He wished to restore paganism as the external machinery of popular belief, and considered that belief itself as an allegorical representation of real truths. His system, under the outward form of Greek religion, was a heterogeneous mixture of Gnos- ticism, Platonism, and even, in a slight degree, of Christianity itself. In this consisted the utter folly and absurdity of his attempt to force an effete super- stition upon an unwilling world. The time of pagan- ism had gone \u2014 the outward forms and dogmas had ceased to have a hold upon the hearts and minds of the masses, the inner philosophy was suited only to the few members of the Emperor's own sect and school ; whilst the Gospel, though not as yet uni- versally embraced, was too deeply rooted to be torn up by violence, and addressed itself to the wants, the hopes, the sympathies of mankind. The policy of Constantius had ruined Gaul. To avenge himself upon the provincials for their support of his rival, he had invited the Franks and Alemanni to invade the province, and had promised them the possession of all that they could conquer. These bar barians laid waste the country with fire and sword. Forty-five of the principal cities were pillaged and burnt, including Cologne, Mayence, Worms, Spires, Treves, and Strasburg. Both banks of the Rhine, throughout its whole length, were in the hands of these marauders, and the whole country to the west-"], [263, "HISTORY OF ROME. 255 ward had become a waste desert. Constantius felt that his own presence was necessary in the East ; he therefore listened to the advice of Eusebia, and re called Julian in order to entrust him with the task of recovering Gaul.* With grief he left his beloved Athens for the court of Milan, and exchanged the academic gown for the habiliments of a general. He received the hand of Helena, the sister of Con stantius, a princess much older than himself; and on his twenty-fifth birthday, the Emperor, in solemn state, presented him to the army as C\u00e6sar of the West, and assigned to him the command of the armies in Gaul. Julian keenly felt the perils of his exalted position. He expressed his fears in the words of Homer : \u2014 EXXa/3e noptpvpfoc Oavaros Ka\\ poipa Kparairs' \u2014 (\" Blood-red death and resistless fate have seized me as their victim : \") and, conscious of his awkwardness in military exercises, exclaimed, \" Oh, Plato, what a task for a philosopher ! \" Still he earnestly devoted himself to his duty, and discharged it well. He in ured himself to hardship by denying himself almost the necessaries of life, and submitting himself to the strictest discipline; and studied the art of war under Sallust, a distinguished officer, who was after wards Prefect of Gaul. He found the soldiers de moralized and dispirited, but he restored discipline, and taught them to respect themselves. The forces placed at his disposal were inadequate to perform the work thoroughly and decisively, and to drive the \u00bb a.d. 355."], [264, "256 HISTORY OF ROME. Franks across the Rhine ; but, notwithstanding all difficulties, his energy and abilities were followed by marvellous results. The pains which the studious scholar and philo sopher had taken to acquire the qualifications of a general, were rewarded with success. The head quarters of the legions in Gaul, was Rheims. Thither therefore he repaired, and marched at their head against the Alemanni. They, by an unexpected attack upon the rear of the Romans, cut to pieces two legions ; but Julian, in a second battle, fought at Brocomagus {Brumai), near Strasburg, routed the barbarians, and put them to flight.* Court intrigue, and the jealousy\" of the eunuchs, put impediments in his way, which he overcame by his firmness and prudence. In the ensuing campaign, thirty -five thousand Alemanni, led by a warlike prince named Chnodoman, crossed the Rhine, and gave Julian battle a second time near Strasburg.\")\" The Romans were only thirteen thousand strong ; but their victory was sanguinary and decisive. Their loss did not exceed two hundred and forty-three, whilst six thou sand of the barbarians fell, and Chnodoman himself was made prisoner. The conqueror next determined upon the subjugation of the Franks. He lined the whole bank of the river with troops, from the mouth up to Cologne, and reduced the Franks to the neces sity of suing for peace ; obliging them to furnish a contingent to the armies of Rome, and to acknowledge the supremacy of the Emperor. In three successful expeditions across the Rhine, he completely humbled * a.d. 356. f a.d. 357."], [265, "HISTORY OF ROME. 257 the pride of the Alemanni, and compelled them to supply and convey the materials for building a chain of forts along the bank of the river, as a defence against future invasions. Having brought the war to a glorious termination, Julian betook himself to the more congenial task of civil government. Impartial in the administration of justice, and scrupulously exact in weighing evi dence, he eschewed all undue severity. \" Who,\" said the prosecutor of an extortionate governor, \" will ever be found guilty if it be held sufficient to deny the crime ?\" \" But who,\" replied the C\u00e6sar, \" will ever be acquitted if it is sufficient to affirm it?\" His govern ment of Gaul was patriotic and humane. He rebuilt the cities which the barbarians had destroyed, and fed the famine-stricken peasantry with cargoes of corn imported from Britain. When an order for an extra indiction arrived from Milan, he indignantly refused to authorize the imposition of this tax on his half-ruined and impoverished subjects. Under his sway commerce revived, and the neglected fields yielded a bounteous return to the labours of the husbandman ; and Paris, which he calls his dear Leucetia {ttjv (f>l\\vv AevKerlav), no longer confined to the narrow island of the Seine, began to extend itself to the opposite southern bank, and soon could boast of baths built after the model of those of Diocletian, a palace, an aqueduct, a Campus Martius, and an amphitheatre. The successes of Julian added fresh fuel to the jealousy of Constantius, and gave occasion to fresh intrigues at his court. In vain, in the laurelled despatches forwarded to the provinces, he himself"], [266, "258 HISTORY OF ROME. claimed the credit of Julian's victories ; no one would believe him. At length envy gave birth to alarm, and he withdrew four legions from the army of Julian, besides three hundred picked men from each legion which remained, and ordered them to march to Persia. Julian foresaw the evil consequences of this impolitic reduction of his strength. The troops themselves were attached to Julian, had formed con nexions in the country to which they had been habituated, and hated the idea of service in the East. Jtdian was perplexed; he could not decide whether to obey the Emperor or listen to the wishes of his soldiers to remain. At length he determined upon obedience. The troops destined for the East were first grieved and then angry. The humane measures which he took to soften the hardships of the long march, and to transport in comfort their wives and children, made him more popular than ever. In vain he urged upon them the duty of obedience. Carried away by the violence of their passions, they rushed to the palace, and proclaimed Julian Augustus. Whether the high dignity was forced upon him by threats and violence, in spite of sincere entreaties and repeated refusals, or whether the leaders of the revolt saw a secret inclination lurking beneath this outward show of resistance, it is impossible to say. Though a student, Julian was ambitious and fond of show; and though a philosopher, the history of his religious feelings prove him to have been superstitious and cre dulous. He may therefore have deceived himself into listening to the calls of ambition much earlier than he even permitted himself to believe. His first act"], [267, "259 HISTORY OF ROME. was to write to Constantius, requesting that his title as Augustus might be confirmed. Constantius, how ever, very imprudently rejected his proposal with indignation. JuUan then determined upon war, and simultane ously apostatized publicly from the Christian faith. He had been educated as a Christian, and had even been admitted into the ecclesiastical order of readers. He himself confesses in one of his letters that he was a believer until his twentieth year, and until his quarrel with Constantius he had concealed his pagan ism. But a few weeks before he had celebrated the Epiphany, or as some say, the Nativity ; he now in the presence of the army solemnly committed his cause into the hands of the immortal gods. He assembled his forces at Basle, and despatched them in two divisions and by two different routes into Illyricum ; and he himself, at the head of a chosen body of three thousand volunteers, marched through the Black Forest to the Danube. So rapid was his voyage down that river, that in eleven days he landed at Bononia, near Sirmich, after accomplishing a distance of seven hundred miles. Amidst universal demonstrations of joy, he took possession of Sirmich ; and the whole of Illyricum, Macedonia, and Greece readily submitted to him. The only opposition he met with was from two legions, who threw themselves into Aquileia, and defended it with such vigour that he could not force them to surrender until two months after the death of Constantius. This event saved the empire from a civil war. He was at Antioch when the news of Julian's advance"], [268, "260 HISTORY OF ROME. reached him, and without a moment's delay hastened to meet him. But excitement and fatigue brought on fever, and this feeble and cruel prince died near Tarsus, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fourth of his reign* In his last moments he declared Julian his successor. The new Emperor entered Constantinople in triumph, and followed the corpse of Constantius to its last resting-place in the Church of the Holy Apostles. In faith Constantius was an Arian, and having, like Constantine, delayed his baptism till his last moments, he received that rite just before he expired at the hands of Euzonius, the Arian Bishop of Antioch. This religious party, encouraged by imperial pa tronage, persecuted during his reign the orthodox Christians, and banished the great Athanasius from Alexandria.\"! Few men have exercised a greater in fluence over the feelings and sentiments of the masses than this strong-minded and stout-hearted prelate. In this reign was held the Council of Arminium (Rimini), the decrees of which were Arian, and directly opposed to those of the celebrated Council of Nic\u00e6a. * A. D. Nov. 3, 361. t a.

The picture which the Chris tian Fathers draw of his court is totally inconsistent with the purity of his moral character, his simple, thoughtful, and contemplative habits, and his self denial, which amounted almost to asceticism. St. Chrysostom describes the court of Julian as the resort of impostors and charlatans, pretenders to magic, and the most infamous and licentious of both sexes. Gregory of Nazianzum adds that he would associate and divert himself publicly with women of abandoned character, and tradition even accuses him of murdering women and children for the purposes of necromancy and divination."], [270, "262 HISTORY OF ROME. The great sin of Julian was his apostasy; but whilst we condemn the sin, we cannot but pity the sinner. Christianity was presented to him in its least inviting aspect. In his eyes it was connected with the meanness and cruelty of Constantius and the corruptions of his venal court. He could not but see the bitter and uncharitable enmity which animated the great leaders of the opposite parties in the Church. The inconsistency between the doctrines and practices of Christianity was to him a difficulty, as it has been to many heathens in more modern times. His en thusiastic attachment to Greek literature and philo sophy enlisted him in favour of their religion, and the fanaticism of the Neoplatonists, to which school his philosophical instructors belonged, first imposed upon themselves and amalgamated Oriental magic with the rites of the ancient mysteries, next fascinated their pupil. Julian was a philosopher, and the philosophy of his times made him a fanatic. His foolish attempt to revive paganism was the parent of wickedness, of crime; and in his anxiety to accomplish an impossibility, the wisdom displayed in the rest of his policy gave place to fraud, and his gentleness and liberality to bigotry and cruelty. He was not content with attacking the evidences of Christianity with his pen, the reopening all heathen temples, the proclaiming universal religious tolera tion, and erasing the monogram of our Lord's name from the Labarum, but he closed the Christian schools, ironically declaring that if they rejected the faith of the heathen, they were unworthy of their literature and learning. He excluded Christians from all public"], [271, "263 HISTORY OF ROME. employments. These civil disabilities constitute as bitter persecutions as the most cruel bodily tortures. But besides this, Julian, although his clement dispo sition was averse to cruelty, must be held responsible for the excesses of his ministers and his heathen subjects. By his fanaticism their unholy zeal was inflamed, and blazed forth in remorseless persecu tion. The Christians of Syria were tortured and slain, having fallen victims to popular fury. When his edicts enforced the restoration of heathen temples which had been desecrated during Christian reigns, on the repayment of their value, the authorities, in their zeal to execute the imperial commands, in humanly punished those who were unable to pay. On these grounds they arrested Mark, the Arian Bishop of Arethusa {Bestan), cruelly scourged him, smeared him with honey, and exposed him to be tor mented with insects beneath the burning rays of an eastern sun. Nor can Julian himself be held exempt from the charge of tyranny and oppression towards the professors of the Christian faith ; for by his own decree he unjustly exiled the great primate of Egypt, Athanasius, and compelled him, for the fourth time in his eventful life, to retire from his see to the solitudes of the desert. In the discharge of public business Julian was in defatigable. The shortest possible time was given to sleep, and to his frugal meals. He appeared at the games in the circus only as long as etiquette abso lutely required, and when occupied in business his powers of application were unequalled. Like C\u00e6sar, he could write, listen, and dictate at one and the"], [272, "264 HISTORY OF ROME. same time. His first care after his accession was to reform the abuses of the court. He dismissed at once the thousand cooks, and butlers, and barbers, the swarms of table-deckers and the eunuchs, (who were as numerous as the flies which hover over a flock of sheep in spring,) with their costly robes and luxurious tables, and splendid lodgings, and fees, and perquisites. He wore no jewelled robes of state, and the imperial table no longer groaned beneath recherche dainties procured at any cost, whether in season or out of season. It is said that he carried his contempt of personal appearance to a culpable excess, that his hands were unwashed, his nails uncut, and that his philosophic beard was haunted by the usual accompa niments of want of cleanliness. From the reformation of abuses he proceeded to the punishment of their corrupt authors. The false favourites of his predecessor were brought to trial before six commissioners, who sat at Chalcedon, two civil and four military. The latter being the majority, invested this tribunal with the severe character of martial law rather than the calm impartiality of a court of justice. The guilty were put to death, but many innocent persons suffered with them. Still Julian was too magnanimous for the jealous suspicions of a tyrant. A native of Ancyra had purchased a cloak of imperial purple. This was reported to Julian as a treasonable act. Instead of taking serious notice of it, he sent him a pair of purple slippers to match his dress. Even when a real conspiracy was discovered, which had been organized by ten of the household troops, instead of punishing the conspira-"], [273, "HISTORY OF ROME. 265 tors with death, he contented himself with the exile of the two principal ringleaders. Besides the extensive reforms which he made, he was so active as a legislator, that fifty-four of his laws were admitted into the codes of Theodosius and Justinian, and he himself often assisted the prefects in the administration of justice with the greatest acuteness and wisdom. Marvellous to say, such was his energy and industry, that all this was accomplished in the short space of sixteen months, the period which elapsed previous to his setting out for his Eastern campaign.* Upon the death of Constantius, Sapor had made overtures for peace, which Julian rejected with indignation. Eight months after that event, he marched to the licentious and effeminate city of An tioch, where he wintered. He found the lively and satirical inhabitants of the Syrian capital wholly ab sorbed in pleasure and amusement ; everything serious was laughed at ; all that was pure and holy was treated with irreverent contempt. Libanius, the heathen sophist, and Chrysostom, the Christian father, alike coincide in giving this picture of this frivolous and luxurious people. The Christian community of Antioch was, moreover, rent to pieces by the most violent religious party spirit. The city in which the believers in the Gospel were first called by the distinctive appellation of Christians, was now the hot-bed of heresy and schism. Nor need this be a matter for surprise. The excitements of that phase of religious sentiment has always been consistent with a frivolous and pleasure-seeking life. \u2666 December, A. D. 361, to March, A. D. 363. N"], [274, "266 HISTORY OF ROME. As might be expected, there was no sympathy be ween Julian and the Antiochians. The self-denying philosopher regarded their follies with contempt. The profligate and luxurious inhabitants sneered at his pure morals and simplicity of living. The fashionable world were disgusted with his slovenly dress and shaggy beard. The religious world, whatever their doctrinal differences, were cordially agreed in hating a pagan and an apostate. This unpopularity was increased by the ill effects of a great financial mistake which he committed, from the benevolent motive of relieving the distress of the poor. A bad harvest had produced a scarcity, and he fixed the price of corn by statute below its market value even in seasons of plenty. At the same time he supplied the market with large quantities of foreign corn. This was bought up by the rich dealers. Neither they nor the farmers would sell at the fixed prices, and what little corn was sold to the public secretly fetched a higher price than ever. The dearth which was the necessary result of this erroneous policy, was laid to the Emperor's charge, and the anger of this light but witty people vented itself in insulting songs and lampoons. Julian paid them in their own coin, and avenged himself by lashing their vices and follies in a severe satire, entitled Misopogon (the Beard-hater), one of the wittiest pieces of this period of Greek literature.* In the ensuing spring he set out for the Persian war.

This plan of opera tions was a judicious one, because he reckoned upon the aid of the Armenians ; but unfortunately for him they were Christians, and therefore, although enemies of Sapor, they preferred remaining neutral rather than assist the renegade Emperor. The dissensions, n2"], [276, "268 HISTORY OF ROME. also, of Procopius and Sebastianus, and their in capacity to struggle with great emergencies, contri buted to disappoint the plans of Julian. He had also himself been guilty of a fatal error in deferring his expedition until the spring, instead of commencing it in the winter ; hence he did not reach the scorching plains of Babylon until the heat of summer had set in. Still he transported his army across the Tigris in the face of overwhelming difficulties, and drove the Persians who opposed his passage to the gates of Ctesiphon. His troops were eager to storm the city, but he, as well as his generals, were convinced that the royal city which had succumbed to Trajan and Severus was too strong for him to attempt it with any probability of success. At this conjuncture Sapor, dispirited by the continued success of Julian, offered an advantageous and honourable peace, but the Em peror unfortunately obstinately refused, and, absorbed in dreams of triumphant conquest, he resolved to march into the very centre of his enemy's dominions. Unable to tow his fleet against the stream of the arrowy Tigris, for such is the origin of its name, and unwilling to leave his noble navy a prey to Sapor, he burnt a thousand vessels, reserving only a score of boats, which could be carried on trucks, and used for the passage of rivers. But his career of conquest was over ; the inhabitants fled before him to the cities after burning their crops and farms, and JuUan found nothing but a scorched and shrivelled waste. Soon, therefore, famine and want compelled him to begin a disastrous retreat.

The cavalry and archers of the Persians hung upon their rear ; and when they exchanged the shadowless and burning plains for the mountains, they found the fastnesses occupied by Persian ambushes. Information was brought to Julian that an attack had commenced. The heat had tempted him to ride without defensive armour, but he seized a shield from an aide-de-camp and rode to the rescue. The Persians were put to flight, but in the pursuit Julian fell mortally wounded with a javelin.* He died with the calmness of a philosopher ; and though a Pagan, his resignation to the divine will was worthy of a Christian. He expired, after a short but eventful reign of twenty months, in the thirty second year of his age. His remains were conveyed in solemn pomp to Tarsus in Cilicia \u2014 games were celebrated at his funeral, and his tomb adorned the banks of the Cydnus instead of those of the Ilissus or the Tiber. JOVIAN, DIED A.D. 364, As Julian had not nominated a successor, the gene rals met to elect an emperor. Their unanimous choice fell upon Sallustius, the Pr\u00e6torian-Prefect, but unfor tunately that great and good man declined the purple, pleading the infirmities of age. In this dilemma Jovian, the son of the Count Varronianus, who filled the post at court of first of the domestics, was, in a moment of inconsiderate haste and much to his own * June 26, a.d. 363."], [278, "270 HISTORY OF ROME. astonishment, saluted Augustus, and his election was confirmed. He was a Christian, and a man of frank and popular manners, but he was neither a great nor a good man. The intelligence of Julian's death was JOVIAN. conveyed to Sapor by a deserter, and, encomaged by the news, he endeavoured to retrieve his ill-success. His horse guards {Regius equitatus) broke the ranks of the Jovians and Herculeans, but after a bloody battle the Persians were at last vanquished. On the following day the engagement was renewed, but the Romans, though wearied and worn out, were so far from being dispirited that they prevailed on Jovian to permit them to attempt the passage of the Tigris. This, however, they were unable to effect, and nothing seemed before them but famine and death. At this critical moment Sapor sent to offer terms of peace. They were humiliating in the highest degree, but Jovian was not in a condition to decline them. A truce was consequently made for thirty years, on condition of surrendering Nisibis, the great rampart of the empire against Persia, and the five pro-"], [279, "271 HISTORY OF ROME. vinces east of the Tigris. An uninterrupted retreat was promised, together with a supply of provisions for the famishing army. The retreat was most dis astrous ; many of the soldiers were swept away by the rapid current of the Tigris. The survivors had then to traverse a waterless plain seventy miles in extent, and were reduced to such extremities as to be obliged to sacrifice their baggage-horses to appease their hunger. The emaciated relics of the army reached Nisibis, which, amidst the discontented murmurs of his subjects and the bitter grief of the inhabitants, Jovian surrendered into the hands of the Persians. The new Christian Emperor marched from Nisibis to Antioch with the sacred Labarum floating over his head. It was a welcome sight to the suffering Church, in whose favour an edict of toleration was immediately issued. Bishops of all parties attended his levies. The venerable Athanasius returned from his exile, and was reinstated in his archiepiscopal see. The elasticity with which the Church recovered its supre macy now that the weight of oppression was removed proved the absurd folly of Julian in endeavouring to impose paganism upon a reluctant world. Jovian remained at Antioch only six weeks. The volatile inhabitants lampooned and satirised him as they had his predecessor. On the road to Constantinople he made his infant son his colleague in the consulship.* The unconscious child shrieked and struggled when the attendants wished to place him in the ivory chair, and this was thought an omen of Jovian's death, which so soon ensued.

His body was carried to Constantinople, and buried in the imperial sepulchre. JOVIAN FOUND DLAD VALENTINIAN. born a.d. 322 ; died a.d. 375, Upon the death of Jovian the empire was without a ruler for nine or ten days, during which the army was marching to Nice, and the generals and officers of the court were seeking a worthy successor to the purple. At length their choice fell upon Sallustius, who declined a second time on the same plea as before. * Feb. 17, a.d. 364."], [281, "HISTORY OF ROME. 273 He also declined it in behalf of his son, on the grounds of his youth and inexperience. All with one voice then declared in favour of Valentinian, an Illyrian by birth, who had distinguished himself in the Persian war. He was the son of Gratian, a man of obscure family, who had gradually risen to the dignity of Count of Africa, of which position he was deprived on a suspicion of corrupt administration. Valentinian was uneducated, but he possessed natural good sense, a ready eloquence, and refined taste, for it is said that he was an elegant writer, and accom plished in painting and modelling.* His military genius was great ; he was tolerant and liberal-minded, but severe, passionate, and unforgiving. To his natural mental gifts he added those of a commanding figure, a manly though stern countenance, and a vigorous constitution, which was braced by constant military employment, and never weakened by excess or intemperance. The electors summoned him from Ancyra, and pre sented him to the assembled army, by whom he was * Milman's Notes to Gibbon. n3"], [282, "274 HISTORY OF ROME. saluted Augustus, in the midst of universal acclama tions, and invested with the purple and the diadem* A great improvement had now taken place in imperial elections. Not only was the dignity unsought by Valentinian, but even before his time all traces of the corrupt practice of giving donatives to the army had disappeared. Scarcely had the new Emperor raised his hand to address the troops on his accession, than they demanded with a loud shout that he should nominate a colleague lest the empire should become vacant. In obedience to this demand, he, in a few weeks, nominated his brother Valens Augustus.f Valens was a cowardly persecutor, and grievously oppressed the orthodox party in the Church, and their brave and in domitable Archbishop, Athanasius. Both the brothers, indeed, were Arians, but Valentinian was no per secutor, nor did he ever mix himself up with the disputes of religious parties. By his influence Valens was compelled to cease from the course which he had pursued. In his spirit he was truly catholic, and his first care was, by firm but judicious edicts and laws, to protect the Church against attacks from without, as well as to secure its internal peace and unity. The good effects of his policy were sufficiently apparent in the rapid progress made by Christianity during his reign. Soon after their accession, the two brothers were attacked with a long and severe fever, which super stition attributed to the sorceries of Julian's friends, whom, in his zeal to reform abuses, Valentinian had removed from power. As soon as they recovered, he conferred upon Valens the prefecture of the East, * Feb. 26, a.d. 364. f March 28."], [283, "275 HISTORY OF ROME. reserving for himself the poorer and more military provinces of Italy, Illyricum, and Gaul. Valens had not occupied his prefecture much more than a year when Procopius, a cousin of Julian, assumed the title of Emperor of Constantinople, His relationship to Julian, and a groundless report that Julian had secretly invested him with the purple, had rendered him an object of suspicion even in the preceding reign, but he had cleared himself by resigning a com mand which he held in Mesopotamia, and by retiring into private life. On the accession of Valentinian he had been again arrested, but he effected his escape, and after some months of concealment suddenly appeared at Constan tinople. The people were ripe for revolution, for they hated the cruelty of Valens whilst they despised his timidity, and the soldiers saluted Procopius as em peror. His army rapidly received large reinforce ments, and the discontented populace embraced his cause with enthusiasm. The cowardly Valens, instead of boldly meeting the danger, wished to negotiate ; and, had it not been for the firmness of his advisers, would have abdicated. The venerable Sallust, who had retired from active service, again resumed the com mand, and after two unsuccessful battles the usurper was deserted by his troops,* and at last betrayed by his former adherents into the hands of his enemies. He was then taken to the camp of Valens and beheaded. The Ostrogoths, who, under their king Hermanric, had established their supremacy over the Visigoths, the Heruli, the Venedi {Poland), and the * May 28, A. D. 366."], [284, "276 HISTORY OF ROME. Ostii (Esthonia), espoused the cause of Procopius; thirty thousand Goths crossed the Danube, but before they could advance farther the rebellion was over, and the usurper slain. They were surrounded by the armies of Valens, and the failure of provisions compelled them to submit. Still they continued a defensive war for three years, and at length obtained a treaty of peace from Valens. The military talents of Valentinian soon found full employment, for during his whole reign the peace of the empire was disturbed by foreign wars. The Alemanni invaded Gaul, burnt the villages, and before Dagalaiphus, the best general of the time, could give them battle, effected their retreat with their prisoners and plunder into the recesses of the German forests.* But early in the ensuing year, Jovinus, the master general of cavalry, surprised the victorious barbarians as they were resting and feasting on the banks of the Moselle, and defeated them with the loss of ten thousand killed and wounded. Their king was taken prisoner, and hung by the infuriated soldiery without the knowledge of the general, and a prince named Withicab was shamefully assassinated. The subsequent capture of Moguntiacum {Mentz) induced Valentinian in person, accompanied by his son Gratian, to cross the Rhine into the enemy's country. The Alemanni were encamped on a moun tain in Wirtemberg, and whilst endeavouring to dis lodge them the life of Valentinian was in imminent peril. Nevertheless, he drove them from their posi tion, and, occupying it with his troops, returned * a.d. 365."], [285, "HISTORY OF ROME. 277 to Treves, where he celebrated triumphal games. Knowing the importance of the Rhine as a frontier, he fortified the whole length of it with a line of towers, and thus protected Gaul from future invasions.* The piratical Saxons, who inhabited the duchies of Sleswig and Holstein, committed great depredations on the coasts of Gaul and Britain, but they were com pletely conquered by Severus, the master-general of the infantry, who compelled them to furnish a quota to serve in the Roman armies, and after a treacherous massacre of most of them sent the remainder to suffer a still more cruel death in the combats of the amphi theatre. The whole of Britain was in a state of peaceful submission to the Romans, with the exception of Caledonia, which still enjoyed a barbarous freedom. The lowlands were inhabited by the Picts, the naked painted warriors of the North, a race long extinct ; and the highlands were the dwelling-place of the Scots, who, as their name implies, were a race of wanderers. More than twenty years before the ac cession of Valentinian, these barbarians had made descents upon the peaceful Roman province, and, aided by the Saxon sea-robbers, had spread such devastation throughout the land that news of the sufferings of the Britanni readied Valentinian. Soon afterwards intelligence was brought that two Roman generals were attacked by surprise and cut off by the invaders. Theodosius was accordingly commissioned to deliver Britain from its barbarous invaders. At the head of a numerous force, including the Heruli * A.D. 371."], [286, "278 HISTORY OF ROME. and the Batavians, he landed near Sandwich, and fought his way to London, which immediately sub mitted. In two campaigns* he drove the Caledo nians to the remotest portion of the island, and added to the Roman dominions the province of Valentia, RICaBOIlOLCH, NEAR SANDWICH which was so named in compliment to the Emperor. He was rewarded with the master-generalship of the cavalry ; and, after adding to his exploits in Britain a defeat of the Alemanni, he was despatched to Africa, which had broken out into a state of revolt. This province had long suffered under the corrupt and extortionate sway of the Count Romanus. The inhabitants of Tripoli \u2014 a federal union of three cities, as its name implies \u2014 petitioned the Emperor on the subject of their wrongs, but owing to the successful intrigues of Romanus their petition was pronounced * a.d. 368 and a.d. 369."], [287, "279 HISTORY OF ROME. frivolous, and their president put to death by the hasty sentence of the passionate A7alentinian. At this crisis,* Fumius, a powerful Moorish prince, was in rebellion, and the ill-used Africans joined in his revolt. The military genius and steady perseverance of the restorer of Britain crushed the rebellion, and the ringleader committed suicide. The crafty Ro manus received no severer punishment than dismissal from his command, whilst the brave Theodosius, when death had removed the Emperor whom he had so faithfully served, was executed at Carthage,f because his great merits were supposed to render him danger ous to the empire. From Britain the attention of the Emperor was called to other dangers which threatened the northern frontier. The Quadi, who, in the time of M. Antoninus, had marched to the gates of Rome, were jealous of the line of forts with which Valentinian was strengthening the banks of the Danube. These works were confided to Mar cellinus, son of Maximinus, prefect of Gaul. Ga binius, King of the Quadi, came to remonstrate with Marcellinus, and accepted an invitation to sup with him. The rites of hospitality were violated, and the king was murdered. The Quadi, in revenge, invaded Pannonia, and laid waste the province. Valentinian, who was at Treves, marched into their country in the ensuing spring,}: and visited them with a severe retaliation. When he was wintering at Bregetio {near Presburg), an embassy from the Quadi arrived to beg for mercy.

In the first year of his joint reign with his nephews, Valens was placed in a situation of great difficulty. The Huns, a savage nomad horde, of Mongol race, had overthrown the Gothic power. Their more than Calmuck ugliness terrified even the barbarous Goths, and their resistless numbers overwhelmed the whole territory with desolation and bloodshed.* They had originally inhabited the table-land of Upper Asia, north of the great wall of China, which was built for the vain purpose of resisting their inroads.\")\" Two \u2666a.d. 375. t B.C. 244."], [290, "282 HISTORY OF ROME. centuries before Christ they had conquered a royal Chinese army, and China became tributary to them. During the centuries which intervened between this era and their contact with the Romans, vast hordes had migrated from their cold and barren land, one of which occupied the territory of the Alani \u2014 the plains bounded by the Volga and the Tanais \u2014 and after a battle, in which the King of the Alani was slain, the two races united, and formed, as it were,1 one people. Their allied forces were too strong for Hermanric, the Gothic chieftain, whose prowess, according to Niebuhr,* is celebrated in the Heldenbuch and Ice landic Sagas. The chieftain himself was slain, and the Gothic power overthrown. The vanquished Goths, in their difficulty, implored the aid of Valens, and permission to settle in the waste lands of Thrace. The case required immediate decision, but the timid and feeble Emperor could not make up his mind either to admit or repel so dangerous a body of settlers. His ministers, to whom he referred the question, were at first equally at a loss ; but at length their petition was granted, and one million of men, women, and children were transported across the Danube. To provide for these myriads was almost an impossibility ; dearth was followed by starvation, and starvation by discontent. The erroneous policy of Valens was now plain. He ought to have aided them on their own bank of the Danube, and thus secured a strong barrier against the further advance of the Huns, but he should never have admitted them into the empire. The danger was * See Lect. on R. H. cxxxiii."], [291, "283 HISTORY OF ROME. enhanced by the avarice of the Roman officers, who had been bribed to permit them, contrary to the stipulations, to retain their arms. Moreover, they took advantage of the necessities of the starving Goths, and instead of supplying provisions, as they had promised, forced them to pay exorbitant prices for unwholesome and disgusting food, and animals which had died of disease. Not only were ten pounds of silver demanded for a meal, but the wretched people were compelled to barter their children for bread. At length, driven to desperation, they turned upon their oppressors, and broke out into open rebellion at Marcianopolis {near Shumla). Only one tribe, the Visigoths, had as yet crossed the river. They were led by Fritigern, one of their two judges, who com manded their armies in war as they conducted the civil administration in peace ; and with the excep tion of a few fortified towns, the whole of Mcesia and Thrace were soon in their possession. The news of this rebellion aroused Valens. He marched from Antioch to Constantinople, and thence to Hadrianople, near which city the Gothic army was assembled in great force under Fritigern. Instead of waiting to be reinforced by Gratian, who had already beaten the Alemanni, and was advancing to his aid, he rashly attacked the enemy. The result was fatal. The Roman cavalry were put to flight, and two thirds of the army cut to pieces. Valens, dangerously wounded, was carried to a cottage by his staff, but his place of refuge was set on fire, and he perished in the flames.* From the Hadriatic to the Black Sea * A.

Liberally educated, in his boyhood he had learnt the art of war under his father. At his death he retired to his native place, and, like Cincin natus, was summoned from his farm to be invested with the purple. He was a truly illustrious man, and well deserved the name of \" Great\" which history conferred upon him. He was an especial favourite with the orthodox Christians. Soon after he was invested with the purple, he received baptism at the hands of an Athanasian bishop ; * he deposed the Arian Bishop of Constantinople, and convened the council assembled at that city,f which determined the equal divinity of the third Person of the Holy Trinity. His only faults were a hasty temper and a distrust of himself, which tempted him to place confidence in men who were unworthy to be his counsellors. Having to cope with an enemy superior in strength to himself, he prudently encamped at Thessalonica, occupied the fortified towns, and, narrowly watching his movements, harassed him by constant sorties. Thus, unable to meet the Goths en masse, he beat them in detail, and, when Fritigern died, the chiefs quarrelled amongst themselves, the union between the tribes was dissolved, each made an independent treaty, and at length all submitted to Theodosius, and engaged to serve in the imperial armies.:): Nearly four years afterwards H the Ostrogoths were conquered on the banks of the Danube, were trans ported to Asia Minor, and under the title of F\u0153derati swelled the armies of the East. * a.

He had resided long in Britain ; and a Welsh tradition states, that he married Helena, a lady of Caernarvon.

Maximus, however, was not content that the Alps should be the boundary of his dominions. Suddenly he appeared with an army near the gates of Milan. Justina, and her son Valentinian II., fled to the protection of Theodosius at Thessalonica. Italy submitted to Maximus. Partly gratitude, partly the beauty of Galla, Valentinian's sister, moved the Emperor of the East to espouse the cause of the exiled Emperor. He marched .against Maximus, and utterly defeated him near Aquileia.f The usurper was given up to the soldiers, who immediately beheaded him. Theodosius wintered at Milan, and in the spring entered Rome in triumph. Valentinian survived his restoration about four years. Arbogastes, the commander-in-chief of his armies, was a Frank ; he seems to have usurped an authority somewhat similar to that of the Mayors of the palace in the earlier periods of the French monarchy, and to have filled all the posts about the person of his sovereign with his creatures and countrymen; the spirit of the young Emperor was roused, and he dismissed his general ; soon afterwards, when holding his court at Vienne in Dauphine\", he was found strangled. The successful assassin followed up the blow by raising to the purple Eugenius, who filled the * Aug. 25. t a.d. 388."], [296, "288 HISTORY OF ROME. office of tribunus notariorum, i. e. a secretary of state. The usurper sent ambassadors to Theodosius, who, though indignant, sent them back with presents and compliments. Two years afterwards he marched against Arbogastes, and gave him battle near Aquileia. The battle was bloody and hardly contested, and on the first day Theodosius, although he showed himself a consummate general, was forced to retreat, but on the ensuing morning some of the usurper's troops deserted; a sudden tempest arose and favoured him, like the storm which struck terror into the Genoese archers at Crtky, and Theodosius gained a complete victory. Eugenius was beheaded, and Arbogastes fled to the mountains, where he committed suicide. Theodosius did not long remain sole .master of the Roman world ; four mouths afterwards he was attacked by dropsy, and acting upon the policy of his predecessors, he divided the empire between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius, on whom he had already conferred the title of Augustus. Both these princes, as well from their extreme youth as their feebleness of character, were unfit for their high position. Arca dius was only eighteen, and Honorius only eleven years old, when the latter was summoned to Milan just in time to attend the death-bed of his father. The Circensian games celebrated his arrival ; the excitement and fatigue overcame the dying Emperor, and he expired the next night amidst general lamentations.* He was justly regretted by his subjects; for, although he was hasty in temper and luxurious in * Jan. 17, a. D. 395."], [297, "289 HISTORY OF ROME. habits, he strove, generally with success, to curb the former, and devoted himself with vigour and perse verance to great enterprises. One awful instance is recorded in which the violence of his passion hurried him into a deed of fiendish cruelty. The Thessalonicans had a quarrel with Botheric, the commandant of the garrison, and in their anger foully murdered him and his officers. Theodosius, instead of bringing to trial and punishing the guilty, ordered a general massacre, and in three years seven thousand, or as some say fifteen thousand, victims were butchered \u2014 the women and children, the innocent and the guilty, alike were involved in one indiscriminate slaughter.* On another occasion, his better nature vanquished the fury of his wrath. The Antiochians rose in arms and broke down the statues of the Emperor and his beloved wife. At first, Theo dosius issued a decree to execute vengeance upon the rebellious city ; the deputies of the people and the ecclesiastics, especially the eloquent Chrysostom, implored mercy. The imperial ministers suspended the execution of the sentence, and again consulted their master. The result was, that the wrath of Theodosius was appeased, and a free pardon was granted to the offenders. In private life he was liberal and virtuous ; in public life he was a wise legislator, and a brave and successful general. He was beloved by the Church because he entirely proscribed paganism and idolatry, which those of his predecessors who were most favourable to Christianity had at any rate tolerated * a. D. 390. 0"], [298, "290 HISTORY OF ROME. he closed the heathen temples, confiscated their en dowments, and made the open profession of heathenism highly penal. Nor did his persecution of Arianism add little to his popularity. Three shining lights of the Church adorned the reign of this Emperor ; Basil and Gregory of Nazianzum in the eastern, and Am brose in the western empire ; both the eastern fathers were natives of Cappadocia, and early friends and fellow-students in the schools at Athens ; both were elegant scholars, graceful orators, and learned divines ; the former was elevated to the archbishopric of C\u00e6sarea, the latter to that'of Constantinople. The jealousy of his enemies objected to his translation from the see of his native town as being uncanonical, and he meekly resigned his dignity into the hands of the council of Constantinople, and returned to the obscure retirement of Nazianzum. Ambrose was governor of Milan in the reign of Gratian, and whilst still unbaptized was unexpectedly and reluctantly called by the acclamations of the people to the archiepiscopal throne of that city. He was a staunch Athanasian ; and when the Arian Empress Justina demanded that one church should be given to her sect, he firmly refused. Justina ordered him to quit Milan, but the people took the part of their archbishop ; miracles were pretended to be wrought in his favour, and his enemies were obliged to give way. When he heard of the massacre of Thessalonica, he stopped Theodosius at the door of the cathedral of Milan; nor would he admit him as a worshipper until he had publicly done penance, and expressed his contrition.

The former of these, who ruled the East, was a cruel and avaricious wretch, whom Theodosius had injudiciously raised to the prefecture of that division of the empire ; the latter, who was guardian of Honorius, was probably a Vandal by descent, and is celebrated by the poet Claudius as a brave and virtuous soldier. He had married Serena, the niece of Theodosius, and had attained the rank of Master-general of the cavalry and infantry {magister utriusque militi\u0153). Arcadius, who was old enough to submit with reluctance to the dictates of a guardian, was nevertheless too weak to act independently ; consequently, Eutropius, an artful eunuch, gained an ascendancy over him, and induced him to marry Eudoxia, a beautiful Frank lady, thus baffling the designs of Rufinus, who had intended the young Emperor for his own daughter. The wily ambition of Rufinus was soon cut short by Stilicho. On the excuse of leading back to 0 2"], [300, "292 HISTORY OF ROME. Constantinople the eastern legions which had been summoned to Italy by the revolt of Eugenius, the latter marched eastward ; this alarmed Rufinus, and he induced Arcadius to forbid his approach. Stilicho obediently retired, but sent the troops forward under the command of Gainas, a Gothic leader. At a mile from Constantinople, on the field of Mars, the legions halted ; Arcadius and Rufinus came out to meet them, but they immediately closed round the hated minister, and slew him in the very presence of his royal master.* His corpse was mutilated and outraged, and his head and hands were carried in mockery through the streets of Constantinople. The obse quious favourite Eutropius now exercised supreme authority over the eastern Emperor. Meanwhile, the West and its imbecile Emperor were exposed to fresh perils. In the summer of this year, Alaric with his Visigoths swept over Macedonia and laid waste almost the whole of Greece. Athens purchased her immunity at the price of all her wealth, and became like the \" bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim.\" Corinth, Argos, and Sparta submitted without a struggle, and yielded up their monuments of classic art to the barbarian conqueror. Stilicho, met him aud defeated him on the confines of Arcadia and Elis ; but he escaped, crossed the Criss\u00e6an gulf, and landed in Epirus. Jealousy of Stilicho or some other unknown policy, induced the court of Arcadius to make a treaty with the Visigoth king, and to confer upon him the office of magister militum in that division of Illyricum which belonged * Nov. 27, a.

Stilicho, disappointed by this unexpected policy on the part of the Court of Constantinople, crossed from Greece to Africa, where an insurrection rendered his presence necessary.

Honorius, who had in the fourteenth year of his age married Maria, the daughter of his guardian, held his court at Milan, when intelligence arrived that Alaric (instigated probably by the intrigues of the ministers of Arcadius) had crossed the Julian Alps and was advancing from Aquileia. When he reached Milan, Honorius fled, intending to seek refuge in Aries ; but being hotly pursued by the enemy, he was forced to halt at Asta {Asti) in Piedmont, and was there besieged. Stilicho, hoping that the Emperor might have held out for a time, had sailed up the lake of Como ; raised forces in the mountains of Switzerland and the Tyrol; swam the Adda in the Val Tellina ; crossed the Po, and cutting his way through the beleaguering camp, saved his sovereign from the disgrace of capitulation. The besiegers were now in their turn besieged; but the dauntless Alaric determined to advance upon Rome, and either conquer or die. His camp was"], [303, "295 HISTORY OF ROME. formed near Pollentia {Polenza), and whilst the Goths, who were Christians, were engaged in celebrating Easter Sunday,* they were suddenly attacked by the Roman cavalry. After the first alarm they rallied, in full confidence that God would avenge the sacrilegious act ; but Stilicho in person led the main body of his army, and the Goths were driven from their intrench ments with great slaughter. Much of the spoil with which they had enriched themselves in Greece was recovered, and many prisoners taken, amongst whom were the wife and children of Alaric. The conquered chieftain retired to the mountain fastnesses of the Apennines, still determined upon marching against Rome ; but the desire to see his family again induced him to accept terms of peace from Stilicho, and leaving as it appears his children as hostages in the hands of the Romans, he evacuated Italy and recrossed the Po. When he arrived at Verona he meditated an attack upon that important city, in violation of the treaty wdtich he had just made; but Stilicho had received secret information respecting his design, and defeated him in another sanguinary battle. For a while the vanquished bar barian endeavoured to maintain his position in the passes of the Alps ; but some of his troops deserted to the Romans, and he fled to Illyricuin with the small remnant of his mighty army. Honorius, accompanied by his successful general and guardian, entered Rome in triumph, beneath a triumphal arch erected for the occasion, which, though now destroyed, existed in the fourteenth century.f * March 29, A. D. 403. t A. D. 404."], [304, "296 HISTORY OF ROME. The ruined walls of Aurelian were restored, in order to defend the capital (vainly as it afterwards proved) against future attacks of barbarian foes, and immense masses of materials were dug up for the purpose, which had been buried in the place now occupied by the Monte Testaccio, and the walls which he repaired are the same which still encircle Rome. The remains of an inscription still existing on the Porta S. Lorenzo attributes this great work to Stilicho. Liberal offerings were made to the Church ; the Senate was treated with marked respect, and the people were entertained with games and spectacles. The horrid combats of the gladiators were now exhibited for the last time. The abolition of them is due partly to the remonstrances of Prudentius, a Christian poet ; partly to the devoted courage of Telemachus, an Asiatic monk. Being present at the bloody spectacle, he rushed into the arena and en deavoured to separate the combatants. The people, infuriated at their disappointment, stoned him to death, and he fell a martyr to the humane principles of the Gospel. The timid Honorius then determined to fix his residence at Ravenna, a naval and military station which from its position was almost impregnable. Although now, owing to the retreat of the Hadriatic, at the distance of four miles from the sea-coast, it was then, like Venice, built upon piles and numerous small islands intersected by canals. It was separated from the mainland by extensive morasses, and ap proached by an artificial causeway which could easily be put in a state of defence. The ebb and flow of"], [305, "297 HISTORY OF ROME. the sea purified the canals and brought with it re freshing breezes ; so that, unlike the neighbourhood of most marshes, the city was pleasant and healthy. During three centuries and a half the successors of Honorius occupied the same secure but prison-like residence, and Ravenna was virtually the capital of the Western Empire. Scarcely had Lombardy time to recover from the invasion of Alaric, when the hordes which occupied the rich plains of the Vistula poured down into Italy.* The leader of this great Vandal or Sclavonian immigration was Rhadagast orRadagaisus: his myriads were still further augmented by bodies of Alani from Scythia ; by Suevi and Burgundians from Germany. and Gothic adventurers ; so that the total number amounted to no less than two hundred thousand fighting men together with women and children, who probably increased the number tenfold. This formid able wave of population poured unresisted across the Alps, Lombardy, and the Apennines, and overwhelmed the principal cities of Italy. Unlike the army of Alaric, which was both Christian and disciplined, this uncivilized horde was inspired with all the fury of savages and heathens. Their leader laid siege to Florence. The inhabitants were reduced to the last extremity of famine, but their courage was supported by the persuasive eloquence of St. Ambrose ; when Stilicho, whose head-quarters were at Ticinus or Pavia, suddenly came to their relief. Adopting the same system of stratagem which had proved successful at Asti, he * A. D. 405. o 3"], [306, "298 HISTORY OF ROME. invested the barbarian host which was encamped upon the neighbouring heights of F\u00e6sul\u00e6 with strong lines of circumvallation : thus the besiegers were in their turn besieged; all supplies were cut off, and after many had perished by famine, they surrendered. Numbers of the survivors were sold as slaves, and the execution of Radagaisus after his capitulation sullied the glory which the conqueror had achieved. Italy was saved ; but half or more of the barbarians had been only driven back unhurt to the Apennines. The Rhenish frontier had been stripped of its troops in order to recruit the forces of Stilicho, and the fugitives by mere force of numbers vanquished the Franks, who bravely opposed to their progress an unavailing resistance, and crossing the Rhine spread desolation through Gaul.* The Vandals, Alani, and Suevi remained in Gaul, until they crossed the Pyrenees and found settlements in Spain.f The Burgundians never left the country, and thus from this invasion the Transalpine empire of Rome dates its fall. The sufferings of the Gauls were aggra vated by oppressive taxes. Officers selected from the wealthy inhabitants were made responsible for the revenue of each district : the collection from them was enforced even by torture, and they were then left to levy the amount upon the inferior classes by whatever oppressive extortions they thought necessary, and the old system by which they were collected made these burdens still more serious. This system had existed for more than a century, and hence originated the insurrections of the Bagaud\u00e6, or peasant wars, * A. D. 406. f a. D. 407."], [307, "HISTORY OF ROME. 299 which had periodically broken out ever since that time. A revolt of the distant province of Britain added to the general calamity. The army elevated to the purple three emperors in rapid succession, the first two of whom were murdered ; the third, named Con stantine, a mere legionary soldier, landed at Boulogne,* and met with ready submission from the remnant of the Gauls who were still able to maintain their inde pendence of the Vandals and their allies. Spain also joined the standard of the usurper, probably deeming this the only means of refuge from her barbarian invaders. The inability of Stilicho to save Gaul exposed him to the calumnies of his enemies at court. They excited the fears and suspicions of Honorius, and persuaded him that his general had a design upon his life, in order to place his son Eucherius upon the throne of the childless Emperor. It is scarcely probable that Stilicho ever meditated this treason, although it may well be believed that he designed his son to be the successor of Honorius. In addition to his influence at court being thus undermined, his popularity with the Senate and army had declined, owing to another cause. Alaric had broken with the court of Constantinople and had made a treaty with that of Ravenna, and in order to purchase his firm adherence Stilicho had promised him a bribe of four thousand pounds of gold. The army were enraged at this disgraceful subsidy. The Senate, although they reluctantly authorized the payment, protested * A. D. 407."], [308, "200 HISTORY OF ROME. with indignation, and one of their body, Lampadius, exclaimed that it was not a treaty of peace, but of servitude. Disgrace and ruin now threatened the fallen favourite. Honorius himself conspired against his minister just as Louis XIII. of France did against his. He harangued the army at the camp of Pavia, and instigated a wholesale massacre of the friends of the unfortunate general. Stilicho, who was at Bologna, heard of the massacre, and instead of striking a deci sive blow hesitated until too late, and then took sanctuary in a church at Ravenna. This refuge he was treacherously induced to leave, and was imme diately beheaded. His son shared his fate, and his widow, Serena, was also sentenced to death and strangled during the siege of Rome.* A few months afterwards an imperial edict branded the memory of the fallen minister with the title of \" the public enemy.\" The murder of Stilicho furnished Alaric with a pretext for invading Italy a second time, whilst the bloodthirsty madness of the ministers of Honorius adopted a policy which increased his army with a reinforcement of thirty thousand brave soldiers. Fear ful of the faithful Huns and other barbarian auxiliaries who formed the army of Stilicho and were much attached to him, they either authorized or permitted the plunder and sack of the strong Italian cities in which the valuables and families of these foreigners were kept, as pledges of their fidelity. Lashed to fury by the wickedness of the imperial court, they swore eternal hatred, and welcomed the Gothic invader with open arms. * August 23, a.

Day after day passed away, and no succour arrived from the unfeeling court; and at length the despairing- Senate sent two delegates to offer an honourable ca pitulation. Alaric received them with scornful pride, and consented to raise the siege on the surrender of all their treasure, which was said to have been enormous, and all their foreign slaves. \" What then will you leave us ? \" inquired the humbled deputies. \" Your lives,\" was the stern reply.* The conqueror, however, was induced by the approach of summer, a season so unhealthy in the Campagna, to grant easier terms, and he stipulated to retire on payment of 5,000 pounds of gold (200,000?.), 30,000 pounds of silver (90,000Z), 4,000 silken robes, 3,000 pieces of purple cloth, and 3,000 pounds of pepper, then esteemed a rare and costly luxury. He then pitched his camp in Tuscany, where he was joined by forty thousand fugitive slaves, and his army was thus increased to the number of one hundred thousand effective soldiers. Negotiations for peace were commenced with the court of Ravenna; but though Honorius conferred upon Alaric the dignity of master-general of both arms of the service, they led to no permanent results. Alaric returned to Rome a second time, and made himself master of Ostia with its well-filled granaries. The old port of Rome had now become an episco pal city, the throne of which was occupied by the celebrated Hippolytus. The Senate, thus threatened with starvation, submitted, and Alaric elevated Attalus, * A. D. 409."], [311, "303 HISTORY OF ROME. prefect of the city, to the imperial purple, and con ducted him to Ravenna. The court of the pusillani mous Honorius was in a state of complete anarchy. Jovius, the Pr\u00e6torian Prefect, had headed a cabal which had obtained the execution of two of the generals and the assassination of the Emperor's chamberlain. The successful intriguers sent an em bassy to the camp of Alaric to propose, in the name of Honorius, a division of the western empire between himself and Attalus, but the latter insolently refused to admit Honorius as a colleague. He eveu ventured to propose that the Emperor should abdicate, and accept his life on condition of perpetual exile. Jovius and Valens, the master-generals, immediately deserted their fallen sovereign. At this critical moment four thousand veterans un expectedly arrived at Ravenna. The tide of fortune turned for awhile. The eyes of Alaric were opened to the incompetence of Attalus \u2014 he was degraded and stripped of the imperial insignia, which were sent as tokens of good-will to Honorius. Peace might now have been concluded, had not the Emperor, or rather his inconstant ministers, made common cause with Sarus, another Gothic chieftain, who was a personal enemy of Alaric, and insolently declared that all hopes of a satisfactory negotiation were ended for ever. Then the fury and avarice of Alaric burst forth without control. A third time the Gothic host laid siege to Rome \u2014 treachery assisted the invaders.* In the dead of night the Salarian gate, which still stands as a monument of Rome's fall, was opened, and the * August 24, A.

The streets were choked with corpses \u2014 the wealthy were tortured till they discovered ALAHIC TAKES ROME. their hidden treasures. Slavery and chains were the lot of thousands, and crowds of fugitives fled to the opposite coasts of Africa, and even to Jerusalem, and the holy retirement of Bethlehem. Strange to say, it is said that, in the midst of this universal ruin, only one senator perished by the sword. The horrors of the siege were owing to the savage fury of the army, and not to Alaric himself, who did his best to restrain his soldiers. He issued a proclamation to spare the lives of civilians, and of every one who took sanctuary, especially in the churches of St."], [313, "HISTORY OF ROME. 305 Peter and St. Paul. The churches themselves were not plundered, and the sacred plate and furniture were held inviolate. The Goths were barbarians, but still they were Christians. Alaric evacuated Rome in six days, or, as Orosius asserts, in three, and then proceeded to lay waste the fertile plains of Campania. In this raid he took Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, prisoner. The rude con querors imitated the luxurious habits of the refined Romans, and, like Horace, or Atticus, stretched be neath the boughs of some wide-spreading palm or beech, drank from golden patera, the generous wines of Setium and Falernum. Alaric marched to Rhe gium (Reggio), with the intention of crossing over into Sicily, and thence into Africa, but a sudden storm in those dangerous straits wrecked a portion of his army before his very eyes, and he relinquished his design. Soon after, he died at Cosenza, in the Abruzzi. The waters of the Busento flow over his grave, and the workmen who built his tomb were put to death, so that no man might know the resting-place of the conqueror of Rome. His brother-in-law, Ataulphus (Adolphus), succeeded him in the command of the army. In his youth he had been ambitious to pursue the career of a conqueror, and to be the founder of a Gothic empire, but expe rience had taught him that the Goths were incapable of civilization, and in the fallacious hope of restoring the greatness of the fallen empire of Rome, he adopted a pacific policy. After concluding a treaty with Honorius, he evacuated Italy and marched into Gaul, and thence into Spain. Driving the Vandals,"], [314, "306 HISTORY OF ROME. Suevi, and Alani before him into Asturia, Gallicia, and Portugal, he formed an independent principality, extending over Languedoc on one side of the Pyrenees, and Catalonia on the other. Four years after the taking of Rome,* he married, at Narbonne, Placidia, the sister of Honorius, an alliance which was most distasteful to the court, but which drew closer the bonds of friendship between himself and the Roman Emperor. Italy, relieved from the ravages of the barbarians, had time to breathe again, and Honorius, being now apparently under the influence of wise counsellors, not only granted a general pardon to all offenders, but remitted the arrears due to the treasury, and diminished taxation for the future. Rome rapidly rose from her ruins, and regained a portion of her former magnificence; many of the exiles returned, and crowds of strangers flocked in to swell the popu lation and increase its prosperity. Fresh troubles now assailed the feeble Emperor. f Heraclian, Count of Africa, who had hitherto remained loyal, assumed the purple, and assembling a numerous fleet, sailed to Ostia. His army had not proceeded far from thence on the road to Rome, when it was utterly routed, and he fled in a single ship to Carthage. The rebellion was thus crushed, and the author of it beheaded. The revolutions which took place in Gaul during this period are too long and complicated for the limits of this history. Suffice it to say, that Britain, deserted at once by the Roman legions, \\ which had hitherto maintained its submission to Rome, and constituted * A.D. 414. t A.D. 413.

The maritime provinces of Gaul, situated between the Seine and the Loire, which THE B * i I*-- WITHDRAW FROM BRITAIN were known by the name of Armorica, followed the example of Britain, and the freedom thus achieved subsequently received the confirmation of Honorius. Eventually Armorica nominally returned to its alle giance to the empire, although it was constantly disturbed by fresh acts of rebellion. Britain never returned to the dominion of Rome. The jurisdiction over the island was divided amongst thirty-three corporate municipal cities, each of which had its magistrate, senate, and popular assembly, somewhat after the example of the Roman constitu tion. As might be expected, the island, though"], [316, "308 HISTORY OF ROME. restored to independence, was distracted by faction, owing to this divided authority, and the hereditary nobles and landowners, some of which were descended from ancient British kings, elevated themselves to a position not unlike that of the tyrants in the old Republics of Greece. This state of discord, in which city was divided against city, and noble waged petty war on noble, was favourable to the growth of ecclesiastical influence and power. The peaceful synods of the British bishops were the only assem blies which at all approached to the character of national councils, the only meetings in which the common interests of Britain were discussed. In these convocations the nobles and magistrates sat and debated with the spiritual authorities ; and some times, in circumstances of great emergency, the nation was united under one governor, or dictator, whose title was Pendragon. These meetings, together with the principles of Christian unity, which it was the mission of the clergy to maintain, contributed principally to save the island from disruption and anarchy. Contemporaneously with these events, a represen tative constitution was conferred by Honorius upon those provinces of Gaul which had remained faithful to Rome.* The assembly of those provinces, seven in number, was convened annually at Aries. Its members were the Pr\u00e6torian Prefect, seven governors, the magistrates and bishops of the chief cities, to gether with a number of the landed nobility and gentry.

HONORIUS, nearly six years before his death,* had bestowed the hand of his sister, Galla Placidia, the widow of Ataulphus, upon Constantius, a general to whom he was under great obligations, on account of his signal services during the revolutions in Gaul. Two usurpers, Gerontius and Maximus, he had driven to commit suicide, and a third, Constantine, he had entirely defeated ; who, before he joined the rebels in Gaul, had been proclaimed emperor by the legions in Britain. He was a remarkable man, of commanding stature and princely bearing, endowed with great administrative capacity in the business both of peace and war. In his public duties he was grave and reserved, but in private life and in the hours of relax ation he unbent, was gay, frank, and cheerful, and, like very many great men, possessed a strong sense of * A.D. 417."], [319, "311 HISTORY OF ROME. humour. He is lauded in ecclesiastical history for his zeal against the Pelagians, and for having done much towards crushing the Donatist schism in Africa. Honorius had also conferred upon him the rank of Augustus,* but he only lived to enjoy the imperial title seven months. Constantius left two children, Placidus Valentinia nus, a boy four years old, and an infant daughter named Justa Grata Honoria. His widow exercised a powerful ascendancy over her brother Honorius ; but shortly before his death, some court intrigue converted his affection into a bitter quarrel, and she fled to Constantinople. In her absence, John, the principal secretary of state, usurped the vacant purple, and Theodosius II., the Emperor of the East, who had welcomed Placidia with kindness and hospitality, sent a force of infantry by sea under the command of Ardaburius, and another of cavalry by the coast of the Hadriatic, under Aspar, the son of Ardaburius. Placidia and her infant son accompanied the latter force. The fleet was scattered by a storm, and Ardaburius taken prisoner to Ravenna. He found means, however, to open secret communication with his son, who crossed the lagoons and took Ravenna after a slight resistance. The usurper, deserted by his troops, was captured, his right hand cut off, and himself beheaded at Aquileia.t It is said by the ecclesiastical historian, Socrates, that Theodosius was assisting at the games of the circus when the intelligence was brought to him of the usurper's death, and that he immediately rose, * a. D. 421. t A. D. 425."], [320, "312 HISTORY OF ROME. and, accompanied by the spectators present, proceeded to the church to offer a public service of thanks giving. During the usurpation, Theodosius was by right sole Emperor both of the East and West, but he wisely retained the former empire only, and re solved to confer the western empire upon his cousin, an infant of six years old, leaving him during his minority under the guardianship of Placidia. The weakness of this Emperor's character furnishes grounds for the suspicion that she grossly abused her power and strengthened her own authority, by bringing up her son in frivolous tastes and effeminate habits. Theo dosius set out for Italy with the intention of declar ing Placidus Valentinianus Augustus, but sickness prevented him from proceeding farther than Thessa lonica. He therefore entrusted the duty to Helion, a patrician, who, in the presence of the Senate and assembled people, invested Valentinian III. with the imperial purple.* PLACIDUS VALENTINIANUS III. (EMPEROR OF THE WEST. DIED A. D. 455. The young Emperor was betrothed and afterwards married to Eudoxia, the daughter of Theodosius. Western Illyricum was transferred to the sovereign of the East, and, although the two Emperors were firm allies, it was enacted that the laws and decrees of each should have force only in his own dominions, unless expressly ratified by his colleague. John was but just dead, when Aetius, who, although * October 23."], [321, "313 HISTORY OF ROME. a traitor to his imperial mistress, was, for his bravery and military skill, the last Roman who deserved to be called a general, appeared on the borders of Italy with a force of sixty thousand Huns, the ancestors of the modern Hungarians, to aid the usurper. He was a native of Silistria, of good family, and of Latin descent. As a young man, he had been a hostage in the hands of Alaric and the Huns, and, owing to his early acquaintance with them, had frequently been sent afterwards as an ambassador to them. To these accidental circumstances, added to his natural advan tages, he owed the influence which he evidently possessed over these barbarians. As he had arrived too late to assist John, he was obliged to purchase the departure of his overwhelming army. The Huns crossed the Danube, pillaged and laid waste Thrace, and boasted -that they would lay siege to Constanti nople, take it at the first assault, and destroy all the inhabitants with fire and sword : but their arrogant purposes were defeated, pestilence thinned their ranks, and their leader was killed by lightning. Meanwhile, the wily Aetius pretended the greatest loyalty to Placidia, and gained such influence in her counsels, that he persuaded her to recall from the government of Africa her other distinguished general, the Count (Comes) Bonifacius, a Christian of true piety, unblemished honour, and undoubted bravery. This false step led to the ruin and loss of that wealthy province. At the same time he secretly induced Bonifacius to disobey the order of the Empress mother. Artfully fanning the flame which he had thus kindled, he at last drove Bonifacius into open P"], [322, "314 HISTORY OF ROME. rebellion, and into an alliance with Gonderic, the Vandal king.* This nation had effected a settlement in Spain in A.D. 409, and, although the Peninsula was recovered by the Emperor Honorius, the Vandals still retained their position in Gallicia, and even made themselves masters of the towns of Seville and Carthagena. They now gladly accepted the invitation of the Count of Africa, and, crossing the narrow straits of Gibraltar, landed on the opposite coast. The Spaniards were only too glad to supply transports to convey them over, in order to get rid of their barbarian invaders. During the negotiations, Gonderic had died, and their present chieftain was the famous Genseric or Gizeric, his illegitimate brother. He was a lame man, of middle height, and of few words, but pro found policy, of turbulent passions, and craving ambition. He despised luxury, and was ever on the watch to stir up strife, to sow the seeds of contention, and to set nations together by the ears. His army, which amounted to fifty thousand fighting men, quickly received reinforcements from the wild hordes of Mauritania and Mount Atlas, who hailed this opportunity of driving the Romans from their native land. The state of the African Church, moreover, was favourable to the rebellion of Bonifacius and his barbarian ally. The Donatists, a sect almost as numerous in Africa as the orthodox, had been ruth lessly persecuted by Honorius. They had been fined and disfranchised, three hundred of their bishops * A.D. 428."], [323, "315 HISTORY OF ROME. and ten thousand of their clergy were deprived, exiled, and proscribed. Genseric, an Arian, and therefore as hostile as they were to the orthodox party, professed himself their champion, and, as the event proved, kept his word ; for, under the Vandal sway, the Donatists enjoyed immunity from persecu tion during a whole century. Rome was thunderstruck at the unexpected treason of so good a man and so honest a soldier as Bonifacius. Through the influence of his friends, communications were opened between Placidia and her rebellious general; the despatches of Aetius to both were produced, and his treachery discovered.* Bonifacius heartily repented and was forgiven, but his repent ance came too late : the most valuable province of the empire \u2014 the granary of Rome \u2014 was virtually lost for ever. Although the Roman garrison returned to their allegiance, Genseric would not retire from the possessions which he had acquired. He defeated the veterans of Bonifacius, and his victorious troops spread desolation and death over the fertile and populous coast of the Mediterranean. The progress of the barbarians was marked with blood ; vineyards and olive-yards were desolated, flourishing cities razed to the ground, men, women, and children became the in discriminate victims of dishonour, torture, and death. Full of unavailing remorse, the Count of Africa threw himself into Hippo, where he was besieged, and in this siege died the great Latin Father, Augus tine, Bishop of that see.f This luminary of the Church, candid in the confession of his youthful * A.D. 430. t August 28. p2"], [324, "316 HISTORY OF ROME. sins, pure and self-denying in the remainder of his career, full of impassioned eloquence, powerful in argument and controversy, unwearied in industry, and learned so far as one ignorant of Greek could be so, was taken away from the evil to come in the seventy-sixth year of his age, after the siege had continued fourteen months. The Emperor of the East, at the request of Placidia, despatched nume rous reinforcements from Constantinople, under the command of Aspar, but the united armies were defeated by the barbarians. Bonifacius fled, and embarked for Italy. His troops evacuated Hippo, to which the inhabitants were permitted by the conquerors to return. He himself was restored to favour and raised to the rank of patrician, as well as to that of Master-general of the imperial army. His rival, Aetius, could not forget his disgrace, and, marching from Gaul at the head of a barbarian force, met his noble-spirited adversary: a battle ensued, in which Bonifacius was victorious, but was mortally wounded by the lance of Aetius. Before he died, he displayed the forgiving temper of a Christian warrior, and urged his wife to bestow her hand and her wealth upon Aetius. He, however, was outlawed as a traitor, and fled to his old friends the Huns, in Pannonia, for safety and protection. Genseric, meanwhile, met with many obstacles to establishing his sway in Africa, and it was not until eight years had elapsed that he took Carthage, its splendid but profligate metropolis, by surprise. After having given up the city to plunder, he confiscated all the personal wealth of the inhabitants, and divided"], [325, "317 HISTORY OF ROME. the fertile fields which lay beneath the walls amongst his followers.* Whilst the Western Empire had thus to struggle against Genseric and his Vandal hordes, the East was threatened by the Huns and their sovereign Attila. This celebrated conqueror is described as exhibiting the true Calmuck type both in form and features. His small eyes were deeply set in his broad, flat, dark visage, and he had scarcely any beard. He was of short stature, but broad-chested and muscular. War was his delight ; but his abilities even surpassed his bravery. The influence which his personal qualities were calculated to maintain over his subjects he strengthened by an appeal to their superstition. Their god of war was worshipped by them under the symbol of a sword ; this sword he pretended to find, and claimed as its possessor the empire of the world. On the grounds, therefore, that he was declared the chosen of Heaven, he deposed and put to death his brother, Bleda, who had inherited the sovereign power conjointly with himself, and thus he became master of an empire bounded by the Rhine and the Volga, the Baltic and the Danube. Inferior kings and chieftains attended his court as dependents, and the number of his available army has been stated at five or even seven hundred thousand men. Such was the chieftain whom Genseric, in order to prevent a junction between the forces of Valentinian and Theodosius, urged to invade the East. Circum stances soon furnished a pretence for war. A body of Huns attacked some merchants who were holding * Oct. 9, a. d. 439."], [326, "318 HISTORY OF ROME. a market at the city of Margus, on the northern bank of the Danube, and killed many of them. The Huns defended this act of violence on the ground that the Bishop of Margus had stolen a secret treasure belong ing to their kings, and demanded a restitution of the plunder, and the surrender of the bishop. The court of Constantinople refused, but the bishop purchased his pardon by the surrender of his city. The war thus begun, rapidly spread. The weak forts, which were the only defence of the Illyrian frontier, were destroyed by the overwhelming numbers of the bar barians,* and the whole of Europe, from the Euxine to the Hadriatic, was laid waste with fire and sword. Seventy cities were sacked and plundered. The im perial troops were beaten in three pitched battles; and nothing but the earthquake-riven walls of Con stantinople kept off the swollen tide of the forces of Attila. The weak character of Theodosius was not equal to protecting his subjects, and he determined to sue for peace. The conditions upon which it was granted were most humiliating. They comprised the cession of a vast territory on the southern bank of the Danube, the payment of six thousand pounds of gold, and an annual tribute of two thousand one hundred pounds, the release of all prisoners without ransom, and the surrender of all deserters. The bitterness of subju gation was enhanced by the pride of Attila, and the insolence of his envoys. \" Theodosius,\" said he, \" is of noble blood as I am, but in paying tribute to me he is divested of his nobility, and has become my slave.\" * A.D. 441."], [327, "HISTORY OF ROME. 319 He sent to the court of his conquered enemy those whom he wished to reward, in order that they might be enriched at his expense : in fact, he made a con tinual traffic of the alarm of the Romans. The last envoys whom Attila sent for this purpose, were two remarkable men, \u2014 Orestes, a noble Pan nonian, who was the father of the last Roman Em peror of the West, and Edecon, the father of Odoacer, the first barbarian king of Italy. The latter, dazzled by the wealth of Constantinople, was introduced by an intriguing courtier named Vigilius, to Chrysaphius, the last of those wretched eunuchs, who in succession guided the councils of the imbecile Emperor. The eunuch bribed him to compass Attila's death, and Theodosius assented to the perfidious murder. Their treacherous design, however, was overthrown by the remorse and confession of Edecon. The harsh and oppressive manner in which the em bassies of Attila exacted the surrender of the deserters, induced Theodosius to send his great chamberlain, Maximin,* accompanied by a splendid suite, including Vigilius, and the Byzantine historian, Priscus, to whom we are indebted for the account of this embassy, to the royal residence of Attila. It was situated, as some say, near Tokay ; according to other authorities, about thirty-six miles from Buda. It was half camp, half village. The palace and houses of the chiefs were of wood ; the public baths of stone, whilst the soldiers and retainers lived in tents or mud huts, thatched with straw. The harem was tastefully furnished and adorned. Vessels of gold and silver, the production * a.d. 448."], [328, "320 HISTORY OF ROME. of Greek art, were in daily use amongst these rude warriors, who displayed the same barbaric taste for gems in their dress, their horse-furniture, and their arms, as the Hungarian nobles of modern times. Attila alone preserved the ancient simplicity of his ancestors. He eschewed all personal ornament ; his table-service was of wood, and he received the im perial embassy seated on a wooden chair. When they were introduced into his presence, he convicted Vigilius of false statements as to the num ber of deserters, and then dismissed them back again to Constantinople with a stern demand of the whole number. Maximin and his suite were hospitably entertained at two regal banquets ; although the place of honour, at the right hand of Attila, was assigned to Bericus, a Gothic chieftain. The account of Priscus reminds us of the customs of feudal Europe in later times. During the feast, two Scythian bards sang the exploits of Attila; and two court fools amused the guests with their rude jests and absurd postures. Long after the ambassadors had retired, the Huns con tinued their conviviality until their merriment ended in riot and intemperance. On the third day the ambassadors returned to Constantinople loaded with presents, and entertaining hopes that they had laid the foundation of a lasting peace. There can be no doubt that the ambassadors were entirely ignorant of the conspiracy against the life of Attila, to which Theodosius had been accessory ; but this does not detract from the magnanimity of Attila in paying respect to the representatives of his per fidious enemy. When, however, after their departure,"], [329, "HISTORY OF ROME. 321 Vigilius returned, bringing to Edecon a bag of gold, the price of his master's blood, he was arrested and brought into the presence of the stern Attila. At first he had sufficient effrontery to deny his guilt ; but the threat of executing his son, who accompanied him, forced from him full confession. Attila sold the traitor his life for two hundred pounds of gold, and sent an embassy to Constantinople to demand the head of Chrysaphius, and to remonstrate with the Emperor. The latter quailed beneath the deserved rebuke, and sent his Lord High Treasurer and the Master- General of his forces with splendid presents, to im plore the clemency of the royal Hun. He received them, on the banks of the river Drenco, with his wonted sternness ; but the rich presents, of which the ambassadors were the bearers, purchased pardon for the Emperor and his base favourites, the surren der of his claim to the deserters, and the cession of a large territory south of the Danube, which he had already drained of its wealth. The cost of their Emperor's perfidy was borne by his oppressed sub jects. These events were speedily followed by the death of the Emperor. A fall from his horse injured his spine, and he expired in the fiftieth year of his age,* and after a long reign of more than forty-two years. He was buried in the tomb of his father, Arcadius, in the Church of the Apostles at Constantinople. This reign is marked in Church history by the \u0152cumenical Council of Ephesus,f which decreed the deposition of Nestorius. Theodosius is praised by the - July 28, A. D. 450. + a.

The domestic arrangements of his palace, they say, were almost like those of a monastery ; and in all his wars EPMESL his trust was, like David's, in the God of battles. To this piety and zeal for God and the Christian faith, he is said to have added a strict control of his passions and desires, habitual temperance, sobriety and endurance, a gentle and compassionate disposi tion, and a humane and benevolent regard for the"], [331, "323 HISTORY OF ROME. feelings of others. He loved a life of study \u2014 culti vated literature and science, especially astronomy, mineralogy, botany, and medicine. He was a skilful painter and sculptor, a good rider, an accurate marks man, and was celebrated for his beautiful hand writing. Although he possessed qualities calculated to adorn a private station, his defects were evidently such as to disqualify him for ruling an empire ; and hence he was ever ready to be governed by unworthy ministers, to submit to degrading humiliations ; and, as in the case of his assenting to the assassination of Attila, to be guilty of crimes totally at variance with his Christian principles. Had he been exposed to circumstances of less difficulty, he might have maintained the character which in his youth he appears to have deserved. As St. Augustine says, \" he might even have been ca nonized if his lot had been cast in the solitude of private life.\" But he was weak and irresolute, timid and pusillanimous, easily led by others. He would ruin his subjects, and enrich his enemies rather than fight a battle. He was so careless, as to trust any one in order to relieve himself from the cares of state, and sign any document which was placed before him, even without reading it. It is said, that his sister Pulcheria , in order to correct this disgraceful and dangerous fault, laid before him a document for his signature, which consigned his Empress to slavery, and when he had signed it, informed him, to his con fusion, of its contents. His weakness of character was as ruinous to the piety of the Church, which he professed to venerate, as it was to the prosperity of"], [332, "324 HISTORY OF ROME. the State ; for his contemporary, St. Isidore, hints that the ill-judged honours which he lavished on the bishops produced irreligion, and his profuse liberality tempted them to indulge in excess and luxury. In a word, he wanted that strength of will and moral courage, without which no one can govern others, and that moral discernment which qualifies a sove reign to select those great and good men who are worthy to be his counsellors. Theodosius was succeeded by his sister Pulcheria, and for a space of nearly one month the Roman empire was, for the first time, under the dominion of a woman. This princess was two years older than her late brother. She was, according to the ecclesiastical his torians, adorned with all the gifts of nature and of grace, which subsequently obtained for her the honour of canonization. At the early age of fifteen she under took the guardianship and education of the young Theodosius, and to her wisdom and discretion he owed the development of those early virtues which are enumerated and eulogized by the Church his torians of his period, Socrates, Sozomen, and Theo dores. Although on her accession she was as much under the sway of the eunuchs as her brother had been, her first act was to order the public execution of the infamous Chrysaphius and the confiscation of his enormous ill-gotten wealth.

MARCIAN was a native of Thrace; his father was a soldier of undistinguished family, and he himself, being intended for the military profession, enlisted at Philippopolis. On his way thither he found the corpse of a murdered man, and the natural kindness of his disposition prompting him to pay the last offices to the dead, he was observed, and brought before the magistrates on the charge of murder. The presumptive evidence was so strong, that he would have been condemned had not the real criminal been providentially discovered. He gave early promise of military talent, even as a private soldier, and was a great favourite with his comrades. On his march with the Roman army into Persia he fell sick, and was nursed with great care and attention by two brothers.* When convalescent, he was out hunting with his two friends, and, fatigued * A.D. 421."], [334, "326 HISTORY OF ROME. with the chace, fell asleep in the sun at noon-day. Whilst he was sleeping, his friends discovered an eagle hovering over him, and shading him with its outspread wings. The brothers, thinking it an omen, awoke him, and asked him what he would give them if he became emperor. Marcian laughed at the idea ; but upon their repeating the demand, he pro mised to make them patricians. On taking leave of them, they gave him two hundred crowns, and said, \" Do not forget us when God has raised you to your high fortunes.\" This anecdote carries the imagina tion back to the legendary period of Roman history. AtUEDLCT AT CONSTANTINOPLE. On arriving at Constantinople, Marcian attached himself to the service of Ardaburius, and his son Aspar, and accompanied the latter into Africa, in his"], [335, "HISTORY OF ROME. 327 disastrous war against Genseric, the Vandal king.* There he was taken prisoner; but recovering his liberty he returned to Constantinople, and was deservedly elevated to the rank of Tribune and Senator. At the time of his marriage with Pulcheria, he was a widower, with an only daughter, who became the wife of Anthemius, afterwards Emperor of the West. As Marcian was a zealous supporter of the orthodox party in the Church, and an uncompromising oppo nent of heresy, he is celebrated by the ecclesiastical historians for the possession of every virtue which could shed a lustre over the character of a Christian emperor. If their panegyrics are to be trusted \u2014 and there is no positive reason for doubting them \u2014 no emperor since Constantine was to be compared to him for the wise selection of his ministers, and for the administration of his government. The laws which he enacted for the reformation of morals and suppression of prevalent vices are themselves an indication of the purity and uprightness of the legislator. Nor was his courage inferior to his other virtues. When the insolent Attila demanded payment of the tribute which Theodosius had so pusillanimously engaged to pay, the reply of Marcian to his envoys was, that the Romans had no intention of continuing his tributary ; that they would send him liberal presents if he was willing to be their friend, but would oppose him with armies fully equal to his own if he declared himself their enemy. Attila was evidently impressed with the undaunted spirit of the \u2022A.D. 431."], [336, "328 HISTORY OF ROME. Eastern Emperor, for he contented himself with empty threats against Marcian, and concentrated all his forces against the West. The first important event in the new reign was the assembling of the council of Chalcedon, at which Marcian was personally present (Oct. 25) .* He had summoned an \u0152cumenical Council to meet at Nic\u00e6a on the 1st of September, but some troubles in Illyricum, occasioned by an irruption of the Huns, interfered, and caused its postponement until they were quelled. He cemented a close alliance with Valentinian III., but the part which he took in aiding him against the formidable Attila, belongs rather to the history of the Western Empire. The frontiers of his empire were temporarily disturbed by wars with the Sara cens^ Persians, and Nubians; but they were speedily concluded, and peace re- established.^ In the third year of his reign the Empress Pulcheria died, and he gladly executed the provisions of her will, by which she bequeathed all her property to the poor. This virtuous prince died in the seventh year of his short and uneventful reign, either by disease, or, as some say, poisoned by Aspar, having attained the age of sixty-five years.^f * Oct. 8 to Nov. 1, a.d. 451.

Whether Aspar was guilty of the murder of his sovereign or not, he had influence enough to nominate his successor to the purple, and to obtain the unani mous consent of the people. As he could not secure the empire for himself, being a Goth or Alan by birth, and an Arian in religion, he conferred it upon his favourite officer, Leo, although Anthemius, the son-in law of Marcian, had the justest hereditary claim. This fortunate soldier, surnamed in history the Thracian, although some say he was an Illyrian by birth, com manded the troops quartered in Selymbria, with the rank of tribune. The army proclaimed him emperor on the 7th of February, and he was crowned by Anatolius, Patriarch of Constantinople, furnishing the first example of a sovereign receiving his crown at episcopal hands. The Greeks gave Leo the title of Great, whilst others have called him Macellus, or \" the Butcher,\" because he is accused of having put to death Aspar and his children. Leo was of small stature, and without any edu cation, but possessed, nevertheless, good natural abilities. His morals were irreproachable ; but amidst conflicting testimonies, it is impossible to arrive at a true estimate of his character as a sove reign or a man. Suidas accuses him of cruelty, which flattery alone could appease ; of implacable anger and insatiable avarice. On the other hand, the Church authorities eulogize his virtues and great qualities as a blessing to the Roman empire and the Christian"], [338, "330 HISTORY OF ROME. religion ; they praise his piety to God and his charity to man ; and add that he was terrible as a lion to the enemies of God and the State, but to those who were obedient to the laws of God and of justice, he was a true David, a shepherd full of benevolence, or rather a sheep, whose distinguishing attributes were gen tleness and simplicity. There is no doubt that his faith was orthodox, and his zeal for the Church un wearied; that he had a great respect for bishops, was a great builder of churches, and a liberal giver of alms. No event of historical interest appears to have marked the first few years of Leo's reign.* In the seventh his tranquillity was interrupted by dangers in Illyricum. Valamir, one of Attila's generals, was, together with his two brothers, Theodemir and Widemir, as colleagues, chieftain of the Ostrogoths. Marcian had assigned to them a large tract of land in Pannonia, extending from Sirmich to Vienna. They do not appear to have been absolute masters of this territory, but to have enjoyed possession of the land only, whilst the towns belonged to the Emperor and the ancient inhabitants. Their chiefs also appear to have been as it were great vassals of the Emperor of the East, and to have acknowledged him as their feudal sovereign. He, however, was accustomed to send them an annual present, to secure the friendship of these dangerous tenants. Offended at some delay on the part of Leo in send ing this money, Valamir and his brothers burst into Illyricum, laid waste the country and pillaged the * A. D. 461."], [339, "HISTORY OF ROME. 331 towns before they could make effectual resistance. Anthemius, however, the son-in-law of Marcian, being despatched thither with an army, obliged the invaders to retire with some loss. Leo then sent envoys to Valamir, complaining of his treachery, and offering to pay all arrears, and three hundred pounds of gold yearly for the future. Peace was thus re-established, and Valamir sent to Leo as a hostage for his good behaviour his nephew Theodoric, afterwards king of Italy, who was then a child of eight years old. Leo treated the boy with the greatest kindness, gave him a good education, and sent him back to Valamir, at the age of eighteen, with magnificent presents. The few events which occurred in the reign of Leo, besides those which more properly find their place in the contemporary history of the Western Empire, are briefly these : \u2014 The refusal of the Huns to pay their customary tribute to the Persian Shah, Peroze, involved the latter in a long and harassing warfare. He accordingly sent an embassy to Con stantinople,* requesting help towards the expenses of the war, and troops to defend a border fortress in the neighbourhood of the Georgian town of Teflis. He alleged that the abandonment of this fortress would expose the Roman as well as the Persian territories to the inroads of the barbarians. The court of Constantinople replied, that these circumstances furnished no grounds for their interference, but promised that they would send an envoy to discuss the propositions of Peroze. This promise was performed, but the embassy produced no results. * A.D. 464."], [340, "332 HISTORY OF ROME. The same year Constantinople became the prey of a terrible conflagration. Eight of the fourteen wards of this magnificent city were reduced to a heap of ruins. The fire continued to burn without diminution in its violence during four days and nights, and was not entirely extinguished until the close of the seventh day. The space thus reduced to a desert measured fourteen stadia by five. In order to strengthen himself against the intrigues of Aspar, who had elevated him to the purple, and who wished to exercise that authority in the name of the Emperor, which, as an Arian, he could not achieve for himself, Leo married his daughter, Ariadne, to Zeno, an Isaurian noble, on whom he conferred the rank of patrician, the command of the household troops, and also of the imperial armies in the East.* To this alliance, Zeno owed, a few years afterwards, his elevation to the purple. The disagree ment, however, which seemed to be imminent between him and Aspar, was reconciled by affiancing his younger daughter Leontia to Patricius, the son of Aspar, whom he also elevated to the dignity of C\u00e6sar.f This reconciliation, however, did not hinder Aspar from forming fresh intrigues, and even from forming designs against the life of the Emperor. Leo's suspicions were awakened, and Aspar and his sons were assassinated in the palace by the swords of the eunuchs. In him the Arian party lost a powerful protector ; and no sooner was he dead, than the Emperor issued rigorous edicts, depriving them of * A.D. 468. f a.d. 471."], [341, "HISTORY OF ROME. 333 their churches, and forbidding them from holding any religious assemblies. Leo, now finding the infirmities of age increase, was anxious to nominate his successor. His inclina tions turned to his son-in-law Zeno ; but his Isaurian extraction rendered him so unpopular, that the inten tions of Leo caused the outbreak of a riot, in which many persons lost their lives. Seeing, therefore, the impossibility of conferring the diadem upon Zeno, his choice fell upon his grandson,* a youth of fifteen or sixteen years old, who bore his own name ; and in the commencement of the following year he expired, after a reign of seventeen years.f LEO II.

The history now returns to the distracted affairs of the Western Empire. The death of Bonifacius,* left Aetius without a rival. Backed as he was by his faithful Huns, the Empress Placidia felt and acknow ledged him to be her master, even whilst he con descended to sue for pardon. She elevated him to the rank of patrician, and permitted him to assume the office of Master-General of the cavalry and infantry. This proud and perfidious man possessed many great qualities which fitted him for his high position. Endued with manly grace and beauty, he excelled in horsemanship and all martial exercises. He did not know what fear was, his bodily powers of endur ance were invincible, and these were equalled by the vigour of his mental faculties. The barbarians at once feared and respected him, and he was thus able to maintain the frontier of Italy against the inroads of the Vandals, to secure the cooperation of the Franks, * A.D. 432."], [343, "335 HISTORY OF ROME. and to make the Roman power felt in Gaul and Spain. He kept up a close connexion with the Huns, to whose myriads he owed his restoration, educated his son in their camp, and was on terms of mutual friend ship with Attila himself. An army of Huns and Alani defended the Rhone and the Loire, and kept in check the Visigoths, the Franks, and the Burgundians. Of these, the first were settled in the south of Gaul, the Franks occupied Belgium, the Burgundians con stituted a hereditary monarchy in Savoy and the south-eastern portion of modern Burgundy, but paid tribute to the Romans, whilst Provence, Dauphine\", Lower Languedoc, Auvergne, the Lower Loire, the whole of the north-west of Gaul, and the principal part of Spain bordering on the Mediterranean, recog nised the supremacy of Rome. Such was the relative condition of those nations which divided the Western Empire at the period of Attila's invasion of Gaul. The following were the events which immediately led to it. Clodion, the first of the Merovingian dynasty,\u2014 the \" Long-haired Kings\" as they were called, because they wore their fair hair in wavy curls, whilst the Franks their subjects shaved the back part of their heads, \u2014 had his capital at Dispargne, a fortified village situated between Brussels and Louvain. Meeting with a favourable opportunity, he crossed with his forces a part of the Forest of Ardennes, and con quered the country as far as the river Somme. The victorious army lay encamped in the plains of Artois, celebrating the marriage of the son of Clodion, when"], [344, "336 HISTORY OF ROME. they were suddenly surprised by Aetius, at the head of a body of light cavalry. The Franks were vanquished, and their camp pillaged, but neverthe less maintained undisturbed possession of their do minions. On the death of Clodion, a quarrel broke out be tween his two sons, of whom Merov\u00e6us, the younger, put himself under the protection of Rome, whilst the elder solicited and obtained the aid of Attila. At the same time, the king of the Huns demanded the hand of Honoria, the sister of Valentinian. The majesty of Rome could not brook the idea of one of her princesses being numbered amongst the numerous wives of a barbarian monarch, and his proposals were declined. Honoria would willingly have accepted him, but she was immediately sent to Italy, married to a husband of obscure rank, and condemned to perpetual impri sonment. The tribes of Germany and Mcesia flocked to the standard of Attila, and, marching from the plains of Hungary, he was joined by his Frank allies at the confluence of the Neckar and the Rhine. The river was crossed by means of a bridge of boats, and the savage hosts poured into Belgium. The principal cities of that fertile country were besieged and taken, and the inhabitants massacred without distinction either of sex or age. Onward he marched, and met with little resistance from the panic-stricken Gauls. The Seine was crossed at Auxerre, and the Huns encamped beneath the walls of Orleans. The fortifications of this city had been recently repaired, and the citizens, inspired with fresh courage by the preaching of their Bishop,"], [345, "337 HISTORY OF ROME. Anianus, were able, day by day, to ward off the attacks of the enemy. All who could not man the walls were engaged in constant prayer. At length, a sentinel, who kept strict watch from the ramparts, announced to Anianus the appearance of a small cloud on the horizon. \" It is the help of God!\" exclaimed the bishop, and his words were echoed by the hopeful citizens. Larger and larger loomed the cloud, and on a sudden the dust cleared away, and a relieving army became visible, its banners waving, and its arms gleaming in the sunshine. It was the allied forces of the Romans and the Visigoths. Theodoric, the sovereign of the latter, had at first, through jealousy of Aetius, refused his cooperation, but Avitus, a Roman senator, who was living in retirement on his property at Auvergne, painted to him in such lively colours the ruinous consequences of permitting an ambitious barbarian to penetrate into the heart of Gaul, and exhorted with such eloquence the Gothic warriors to fight for their homes and altars, that Theodoric hesitated no longer, and many other tribes joined the allies, and marched with alacrity to the relief of the beleaguered city. The advance of so formidable an allied force induced Attila to raise the siege, recross the Seine, and to take up his position in the broad plains of Champagne (Campi Catalaunici) . He was not, however, permitted to make good his retreat unopposed. The Romans and Visigoths pressed upon his rear, and in the various skirmishes which ensued no fewer than fifteen thousand of his troops were cut off before the commencement of the pitched battle. This memorable conflict is commonly Q"], [346, "338 HISTORY OF ROME. called the battle of Chalons* {Duro-Catalaunum), but, as the champagne countiy, to which the city gives its name, extends round it over a length of one hundred and fifty and a breadth of one hundred miles, it is manifestly impossible accurately to determine the exact scene of the battle.f Attila, at the head of the Huns, occupied the centre of the army, opposite to the Alani, on whose fidelity no dependence could be placed. Aetius commanded the left wing of the Roman army, Theodoric the right, and Thorismond, his brave young heir, had succeeded in occupying some rising ground which commanded the flank of the enemy's position. At first victory appeared to declare in favour of the Huns, for, owing to the treachery of the Alani, they broke the Roman centre, and Theodoric, mortally wounded by a javelin, fell from his horse, and was trampled to death. The Visigoths, however, who were shaken for a time by the flight of the Alani, rallied, and Thorismond, charging from the rising ground, turned the fortune of the day. He, like his father, was thrown from his horse, but was rescued by his staff. Aetius reached the camp of the Visi goths in safety, to be gladdened with the news of the victory which his allies had gained, and the Huns made good their retreat to their camp, which, accord ing to their custom, was protected by a barricade of waggons. Thorismond was elevated on a buckler by his enthusiastic people, a ceremony which with them was equivalent to a coronation. The number of the slain is said to have amounted * a.d. 451. f See Niebuhr's Lectures, cxxxvii."], [347, "HISTORY OF ROME. 339 to one hundred and sixty-two thousand, or even three hundred thousand. Either of these numbers, notwith standing the carnage which the experience of history assigns to undisciplined armies of barbarians, is totally incredible. Attila, like a \"lion at bay, successfully defended his intrenched camp against the assaults of his enemies ; and Aetius, fearing that the victorious Goths would be as dangerous to the empire as the conquered Huns, persuaded Thorismond to withdraw his army. His sudden retirement, after so great a victory, caused Attila to suspect a stratagem ; he therefore remained for some days within his intrench ments, and then retreated across the Rhine. The Franks, under Merov\u00e6us, harassed his rear as far as the borders of Thuringia. No ill- success, however, had power to overcome the perseverance of Attila. He again demanded the hand of the Princess Honoria,* and being again re fused, he passed the Alps with an overwhelming force, and laid siege to Aquileia, one of the richest and strongest cities on the shores of the Hadriatic, and the metropolis of Venetia. Aided by the faith lessness of Roman engineers, the barbarians brought to bear upon the walls a formidable siege-train. For three months the city held out, and the failure of pro visions, and the murmurs of his troops, determined Attila to raise the siege. He was just upon the point of issuing his orders, when he observed a stork fly with its brood from one of the bastions. Immediately calling the attention of the army to this circumstance, he exclaimed, \" Those birds, animated by a presenti- * a.d. 452. 0.2"], [348, "340 HISTORY OF ROME. ment of the future, abandon a town which is on the point of ruin.\" The attack was renewed with fresh spirit, and the city fell. It was pillaged with pitiless cruelty, and scarcely a vestige was left. Thenceforward his march was one of triumph. His line of march became a desert, and he was wont to say that grass never grew where his horse's hoof had trod. The rich plains of Lombardy became a scene of devastation. Vicenza, Verona, and the other principal towns were either plundered or razed to the ground. Milan and Pavia purchased their safety and the lives of their inhabitants by unresisting submission. In the former city he found a picture representing the kings of Scythia doing homage to the enthroned Emperor of Rome, and the indignant conqueror employed an artist to reverse the relative position of the figures. After the battle of Chalons, Thorismond had re turned to Toulouse, the Visigoths' capital, where he administered the government with such wisdom that, notwithstanding the intriguing spirit of his brothers and the power of his nobles, he met with no oppo sition to his authority. This calm, however, did not endure long. Thorismond was of a warlike spirit, whilst his brothers used their utmost endeavours to maintain peace, and finding their remonstrances un availing, his two eldest, Theodoric and Frederic, deter mined upon his death. He made a brave resistance to the assassins whom they sent for the purpose, but was at length overpowered and slain.* Theodoric ascended the throne which he had obtained by fratricide. * a.d. 453."], [349, "HISTORY OF ROME. 341 The invasion of Attila led to the foundation of the enterprising commercial republic of Venice. The exiled inhabitants of the fifty flourishing cities of Venetia took refuge in the numerous islands inter sected and separated from the mainland by lagoons, which are situated in the innermost recesses of the gulf. \" Like waterfowl,\" writes Cassiodorus, \" they fixed their nests on the bosom of the waves.\" Fish was their only food, even seventy years after their immigra tion, and this and salt their only articles of barter and commerce. They were governed by twelve tribunes, annually elected, the representatives of the twelve principal islands. Such were the early founders of the great Venetian oligarchy, which maintained their independence even when the whole of Italy had sub mitted to a Gothic king. Although Aetius alone was fearless and self-pos sessed at this terrible crisis, neither Valentinian nor his subjects appreciated his value. The cowardly Emperor fled to Rome, and sent Avienus with an embassy to negotiate with Attila. This senator, in addition to rank, wealth, and influence, possessed talents admirably qualified for a diplomatic mission, and Leo, the great Bishop of Rome, was one of the embassy. Attila gave them audience at Ariolica (Peschiera), situated at the confluence of the Mincius (Menzo) with the lake Benacus {Lago di Garda). The barbarian was not indisposed to treat. His troops, accustomed to the hard fare and privations of their native country, were, like those of Hannibal at Capua, becoming effeminate and indolent amidst the luxuries of Italy. The intemperate indulgence"], [350, "342 HISTORY OF ROME. of their appetites caused disease, and death began to thin the ranks of his army. Superstitious fears, moreover, suggested a retreat. A picture of Raphael, in the Vatican, represents the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul appearing to Attila, threatening him with death if he did not leave Italy, and seconding the eloquence of the Roman bishop. The terms on which he consented to evacuate Italy were the hand of the Princess Honoria and a large dowry. When he had returned to his own country, his turbulent spirit could not rest in peace. He menaced Marcian with war if he did not pay the tribute promised by Theodosius the younger; and, according to the historian Jornandes, meditated an attack upon the Alani, but was defeated by Thoris mond as signally as he had been at Chalons. History furnishes no further information respecting Attila until his death.* Not content with his nume rous wives, he married a young and beautiful girl named Ildico. On the marriage night, overcome with wine, he fell asleep lying on his back. In this unwholesome posture the current of his blood was stopped, a vessel burst, and he was choked. The royal warrior who had escaped so many bloody deaths in battle, met one at last through intoxication. In the morning the officers of his household, finding that he did not make his appearance, and receiving no answer to their repeated calls, burst open the door of the nuptial chamber and found him dead, covered with blood, but without a wound. His young bride sat beside him, with veiled face, and bathed in tears. * a.d. 453, or 454."], [351, "HISTORY OF ROME. 343 The historian Priscus assures us that the death of Attila was miraculously revealed to the Emperor Marcian that very night, by the apparition of a broken bow, which signified that all his warlike enterprises were at an end. Marcellinus records as a prevailing rumour, that his wife was his murderess, \u2014 that, like a second Holofernes, he met with a Judith in his bride. But there is no foundation for this suspicion. His funeral was celebrated according to the rites of his nation. The body lay in state under a silken canopy, whilst chosen knights rode round chanting in mournful tones the exploits of their king. A merry banquet succeeded, and at nightfall the corpse was buried. It was enclosed in three coffins, one of iron, which symbolized the subjugation of nations by his sword ; one of gold, and one of silver, representing the rich spoils which had been the fruits of his vic tories. Arms and jewels were thrown into the grave, and those who dug it were slain, and had no other recompense than a cruel death. The empire which owed its existence to Attila crumbled to pieces at his death. He had wished that Ellac, his eldest son, should be his successor, but his numerous brothers insisted that their father's dominions should be shared equally amongst them. They ruined one another by bloody wars, and thus enabled the tribes which he had subjugated to fight for their independence. Ardaric, king of the Gepid\u00e6, could not endure the idea that powerful chieftains and warlike nations should be divided amongst the sons of Attila like slaves or cattle. On raising the standard of freedom he was joined by many German"], [352, "344 HISTORY OF ROME. and Scythian nations, and gave battle to Ellac on the banks of the Netad, a river in Pannonia. His victory was a decisive one ; three thousand of his adversaries were left dead upon the field, and Ellac, after performing prodigies of valour, was slain. This battle, and its consequences, reduced the Huns to the necessity of confining themselves to the tracts of country near the Euxine, and the mouths of the Danube, which they had won from the Goths eighty years before. The Gepid\u00e6, under their king Ardaric, remained masters of all Dacia north of the Danube ; Hernac, the youngest son of Attila, retired with a large number of Huns into Lesser Scythia, where they were overwhelmed by a fresh inroad of barbarian hordes ; and Dengizic, another son of Attila, venturing to wage war against the Emperor Leo, was conquered and slain,* and his head ex posed in the Hippodrome at Constantinople. In ten years from this time the Huns were utterly unknown in history, the relics of the race having migrated to some far distant region. All the world hoped that the Western Empire, relieved from Attila and Thorismond, was about to enjoy some repose. Aetius was the support and pro tection of the feeble Valentinian, and all men hailed him as the terror of Attila, and the saviour of the empire. But his well-deserved power and influence rendered him an object of suspicion and alarm to the weak and therefore jealous Emperor. A court eunuch named Heraclius played upon his fears by insinuating that Aetius was too ambitious to be loyal, and too * A. d. 468."], [353, "HISTORY OF ROME. 345 powerful to be a subject. Aetius himself gave some grounds for these accusations by his unguarded con duct. Valentinian had promised his eldest daughter Eudoxia to Aetius' son, Gaudentius. Aetius pressed the immediate performance of this promise with in discreet warmth and urgency. Valentinian, who by this time was persuaded that he was not safe so long as Aetius lived, sent for the general to the palace. He came, attended by his intimate friend Boethius, the Pr\u00e6torian Prefect, but he was conducted alone into the imperial presence chamber. At this interview he urged the celebration of the marriage, and Valentinian, irritated, drew his sword and plunged it into his breast.* The officers who stood around, and amongst them the eunuch Heraclius, aided in the assassination, and Boethius and the rest of his suite were put to death. This foolish, as well as cowardly deed, struck, in the opinion of all wise and generous men, a fatal blow to the empire, from which it never recovered. It is related that when the Emperor asked a simple-minded Roman whether he had done well in killing Aetius, he received the following reply : \u2014 \" I know not whether you have done well or ill, but this I know, you have cut off your right hand with your left.\" The dissolute conduct of the effeminate Valentinian, whom the poet Sidonius calls an idiot and but half a man {semivir amens), eventually caused his death. By stratagem and violence he outraged the chastity of the wife of Petronius Maximus, a senator of illus trious family. The injured husband resolved on * a.d. 454. q3"], [354, "346 HISTORY OF ROME. vengeance, and found willing instruments in two officers of the murdered Aetius. For a while they dissembled their purpose, watching for a favourable opportunity; but one day, when Valentinian was diverting himself in the Campus Martius, they threw themselves upon him in the face of his whole court, and, unopposed, stabbed first the eunuch Heraclius, who was in attendance, and next the Emperor himself.

There was an old tradition, founded upon the inter pretation of the Roman augurs, and recorded by Varro, Claudian, and Sidonius, that the twelve vul tures which appeared to Romulus symbolized twelve centuries, the future duration of the imperial city. Allowing even for some uncertainty as to the chro nology, this period had elapsed, or nearly so, since the building of Rome. And this belief, coupled with the misfortunes of the times, caused a general fear that the downfall of the empire was near at hand. Nor was it far distant, and the events of history tended to the verification of the legend. Whilst the public burdens were immensely increased, and pressed with their greatest weight upon the mass of the popula tion, the resources of the state were squandered with profuse extravagance. The means of supplying this were wrung from the sinews of the provincials by"], [356, "348 HISTORY OF ROME. confiscation, and even by torture. They hated the very name of Roman citizens. Some sought refuge with the barbarians ; others, like parts of Gaul and Spain, were reduced by intolerable tyranny to the condition of barbarians themselves. Rome called them rebels, whilst she herself had driven them to be criminals. The elements of which the empire was composed seemed to be in a state of mutual repulsion ; its parts grew more and more alienated from each other. Thus was the Roman Empire fast crumbling to decay, not only by the external force of barbarian conquerors, but because it possessed within itself the seeds of ruin and destruction. PETRONIUS MAXIMUS. BORN A.D. 395; DIED A. D. 455. The author of Valentinian's death immediately assumed the purple, and on the day following the assassination was proclaimed Augustus.* Petronius Maximus was of noble family and great wealth, and had filled the principal offices of the state before he arrived at the sovereignty. At the early age of nine teen he was a privy councillor, and was successively count or intendant of imperial largesses {Chancellor of the Exchequer), prefect of Rome, consul, and finally he arrived at the dignity of patrician at the age of fifty. He was fond of letters, social, popular, and, until tempted by ambition, loved a quiet life, and passed his time in pleasure and luxury. He had not passed a single night in the palace before he began * March 17, a.d. 455."], [357, "HISTORY OF ROME. 349 to repent of exchanging his former tranquil and easy life for the cares of royalty. \" Happy Damocles,\" he said on one occasion, \" whose reign was limited to a single dinner ;\" and in a letter to Sidonius he writes, \" I know not if there is happiness in aspiring to a crown ; but this I know, that there is misery in arriving at one.\" As Maximus had acquitted himself with credit in the high offices which he had previously held, it was hoped that he would be equal to the exigencies of his new position ; but events proved that he was incapable of coping with the difficulties and dangers which now environed the empire. The people were discontented ; the troops, both Roman and allied, mutinous. The Franks and Alemanni were in arms, and the Visigoths were preparing for war. In this crisis Maximus appointed Avitus, who had retired into private life, general -in -chief of the Roman armies, or at least of those in Gaul, and instructed him to open negotiations with the Visigoths. Owing to his energy, the Alemanni apologised for crossing the Rhine, the Saxons retired from the seaboard of Gaul, and the Franks to the banks of the Elbe. He was just upon the point of concluding a treaty with Theodoric, King of the Visigoths, at Toulouse, when the news of the death of Maximus caused him to alter his policy. The very means which Maximus thought best calculated to establish the security of his throne, brought his brief and unhappy reign to a close. His wife was dead, and he compelled the widowed Eudoxia, before the days of her mourning were"], [358, "350 HISTORY OF ROME. over, to marry the murderer of her husband. He also gave the Princess Eudocia in marriage to his son Palladius. The Queen, indignant at the violence done to her feelings, wrote with her own hand and sent presents to Genseric, the Vandal king, who was still in Africa, conjuring him, by his friendship for Valentinian, to avenge his death, and rescue herself from her degraded position. Genseric did not need much persuasion. The pillage of Rome was sufficient motive. He therefore set sail with a numerous fleet, and appeared at the mouth of the Tiber before the incompetent Maximus had taken any measures to oppose him. Not only Maximus, but all his courtiers fled for their lives, his enraged people attacked him with stones, and a Roman soldier named Ursus gave him the fatal wound.* His corpse was dragged through the town, mangled by the populace, and finally thrown into the Tiber. Palladius, his son, perished with his father. He had borne the empty title of Emperor three months all but five days. Genseric disembarked at Ostia, and in three days after the death of Maximus made his entrance into Rome. He found it utterly defenceless, but at the gates he was met by its brave Bishop, Leo, who prevailed upon him to spare the city from fire, and sword, and torture. For fourteen days Rome was given up to pillage, the wealth of the imperial palace, the personal jewels of the royal family, the gilt bronze roof of the Capitol, the treasures of the churches, the golden candlestick and sacred vessels * June 12."], [359, "HISTORY OF ROME. 351 which Titus had brought from the temple of Jerusa lem, and which had been deposited in the Temple of Peace, were carried on board the ships of Genseric, and conveyed to the ancient rival city of Rome. Thousands of captives swelled the train of the conqueror, and amongst them Gaudastius, the son of Aetius, and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters, Placidia and Eudocia. The whole armada arrived safe at Carthage save one vessel, which bore the sacrilegious spoils of the Capitol. The wretched captives met with Christian kindness from St. Deo gratias, who was then Bishop of Carthage. Eudoxia was sent six years afterwards to the court of Leo, with Placidia, her second daughter, who afterwards married the emperor Olybrius ; whilst Eudocia became the wife of Hunneric, Genseric's son and heir. FLAVIUS M\u00c6CILLUS AVITUS. ABDICATED A.D. 456. Avitus, the general- in-chief, was an Auvergnat of illustrious descent, had served under Aetius, and had by his merits risen to the Pr\u00e6torian Prefecture of Gaul. The Visigoths, with whom he had been sent to treat, honoured and respected his just and upright character, and Theodoric pressed him to accept the vacant purple. Accordingly, after some show of un willingness, he suffered himself to be proclaimed emperor by the Goths* He did not, however, exercise the imperial authority until he was elected by the representatives of the Gauls at their annual * July 10, a. D. 456."], [360, "352 HISTORY OF ROME. assembly at Aries ,* and proclaimed Augustus by the army and the provincials. In order to increase his security, the new Emperor sought and obtained the assent of Marcian to his elevation. From Aries, Avitus proceeded to Rome, whither he had been summoned by the people, and was by them received as Emperor. He was accompanied by his son-in-law, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris. On the first day of the ensuing year he pronounced, amidst the applauses of the Senate and people, a pane gyric on the Emperor. Little did he deserve this fulsome adulation, and the poet's augury of a long and prosperous reign proved him to have been no prophet. The first disturbances which broke the peace of his short reign were the perils which threatened Spain. A body of Heruli from Scandinavia made a descent upon Gallicia ; but though they were driven to their vessels by the inhabitants, they committed great ravages on the shores of the Bay of Biscay.\") Almost contemporaneously, Rechiarius, king of the Suevi, who were settled in that province, taking advantage of the troubles of the empire, laid waste the province of Carthagena, with the design of ren dering himself master of the whole peninsula. Avitus accordingly sent Count Fronto to negotiate a treaty of peace. Theodoric also entreated Rechiarius, who had married his sister, to cease from his usurpations and not to break with him. Rechiarius nevertheless proceeded to lay waste Tarragona, and when Theo doric again remonstrated, fiercely replied that he * August 8. f a. D. 456."], [361, "HISTORY OF ROME. 353 would render an account of his actions at Toulouse. Theodoric, without more delay, met the Suevi, with a vast army of Visigoths and Burgundians, twelve miles from Astorga, on the banks of the Urbicus.* Rechiarius, being entirely defeated, fled for his life, and the enemy, pursuing him, entered and pillaged Braga, his capital. The fugitive king reached Oporto,f where he was seized and put to death. This victory put an end to the kingdom of the Suevi. The ruin of the Suevi excited the wrath of the Count Ricimer, who was the bravest and best general in Italy. Although his mother Vallia was the daughter of a Gothic king, his father was a Suevian. He had surprised off Corsica a Vandal fleet of sixty ships, and utterly destroyed them. Returning in triumph to Italy, he met Avitus at Placentia and compelled him to abdicate the throne. He gave him his life, and he retired to Placentia. The remainder of his career is differently related : some say he died at Placentia ; others, that he sought an asylum from the wrath of his enemies at Brionde in Auvergne, and there died, either by disease or by the hand of the executioner. The statement that he was Bishop of Placentia rests on the authority of Ughelli only. In his reign the Burgundians migrated from Savoy to the province which now bears their name, and made themselves masters of the city of Lyons. t Sunday, Oct. 28. * Oct. 5."], [362, "354 HISTORY OF ROME. MAJORIANUS. DIED A. D. 461. After the deposition of Avitus,* the Empire of the West remained for some time without a master. It is probable, however, that Marcian and his successor Leo declared themselves possessors of the vacant throne, as was the case with Theodosius the Younger after the death of Honorius, and Marcian also after the death of Valentinian III. Under the sanction of one of these princes, Ricimer was made Patrician of Italy, and Majorian succeeded him as Master- General.f The latter soon exchanged his military command for the imperial purple, with the unanimous consent of the army, the Senate, and the people, and the sanction of the Eastern Emperor. He was proclaimed Augustus in the neighbourhood of Ravenna. \\ The testimony of the impartial historian Proco pius, confirming the otherwise suspicious panegyric of Sidonius, proves that the youthful Emperor was truly a great man. To personal graces, a counte nance beaming with courage, and hair the colour of gold, he added the accomplishments of a soldier. He was vigilant, ardent, courageous, sanguine, inde fatigable. He had no low propensities, and was free from avarice. When his fortune was small, he was content and liberal, his conversation and manners were gay and cheerful, and yet he never demeaned himself below his rank. His amiable disposition * Oct. 6 or 16. f Feb. 28, A. D. 457. X April 1 (?)."], [363, "HISTORY OF ROME. 355 endeared him to all, and when he became emperor he was kind to his subjects and terrible to his enemies. Procopius adds, that he surpassed all his predecessors in every virtue. His father was one of the officers of Aetius, and his mother the daughter of a former Majorian, who, in Pannonia, in the reign of Gratian, was Master-General of the cavalry and infantry. He himself served with such credit under Aetius, that he soon provoked the jealousy of his general, and was obliged to retire from the service. After the death of Aetius he was reinstated, and gained the friendship of Ricimer. His first exploit as successor to Ricimer was a victory over nine hundred Alemanni, who made a descent upon Rh\u0153tia and were laying waste the \" Campi Canini,\" a district near Bellinzona, on the shores of the Lago Maggiore. Although, as is natural to a poet, Sidonius celebrates the praises of Majorian principally as a warrior, the nobleness of his sentiments and his practical wisdom are pre-eminent in his civil administration and in the laws which he enacted. A letter of his to the Senate* declares his firm resolution to maintain justice, protect innocence, and to reward virtue ; it expresses his hatred of informers, and his determi nation to exterminate them. In a general order addressed to the provincial governors,! he com mands them to protect the weak against the strong, and to report to him every violation of law and justice. His nine laws, which are found in the Theodosian Code, amongst other things, enacted a free discharge . jan, 13. f March 9."], [364, "356 HISTORY OF ROME. of all arrears of tribute, and extinguished the ex tortionate and arbitrary powers of those who assessed and collected the revenue. He ordered the return of all municipal magistrates to their towns, redressing at the same time the grievances which had led to their absenteeism ; and impressed upon the people the duty of electing as their magistrates men of un doubted wisdom and integrity. Having thus discharged the duties of peace, he directed his vigilant care against the enemies of his country. He defeated the Visigoths in Gaul,* granted peace and alliance to their king, Theodoric, and ob tained from him a promise of aid against the Vandals. These barbarians effected a landing near Sinuessa, at the mouth of the Liris {Garigliano) , but were driven back to their ships with great loss ; and the brother-in-law of Genseric, who commanded them, was slain. In the ensuing year j\" he resolved to seek the Vandals in Africa itself. Ever since their settle ment in that province, their piratical habits had been productive of misery and wretchedness to the neigh bourhood. Not only were all the Roman families who possessed estates in Africa utterly ruined, but their marauding expeditions extended to the islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, and the coasts of Italy. In order to crush these mischievous foes entirely, he assembled a powerful fleet in the Gulf of Alicant, near Carthagena. But Genseric, having received some secret information, attacked and burnt the fleet of his enemy. The enterprise of Majorian was thus at an end, and he commenced his return to * a.d. 45S-9. t a.d. 460."], [365, "HISTORY OF ROME. 357 Italy. Ricimer, to whom he owed his kingdom, had become jealous of his high reputation. Those who lived by the abuses which he had reformed wished his downfall, and his ill-fortune at Carthagena diminished his popularity. The patrician compelled him to abdicate at Tortona,* and five days afterwards he caused him to be assassinated \u2014 unless, as some say, he died of dysentery. LIBIUS SEVERUS. died a.d. 465. By the intrigues and at the command of Ricimer, the Senate conferred the vacant purple on Libius Severus, a Lucanian of obscure birth. All that is recorded of his character is, that he was a man of piety. There is no doubt that he was a mere puppet in the hands of Ricimer, who, as long as he reigned, was virtual, and for the two succeeding years actual, ruler of Italy. Two Roman commanders maintained an independent authority beyond the Alps : Mar cellinus in Dalmatia, as Patrician of the West, and \u00c6gidius in Gaul, with the title of Master-General. The Franks elected the latter as their king, but after four years they restored the Merovingian dynasty. Vandal pirates still continued to commit constant ravages on every coast of the Western Empire, and some of these expeditions were led by the aged Genseric in person. Severus died at Rome, to all appearance a natural death, though not without some suspicion of having been poisoned by Ricimer.f * Aug. 2, A.

An interregnum of nearly two years ensued, during which Ricimer made a fruitless expedition against the Vandals in Africa.* At his request Leo appointed Anthemius Emperor.f He was the son of Procopius, patrician and general, and claimed descent from Procopius, a relation of Constantius and of Julian the Apostate. He married Euphemia, the only daughter of Marcian, and gave his own daughter in marriage to Ricimer. This near connexion, how ever, did not prevent a misunderstanding arising between the Emperor and his son-in-law. So serious did it at length become, that the latter left Rome and retired to Milan, and both began hostile preparations. The mediation of St. Epiphanius, Bishop of Pavia, averted the evils of civil war, and, to the joy of everyone, brought about a reconciliation. The Emperor of the West experienced from his colleague Leo the affection of a parent. The latter fitted out a vast armada | in order to free the coasts of the Mediterranean from Vandal piracy. The cost of this expedition amounted to no less than thirty thousand pounds of gold (5,200,000?.). Basiliscus, who commanded it, effected a successful landing at Cape Bona, only forty miles from Carthage, where he was joined by the Prefect Heraclius and the Patrician Marcellinus, now a loyal subject of the empire. The veteran Genseric requested and obtained a truce of * a.d. 466. t a.d. 467. X a.d. 468."], [367, "HISTORY OF ROME. 359 five days. During this interval a favomable wind sprang up, and enabled him to send a squadron of fireships into the very midst of the enemy's fleet. Whilst the panic-stricken crews endeavoured to save themselves and their ships, Genseric's fleet bore down upon them and gained a complete victory. Basiliscus ignominiously fled to Constantinople with the relics of his fleet and army, and only obtained pardon from Leo through the intercession of his sister, the Empress Verina. Genseric thus became again the sea-king of the Mediterranean, and survived the ruin of the Western Empire. The reconciliation between Ricimer and Anthe mius was not of long duration. The former, aided by a force of Suevi and Burgundians, marched from Milan and pitched his camp on the banks of the Arno. There he was met by Olybrius, the husband of the Princess Placidia, whom he persuaded to join him by the offer of the purple. The rebel patrician pushed forward his outposts as far as the river, and was thus in possession of the whole of the Trans tiberine portion of Rome. A fierce battle was fought at the passage of the Bridge of Hadrian {P. S. Angelo), and the victorious Ricimer burst into the heart of Rome.

The command of Ricimer's army devolved at his death upon his nephew Gundobald, a Burgundian prince, who conferred the vacant throne upon Gly cerius. Of his previous career history gives no in formation. One account states that he was Count of the Domestics. His was a rash and foolish usurp ation, for he had not obtained the consent of Leo, nor was Gundobald able to support him. The Em peror of the East, therefore, nominated Julius Nepos as his colleague.t He was the nephew of Marcel linus, and had succeeded him as Master-General in Dalmatia ; but he owed his elevation to the interest of the Empress Verina, whose niece he had married. The first act of his reign was to drive Glycerius from Italy, and compel him to be consecrated Bishop of Salona in Dalmatia. He was then publicly pro claimed Augustus at Rome.J Scarcely was he seated upon the throne, when the whole horizon of the empire seemed black with storms, threatening its speedy dissolution. In Gaul, the Visigoths, who had been quieted by a truce in the reign of Anthemius, re-commenced war under the * Oct. 23. f Aug. a. D. 473. 5 Jan. 24, A.

This precarious quiet was soon broken in Italy itself. Orestes was now in command of Ricimer's army, which consisted of confederated Germanic tribes of all kinds {f\u0153derati). He was a man of spirit and intelligence, had been secretary to Attila, and had subsequently been raised to the dignities of Patrician and Master-General. Although a Roman by birth, he had been educated amongst barbarians, and had adopted their language and mode of living. Hence the sympathies of the f\u0153derati were entirely with him, and at their head he marched from Rome to Ravenna to depose Nepos. The Emperor did not await his approach, but escaped by sea to Salona.f There he lived five years after his abdication ; and it appears that, although he made no attempt to exercise his authority, all that remained to the Romans in the West, except Italy, nominally recognised him as emperor. He was assassinated f through the in trigues of Glycerius, who was (according to some authorities) afterwards translated to the archbishopric of Milan. t Aug. 28, A. D. 476. X May 9, a. d. 480. * a.

Instead of usurping the empire himself, he preferred ruling in the name of his son, on whom he conferred the purple. The young Emperor was proclaimed at Ravenna ; * but either because of his youth, or in contempt, his time honoured name was changed by historians into the diminutive, Augustulus. The confederate mercenaries had, by gradual suc cessful encroachments, learned their strength and power. They mutinied against their general, and demanded as a feudal possession the third part of the lands of Italy, just as lands in Gaul and Spain had been granted to the Visigoths and Burgundians. Orestes nobly refused to deliver up the innocent in habitants of Italy to the mercy of half-savage bar barians ; but the discontented and mutinous f\u0153derati found a willing leader in Odoacer. Orestes fled to Pavia, but the city was stormed and taken, and the patrician seized and executed. The conqueror found Augustulus at Ravenna. He stripped him of the out ward ensigns of his imperial dignity, but having com passion on his youth, spared his life. He then sent him to Campania, and assigned him the castle of Lucullus as his residence, together with a pension of six thousand pounds of gold. The last Emperor of the West thus * Oct. 29."], [371, "363 HISTORY OF ROME. retired into the obscurity of a private station, and that title of the C\u00e6sars, which had been borne for five centuries, was no more known in that portion of the Roman world. Odoacer, now master of Italy and of the metropolis itself, disdained the title, the purple, and the imperial ornaments, and assumed the name of king, a name so hateful to Roman ears since the days of the Tarquins. With Valentinian III. the empire had lost the portraiture of its ancient majesty. The nine emperors who succeeded him scarcely re tained its shadow, and this was entirely dissipated by Odoacer, who changed that august sovereignty into a barbarian despotism. The literature of this age demands but a few words before concluding its history ; for although it was not quite extinct, or reduced to a state of barbarism after the reign of the Antonines, still its annals are bright ened with but few illustrious names in the third and succeeding centuries of the Christian era. First amongst them stand those of the last eminent jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, after whom jurisprudence re ceived no valuable addition to its stores of learning from their numerous pupils. Contemporary with these, in the reigns of Septimus Severus and Caracalla, flourished Q. Curtius and Tertullian. The former was the author of a life of Alexander the Great, full of interest, and written in a pleasing historical style. The first two books have unfortunately perished, but their loss has been ingeniously supplied by John Freinshemins, a professor at Upsal and Heidelberg in the seventeenth century. It is said that Alphonso, King of Naples, when sick at Capua, and receiving no r2"], [372, "364 HISTORY OF ROME. relief from his physicians, was so delighted with the life of Alexander, that he recovered, and laughingly told his attendants that Q. Curtius was worth a thousand doctors. Tertullian was one of the most eloquent and spirited of the Latin fathers of the Church. Whether he attacks heresy, or immorality, or worldliness, his heart is evidently engaged, and his earnestness gives a vigour and reality to his style which overcomes the artificial refinements of the school to which he belonged. A few years later, in the reigns of Alexander Severus and Gordian, lived Petronius, who has been erro neously assigned to the reign of Nero. It was even assumed that he derived his surname \" Arbiter \" from being the arbiter elegantiarum of Nero's pleasures and amusements. His principal work, of which only a fragment is extant, is entitled \" Satyricon,\" and is written partly in prose, partly in verse. It de scribes, with the talent of a novelist, scenes of ordi nary life. Its coarseness in some parts indicates the voluptuous and pleasure-seeking life which the author led, but it is witty and clever, and Niebuhr* does not hesitate to attribute to him the greatest poetical genius since the Augustan age. The reigns of Constantine and his son saw the virtuous and eloquent Lactantius. Proof against the corruptions of a court, this truly Christian Father devoted his talents to the defence of the Gospel and the protection of the suffering and oppressed. He was the pupil of Arnobius, but his simple and classical taste seems to disdain the con ceits of the African school. His principal work is his \" Institutiones Divin\u00e6,\" the pure and natural * Lect, on Rom. Lit. cxxvi."], [373, "HISTORY OF ROME. 365 Latinity of which obtained for him the title of the Christian Cicero. In the period between Constantine and Theodosius, prose was represented by the miserable epitomisers Eutropius and Victor, and poetry by the debased style of Ausonius. If we may trust his re putation, he was greater as a teacher of grammar or a professor of rhetoric and a private tutor to a prince,* than as a writer of poetry. The reign of Theodosius produced Qu. Aurelius Prudentius, a Christian poet born in Spain. He was an advocate by profession, and filled high offices under Honorius. His poems, which are on sacred subjects, display religious fervour, but neither elegance nor genius. But the most re markable poet of this period was Claudian, who flourished during the reign of Theodosius. He was an Alexandrian Greek, and yet wrote Latin with such elegance and accuracy that the style of his poems will bear the severest criticism. His Ovidian gracefulness and luxuriant imagination carry the mind of the reader back to the Augustan age. His genius was appre ciated, as it deserved to be, by Arcadius and Honorius. who, with the approbation of the senate, erected a brazen statue to his honour in the Forum of Trajan. A Greek inscription on its base attributes to him the united genius of Virgil and Homer. Claudian was a heathen. There is no reason to doubt the assertion of Augustine, that he was \" a Christiani nomine alienus \" (an alien from the name of Christian) \u2014 or that of Orosius, who calls him \" Paganus pervicacis simus\" (a most obstinate pagan). The mistake of supposing him a Christian arose from attributing to * Viz. Gratian."], [374, "366 HISTORY OF ROME. him a few little sacred poems written by Claudius Mamerius, a Christian poet of Vienne, in Gaul, who flourished a few years later. His poems are but occasional pieces, consisting of epigrams, pane gyrics, some light and graceful effusions, which he entitles \" Fescennine Verses,\" amongst which is an epithalamium on Honorius and his bride, and some idylls, of which the best is on the Wells of Aponus (Abano). ' The name of Sidonius Apollinaris, whose panegyric on Majorian has been already mentioned, closes this catalogue. He was a Roman by birth, though a native of Lyons. His Latin is at times somewhat provincial, and his writings display but little poetical genius. He was, nevertheless, a man of refined taste and accomplished mind, and he was sufficiently ap preciated by his patrons to be honoured with a brazen statue in Trajan's library. He died a bishop of the Christian Church, having survived to see the downfall of the Western Empire, and Italy the kingdom of a barbarian sovereign. Such were the literary men, and the list is by no means a contemptible one, who contributed by their labours to adorn even the most degenerate period of the literature of their country. They were the last of a succession of great minds, who kept the light of European intellect still burning until the very moment when the political existence of Rome herself was extinguished. To that long cata logue the world owes a debt of everlasting gratitude. The Roman nation passed away ; its literature came to an end. The gigantic intellects which developed the one and created the other vanished from the"], [375, "367 HISTORY OF ROME. face of the earth ; but the history of that nation, the principles of its laws and institutions, the literary labours of its most powerful intellects, are immortal.
