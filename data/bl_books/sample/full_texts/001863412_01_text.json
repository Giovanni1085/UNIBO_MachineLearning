The scantiness of available information on the subject of the British Parliament, its history and its leading men, is a sur prising fact, in days when historical writing may be said to superabound. Much information was to be found, no doubt, in bulky volumes, or scattered through the material of exten sive libraries ; but there was nothing for the general reader at once comprehensive and readily accessible. An attempt was made, years back, by two fellow- workers on the Press who had experienced the want, to supply it, by bringing together, for the first time and in anecdotal form, \" some of the more striking facts in the history of our Parliaments, aud the public lives of distinguished statesmen.\"* Their work met with a favourable reception, and a cordial appreciation of its purport, not only in this country, but abroad. One cor respondent \u2014 a member of the legal profession in Italy \u2014 expressed himself warmly in praise of the book, which he was desirous of translating into his own tongue, as showing com pendiously the history of constitutional liberty in the nation which has striven most successfully for its promotion, and * \"A Book of Parliamentary Anecdote,\" by G. H. Jennings and W. S. Johnstone, 1872. The writer takes this opportunity of expressing his satisfaction that in his earlier labours he was aided by the co-operation of his valued friend (now deceased), Mr. William Steven Johnstone. That gentleman, although prevented by weak health and arduous engage ments from continuing the work, kindly placed at the disposal of his colleague his own gatherings towards the original book."], [10, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. VI being therefore well adapted as a text-book for the political education of his countrymen.* The encouragement given to the previous tentative work led the present writer to follow it up by the expansion and re-arrangement of its materials ; influenced, as regards the latter point (in the \"Personal\" section of the volume), in some measure by the suggestion of a competent and courteous critic in the Quarterly Review, who afterwards gave his remarks upon the book a more enduring circulation. t As regards expansion, the former work included but a small portion of the material contained in the present; for the vein was found to be more rich as it further explored. To deal with it in a manner likely to secure a satisfactory result his required such leisure and attention as opportunity may have afforded during many years ; the difficulty at length having been to confine the gathered material within moderate limits, while not omitting (it is believed) any important or characteristic fact in either the historical or the biographical branch of the subject. It is hoped that the work, in its present form, may be of practical value in more than one direction. As Mr. Lowe once pointed out, in a celebrated phrase,J the power of thi3 country is now, more distinctly than at any former time, vested in the electoral body. Every individual citizen exercises a proportion of that power ; and, that he may use it wisely, an acquaintance with the history and the working of our Parlia mentary institutions is an essential condition. All have not the opportunity of reference to the works requisite for the information; but all may consult such a digest as will be *He wrote: \"Vous avez raconte, dans ses traits plus remarquables, l'histoire d'Angleterre, qui, ancienne ou moderne, est toujours actuell'e pour nous, parcequ'elle est toujours la meme chose, fatale et grande, l'histoire de la liberte.

VII found here, and the book may therefore claim to possess its \u2022educational uses at home. To maintain the standard reached by constant patriotic effort in past times, and so to uphold the dignity and efficacy of the Nation in Council, is a most impor tant object, which it seems as necessary to keep in view at the present day as at any former period. Moreover, to this country the founders of Parliamentary institutions in other lands have been, and are, eagerly looking. Besides nations speaking other tongues, our numerous colonies have their growing Parliaments, all taking the cue from our own, and tracing in its history the foundations of a government at once popular, and regulated by4law and order, while Freedom broadens slowly down From precedent to precedent. To any of these colonial Assemblies might probably be applied a remark recently made respecting one of them : \" It is almost as jealous of any departure from English Parliamentary pre cedent as could well be the House of Commons itself.\"* As to the general subjects of Parliamentary rule and prece dent, formally considered, it is scarcely needful to say that no attempt is here made to compete wath the claims of such \u2022elaborate and exhaustive works as those of Sir T. Erskine May aud his predecessors, Elsynge, HatseU, and the rest. In the fullowing \"anecdotal\" pages, these matters are necessarily kept less in view than the broad lines of historical fact, personal trait, and oratorical effort or allusion ; and in dealiug -with these, one especial design has been to make the work useful to persons engaged in political and literary pursuits. The occasion of a particular incident, or the use of a certain * Letter from special correspondent of the Times at Melbourne, March 31, 1880. \u2014 Since theso lines were written, the subject has been enforced in the House of Commons. Mr. Speaker Brand, on his re-election to tho chair in 1880, said, \"The power and consequent responsibility of this House are constantly increasing. It is looked up to, not only by onr colonial fellow-subjects as the parent of their popular Assemblies, but every nation in the world now treading in the path of Parliamentary Government watches our proceedings with the greatest attention and interest. It is, then, the more incumbent on us to set an examplo of freedom and order in debate, which constitute the life-blood of Parlia mentary Government.\""], [12, "VIII ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. phrase, is often matter of dispute and requires verification, both in Parliament and out of it. A circumstance which occurred in the session of 1876 will show that the want of a ready means of authenticating such facts and phrases is felt, at times, by persons of the greatest eminence in political life. Mr. Gladstone, speaking in the House of Commons of an expression used by a former colleague (the Earl of Clarendon) in an important crisis, said he had been at some pains to find out in \"Hansard\" what were the actual meaning and connec tion of that expression (\"drifting into war\"), and he gave the correct version. If, however, the right honourable gentle man had had before him the small work of which this is a development, it would have saved him the labour, for the expression would there have been found, among m^ny others of like interest, with the context as given in \" Hansard's \" pages. The process of \"mythical accretion\" to which Mr. Glad stone referred on that occasion is constantly going on with regard to the celebrated dicta of our public men, and this makes it the more desirable to trace, as has here been done, the original occasion and precise sense of such expressions. Another instance in point will be found on page 386. Mr. Cobden was frequently credited with the saying that we could \" crumple up Russia like a sheet of paper.\" What he really did say, and the \"accretion\" which followed, will there be found recorded; and many similar instances appear in other places. One of the express objects of this book is to prevent, on many occasions in future, the need of such laborious research as that instanced by Mr. Gladstone ; and the number of political proverbs and sayings which will be found included here, with an account of the circumstances under which they arose, is very considerable. For many of these, recourse has necessarily been had, not only to the voluminous pages of \" Hansard,\" and the similar records, such as they are, of former days, but to the deeper depth of ancient newspaper files, where alone some of the celebrated sayings of distin guished statesmen could be found, \u2014 often uttered on \" extra parliamentary \" and slight occasions, but destined, by some-"], [13, "PREFACE. IX happy conjuncture of thought and phrase, to live as long in memory, or longer, than anything that fell from them in elaborate orations. To these, as well as some other portions of the book, gathered from voluminous histories and lengthy biographies, the words of the elder Disraeli, when speaking of some of his own labours, may not inappropriately be applied : \u2014 \" There are articles in the present work, occupying but a few pages, which could never have been produced had not more time been allotted to the researches they contain than some would allow to a small volume.\" It may be thought that anecdotes of a humorous nature occur in the book to an extent not to have been anticipated. They have, however, nob been sought for, but have arisen from the -mature of the subject. Humour has always played an important part in the proceedings of the British Parlia ment, whether it be the greater Parliament of the platform and the polling-booth, or the select body which assembles at St. Stephen's. As a worthy member of the House of Com mons once remarked, it loves good sense and joking.\"* This book, therefore, could not faithfully mirror Parliamentary life, as it attempts to do, unless both qualities were fairly represented. Reference to authorities is given throughout the work, wherever it seemed likely to be useful to the reader, or' of any importance for verification. It is scarcely necessary to add that in manv cases the authorities cited indicate only tho sources from which the principal facts or reports are derived ; such additions and explanations as may have been requisite to complete the information having, of course, been supplied from other sources. Of one thing the reader may be assured, \u2014 that the work before him has been prepared without undue leaning or partiality in favour of any of the great parties in the State, whether in past or present time. The historical student frequently cares little for the differences of passing politics, seeiDg rather, in the calmness of private study, that the adver saries and opponents of a particular time have been, in tho * P. 671."], [14, "x ANECDOTAL HISTOBT OF PARLIAMENT. main, men working with different views towards common objects, and that there has been much on both sides worthy of admiration and respect. The familiar illustration of the knights and the shield is as applicable in political as in any other affairs, and it has required many chivalrous men of opposing views to build worthily upon the foundations of the British Parliament. It is believed that all sides alike are here fairly represented; for the historical spirit, as distin guished from that of party, in the main pervades the principal sources of information referred to, and in the collection of material from these quarters there has been no such endeavour as that of Dr. Johnson,* to \" take care that the Whig dogs did not get the best of it.\" * P. 562. PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. During the twelve years which have elapsed since the issue of the first edition of this book, many events of the greatest interest and importance have transpired. The Parliamentary electorate has itself been immensely enlarged; and the brief period that now suffices to effect momentous changes in Parliamentary rules and procedure may be judged by careful readers from some of the closing pages in the first section of the book, and be read in fuller detail in its later portions. Again, the publication of numerous memoirs and biographies of deceased statesmen has thrown additional light upon important passages in their own personal history and career, as well as on that of their colleagues. These biographical records have all required consultation and reference, with results that may be found interspersed in the volume. Names that were most prominent in 1880 and afterward are now missing from the living roll; while statesmen then of lesser note have since come prominently forward, and in many cases"], [15, "PREFACE. XI have required distinct and separate notice, such as had been given to some of their predecessors. A further word of explanation remains to be added. The compiler of this book witnessed, when very young, O'Connell's last appearance at the table of the House of Commons, and remembers to have heard some of those feeble utterances of the dying gladiator to which Mr. Disraeli alluded in his memoir of Lord George Bentinck. In later years it was the writer's duty, also, as engaged on the Press, to attend the House of Commons on many an important' and critical occasion. Therefore, in putting together this record of Par liamentary facts and incidents, so far as recent times are concerned, his hand has been both guided and restrained, in no small measure, by results of personal observation. As to former days, research has sometimes enabled him to recover contemporary records that were sought for in vain even in the library of the British Museum ; and these are frequently quoted, especially in the earlier sections of the work. To conclude, as to the whole aim and purport of the book, in the words of one who is frequently quoted in its pages, \u2014 it is \" to save from what traditions glean, Or age remembers, or ourselves have seen, The scattered relics care can yet collect. .

Antiquity of Parliaments. \u2014 ParUaments or General Councils (writes Blackstone) are coeval with the kingdom itself. How those Parliaments were constituted and composed is another question, which has been matter of great dispute among our learned antiquaries, and, particularly, whether the Commons were summoned at all ; or, if sum moned, at what period they began to form a distinct assembly. In the main, the constitution of Parliament, as it now stands, was marked out so long ago as the seventeenth year of King John, a.d. 1215, in the great charter granted by that prince; wherein he promises to summon all archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, personally ; and all other tenants-in-chief under the Crown, by the sheriff and bailiffs, to meet at a certain place, with forty days' notice, to assess aids and scutages when necessary. And this constitution has subsisted in fact at least from 49 Henry III., there being still extant writs of that date to summon knights, citizens, and burgesses to Parliament. The \" Omnipotence of Parliament.\" \u2014 The power and jurisdic tion of Parliament (says Sir Edward Coke) is so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined, either for causes or persons, within any bounds. Parliament can regulate or new model the succession to the Crown ; as was done in the reigns of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the established religion of the land ; as was done in a variety of instances in the reigns of King Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of Parliaments themselves ; as was done by the Act of Union, and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in short, B"], [22, "\u25a02 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. do everything that is not naturally impossible ; and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipo tence of Parliament. True it is, that what the Parliament doth, no authority upon earth can undo. So that it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom that such members be delegated to this important trust as are most eminent for their probity, their fortitude, and their knowledge. \u2014 Blackstone's Commentaries. \" England can never be Ruined bnt by a Parliament.\" \u2014 It was a known apothegm of the great Lord Treasurer Burleigh that \" England could never be ruined but by a Parliament ; \" and, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, this being the highest and greatest court, over which none other can have jurisdiction in the kingdom, if by any means a misgovernment should any way fall upon it, the subjects of this kingdom are left without all manner of remedy. To the same purpose Montesquieu \u2014 though, I trust, too hastily \u2014 presages that as Rome, Sparta, and Carthage have lost their liberty and perished, so the con stitution of England will, in time, lose its liberty \u2014 will perish : it will perish whenever the legislative power shall become more corrupt than the executive. \u2014 Ib id. Constitution of the Early Councils. \u2014 Hume thus classifies the various orders which composed the great councils of the nation under the Norman kings. \"The supreme legislative power of England was lodged in the king and great council, or what was afterwards called the Parliament. It is not doubted but the archbishops, bishops, and most considerable abbots were constituent members of the council. They sat by a double title ; by prescription, as having always possessed that privilege, through the whole Saxon period, from the first establishment of Chris tianity ; and by their right of baronage, as holding of the king in capite by military service. The barons were another constituent part of the great council of the nation. These held immediately of the crown by a military tenure ; they were the most honourable members of the state, and had a right to be consulted in all public deliberations; they were the immediate vassals of the crown, and owed as a service their attendance in the court of their supreme lord. But there was another class of the immediate military tenants of the crown, no less, or probably more, numerous than the barons \u2014 the tenants in capite by knight's service; and these, however inferior in power or property, held by a tenure which was equally honourable with that of the others. Where a man held of the king only one or two knight's fees, he was still an immediate vassal of the crown, and as such had a title to have a seat in the general councils. The only question seems to be with regard to the commons, or the repre sentatives of counties or boroughs, whether they were also, in more early times, constituent parts of Parliament. It is now agreed that the commons were no part of the great council till some ages after the Conquest, and that the military tenants alone of the crown composed that supreme and legislative assembly.\" The First Council after the Conquest.\u2014 The principle of election appears to have operated in this council, which was called together"], [23, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 3 in the fourth year of William I. (1070). Twelve representatives (says Oldfield) were elected in each county in the whole kingdom, and were sworn before the King. In this Parliament or council the laws of Edward the Confessor (by which is probably meant the common law as it pre vailed during his reign) were adopted and confirmed. The Name of \" Parliament.\" \u2014 Professor Stubbs remarks that \"the name given to the sessions of council (under the early Norman kings) was often expressed by the Latin colloquium ; and it is by no means unlikely that the name of Parliament, which is used as early as 1175 by Jordan Fantosme (' sun plenier parlement '), may have been in common use. But of this we have no distinct instance in the Latin Chroniclers for some years further, although when the term comes into use it is applied retrospectively ; and in a record of the twenty-eighth year of Henry III., the assembly in which the Great Charter was granted is mentioned as the ' Parliamentum Runimed\u00e6.' . . It is first used in England by a contem porary writer in 1246, namely, by Matthew Paris. It is a word of Italian origin, and may have been introduced either through the Normans, or through intercourse with the French kingdom.\" The Earliest Recorded Parliaments. \u2014 In a return presented to the House of Commons by order in 1879, giving the names of members of the Lower House and their constituencies \" from so remote a period as it can be obtained,\" the earliest Parliaments mentioned are the following : 1. 15th John (1213), summoned to meet at Oxford. Writs addressed to all the sheriffs, requiring them each to send all the knights of their bailiwicks in arms ; and also four knights from their counties \" ad loquendum nobiscum de negotiis regni nostri.\" 2. 10th Henry III. (1226), summoned to meet at Lincoln. Writs addressed to the sheriffs of eight counties, requiring them each to send four knights, elected by the \" milites et probi homines \" of their bailiwicks, to set forth certain disputes with the sheriffs. 3. 38th Henry III. (1254), summoned to meet at Westminster. Every .sheriff required to send two knights to be elected by each county, to pro vide aid towards carrying on tho war in Gascony. 4. 45th Henry III. (1261), summoned to meet at Windsor. The Bishop of Worcester, the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester, and other magnates, having ordered three knights from each county to attend an assembly at St. Alban's, the King enjoins the sheriffs to send the above-mentioned knights also to him at Windsor. 5. 49th Henry III. (1264-5), summoned to meet at London. This appears (says tho return) to have been the first complete Parliament consisting of elected knights, citizens, and burgesses. In each of these cases no returns of names could be found. The Commons summoned by Simon de Montfort. \u2014 Leicester (says Humo) summoned a new Parliament in London (20th January, 1265), \" and he fixed this assembly on a more democratical basis than any which had ever been summoned since the foundation of the monarchy. Besides the barons of his own party, and several ecclesiastics, who were not immediate tenants of the crown, he ordered returns to be made of two knights from each shire, and, what is more remarkable, of deputies from tho boroughs \u2014 an order of men which, in former ages, had b2"], [24, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 4 always been regarded as too mean to enjoy a place in the national council. This period is commonly esteemed the epoch of the House of Commons in England.\" The Writ of Summons to Parliament.\u2014 Henry Elsynge, clerk to the House of Commons, writes, in his \"Ancient Method and Manner of Holding of Parliaments \" (1660) : \" It doth not appear by the first record of summons now extant, Anno 49 Henry III., by what warrant the Lord Chancellor caused the writ of summons to be made. The King was then prisoner unto Mountford. But surely none but the King can summon the Parliament ; and this is the reason that Henry IV., having taken his liege lord, King Richard H., prisoner, on the 20th of August, Anno Rich. 23, did cause the writs of summons for the Parliament, wherein he obtained the crown, to bear date the 19th day of the same month, and the warrant to be per ipsum Regem et consilium, and himself to be summoned by the name of Henry Duke of Lancaster.\" The Three Estates Sitting by Themselves. \u2014 Elsynge records: \"6th Edward III., at the Parliament held at Tork, the cause of snmmons being touching Scotland, the prelates with the clergy (sat) by themselves, the dukes and barons by themselves, and afterwards they delivered their joint answer to the King. In the former Parliament of that year at Westminster the cause was touching Ireland : the prelates consulted by themselves, and after they gave a joint answer, and they all joined in one grant of a subsidy to the King. Anno 6th Edward III., Oetabis Hillarii, the prelates treated by themselves, so did the Lords, and so did the Commons, and afterwards their joint answer was reported to the King by the Bishop of Winchester. . . Anno 50 Edward III., the cause of summons ended, the Commons were willed to withdraw them selves to their ancient place in the Chapter House of the Abbot of West minster, and there to treat and consult among themselves.\" Peculiar Designations given to Parliaments. \u2014 Many of tho early as well as the later Parliaments acquired special names, by which they are still distinguished. The following list (in which some of the later pages of this section are anticipated) comprises all such designations as are of historical interest : \u2014 The Mad Parliament. \u2014 One of the last of the great councils summoned before the calling up of the Commons by Simon de Montfort was afterwards known by this name, given to it by the Royalists. \" In the year 1258 (says Gurdon), on April 10th, a Parliament met which was called insanum Parliamentum, Simon Montfort, Earl of Leicester, complained very boldly to the King (Henry III.), appealing to the Parliament for justice ; upbraided the King that he promoted and enriched strangers, and despised and wasted his own people ; neglected his subjects that faithfully served him, as he had charged the King six years before ; that he had not performed his promise of rewarding him for his services and expenses in Gascoigny. To which the King answered, that he would not stand to any"], [25, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 5 promise made to one that proved a traitor. The earl told the King he lied, and, were he not a king, he would make him eat his words.\" The Parliament de la Bond. \u2014 One of Edward II.'s Parliaments (1321) was called \" Parliament de la Bond,\" from the barons coming to Parliament, armed against the two Spencers, wearing coloured bands upon their sleeves for distinction. \u2014 Gurdon. The Good Parliament. \u2014 The Parliament assembled in 1376 (50th Edward III.) has been called by this name, in consequence of its measures against the corruption of the court and government. Several of the ministers were impeached, and the king's mistress, Alice Perrers, was made the subject of a special censure, the Commons passing the following ordinance : \" Whereas complaints have been laid before the king that certain women have pursued causes and actions in the king's court by way of maintenance, and for hire and reward, which thing displeases the king, the king forbids that any woman do it for the future, and in particular Alice Perrers, under the penalty of forfeiting all that she, the said Alice, can forfeit, and of being banished out of the realm.\" The growing activity of the Commons in this Parliament derived much encouragement from the Black Prince, whose death, however, ensued soon after, and John of Gaunt obtained a new Parliament, which undid the work of its predecessor. The Wonderful, or Merciless Parliament. \u2014 The Parliament which was summoned in the eleventh year of Richard II. (Feb. 3rd, 1388) has been called by some historians \" the Parliament that wrought wonders;\" by others, \"the Merciless Parliament.\" In it articles of high treason were exhibited against the King's ministers, who were, accordingly, sentenced to death or banishment. \u2014 Parry's \" Parliaments of England.\" The Shortest Parliament. \u2014 The shortest Parliament ever held was that which met on the 30th of September, 1399, and sat but for a single day, on which it deposed Richard II. \" The deposition of Richard (says Hume) dissolved the Parliament ; it was necessary to summon a new one ; and Henry, in six days after, called together without any new election the same members, and this assembly he denominated a new Parliament.\" The Unlearned Parliament. \u2014 Speaking of this Parliament, which assembled in 1404, Lord Campbell says, the recklessness of the Commons may have arisen from their not having had a single lawyer among them. Lord Chancellor Beaufort, in framing the writs of summons, illegally inserted a prohibition that any apprentice or other man of the law should be elected. In return for such a slight our law books and historians have branded this ParUament with the name of Parliamentum, indoctum, or the \" Unlearned ParUament.\" The Parliament of Bats.\u2014 In the 4th of Henry VI. (1426) a Parliament was summoned to meet at Leicester, and orders were sent to the members that they should not wear swords, so they came to the ParUament, like modern butchers, with long staves, from whence the Parliament got the name of \" the Parliament of Bats.\" And when the"], [26, "6 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. bats were prohibited, the members had recourse to stones and leaden plummets. \u2014 Gurdon's \" History of Parliament.\" The Diabolical Parliament.\u2014 In the 38th year of Henry VI. (1459) a Parliament was summoned to meet on the 20th November, at Coventry. It was there enacted that aU such knights of any county as were returned to the ParUament by virtue of the King's letters, without any other election, should be good, and that no sheriff, for returning them, should incur the pain therefor provided in the Act of the 23rd of Henry VI. The Queen and her party carried all before them in this ParUament, which, from its works, was caUed Parliamentum diabolicum. \u2014 Ibid. The Addled Parliament. \u2014 This name was given by the King's party (James I.) to the ParUament which met on the 5th of April, 1614. It had been summoned in the expectation that it would grant supplies, but it insisted on the previous discussion of grievances, and, as it proved obdurate, it was dissolved on the 7th of June, without having passed a single biU. Prior to the meeting of this Parliament, certain of the King's ministers (among them Bacon and Somerset) undertook that they would so manage the Commons as to secure the necessary votes. This promise got wind, and the ministers were freely spoken of as undertakers \u2014 a circumstance to which the King thus alluded in his opening speech : \" For undertakers, he never was so base to caU or rely on any.\" The Short Parliament. \u2014 The fourth Parliament called by Charles I. is known by this name. It met on the 13th of April, 1640 \u2014 the first Parliament since the dissolution of 1629 \u2014 and was dissolved after a session of three weeks only, on the 5th of May. Never since the institution of regular Parliaments had there been so long an interval without one, as that which preceded the summoning of this assembly. The Dong Parliament. \u2014 The Long Parliament, or the fifth of Charles I., assembled November 3, 1640 \u2014 \" a ParUament which many, before that time, thought would never have had a beginning, and after wards that it would never have had an end.\" It was, however, abruptly and violently dispersed by Cromwell, April 20th, 1653. (See \" Personal \" section, under \" CromweU.\") After many vicissitudes, in which fragments of this Parliament were called together again and again for special purposes, the appearance of legal dissolution was given by a bill for \" Dissolving the ParUament begun and holden at Westminster 3rd of November, 1640, and that the day of dissolution shall be from this day, March 16th, 1659.\"* Macaulay describes it as \" that renowned Parlia ment which, in spite of many errors and disasters, is justly entitled to the reverence and gratitude of all who, in any part of the world, enjoy the blessings of constitutional government.\" On the other hand, Cobbett, in his \" ParUamentary History,\" observes, \" Thus ended the Long Parliament, which, with innumerable alterations and several intermissions, had con tinued the scourge of the nation for nearly twenty years.\" Pride's Purge. \u2014 When the Commons were to meet on Dec. 6th, * 1660, according to modern reckoning, the year formerly commencing on the 25th of March."], [27, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 7 1648, Hume says, Colonel Pride, formerly a drayman, environed the House with two regiments, and, directed by Lord Grey of Groby, he seized in the passage forty-one members of the Presbyterian party, and sent them to a low room, which passed by the appellation of \" heU,\" whence they were afterwards carried to several inns. Above 160 members more were excluded, and none were allowed to enter but the most furious and the most determined of the Independents ; and these exceeded not the number of fifty or sixty. This invasion of the ParUament commonly passed under the name of \" Colonel Pride's Purge,\" so much was the nation disposed to make merry with the dethroning of those members who had violently arrogated the whole authority of government, and deprived the King of his legal prerogatives. The remains of the Parliament were called the \" Rump.\" The Rump. \u2014 \" The nickname originated,\" says Isaac D'lsraeli. \" in derision on the expulsion of the majority of the Long ParUament by the usurping minority. The coUector of ' The Rump Songs ' teUs us, ' If you ask who named it Rump, know 'twas so styled in an honest sheet of prayer caUed the Bloody Rump, written before the trial of our late sovereign ; but the word obtained not universal notice till it flew from the mouth of Major-General Brown, at a pubUc assembly in the days of Richard CromweU.' \" The Dittle, or Barebone's Parliament. \u2014 The Parliament to which these names have been given was summoned by CromweU, and met for the first time July 4th, 1653. A hundred and forty summonses to it were issued, and of the parties summoned only two did not attend. Hume says, \" Among the fanatics of the House there was an active member much noted for his long prayers, sermons, and harangues. He was a leather-seUer in London, his name Praise-God Barcbone. This ridiculous name, which seems to have been chosen by some poet or aUegorist to suit so ridiculous a personage, struck the fancy of the people, and they commonly affixed to the assembly the appellation of ' Barebone's Parliament.' \" This assembly sat until the 12th of Decem ber, 1653, when it resigned its powers into the hands of CromweU. The Convention, or Healing Parliament.\u2014 This name was applied to the Parliament which met on the 25th of April, 1660, and, a few days after, restored Charles II.\u2014 a measure which, it was hoped, would \" heal\" all remaining wounds and differences existing in the nation. The Drunken Parliament. \u2014 The first Parliament which met in Scotland after the Restoration of Charles II. acquired this name. Sir Walter Scott, in his \" Tales of a Grandfather,\" says, \" When the Scottish Parliament met, the members were, in many instances, under the influence of wine, and they were more than once obliged to adjourn, because the royal commissioner (Middleton) was too intoxicated to behave properly in the chair.\" The Longest, or Pensionary Parliament. \u2014 This Parliament \u2014 sometimes called \" the Long ParUament,\" until that name became more distinctly appropriated to the assembly of 1640 \u2014 was summoned to meet at Westminster on the 8th of May, 1661, and was not dissolved until"], [28, "8 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the 24th of January, 1679. It thus existed for nearly eighteen years. It derived its name of \" pensionary \" from the fact that many of its members were in the habit of receiving bribes from the King and the Ministers ; and it has also been discovered that some of them were in the pay of the Court of France. Parliamentary Hostages. \u2014 Oldfield records that in the sixth year of King John (1205) a Parliament was held, at which the children of the barons were required as hostages for their allegiance. An Unwise Counsellor. \u2014 Henry III., being straitened for money, issued a warrant ordering the nobles to meet him in London. Accord ingly, on the day of St. Hilary, 1237, a countless multitude proceeded to the palace at Westminster to hear the King's pleasure. Having heard with consternation the royal demand for a thirtieth of all movable pro perty, they were about to retire for the purpose of consultation, when Gilbert Bassett said to Henry, in the hearing of aU, \" My lord King, send some one of your friends to be present at the conference of your barons.\" In reply to his speech, Richard Percy said, \" What is it, friend Gilbert, that you said ? Are we, too, foreigners ; and are we not among the number of the King's friends ? \" And Gilbert felt himself rebuked for his unpleasant speech. \u2014 Matthew Paris. Selection of Partial Parliaments. \u2014 In ancient times it was ordinary for kings to make a show of summoning Parliaments, whenas properly they were but parliamentary meetings of some such lords, clergy, and others as the King saw most convenient to drive on his own designs ; and therefore we find that Henry III., about the latter part of his reign, when his government drew towards the dregs, he having in the kingdom two hundred and fifty baronies, he summoned unto one of these parliamen tary meetings but five-and-twenty barons and one hundred and fifty of his clergy. \u2014 Nathaniel Bacon's \" Discourse on the Government of England.\" Neglect of the King's Summons to Parliament. \u2014 Edward III., being troubled with a quarrel between the two Archbishops of Canterbury and Tork concerning superiority in bearing the cross, and the important affairs of Scotland so urging, summoned a ParUament at York, which was fain to be delayed and adjourned for want of appearance, and more effectual summons issued forth ; but at the day of adjournment none of the clergy of the province of Canterbury would be there ; and upon this occasion the ParUament was not only interrupted in their proceedings, but an ill precedent was made for men to be bold with the King's summons in such cases as liked not them ; and thereupon a statute was made to enforce obedience upon citizens and burgesses, and such eccle siastics as held per baroniam. Nor did Edward III. ever after hold the presence of the prelates at so high repute at such meetings ; and there fore summoned them, or so many of them as he thought meet for the occasion \u2014 sometimes more, sometimes fewer ; and at a Parliament in his forty-and-seventh year he summoned only four bishops and five abbots."], [29, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. & Albeit the clergy stiU made their claim of vote, and desired the same to be entered upon record. \u2014 Ibid. Representation an Expensive Luxury. \u2014 A correspondent of Notes and Queries writes : \u2014 \" Whatever estimate the people of the present day may put upon the elective franchise, it would seem that our ancestors held the privilege very Ughtly ; for, although the wages to be received by members of Parliament were fixed by the 16th of Edward II. at the low rate of 4s. a day for a knight of the shire, and 2s. for a citizen or burgess, yet we are told by Prynne that many boroughs petitioned to be excused from sending members to ParUament, on account of the expense ; and in a note to 'Blackstone ' we learn that from the 33rd Edward III., uniformly through the five succeeding reigns, the sheriff of Lancashire returned that there were no cities or boroughs in his county that ought or were used, or could, on account of their poverty, send any citizens or burgesses to ParUament. There were some instances where even a less sum than that estabUshed by statute was aUowed ; and it is on record that in 1463 Sir John Strange, the member for Dunwich, agreed to take a cade and half a barrel of herrings as a composition for his wages.\" A Member Suing for his Wages. \u2014 HatseU records that Mr. HaU, member for Grantham, having published a book in 1580, which gave offence to the House, was ordered to be expelled, fined, and imprisoned. On the 21st of November, 1586, Mr. Markham, then member for Grantham, informed the House, on the part of the inhabitants of that borough, that Mr. Arthur HaU, at one time their member, had brought a writ for his wages (amongst other times) for his attendance at the late session of Parliament, holden at Westminster in the twenty-seventh year of Queen Elizabeth, during which time he did not serve in the House. A committee appointed by the House desired him to remit the said wages, which he did \"freely and frankly.\"* Safety and Quietude for Members. \u2014 A ParUament was sum moned by Edward III. to meet at Westminster, March 12th, 1332, the summons reciting the King's reasons for calling them. Where \u2014 that wo may see (says Joshua Barnes) what prudent care was then taken by these august assemblies that their debates should not be awed by fear or disturbed by tumults \u2014 it was first by the King's order proclaimed, \" That no man, upon pain of forfeiting aU his substance, should presume to uso or wear any coat of metal, or other weapon, offensive or defensive, in London, Westminster, or the suburbs of the same. And also that during the time of this session no games or other plays of men, women, or children should be used in Westminster, to the disturbance of the ParUament.\" A ParUament met at Tork in the foUowing year. On the first day of their sitting commandment was given to the Mayor of Tork, in presence of the King and aU his Parliament, to see the King's peace kept in the said city and suburbs thereof, and to arrest aU that offended against it. Also, proclamation to be made against weapons and plays, by the steward and * Seo \" Parliamentary Usages \u2014 Payment of Members.\""], [30, "10 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. marschal, before the house where the Parliament sat, and by the mayor and bailiffs in the city. An Early Speaker's Address on Election. \u2014 The House of Commons which met in 1376 chose Sir Peter de la Mare, knight of the shire for Herefordshire, as their Speaker, and he is sometimes mentioned as the first who bore the title. Sir Peter on this occasion (says the \"ParUamentary History \") made a protestation and said, \" That what he had to declare was from their whole body ; and therefore required that if he should happen to speak anything without their consents, that it ought to be amended before his departure from the said place. He commended the feats of chivalry heretofore practised, for which this nation was so renowned ; and said that by the decay of the same, the honour of the realm did and would daily decrease.\" A Faithful Speaker Punished. \u2014 Sir Peter de la Mare, elected prolocutor or speaker of \" the Good ParUament \" (p. 5), suffered for his boldness on behalf of that body, which had so severely handled court abuses. The death of the Black Prince, who had countenanced its proceedings, left power in the hands of John of Gaunt, against whom and his friends they had been directed. The Parliament was dismissed, and proclaimed to have been no Parliament at aU ; steps taken in consequence of its petitions were canceUed ; and Peter de la Mare was summoned before the King's court and imprisoned. A new Parliament met in January, 1377, no pains having being spared to \"pack \" it ; and this (says Professor Stubbs) is the first occasion on which any definite signs are traceable of an attempt to influence the elections for a political purpose. Sir Thomas Hungerford, the Duke of Lancaster's steward, and one of the knights of the shire for Wilts, was chosen speaker. A strong minority vainly endeavoured to procure the release of Sir Peter de la Mare, and the Londoners insisted that he should have a fair trial ; but he was detained in prison some months, until the occurrence of the jubilee of the old King, Edward III. A Royal Absentee. \u2014 Oldfield relates that in the. tenth year of Richard II. (1387) the Commons sent a message to the King, in which they stated that if the King shaU wilfully estrange himself from his ParUament, and be absent from them for the space of forty days, it shaU be lawful for aU and every of them, without any damage from the King, to go home and return into their own countries. \"And now you,\" continue the remonstrants, \" for a longer time have absented yourself, and have refused to come among them.\" An Earl's Apology. \u2014 In a ParUament of Richard II. , held at Westminster, 1394, the Earl of Arundel exhibited a complaint against the Duke of Lancaster, consisting of four distinct charges. To the accusa tion the King himself answered and affirmed that what the Duke of Lancaster had done was aU right and good. And his Majesty, with the assent of the Lords, awarded that the said earl should ask the duke's pardon, in full Parliameut, and in the very words following, which he spoke accordingly : \" Sir, Sith that it seemeth to the King and other lords, and eke that each here hath been so niiekle grieved and displeased"], [31, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 11 by my words ; it forethinketh, and I beseech you of your grace and lord ship to quit me your man-taUant.\" \u2014 Parliamentary History. The House of Commons making a Scapegoat. \u2014 While, in the early Parliaments, the House of Commons occasionaUy spoke out with boldness, it was often ready at the next moment to meet the King and his council with great subserviency. The foUowing instance is given in the \" Parliamentary History : \" In 1397 the House of Commons required of the King (Richard II.), amongst other demands, an avoidance of the extravagant expenses of the King's household, and that bishops and ladies, who had no particular business there, should be forbidden to frequent the court. The King, hearing of this, was highly incensed, and charged the Speaker, Sir John Bussy, upon his aUegiance to inform him who it was that had brought the matter into Parliament. The Commons, on being told the King's mind in a conference with the Lords, made a most submis sive and even abject apology for their presumption ; gave up the name of the person who had brought it into their House \u2014 one Thomas Haxey, clerk ; and furthermore, proceeded to try poor Thomas Haxey, clerk, and con demned him to die the death of a traitor. The King then informed the Commons that he, out of his royal benignity and gracious seigniory, freely excused them. The scapegoat also came in for a share in the royal clemency, his life being spared on the petition of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other prelates ; but this was chiefly on account of his clerical capacity. A Suicidal Parliament and a Suicidal King. \u2014 A Parliament, elected (writes Professor Stubbs) under the undisguised influence of Richard IL, met at Westminster on the 17th of September, 1397. The King's agents in the House of Commons were Sir John Bussy, the Speaker, Sir Henry Green, and Sir William Bagot. The Chancellor declared in his opening speech that the cause of summons was to establish the King in his rights, and to consult on the revocation of all measures by which those rights were diminished. . The whole of the acts of the Parliament of February, 1388, were, at the prayer of the Commons, declared null, and the persons prejudiced by those acts were restored to aU their rights. Large subsidies were granted, some of them for the term of the King's life. \" The last Act (says Stubbs) of this suicidal Parliament was to delegate their authority to eighteen members chosen from the whole body : ten lords temporal, of whom six were to be a quorum, two earls as proctors for the clergy, and six members of the House of Commons, three or four to be a quorum. AU these were men whom tho King believed to be devoted to his interests, and whom he had spared no means to attach to himself. He held, therefore, his ParUament in his own hand. . . It was a resolute attempt not to evade, but to destroy, the limitations which for nearly two centuries the nation, first through the baronage alone, and latterly through the united Parliament, had been labouring to impose upon the King.\" These acts laid a foundation for the downfaU of Richard in 1399. In the articles of accusation on which his deposition was grounded, the delegation of the powers of Parliament to a committee of estates, and the fraudulent nse of that delegation"], [32, "12 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to engross the entire authority in his own hands, were prominent features. A Pious Subsidy. \u2014 Henry IV. caUed a ParUament which met October 6th, 1404. \" The ChanceUor,\" says Lord CampbeU, \" in a speech from the text ' Rex vocavit seniores terr\u00e6,' having pressed most urgently for suppUes, the Commons came in a body, and, the King being on the throne, proposed that without burdening his people he might supply his occasions by seizing on the revenues of the clergy. Archbishop Arundel replied that the stripping the clergy of their estates would put a stop to their prayers night and day for the welfare of the State. The Speaker of the Commons, standing at the bar, smiled and said openly that he thought the prayers of the Church a very slender supply.\" Royal Rewards to the Speaker. \u2014 Of the Parliament which assembled at Westminster March 1st, 1406, Sir John Tibetot was chosen Speaker. Sir John excused himself on account of his youth and other causes ; nevertheless, the King confirmed his election. This youthful Speaker appears to have discharged his functions to the satisfaction of the Court at least ; for at the close of the Parliament the King, to show his generosity and gratitude to Sir John, granted to him, in fee, aU the lands and hereditaments of Richard ap Griffith ap Voethus, in the counties of Carmarthen and Cardigan, and elsewhere in the principality of South Wales, forfeited to the King by his being an adherent to Owen Glendower, rebel and traitor ; and also the office of keeper of the forests of Weybridge and Sapley, in the county of Huntingdon, without any fee or out payments ; and further, the goods and chattels of Peter Priswick, carpenter, a felon, amounting to \u00a3150. He was afterwards made Earl of Worcester. \u2014 Parliamentary History. The Lords and the Privilege of the Commons. \u2014 From the case of Speaker Thorpe it is quite evident (writes Mr. James Gairdner) that in the days of Henry VI. the privileges of the lower chamber were entirely in the keeping of the House of Peers. Speaker Thorpe had been arrested in 1453, during the parliamentary recess, at the suit of Richard, Duke of Tork. The action was for trespass ; Thorpe was cast in damages of \u00a31000, and he still lay in prison in the foUowing February when Parliament reassembled. The Commons at once petitioned for the libera tion of their Speaker, as without him they could not proceed, and also of another member who was incarcerated at the same time. The Duke of Tork's counsel, in the Lords, opposed the appUcation, explaining the cir cumstances of the case. The Lords, being anxious to preserve the liberties and privileges of the lower house, asked the opinion of the judges, and the judges made a very careful reply. They declared \" that they ought not to answer to that question, for it hath not been used afore time that the justices should in any wise determine the privilege of this High Court of ParUament ; for it is so high and so mighty in its nature that it may make law, and that that is law it may make no law, and the determination and knowledge of that privilege belongeth to the Lords of the ParUament, and not to the justices.\" They only added that there was no existing form of procedure to quash aU processes against privileged"], [33, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 13 members ; otherwise privilege in such cases as treason, felony, and other serious offences would be a manifest interference with justice ; but that in minor cases a member arrested was allowed to make his attorney and attend in ParUament. On this opinion the Lords determined that Thorpe should remain in prison, and the Commons were commanded to elect another Speaker. Petition against a Judge. \u2014 In 1434 (13 Henry VI.) a petition was presented to the Commons of England against Sir William Paston, knight, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, by WiUiam DaUing. The fact that the Commons were appealed to on such a matter, at this early era in our records, is worth notice. The petition is thus given in Sir John Fenn's \"Paston Letters\": \u2014 \"Please it to the right sage and wise Commons of this present Parliament, that where(as) every justice of the King is sworn that he should not take no fees or rewards for to be of counsel with no man, but only with our sovereign lord the King, and thereto they be sworn. Please it to (the) Commons of the present ParUa ment that WiUiam Paston, one of the justices of our sovereign lord (the) King, taketh divers fees and rewards of divers persons within the shires of Norfolk and Suffolk, and is withhold with every matter in the said counties ; that is to say \u2014 Of the town of Tarmouth, Is. yearly ; of tho Abbot of St. Benet's, 26s. 8d. [several more are here instanced] ; and of Katherine Shelton, 10 marks (\u00a36 13s. 4d.), against the King, for to be of her counsel for to destroy the right of the King and of his ward \u2014 that is for to say, Ralph, son and heir of John Shelton.\" In a note prefixed to this petition, it is mentioned that Sir WiUiam Paston was born in 1378, became a judge of the Common Pleas in 1430, and from the propriety of his conduct was caUed \" the Good Judge.\" Henry VIII.'s Method with the Commons. \u2014 The Ministers of Henry VIII., says Oldfield, \"moved in 1536 that a biU be brought in to dissolve such monasteries as had not above \u00a3200 per annum in land. The biU remained so long in the House that the King, who was impatient to have it passed, took upon himself to expedite its progress. He sent for the members to attend him in his gaUery, when, having kept them waiting for a considerable time, he told them fiercely that if the bill did not pass it would cost many of them their heads.\" It is also related that whUc tho opposition of the Commons to the imposition lasted, Henry sent for a Mr. Edward Montague, who had considerable influence in the House, and said, \" Ho, man ! will they not suffer my biU to pass ? \" and, laying his hand on Montague's head, who was then on his knees before him, \" Get my biU passed by to-morrow, or else to-morrow this head of yours will be off.\" The biU was passed, aud Mr. Montague's head was permitted to remain upon his shoulders. Oriental Adulation. \u2014 In 1537 an insult was put upon the House of Commons, which shows (says Lord CampbeU) the degraded state to which Parliament was reduced in the reign of Henry VIII. On the recommen dation of the Court, Rich, whoso bad character was notorious, and who was hardly free from any vice except hypocrisy, was elected Speaker. He repaid this promotion by comparing the King, on the first day of the"], [34, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 14 session, for prudence to Solomon, for strength to Samson, and for beauty to Absalom; and on the last to the sun, that warms, enlightens, and invigorates the universe. Lord CampbeU also remarks that, as eastern despotism was established in England under Henry VIII., there was introduced a near approximation to the eastern custom of prostration before the sovereign. On the last day of the session of 1540, as often as any piece of flattery peculiarly fulsome was addressed to the King by the Speaker or the Chancellor, \" everyman stood up and bowed themselves to the throne, and the King returned the compliment by a gracious nod from it.\" Bribing Members with Foreign Money. \u2014 In 1544 (writes Gurdon), the Londoners not liking the intended marriage of Mary with the Prince of Spain, the ParUament was summoned to meet at Oxford. Against the caUing a new Parliament great sums of money were remitted by the Emperor (Charles V.) to Gardiner, to soften the leading nobility, and carry elections for commoners that would comply with the designs of the Court. Lord ChanceUor Gardiner having granted pensions to many of the leading members of the House of Commons, thereby softened them. Commencement of the Journals of the Commons. \u2014 A ParUament was caUed to meet at Westminster on the 4th of November, 1547, in the first year of the reign of Edward VI. The \" ParUamentary History \" says, \" We are now come to a period from which the Journals of the House of Commons are extant. The first volume, which begins with the reign, contains Uttle more than a diurnal succinct account of proceedings in reading biUs, &c. The Journals of the Lords are more explicit in the reign before us than those of the Commons.\" Secession of Members from the Commons. \u2014 In the ParUa- ment which assembled 11th November, 1554, the first of PhiUp and Mary, the legislative enactments of the three previous reigns against Roman CathoUcism were repealed. \" A circumstance occurred of a very extra ordinary nature in this ParUament \" (says the \"ParUamentary History\"), \" and the Uke of which we have not before met with.* This was a voluntary secession of some members of the Commons, who actuaUy left the House when they saw the majority inclined to sacrifice everything to the ministry. Lord Coke, who, in order to do honour to their memories, has preserved their names in his ' Institutes,' states that the Court resented this separation of the members, and ordered the Queen's Attorney- General to indict them in the Court of Queen's Bench. Six of them were so timorous as to submit to the mercy of the Court, and paid their fines. AU the rest, amongst whom was that famous lawyer Plowden, traversed; but judgment against them was prevented by the Queen's death.\" The Commons and the Suppressed Monasteries. \u2014 In 1557 it was stated (writes Oldfield) that Queeu Mary intended to rebuild the monasteries and restore the lands which had been alienated. The know ledge of this intention created such warmth of debate in the Commons * For later instances see \" Parliamentary Secession,\" in the Miscellaneous section."], [35, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 15 that several of the members laid their hands on their swords, saying, \" They knew how to defend their own properties.\" This put a stop to the intentions of the court. The Four Requests. \u2014 Hakewel writes, in his \"Modus Tenendi Parliamentum, or Old Manner of holding Parliaments \" (1670), that Sir Thomas Gargrave, chosen Speaker in the first year of Elizabeth, \" made the four requests, ever since and now usually made by most Speakers, as appears by his oration ; First, for free access to the Queen. Secondly. Uberty of speech. Thirdly, for priviledge from arrests. Fourthly, that his mistaking might not prejudice the House.\" A Caution. \u2014 Coke, Solicitor General, being chosen Speaker in 1592, made these requests through Lord Keeper Puckering (himself a former Speaker), and received for answer : \" Privilege of speech is granted, but you must know what privilege you have, not to speak every one what he liste' h or what cometh into his brain to utter, but your privilege is for such speech as shall be used with judgment and sobriety. Wherefore, Mr. Speaker, her Grace's pleasure is that if you perceive any idle heads that stick not to hazard their own estates, which wUl meddle with reform ing the Church and transforming the Commonwealth, and exhibit any bills to such purpose, you receive not those biUs tiU they have been shown to those who can better judge of such things.\" The \" Meddlesome \" Commons. \u2014 A Parliament met in April, 1571, and soon after (writes Hallam) it became the common whisper that no one must speak against licences, lest the Queen and Council should be angry. And at the close of the session the Lord Keeper severely reprimanded those audacious, arrogant, and presumptuous members who had caUed her Majesty's grants and prerogatives in question, meddling with matters neither pertaining to them nor within the capacity of their understanding. Frequent Committals to the Tower.\u2014 At the meeting of ParUament in February, 1575-6, Peter Wentworth broke out, in a speech of uncommon boldness, against Queen Elizabeth's arbitrary encroach ments on their privileges. The liberty of free speech, he said, had in the last two sessions been so many ways infringed, that they were in danger, while they contented themselves with the name, of losing and foregoing the thing. It was common for a rumour to spread through that House, \" the Queen likes or dislikes such a matter ; beware what you do.\" Messages were even sometimes brought down either commanding or inhibiting, very injurious to the liberty of debate. After surprising the House by the bold words, \" None is without fault, no, not our noble Queen, but has committed great and dangerous faults to herself,\" he went on to tax her with ingratitude and unkindness to her subjects, in a strain perfectly free indeed from disaffection, but of more rude censure than any kings would put up with. . . Wentworth had gone to a length which alarmed the House of Commons. They judged it expedient to prevent an unpleasant interference by sequestering their member, and appointing a committee of all the Privy Councillors in the House to examine him. Wentworth declined their authority, tiU they assured him"], [36, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 16 that they sat as members of the Commons and not as CounciUors. After a long examination, in which he not only behaved with intrepidity, but, according to his own statement, reduced them to confess the truth of all he advanced, they made a report to the House, who committed him to the Tower. He had lain there a month when the Queen sent word that she remitted her displeasure towards him, and referred his enlargement to the House, who released him upon a reprimand from the Speaker, and an acknowledgment of his fault, upon his knees. . . In the session of 1587-8, Wentworth insisted that some questions of his proposing should be read to the House. These queries were to the following purport: \"Whether this couucil was not a place for any member of the same, freely and without control, by biU or speech, to utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth ? Whether there be any council that can make, add, or diminish from the laws of the realm, but only this councU of parliament? Whether it be not against the orders of this council to make any secret or matter of weight, which is here in hand, known to the prince or any other, without consent of the House ? \" with others to simUar effect. These questions Serjeant Pickering, the Speaker, instead of reading them to the House, showed to a courtier, through whose means Went worth was committed to the Tower. Others who had spoken in favour of his motion underwent the same fate. Again, in 1593, on the very first day of the session, the unconquerable Peter Wentworth, with another member, presented a petition to the Lord Keeper, desiring \" the Lords of the Upper House to join with them of the Lower in imploring her Majesty to entail the succession of the crown, for which they had already prepared a bill.\" This step drew down, as must have been expected, the Queen's indignation. They were summoned before the CouncU, and committed to different prisons. \u2014 Hallam. An Undaunted Patriot. \u2014 A biU for reforming tho abuses of ecclesiastical courts was presented by Morice, attorney of the court of wards, and underwent some discussion in the House (1593). But the Queen sent for the Speaker, and expressly commanded that no bUl touching matters of state or reformation of causes ecclesiastical should be exhibited ; and, if any such should be offered, enjoining him on his allegiance not to read it. It was the custom at that time for the Speaker to read and expound to the house all the biUs that any member offered. Morice himself was committed to safe custody, from which he wrote a spirited letter to Lord Burleigh, expressing his sorrow for having offended the Queen, but at the same time his resolution \" to strive,\" he says, \" while his life should last, for freedom of conscience, public justice, and the liberties of his country.\" \u2014 Lbid. A \"Pope-like\" Speech. \u2014 Wentworth, the most distinguished assertor of civil liberty in Elizabeth's reign, related in the House a conversation he had held with Archbishop Parker. \" I was,\" he says, \" among others, the last ParUament (1574), sent for unto the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the Articles of ReUgion that then passed this House. He asked us ' Why we cUd put out of the book the articles for the hormlies, consecration of bishops, and such like p ' ' Surely, sir,' said I"], [37, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 17 4 because we were so occupied in other matters that we had no time to examine them how they agreed with the Word of God.' ' What ! ' said he ; ' surely yon mistake the matter ; you wiU refer yourselves whoUy to us therein !' ' No ; by the faith I bear to God,' said I, ' we wiU pass nothing before we know what it is ; for that were but to make you popes. Make you popes who Ust,' said I, ' for we wiU make you none.' And sure, Mr. Speaker, the speech seemed to me to be a Pope-like speech; and I fear lest our bishops do attribute this of the Pope's canons unto themselves \u2014 Papa non potest errare.\" \u2014 Ibid. Elizabeth and the Bishops. \u2014 Elizabeth, in her speech to Parlia ment on closing the session of 1584, when many complaints against the rulers of the Church had rung in her ears, told the bishops that if they did not amend what was wrong, she meant to depose them. Her power to do so was unquestioned, and her readiness to carry it into effect on minor occasions was shown by her weU-known letter to Cox, Bishop of Ely, when he resisted the sacrifice of his garden in Holborn to the Queen's favourite, Hatton : \" Proud prelate, \u2014 Tou know what you were before I made you what you are : if you do not immediately comply with my request, by G \u2014 I wiU unfrock you. \u2014 Elizabeth.\" A Member of Parliament Pilloried. \u2014 In Grafton's \" Abridg- ment of the Chronicles of England \" there is the foUowing account of a member who feU into great disgrace in the Parliament which sat in 1571 : \u2014 \" An undiscrete Burgeoys of the Parliament. \u2014 And it fortuned that in the said ParUament one very indiscrete and unmete man was returned a Burgeoys for the borough of Westbury, in Wiltshire, who being instructed by such as deUghted to abuse his simplicitie to evil purposes, as ho liim- selfe in the Parliament Hous (beyng sober) openly declared, or els caryed by excesse of drink, or both, did spreade abroade lewde and sedicious rumours against the Queenes Majesties person. And being thereof detected to the Parliament House, and the offence by hym confessed, and his defectes and insufficiency weU considered, hee was from the House committed to ward. And for that there was confessed corruption in receaving of money for his election, and also a band taken of him by certein of the town of Westbury, to save them harmless of tho said corrupt retorne (as hee confessed), the towne was amerced by the Parliament House at twentie pounds. Aud it was ordered that hee should have his said bande redelyvered. And afterward the sayd person, for the spreading of his sedicious rumour, he was, by order of the Quenes Majesties most honorable Council, sett on the piUory in Chepesyde in London.\" This case, remarks Hallam, is the earUest precedent on record for the punishment of bribery in elections. \" Hemming \" a Member Down. \u2014 Serjeant Heale, addressing tho House in 1601, said, \" The Queen hath as much right to aU our lands and goods as to the revenue of her crown ; \" at which aU the House hemmed, and laughed, and talked. \" WeU,\" quoth Serjeant Heale, \" all your hemming shall not put me out of countenance.\" So Mr. Speaker stood up and said, \" It is a great disorder that this should be used, for it is the ancient use of every man to be silent when any one speaketh ; and c"], [38, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 18 he that is speaking should be suffered to deliver his mind without inter ruption.\" So the Serjeant proceeded, and when he had spoken a little while, tho House hemmed again, and so he sat down\u2014 Parliamentary History. Parliamentary Despatch.\u2014 Lord Bacon relates that Mr. Popham, when ho was Speaker, and the Lower House had sat long and done in effect nothing, coming one day to Queen Elizabeth, she said to him, \"Now, Mr. Speaker, what has passed in the Lower House?\" He answered, \" If it please your Majesty, seven weeks.\" Bills Quashed by the Sovereign.\u2014 Queen Elizabeth on one occasion refused her assent to no less than forty-eight biUs which had passed both Houses. As the title of each bill was read, the usual bow implying assent was withheld, and the clerk thereupon made tho announcement usual in such cases, that her Majesty \"would take time to think about it.\" The last time on which the power to reject bills was exercised by the sovereign was in 1707, when Queen Anne refused her assent to a biU for settling the militia in Scotland. The Voice of the Nightingale. \u2014 King James, on the opening of the first Parliament held after his accession (1604), introduced the practice of personally declaring the reasons for summoning the Houses, and did so in a long and learned speech. When he had concluded, Lord Chancellor Ellesmere thus commenced an adulatory address : \"My lords and gentlemen, aU you have heard his Majesty's speech, and that extra ordinary confidence his Majesty hath reposed in the great wisdoms and loving affections of this present Parliament. Te do not expect, I am sure of it, any iteration or repetition of the same. A Lacedemonian being once invited to hear one that could well counterfeit the voice of the nightingale, put it off with this compliment \u2014 ' I have heard the nightingale itself.' And why should you be troubled with the croaking of a ChanceUor, that have heard the powerful expressions of a most eloquent King ? \" The Gunpowder Plot. \u2014 In the Journals of the Commons, Novem ber 5th, 1605, occurs this entry : \" This last night the Upper House of Parliament was searched by Sir Thomas Knevett, and one Johnston, servant to Mr. Thomas Percyl, was there apprehended, who had placed thirty-six barrels of gunpowder in the vault under the house, with a purpose to blow up the King and the whole company when they should there assemble. Afterwards divers other geutlemen were discovered to be of the plot.\" The King, addressing the Parliament on that occasion, said: \" This may weU be called a roaring, nay, a thundering sin of fire and brimstone, from the which God hath so miraculously delivered us all.\" Tho Plot is commemorated in the Houses of Parliament by an observance continued (says Mr. R. Palgrave) down to the present day. Before the opening of every session, a company of \" beefeaters \" from the Tower of London examine all the places below the rooms in which the Lords aud Commons are to sit. Disputing Royal Interference. \u2014 A double return (writes Old field) having been made in an election for the county of Bucks, in the"], [39, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 19 third year of the reign of King James I. (1606), the House decided that Sir Francis Goodwin was duly elected, and nullified the return of Sir John Fortescue. The King interposing desired the Lords to demand a conference with the Commons on the subject. This the Commons refused ; and also decUned to comply with a positive command that they should confer with one of the judges. The matter was adjusted by Sir Francis yielding up his right. A Bishop's Apology. \u2014 In 1614, Dr. Richard NeUe, Bishop of Lincoln, uttered some words which gave offence to the Commons, and they complained of them in a message to the Lords, to which they received an answer that the bishop \" had made solemn protestation, upon his salvation, that he had not spoken anything with any evU intention to that House, which he doth with all his heart duly respect and highly esteem ; express ing, with many tears, his sorrow that his words were so misconceived, and strained further than he ever meant ; which submissive and ingenuous behaving of himself had satisfied the Lords, and their lordships assure the Commons that if they had conceived the lord bishop's words to have been spoken, or meant, to cast any aspersion of sedition or undutifulness upon that House, their lordships would forthwith have proceeded to the censuring and punishing thereof with aU severity.\" \u2014 May's \" Law, &c, of Parliament.\" The \"Kings\" of the Lower House. \u2014 James, notwithstanding his arbitrary notions of the kingly power and \" right divine,\" appears to have been duly impressed with the power of the House of Commons. Mr. Forster relates that Sir Robert Cotton was one of the twelve members who carried the famous declaration against monopolies, in 1620, to King James at Newmarket, when the quick-witted, shrewd old monarch caUed out, \" Chairs ! chairs ! here be twal kynges comin ! \" The follow ing instance of the King's impression is given by L'Estrange : \u2014 The King mounted his horse one time, who formerly used to be very sober and quiet, but then began to bound and prance. \" The de'il i' my saul, sirrah,\" says he, \" and you be not quiet I'se send you to the five hundred kings in the House of Commons ; they'U quickly tame you.\" Opening of Parliament by James I. in 1621. \u2014 Sir S. D'Ewes records that in tho King's short progress to Westminster, the foUowing passages were accounted somewhat remarkable. First, that he spake often and lovingly to the people, standing thick and threefold on aU sides to behold him, \" God bless ye ! God bless ye ! \" contrary to his former hasty and passionate custom, which often, in his sudden distemper, would bid a p or a plague on such as flocked to see him. Secondly, that though tho windows wero fiUed with many great ladies as he rode along, yet that he spake to none of them but to the Marquis of Buckingham's mother and wife, who was the solo daughter and heiress of the Earl of Rutland. Thirdly, that he spake particularly and bowed to the Count of Gondomar, the Spanish Ambassador. And, fourthly, that looking up to one window as he passed, fuU of gentlewomen or laches, aU in yellow bands, ho cried out aloud, \" A p take ye ! are ye there ? \" at which, being much ashamed, they all withdrew themselves suddonly from tho window. C2"], [40, "20 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Freedom of Debate. \u2014 Oldfield mentions that in the session of the eighteenth of King James I. (1621), Sir Edwin Sandys, having spoken with great earnestness and freedom on various matters of moment, incurred the displeasure of the King and his ministers. The House, by its vote, cleared him from having given any just cause of offence ; but, as soon as the adjournment took place, he was committed by a warrant of the Privy Council for a misdemeanor. After a confinement of nearly six months he was liberated by a warrant from the King, a few days before the ParUament again met. This affair gave rise to violent debates inside the House, and caused much commotion without. The King Erasing a Declaration of Privilege. \u2014 In the session of 1621 the Commons began to show evident signs of that dis content which afterwards broke out into such serious controversies with the Crown. Sir Richard Grosvenor said, \" We have hitherto sung nothing but placebo, and danced to the King's heart ; but it hath now pleased his Majesty to change this tune, and to make us sing nothing but lachrym\u0153, and sing loath to depart.\" At length the misunder standing between James and the Commons attained such a height, that the King, with his own hand, erased from the Journals of the Commons the celebrated protestation or declaration of their liberties and privileges, which they had passed in anticipation of a dissolution ; and, on the 6th January, 1622, published a proclamation declaring the Parliament dissolved, and animadverting with severity on those ill-tempered spirits who had compeUed him thus to exercise his prerogative. But James was not con tented with the bare expression of his displeasure ; several leading members of the country party, amongst whom was Sir Edward Coke, were committed to the Tower. \u2014 Roscoe's \" British Laicyers.\" The first volume of the Commons' Journals bears the entry, where the declaration was recorded, \" King James, in council, with his own hand, rent out this Protestation.\" Boys in the House of Commons. \u2014 Sir Robert Naunton, in his \" Fragmenta RegaUa,\" writing of Queen Elizabeth's reign, says : \" I find not that the House was at any time weakened and pestered with the admission of too many young heads, as it hath been of later times ; which remembers me of Recorder Martin's speech, about the tenth of our late sovereign lord, King James, when there were accounts taken of forty gentlemen not above twenty, and some not exceeding sixteen; which moved him to say, ' That it was the ancient custome for old men to make lawes for young ones, but that then he saw the case altered, and that there were chUdren elected into the great CounceU of the kingdome, which came to invade and invert nature, and to enact lawes to govern their fathers.'\" HatseU, in his \"Precedents,\" remarks that the poet WaUer, among others, sat in Parliament (1622) before he was seventeen years of age ; and notwithstanding the opinion of Sir Edward Coke as to the law, it is certain that the practice was different. The question was, however, finaUy settled by the 7th and 8th of WiUiam III., c. 25, which makes void the election of any person who is not twenty-one years of ao-e ; but members were occasionaUy admitted in despite of the provisions of"], [41, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 21 this Act. Charles James Fox was returned, and sat, at the age of nine teen ; but Chesterfield, under simUar circumstances, received from the Ministry of the day, whom he had attacked, a hint that he must withdraw. (See \" Personal\" section.) First Meeting of Charles I. and the Parliament. \u2014 It cannot be aUeged against Charles I. (says Isaac D'lsraeU) that he pre ceded the Parliament in the war of words. He courted their affections ; and even in his manner of reception, amidst the dignity of the regal office, studiously showed his exterior respect by the marked solemnity of their first meeting. As yet uncrowned, on the day on which he first addressed the Lords and Commons (June 18, 1625) he wore his crown, and vaUed it at the opening and on the close of his speech \u2014 a circumstance to which the Parliament had not been accustomed. Another ceremony gave still greater solemnity to the meeting : the King would not enter into business tiU they had united in prayer. He commanded the doors to be closed, and a bishop to perform the office. The suddenness of this unex pected command disconcerted the CathoUc lords, of whom the less rigid knelt, and the moderate stood : there was one startled Papist who did nothing but cross himself. A Slight from the Black Rod. \u2014 HatseU records that on the 19th of March, 1627, the Commons were sent for to attend the King in the House of Lords, by a Mr. Crane. \" It was very iU taken that Mr. MaxweU, Knight of the Black Rod, had not come himself to bring the message, as had formerly been used ; insomuch that sundry members of the House advised that Mr. Speaker elect should not stir tiU they had received the message by Mr. MaxweU himsolf. But others (howsoever they acknowledged this to have been a great neglect in Mr. MaxweU and wrong to the House) advised, becauso his Majesty stayed for them, that they should not now further insist upon it, but go up ; and so they did.\" Timid Counsels. \u2014 On the occasion of Sir John Eliot's first arrest for words spoken in Parliament, in 1626, the House of Commons, in reply to the Speaker's caU to proceed to the orders of the day, shouted \" Sit down ! sit down ! No business till we are righted in our Uberties !\" Sir Dudley Carleton, who held an office at court, attempted to sooth and at the same time warn the house. \" I beseech you, gentlemen,\" said he, \" move not his Majesty with trenching on his prerogative, lest you bring him out of love with ParUaments. In his messages he hath told you that, if there were not correspondency between him and you, he should be enforced to use new counsels. Now, I pray you to consider what these new counsels are and may be. I fear to declare those that I conceive. In all Christian kingdoms you know that Parliaments were in use anciently, until the monarchs began to know their own strength, and, seeing the turbulent spirits of their Parliaments, at length they, by Uttle and little, began to stand upon their prerogatives, and at last overthrew the Parliaments throughout Christendom, except here only with us.\" The House, however, was in no mood to Usten to this caution ; many members called out against tho speaker, \"To the bar! to the bar!\" and as the"], [42, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 22 House would go on with no business, the King was reluctantly compelled to release EUot after eight days' imprisonment, and to wait for another opportunity to punish him as he desired. A Strenuous Parliament. \u2014 The early Parliaments of Charles I. were short-lived, the first having an existence of two months, and the second of Uttle over four. The third, caUed together March 17, 1628 (1627, old style) and dissolved March 10, 1629, was a momentous one, for what transpired therein laid the basis of aU that foUowed in the Long Parliament. A rare book entitled \" The Sovereign's Prerogative and the Subjects' PrivUedge, discussed between Courtiers and Patriots in Parlia ment, 3 and 4 King Charles,\" gives the proceedings of this assembly, with many of the principal speeches. The date of this volume is 1657, preceding by two years the first volume of Rushworth's \" CoUectious ;\" and the preface, signed T. F., sufficiently indicates the hand of Thomas Fuller. In this the writer observes : \" And now give me leave to say that the history of the Parliament represented in this book is fundamental to the history of our times, and what vaUant pen soever dare undertake the writing thereof, it must lay its groundwork and take its rise from this Parliament. Herein were virtuaUy contained the seeds of aU those troubles which since the heat of anger hath ripened to the fuU height and breadth thereof. For what is said of Rebekah, that twins were in her bowels which made their mother's womb the field of their fight, wherein their unborn infancy gave an essay of that antipathy which would be continued betwixt them when arrived at riper years : the same was true here, where the opposition betwixt two parties was begun with much violence and impetuonsness. Tet let not the similitude be uncharitably improved beyond my intent, as fixing the odious character of Esau on either of them, who hope and believe that both of them might be Jacobs, at the first propounding plain, pious, and peaceable ends unto themselves. Tea, this may say to ensuing Parliaments, as \u00c6neas in the poet to his son. ' Disce puer virtutem ex me vernmque laborem, Fortunam ex aliis.' \" Great Occasions make Great Men. \u2014 It was the opinion of the chief orator of the United States, Daniel Webster, that the finest bursts of Parliamentary eloquence on record are to be found in the debates of the Parliament in the reign of Charles I. The collections of the time are very imperfect, but sufficient to show the high standard of thought, and the power of expression and illustrative aUusion, which pre vailed generally in the House of Commons; while, as regards brevity, even the longest of the speeches contrast most impressively with those of later days. Many of the men whose names are almost forgotten could be as eloquent at times as the great leaders of the House. Two instances from one debate (March 22, 1628) may be taken as samples, but others will appear further on. Sir Benjamin Rudyard spoke in favour of giving the King a large supply, but at the same time beseeching him to redress urgent grievances, and said : \" This is the crisis of ParUaments ; we"], [43, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 23 shall know by this if Parliaments Uve or die. . . Preservation is natural; we are not now on the bene esse, but on the esse. Be sure England is ours, and then prune it. Is it no smaU matter that we have provoked two most potent kings ? We have united them, and have betrayed ourselves more than our enemies could. Men and brethren, what shall we do ? Is there no balm in Gilead ? If the King draw one way, the ParUament another, we must aU sink. I respect no particular ; I am not so wise to contemn what is determined by the major part. One day teUs another, and one Parliament instructs another.\" Sir Robert PhiUips followed shortly after, and said : \" This day's debate makes mo caU to mind the custom of the Romans, tfho had a solemn feast once a year for their slaves, at which time they had liberty without exception to speak what they would, whereby to ease their afflicted minds ; which being finished, they severaUy returned to their former servitude. This may, with some resemblance and distinction, weU set forth our present state, where now, after the revolution of some time, and grievous sufferings of many violent oppressions, we have (as those slaves had) a day of Uberty of speech, but shaU not, I trust, be herein slaves, for we are free ; we are not bondmen, but subjects ; those after their feast were slaves again, but it is our hope to return free men.\" Then, passing on to point out several recent infringements of the Uberty of the subject, he exclaimed : \" I can live, although another without title be put to live with me ; nay, I cau live, although I pay excises and impositions for more than I do. But to have my liberty, which is the soul of my life, taken from me by power, and to be pent up in a gaol without remedy by law, and this to be so adjudged as to perish in gaol, \u2014 Oh, improvident ancestors ! oh, unwise forefathers ! to be so curious in providing for the quiet possession of our lands and Uberties of Parliament, and to neglect our persons and bodies, and to let them lie in prison, and that durante beneplacito, remediless. If this be law, what do we talk of our liberties ? why do we trouble ourselves with the dispute of law, franchises, propriety of goods, and the like ? It is the summa totalis of aU miseries. What may a man call his, if not liberty ? \" The King's Growing \" Distaste \" for Parliament. \u2014 Subsidies having been voted to the King on the 4th of April, 1628, Mr. Secretary Cook three days afterwards reported to the House the King's acceptance, and how his Majesty was pleased to ask, By how many voices they were gained? \"I said, but by one. His Majesty asked how many were against him ? I said, none ; for they were voted by one voice, and one general consent. His Majesty was much affected therewith, and caUed tho Lords in council, and there I gave them account what had passed. Besides, it gave his Majesty no smaU content that, although five subsidies be inferior to his wants, yet it is tho greatest gift that ever was given in Parliament ; and now he sees with this he shaU have the affections of his people, which will be greater to him than aU value. He said he liked Parliaments at the first, but since (he knew not how) he was grown to a distaste of them ; but was now where he was before, he loves them, and shall rejoice to meet with his people often.\""], [44, "24 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. The King Spurring the Commons.\u2014 Thursday, the 10th of April, 1628, Mr. Secretary Cook delivered this message from the King : \"That his Majesty desireth this House not to make any recess these Easter hoUdays, that the world may take notice how earnest his Majesty and we are for the pubUc affairs in Christendom, the which by such a recess would receive interruption.\" This message for non-recess (writes Rushworth) was not weU-pleasing to the House. Sir Robert PhiUips first resented it, and took notice \"that in 12 and 13 Jac., upon the like intimation, the House resolved it was in their power to adjourn, or sit. Hereafter (said he) this may be put upon us by princes of less piety. Let a committee consider hereof, and of our right herein, and to make a declaration.\" Sir Edward Coke spoke to the same purpose, and said, \" I am as tender of the privUe0^s of this House as of my life, and they are the heartstrings of the commonwealth. The King makes a proroga tion, but this House adjourns it self.\" Hereupon a message was sent to the King, \" That the House would give aU expedition to his Majesty's service, notwithstanding their purpose of recess.\" To which message his Majesty returned this answer, \" That the motion proceeded from himself, in regard of his engagement in the affairs of Christendom ; wished them all alacrity in their proceedings, and that there be no recess at all.\" There was no recess, but on Easter Monday the Commons presented to the King their petition \" concerning the bUleting of soldiers,\" to which they received a very sharp reply, ending as follows : \" To be short, go on speedily with your business, without fear or more apologies, for time caUs fast on you, which wiU neither stay for you nor mo. Wherefore it is my duty to press you to hasten, as knowing the necessity of it ; and yours to give credit to what I say, as to him that sitteth at the helm. For what concerns your petition, I shaU make answer in a convenient time.\" A Dream Related in Parliament. \u2014 A startUng message (relates Isaac DTsraeU) having been sent by the King for the despatch of business (about the time just mentioned), the House, struck with astonishment, desired to have it repeated. They remained sad and silent ; no one cared to open the debate. A whimsical, cracked-brained politician, Sir James Nethersole, suddenly started up, entreating leave to teU his last night's dream. Some laughing at him, he observed that \" kingdoms had been saved by dreams ! \" AUowed to proceed he said, \" he saw two good pastures ; a flock of sheep was in the one, and a bellwether alone in tho other ; a great ditch was between them, and a narrow bridge over tho ditch.\" He was interrupted by the Speaker, who told him that it stood not with the gravity of the House to Usten to dreams ; but the House was inclined to hear him out. \" The sheep would sometimes go over to the beUwether, or the beUwether to the sheep. Once both met on the narrow bridge, and the question was who should go back, since both could not go on without danger. One sheep gave counsel that the sheep on the bridge should lie on their bellies, and let the beUwether go over their backs.\" The application of this dilemma he left to the House. Eliot, Wentworth, and Coke protested against the interpretation of dreams in the House. A Maxim of the Commons.\u2014 On the 8th of May, 1628, the"], [45, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 25 Commons finished the Petition of Right, and deUvered it to the Lords for their concurrence at a conference. At this conference Sir Edward Coke made a speech in which ho said, \" We did think it the safest way to go in a Parliamentary course, for we have a maxim in the House'of Commons, and written on the walls of our House, that old ways are the safest and surest ways.\" The House in Tears. \u2014 In Rushworth's \" CoUections \" is given a letter from one of the members of the Parliament of 1628, Mr. Thomas Alured, to a friend, in which he thus describes a scene of tho previous day (the 5th of June) : \" Testerday was a day of desolation among us in Parliament, and this day we fear wUl be the day of our dissolution. . . We had a message from his Majesty by the Speaker that the session should end on Wednesday, and thai therefore we should husband the time, and dispatch the old businesses without entertaining new. Intending to pursue their declaration [against the Duke of Buckingham and other grievances], they had this message, requiring them not to cast or lay any aspersion upon any Minister of his Majesty. The House was much affected to be so restrained, since the House in former times had proceeded by finding and committing John of Gaunt, the King's son, and others ; and of late have meddled with and sentenced the Lord ChanceUor, and the Lord Treasurer Cranfield. Then Sir Robert Phillips spake, and mingled his words with weeping ; Mr. Prynne did the like, and Sir Edward Coke, overcome with passion, seeing the desolation likely to ensue, was forced to sit down when he began to speak, through the abundance of tears ; yea, the Speaker in his speech could not refrain from weeping and shedding of tears, besides a great many whoso great griefs made them dumb and sUent ; yet some bore up in that storm and encouraged others. In the end they desired the Speaker to leave tho chair, and Mr. Whitby was to come into it,* that they might speak tho freer and the frequenter, and commanded no man to go out of tho House upon pain of going to the Tower. Then the Speaker humbly and earnestly besought the House to give him leave to absent himself for half an hour, presuming that they did not think ho did it for any Ul intention ; which was instantly granted him. Then, upon many debates about their Uberties hereby infringed, and the eminent danger wherein the kingdom stood, Sir Edward Coke told them . . he, not knowing whether ever he should speak in this House again, would now do it freely, and there protested that the author and cause of all those miseries was the Duke of Buckingham, which was entertained and answered with a cheerful acclamation of the House. As, when one good hound receives the scent, the rest come in with a fuU cry, so they pursued it, and everyone came on home, and laid the blamo where they thought the fault was. As they were voting it to the question whether they should name him in their intended remon strance, the solo or the principal cause of aU their miseries at home and abroad, the Speaker, having been three hours absent and with the King, returned with this message : that the House should then rise till to-morrow * The Honse, in fact, \" going into committee.\""], [46, "26 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. morning. What we shaU expect this morning, God of Heaven knows. We shaU meet timely, partly for the business' sake, and partly because two days since we made an order, that whosoever comes in after prayers pays twelvepence to the poor.\" Assent to the Petition of Right. \u2014 On the 6th of June, 1628, the King moderated the effect of his message of the previous day, by sending another, in which he expressed a hope that \" all Christendom might take notice of a sweet parting between him and his people.\" The House of Commons, however, was determined that the Petition of Right should receive a definite reply, and sent a message to the Lords that they would join in a humble request to the King \" that a clear and satisfactory answer be given by his Majesty in full Parliament to the Petition.\" This being agreed to, the King came to the House of Lords on the 7th, and, the Commons being summoned, Charles made a short speech, in which he said: \" To avoid aU ambiguous interpretations, and to show you that there is no doubleness in my meaning, I am wUling to please you in words as weU as in substance. Read your petition, and you shaU have an answer I am sure will please you.\" The Petition having been read, the formal answer was returned, \" Soit droit fait comme H est desire,\" and the King again spoke. \" This,\" said he, \" I am sure is fuU, yet no more than I granted you in my first answer, for the meaning of that was to confirm aU your liberties, knowing, according to your own protestations, that you neither mean nor can hurt my prerogative. Aud I assure you my maxim is, that the people's liberties strengthen the king's prerogative, and the king's prerogative is to defend the people's liberties. Tou see now how ready I have shown myself to satisfy your demands, so that I have done my part; wherefore, if this Parliament hath not a happy conclusion, the sin is yours ; I am free of it.\" An entry on the Lords' Journals records : \" At the end of the King's first speech, at the answer to the petition, and on the conclusion of the whole, the Commons gave a great and joyful applause.\" Refusing to Put the Question. \u2014 Sir Simonds D'Ewes, in his \"Autobiography,\" relates that on the 2nd of March, 1629, \"Sir John Finch, the Speaker (being the Queen's soUcitor), refusing to do his office or to read some particular writings the House enjoined him,* many members thereof feU to reproving him, others to excuse him ; and the tumult and discontent of the whole House was so great, as the more grave and judicious thereof began infinitely to fear lest at the last swords should have been drawn, and that forenoon ended in blood.\" Selden thus addressed the Speaker on this occasion : \" Dare not you, Mr. Speaker, put the question when we command you ? If you wiU not put it, we must sit still ; thus we shaU never be able to do anything ; they that come after you may say, they have the King's command not to do it. We sit hero by command of the King under the great seal, and you are by his Majesty, sitting in his royal chair, before both Houses appointed our Speaker, and now you refuse to perform your office.\" On the following * See \" Personal \" section \u2014 Sir John Eliot."], [47, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 27 day, warrants were issued from the CouncU against Selden and other members, and several were sent to the Tower. Sir John Eliot was kept there till he died. Finch's conduct in the chair was many years afterwards made one of the grounds of his impeachment by the Long Parliament. The Dissolution of 1629.\u2014 The \"Vipers.\" \u2014 The dissolution of 1629 put an end to ParUamentary proceedings for more than eleven years \u2014 until the caUing of a ParUament in April, 1640. On the 10th of March, 1629, his Majesty was seated on the throne, the Lords being present in their robes, \" and divers of the Commons (says Rushworth) below the bar, but not their Speaker, neither were they caUed,\" when the King spoke as follows ; \" My Lords, I never came here upon so un pleasant an occasion, it being the dissolution of a Parliament ; therefore men may have some cause to wonder why I should not rather choose to do this by commission, it being a general maxim of kings to leave harsh commands to their ministers, themselves only executing pleasing things. Tet, considering that justice as weU consists in reward and praise of virtue as punishing of vice, I thought it necessary to come here to-day, and to declare to you and aU the world that it was merely the undutiful and seditious carriage in the Lower House that hath made the dissolution of this Parliament ; and you, my lords, are so far from being any causes of it, that I take as much comfort in your dutiful demeanour as I am justly distasted with their proceedings. Tet, to avoid their mistakings, let me teU you that it is so far from me to adjudge all the House alike guilty, that I know that there are many there as dutiful subjects as any in the world, it being but some few vipers among them that did east this mist of undutif ulness over most of their eyes. Tet, to say truth, there was a good number there that could not be infected with this contagion, insomuch that some did express their duties in speaking, which was tho general fault of tho House the last day. To couclude, as those vipers must look for their reward of punishment, so you, my lords, must justly expect from me that favour and protection that a good king oweth to his loving and faithful nobiUty.\" The Lord Keeper was then commanded to announce the Parliament dissolved. Compulsory Detention of Members. \u2014 A motion on the subject of grievances was under discussion in the Commons, November 6th, 1640, when, the time of rising being come, and other members appearing ready to continue the debate, an order was suddenly made that the door be shut aud none suffered to go out. The Lords were also advertised, that that House, too, might be kept from rising. \u2014 Parry's \" Parliaments of England.\" Similar measures were several times adopted at this critical period. The Impeachment of Strafford. \u2014 On the 11th of November, 1640 \u2014 a few days only after the meeting of the Long Parliament \u2014 Mr. Pym rose and announced that ho had a matter of the highest importance to lay before the house, and he moved that it should be cleared of strangers, the doors locked, and the keys laid on the table. He then entered into a long discourse on the condition of the kingdom, saying, \" We must inquire from what fountain these waters of bitterness"], [48, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 28 flow;\" and went on to denounce by name the Earl of Strafford, who had just returned to London from the North. In unfolding his charges Pym wrought the House to such a pitch that it resolved upon Stratford's instant impeachment, and the doors were unlocked to aUow Pym to proceed, as the messenger of the House, to the House of Lords. Here, supported by the presence of a large number of the members, he declared : \" I do here, in the name of the Commons now assembled in Parliament, and in the name of aU the commons of England, accuse Thomas Earl of Strafford, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, of high treason ; and they have commanded me further to desire your lordships that he may be sequestered from Parliament, and forthwith committed to prison.\" Strafford, according to Clarendon, had just entered the house, having heard that an unusually long sitting was in progress, and intending to denounce certain members of the popular party, as having induced the Scots to invade the northern counties. According to another account, Strafford entered while the lords were consulting upon the message just delivered, and, \" with a proud, glooming countenance,\" made towards his place. But, to his astonishment, he was required to with draw untU he should be caUed in, which he did in confusion ; and being presently summoned, was ordered to kneel, and deUver himself to the keeper of the black rod as his prisoner, until he had cleared himself of the crimes charged upon him by the House of Commons. He offered to speak, but was dismissed unheard, and, having been commanded to deliver up his sword, left the House in custody, \" no man capping to him before whom that morning the greatest of England would have stood discovered.\" Blowing up the House. \u2014 When the Lord Keeper Finch was impeached by the Long Parliament, the charges of high treason against him included not only his conduct in promoting the King's levy of ship money, and similar acts of arbitrary power, but also his refusing, when Speaker of the House in a former Parliament (1629), to comply with its wish by reading a remonstrance against Lord Treasurer Weston, &e. Many members spoke strongly on this subject. (Their remarks are summed up in \" Sir John Northcote's Note Book,\" 1640.) Mr. Whiteloeke urged that when Finch was in the chair he left it against the word of the House, and refused to move what was for the good of the kingdom ; and that such conduct, looking to its consequences, was treason. Mr. Peard also took the same view, and enforced it by saying, \" If the Speaker wiU be silent, we are dumb. That is blowing up the House without gunpowder. To have an idle Parliament was to have no Parliament at aU.\" Finch, however, escaped the fate of Strafford, which seemed impending over him, by making a hurried departure for Holland, after being heard in his own defence at the bar of the House (Dec. 21, 1640). The Commons Ordering a Speech to be Burnt.\u2014 Lord Digby having printed his speech on the biU for Strafford's attainder, a com mittee of the Commons appointed to inquire into the matter made their report on the 13th June, 1641. The House thereupon resolved: \"That no member of this House shaU give a copy, or pubUsh in print anything that he shall speak here, without leave of the House ;\" and declared that"], [49, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 29 Lord Digby's speech was untrue, and scandalous to the proceedings of the House ; and ordered it to be burnt, which was done, as usual, by tho common hangman. A Convenient Elevation. \u2014 My Lord Digby (says Selden) having spoken something in the House of Commons for which they would have questioned him, was presently caUed to the Upper House. \" He did by the Parliament as an ape when he hath done some waggery : his master spies him, and he looks for his whip ; but before he can come at him, whip, says he, to the top of the house.\" Exercise of the Power of Life and Death. \u2014 Lord Digby's speech on the attainder of Strafford, having been condemned by order of the House of Commons, does not appear in the \" Speeches and Passages of this Great and Happy Parliament,\" printed in 1641. It is given, however, in a reprint of that coUection which was issued in 1656. Tho attempt to suppress such an address shows how intolerant was Parliament at this time of anything against the feeUng of the powerful majority. The following were among the principal passages of the speech : \" Some (I thank them for their plain dealing) have been so free as to teU me that I suffered much by the backwardness I have shown in this bUl of attainder of the Earl of Strafford, against whom I had been formerly so keen, so active. Truly, Sir, I am stiU the same in my opinions and affec tions, as unto the Earl of Strafford. I confidently believe him the most dangerous minister, the most insupportable to free subjects, that can be charactered. I believe his practices in themselves as high, as tyrannical, as any subject ever ventured on, and the malignity of them hugely aggra vated by those rare abilities of his, whereof God hath given him the use, but the Devil the application. In a word, I believe him stiU that grand apostate to the commonwealth, who must not expect to be pardoned it iu this world till he be dispatched to the other. And yet let me teU you, Master Speaker, my hand must not be to that dispatch. I protest, as my conscience stands informed, I had rather it were off.\" He went on to argue that the House were formerly in the position of prosecutors against the earl, but should remember they were now acting as judges, and the fervour commendable in the former case would be \" misbecoming \" in the latter. After finding fault with Sir Henry Vane's evidence on the principal point against Strafford, that he advised the King to employ the army of Ireland to reduce England, the speaker continued : \" Had this of the Irish army been proved, it would have diffused a complexion of treason over aU ; it would have been a with indeed, to bind aU those other scattered and lesser branches, as it were, into a faggot of treason. I do not say but the rest may represent him as a man worthy to die. and perhaps worthier than many a traitor. I do not say but they may justly direct us to enact that they shall be treason for the future. But God keep me from giving judgment of death on any man, and of ruin to his innocent posterity, upon a law made a posteriori. Let the mark be set on the door where the plague is, and then, let him that will enter, die. . . Let me conclude in saying that unto you all which I have thoroughly incul cated to mine own conscience upon this occasion. Let every man lay his"], [50, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 30 hand upon his heart, and sadly consider what we are going to do, with a breath\u2014 either justice or murther ; justice on the one side, or murther heightened and aggravated to its supremest extent. The danger being so great, and the case so doubtful that I see the best lawyers in diainetrall opposition concerning it, let every man wipe his heart, as he does his eyes when he would judge of a nice and subtle object. The eye, if it be pretincted with any other colour, is vitiated in its discerning. Let us take need of a blood-shotten eye of Judgment.\" A Representation of Grievances. \u2014 Digby's speech just quoted separated him from the popular party in the House of Commons, to which he had previously been attached. But other of his speeches show zeal and abUity equal to those of any of his associates in the early days of the Long ParUa ment. On the 9th of November, 1640, he addressed the House on the upper most subject of grievances, explaining that Dorsetshire (the county he sat for) had not, like other counties, formally petitioned the House, having left it to himself and his coUeagues to deUver its representation by word of mouth, which he proceeded to do. \" But alas, Mr. Speaker,\" he con tinued, \" particular lamentations are hardly distinguishable iu universal groans. Mr. Speaker, it hath been a metaphor frequent in Parliament, and, if my memory fail me not, was made use of in the Lord Keeper's speech at the opening of the last, that what moneys kings raised from their subjects, they were but as vapours drawn up from the earth by tho sun, to be distUled upon it again in fructifying showers. The comparison, Mr. Speaker, hath held of late years in this kingdom too unluckily. What hath been raised from the subject by those violent attractions hath been formed, it is true, into clouds, but how ? To darken the sun's own lustre, and hath faUen again upon the land only in hailstones and mUdews, to batter and prostrate stiU more and more our liberties ; to blast and wither our affections, had not the latter of these been still kept aUve by our King's own personal virtues, which wiU ever preserve him, in spite of all iU counseUors, a sacred object both of our admiration and loves.\" A Humorous Incident on a Grave Occasion. \u2014 The Great Remonstrance lay engrossed on the table of the house on Monday, the 22nd of November, 1641, waiting the final vote. Mr. John Digby, member for Milborn Port, came into the house, and getting upon the ladder that stood at the door of the house, by which members usuaUy went up to the seats under the gaUery, sat stiU upon it. Whereupon Mr. Speaker Lenthal called out to him, and desired him to take his place, and not sit upon the said ladder as if he were going to be hanged ; \"at which,\" says the narrator, \" many of the House laughed.\" The Great Remonstance\u2014 Hardly (writes Forster) had announce ment been made of the division which carried the Grand Remonstrance by a majority of eleven votes (November 22nd, 1641), when one more strenuous effort was made to have it addressed to the King. Several members opposed tho printing of the declaration, and desired to enter their protest. About one o'clock of the morning, Mr. George Palmer, a lawyer of the Middle Temple, stood up. He should not be satisfied, he said, for himself or those around him, unless a clay were at once appointed"], [51, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 31 for discussion of whether the right to protest did not exist in that House ; and, meanwhUe, he would move that the Clerk should now enter the names of aU those whose claim to protest would then have to be deter termined. At these words the excitement broke out afresh; loud cries of \"AU! AU!\" burst from every side where any of Hyde's party sat; and Palmer, carried beyond his first intention by the passion of the moment. cried out, unexpectedly, that he did for himself then and there protest, for himself and all the rest \u2014 \" of his mind,\" he afterwards declared that he meant to have added, but for the storm which suddenly arose. The word All ! had fallen Uke a lighted match upon gunpowder. It was taken up and passed from mouth to mouth with an exasperation bordering on frenzy; and to those who in after years recaUed the scene, under that sudden glare of excitement, after a sitting of fifteen hours \u2014 the worn-out, weary assemblage ; the ill-lighted, dreary chamber ; the hour sounding one after midnight; confused, loud cries breaking forth unexpectedly, and startling gestures of violence accompanying them \u2014 it presented itself to the memory as a very Valley of the Shadow of Death. \"All ! aU ! \" says D'Ewes, was cried from side to side ; some waved their hats over their heads, and other took their swords in their scabbards out of their belts, and held them by the pommels in their hands, setting tho lower part on the ground ; so, if God had not prevented it, there was very great danger that mischief might have been done. Those who cried \" All ! aU ! \" and acted in the way described, were of the number against the Remonstrance. Amongst them was Mr. Philip Warwick, the member for Radnor, who bethought himself of a brief Scriptural comparison from the wars of Saul and David (2 Samuel ii. 12 \u2014 16). He thought of what Abner said to Joab, and Joab to Abner, when they met on either side of the Pool of Gibeon ; and how, having arisen at the bidding of their leaders to make trial of prowess, their young men caught every one his follow by the head, and thrust his sword in his feUow's side, and so feU down together; a result (as Warwick afterwards wrote) which might have foUowed, had not the sagacity and great calmness of Mr. Hampden, by a short speech, prevented it. \" Pull the Rogues out by the Ears ! \" \u2014 On the 3rd of January, 1642, the Attorney-General (Herbert) had made an ineffectual attempt in the House of Lords to procure the surrender of one member of that house and five members of the Commons, whom he accused in the King's name of sundry offences. A King's serjeant-at-arms delivered a similar message to the Commons, which replied, through a deputation to his Majesty, that the matter should be considered, and the accused would be ready to answer any legal charge. A long and very warm debate passed in the royal chamber on the night of this attempt, the Queen taking prominent part therein ; and it ended (according to an account left by Sir W. Coke of Nor folk) in the settled resolve that Charles would himself demand the members next morning. But his heart failed him when the morning came. He went to the Queen's apartments early, and, finding Lady Carlisle with her, took her Majesty into her closet, and there having put to her aU the hazards of the attempt, and all its possible consequences, declared that he must"], [52, "32 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. abandon it. Whereat the Queen, no longer able to contain her passion, is said to have violently burst out, \" Allez, poltron ! Go, pull these rogues out by the ears, ou ne me revoyez jamais ! \" The Attempt to Arrest the Five Members. \u2014 The most dramatic incident that ever took place in the House of Commons, and the most important in its consequences, was the attempt of Charles I. in person to arrest the leading popular members of the assembly. Pym, Hampden, Hazlerig, Hollis, and Strode were the five whom he had determined to secure. With an armed company numbering some two or three hundred officers and soldiers, attended by his nephew Charles, the Elector Palatine, and several members of the court, the King marched from WhitehaU to Westminster HaU on Tuesday, the 4th of January, 1642. The House gained word of his coming from one who had passed the crowd, and a lady of the court (Lady Carlisle) also sent a hasty message to put Pym on his guard. It was resolved that the five members, who had been impeached by the King's serjeant on the previous day, should \" depart forthwith, to avoid combustion in the house.\" Four left immediately, but Strode insisted on staying to face the King, until he was forced from the house by his friend Sir Walter Earle, just as Charles was entering Palace Tard. A lane was made by the courtiers as the King advanced through Westminster HaU up to the door of the Commons, and some of his armed party pressed forward and thrust away the doorkeepers, but were commanded by Charles to refrain from entering \" upon their lives.\" A knock was given, and the door was opened at once, the King passing in accompanied by his nephew alone. He advanced, uncovered, toward the chair, glancing eagerly at the place where Pym was accustomed to sit, but not seeing him, approached Speaker Lenthal and said, \" By your leave, Mr. Speaker, I must borrow your chair a little.\" The Speaker left, and the King entered it, again looking eagerly around, while the members stood uncovered before him. The sUence was painful ; the King broke it at length, in slow utterances. Rushworth, a clerk at the table, appears almost alone to have kept his composure, coolly noting down \" in character \" the King's words, of which Charles asked him tho same evening to give an exact transcript. \" Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I am sorry for this occasion of coming unto you. Testerday I sent a serjeant- at-arms, upon a very important occasion, to apprehend some that, by my command, were accused of high treason, whereunto I did expect obedience, and not a message; and I must declare unto you here, that albeit no king that ever was in England shaU be more careful of your privileges, to maintain them to the uttermost of his power, than I shall be, yet you must know that in cases of treason no person hath a privilege. And therefore I am come to know if any of those persons that were .accused are here ; for I must tell you, gentlemen, that so lono- as these persons that I have accused, for no slight crime but for treason, are here, I cannot expect that this House will be in the right way that I do heartily wish it ; therefore I am come to teU you that I must have them whereso ever I find them.\" He again looked about him, and called Mr. Pym by name. No answer being mnde, he turned to the Speaker, and required to"], [53, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 33 know whether any of the persons he had named were in the house. Lenthal answered, kneeling, \" May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here ; and humbly beg your Majesty's pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your Majesty is pleased to demand of me.\" \" Well,\" said the King at last, \" since I see aU the birds are flown, I do expect from you that you wiU send them unto me as soon as they return hither.\" Apparently impressed by the attitude of the Speaker and the House, he added something more to the effect that he had never intended any force, but to proceed against the members in a legal and fair way, concluding, \" I wiU trouble you no more, but teU you I do expect, as soon as they come to the house, you wiU send them to me. otherwise I must take my own course to find them.\" He then retired, \" pulling off his hat tiU he came to the door,\" the members scowling at him and audibly muttering \" Privilege ! privilege ! \" The House adjourned itself immediately the King had left. A Gallant Contribution. \u2014 Mr. Henry KiUegrew, of CornwaU, member for West Looe, a stanch Royalist, on being invited, with the other members, to offer a contribution towards the formation of an army for the Parliament, stood up and answered he would provide a good horse, and a good sword, and a good buff coat, and then he would find a good cause ; \" which for that time,\" says Clarendon, \" only raised laughter, though they knew weU what cause he thought good, which he had never dissembled.\" Imprudence. \u2014 Selden says : \" The King calling his friends from the Parliament, because he had use of them at Oxford, is as if a man should have use of a little piece of wood, and he runs down into the ceUar and takes the spigott : in the meantime aU the beer runs about the house. When his friends are absent the King wiU be lost.\" Altering the Lord's Prayer. \u2014 Isaac DTsraeli mentions that \"there was a most bloody-minded 'maker of washing-baUs,' as one John Durant is described, appointed a lecturer by the House of Commons (the Rump), who always left out of the Lord's Prayer, ' As we forgive them that trespass against us,' and substituted, ' Lord, siuce thou hast now drawn out thy sword, let it not be sheathed again tiU it be glutted in the blood of the maliguants.' \" Peers Sitting in the House of Commons. \u2014 By the Act passed in March, 1648, for abolishing the House of Peers, it was declared, \" That such Lords as have demeaned themselves with honour, courage, and fidelity to the Commonwealth, and their posterity who shaU continue so, shaU not be excluded from the public councils of the nation, but shaU be admitted thereunto, and have their free vote in Parliament, if they shall be thereunto elected, as other persons of interest, elected and qualified there unto, ought to have.\" In couseqnenee hereof the Earl of Pembroke took his seat in tho House of Commons on the 16th of April, 1649, as knight of the shire for Berks ; as did also, in the same year, W. Earl of Salisbury, as a burgess for Lynne, and Edward Lord Howard of Eserike, as a citizen for Carlisle. These were the only peers that were elected members of the House of Commons. \u2014 Parliamentary History. D"], [54, "34 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. The First Reform in Parliament. \u2014 A House of Commons (writes Macaulay) \"was a necessary part of CromweU's new polity. In constituting this body, the Protector showed a wisdom and a public spirit which were not duly appreciated by his contemporaries. The vices of the old representative system, though by no means so serious as they after- wards became, had already been remarked by far-sighted men. Cromwell reformed that system on the same principles on which Mr. Pitt, a hundred and thirty years later, attempted to reform it, and on which it was at length reformed in our own times. To create a House of Lords was a less easy task. It was to no purpose that he offered to the chiefs of iUustrious famiUes seats in his new senate. They conceived that they could not accept a nomination to an upstart assembly without renouncing their birthright and betraying their order. The Protector was, therefore, under the necessity of filUng his Upper House with new men who, during the late stirring times, had made themselves conspicuous. This was the least happy of his contrivances, and displeased all parties. The Levellers were angry with him for instituting a privileged class. The multitude, which felt respect and fondness for the great historical names of the land, laughed without restraint at a House of Lords in which lucky draymen and shoemakers were seated, to which few of the old nobles were invited, and from which almost aU those old nobles who were invited turned disdainfully away. . . The first House of Commons which the people elected by his command questioned his authority, and was dissolved without having passed a single Act. His second House of Commons, though it recognised him as Protector, and would gladly have made him King, obstinately refused to acknowledge his new Lords. He had no course left but to dissolve the Parliament. ' God,' he exclaimed, at parting, ' be judge between you and me ! ' \" Power of Parliament to Convene itself. \u2014 By a statute, 16 Car. I. c. 1, it was enacted that, if the King neglected to caU a ParUament fcr three years, the Peers might assemble and issue out writs for choosing one ; and, in case cf neglect of the Peers, the constituents might meet and elect one themselves. But this, if ever put in practice, would have been liable to several inconveniences ; and the Act itself was esteemed sc highly detrimental and injurious to the royal prerogative that it was repealed by statute 16 Car. II. c. 1. . . . The Convention Parliament, which restored King Charles II. , met above a month before his return: the Lords by their own authority, and the Commons in pursuance of writs issued in the names of the keepers of the liberty of England by authority of Parliament. The said Parliament sat tiU the 29th of December, fuU seven months after the Restoration, and enacted many laws, several of which are still in force. But this was for the necessity of the King, which supersedes aU law; for if they had not so met, it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been settled in peace. And the first thing done after the King's return was to pass an Act declaring this to be a good Parliament, notwithstanding tho defect of the King's writs. It was at that time a great doubt among the lawyers whether even this healing Act made it a good Parliament, and"], [55, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 35 held by very many in the negative, though it seems to have been too nice a scruple. And yet, out of abundant caution, it was thought necessary to confirm its Acts in the next Parliament, by statute 13 Car. II. c. 7 and c. 14. \u2014 Blackstone's Commentaries. \" Dissolution \" or \" Interruption ? \" \u2014 Pepys writes : Jan. 9th, 1659 \u2014 60. W. Simons told me how his uncle ScobeU (Clerk to the House of Commons) was on Saturday last caUed to the bar, for entering in the Journal of the House, for the year 1653, these words : \" This day his -ExceUence the Lord G. CromweU dissolved this House,\" which words the Parliament voted a forgery, and demanded of him how they came to be entered. He said that they were his own handwriting, and that he did it by rights of his office, and the practice of his predecessor ; and that the intent of the practice was to let posterity know how such and such a Par liament was dissolved, whether by command of the King or by their own neglect, as the last House of Lords was ; and that to this end he had said and writ that it was dissolved by his ExceUence the Lord G. ; and that for the word dissolved, he never at the time did hear of any other term ; and desired pardon if he woidd not dare to make a word himself what it was six years after, before they came themselves to caU it an interruption ; that they were so Uttle satisfied with this answer, that they did chuse a committee to report to the House whether this crime of Mr. ScobeU's did come within the Act of Indemnity or no. Scandalous Scenes. \u2014 December 19th, 1666. I up to the Lords' House to enquire for my Lord BeUasses ; and there hear how, at a con ference this morning between the two Houses about the business of the Canary Company, my Lord Buckingham leaning rudely over my Lord Marquis Dorchester, my Lord Dorchester removed his elbow. Duke of Buckingham asked whether he was uneasy ; Dorchester replied, yes, and that ho durst not do this anywhere else ; Buckingham replied, yes he would, and that he was a better man than himself ; Dorchester said that he lyed. With this, Buckingham struck off his hat, and took him by his periwigg and pulled it aside, and held him. My Lord Chamberlain aud others interposed, and upon coming into the House the Lords did order them both to the Tower, whither they are to go this afternoon. This day's work wiU bring the Lieutenant of the Tower 3501. . . Sir R. Ford did make me understand how the House of Commons is a beast not to be understood, it being impossible to know beforehand the success almost of any smaU plain thing, there being so many to think and speak to any business, and they of so uncertain minds, and interests, and passions. He did tell me, and so did Sir W. Batten, how Sir AUen Brodericke and Sir Allen Apsley did come drunk the other day into the House, aud did both speak for half an hour, together, and could not be either laughed, or puUed, or bid to sit down and hold their peace, to tho great contempt of the King's servants and cause ; which I am grieved at with all my heart. \u2014 Ibid. A Whip by the Court.\u2014 December 8th, 1666. The great Proviso passed the House of ParUament yesterday, which makes the King and court mad, the King having given order to my Lord Chamberlain to send d2"], [56, "36 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to the play-houses and brothels, to bid aU the Parliament-men that were there to go to the Parliament presently. This is true, it seems ; but it was carried against the court by thirty or forty voices. It is a proviso to the PoU Bill, that there shall be a committee of nine persons that shall have the inspection upon oath, and power of giving others, of aU the accounts of the money given and spent for this warr. This hath a most sad face, and will breed very iU blood. \u2014 Ibid. Parliament \" Fooled\" by Charles II. \u2014 Pepys gives the foUow- ing account of the cavalier treatment of a Parliament by this sovereign : \u2014 \" July 25th, 1667. 1 demanded of Sir R. Ford and the rest, what passed to-day at the meeting of Parliament : who told me that, contrary to all expectation by the King that there would be but a thin meeting, there met above three hundred this first day, and all the discontented party ; and, indeed, the whole House seems to be no other almost. The Speaker told them, as soon as they were sat, that he was ordered by the King to let them know he was hindered by some important business to come to them and speak to them, as he intended ; and therefore ordered him to move that they would adjourn themseves tiU Monday next (it being very plain to all the House that he expects to hear by that time of the sealing of the Peace, which by letters, it seems, from my Lord Hollis was to be sealed the last Sunday). But before they would come to the question whether they would adjourn, Sir Thomas Tomkins steps up and tells them that aU the country is grieved at this new-raised standing army ; and that they thought themselves safe enough in their trayn-bands ; and that, therefore, he desired the King might be moved to disband them.\" A vote to this effect being passed, the House adjourned. Four days afterwards Pepys writes : \" Presently comes down the House of Commons (in Westminster HaU), the King having made a very short and no pleasing speech to them at aU, not at all giving them thanks for their readiness to come up to town at this busy time ; but told them that he did think he should have had occasion for them, but had none, and therefore did dismiss them to look after their own occasions tiU October ; and that he did wonder any should offer to bring in a suspicion that he intended to rule by an army, or otherwise than by the laws of the land, which he promised them he would do ; and so bade them go home and settle the minds of the country in that particular ; and only added, that he had made a peace which he did believe they would find reasonable, and a good peace, but did give them none of the particulars thereof. Thus they are dismissed again, to their general great distaste (I believe the greatest that ever ParUament was) to see themselves so fooled, and the nation in certain condition of rum, while the King, they see, is only governed by his lust, and women and rogues about him. The Speaker, they found, was kept from coming in the morning to the House on purpose, till after the King was come to the House of Lords, for fear they should be doing anything in the House of Commons to the further dissatisfaction of the King and his courtiers.\" Intolerance in the House of Commons. \u2014 February 10th, 1667 68.

But before"], [57, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 37 the King's coming the House of Commons met ; and, upon information given them of a bill intended to be brought in, as common report said, for Comprehension, they did mightUy and generally inveigh against it ; and did vote that the King should be desired by the House the message delivered by the Privy CounseUors of the House) that the laws against breakers of the Act for Uniformity should be put in execution : and it was moved in the House that if any people had a mind to bring any new laws into the House about religion, they might come as a proposer of new laws did in Athens, with ropes about their necks.- \u2014 Pepys. Number and Payment of Members.\u2014 Ma rch 30th, 1668. At dinner we had a great deal of good discourse about Parliament ; their number being uncertain, and always at the will of the King to increase as he saw reason to erect a new borough. But aU concluded that the bane of the Parliament hath been the leaving off the old custom of the places allowing wages to those that served them in Parliament, by which they chose men that understood their business and would attend to it, and they could expect an account from ; which now they cannot : and so the Parlia ment is become a company of men unable to give account for the interest of the place they serve for. \u2014 Ibid. \"Our Masters at Westminster.\"\u2014 April 22nd, 1668. \"From the Privy stairs,\" writes Pepys, \" to Westminster HaU ; and taking water.

Presence of the King at Debate. \u2014 It was a frequent practice with Charles II. to attend the debates in the House of Peers, and he did so even when his own speech from the throne was being taken into con sideration. \" It was as good as a play,\" he said on one occasion. Bishop Burnet, writing of 1669, thus alludes to the King's practice : \" To prevent aU trouble from the Lords, the King was advised to go and be present at all their debates. Lord Lauderdale valued himself to me on this advice, which he said he gave. At first the King sat decently on the throne, though even this was a great restraint on the freedom of debate ; which had some effect for a while ; though afterwards many of the lords seemed to speak with more boldness, because they said one heard it to whom they had no other access but in that place, and they took the more Uberty because what they said could not be reported wrong. The King, who"], [58, "38 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. was often weary of time and did not know how to get round the day, liked the going to the House as a pleasant diversion. So he went con stantly, and he quickly left the throne and stood by the fire, which drew a crowd about him, that broke all the decency of that House. For before that time every lord sat regularly in his place, but the King's coming broke the order of their sittings as became senators. The King's going thither had a much worse effect. Thus he became a common solicitor, not only in public affairs, but even in private matters of justice. He would in a Uttle time have gone round the house and spoken to every man that he thought worth speaking to, and he was apt to do that upon the solici tation of any of the ladies in favour, or of any that had credit.\" Origin of the \"Cabinet.\" \u2014 Few things in our history are more curious than the origin and growth of the power now possessed by the Cabinet. From an early period the Kings of England had been assisted by a Privy Council, to which the law assigned many important functions and duties. During several centuries this body deliberated on the gravest and most delicate affairs. But by degrees its character changed: it became too large for despatch and secresy ; the rank of privy counciUor was often bestowed as an honorary distinction on persons to whom nothing was confided, and whose opinion was never asked ; the sovereign, on the most important occasions, resorted for advice to a small knot of leading ministers. The advantages and disadvantages of this course were early pointed out by Bacon, with his usual judgment and sagacity ; but it was not tiU after the Restoration that the interior councU began to attract general notice. During many years old-fashioned politicians continued to regard the Cabinet as an unconstitutional and dangerous board ; neverthe less, it constantly became more and more important. It at length drew to itself the chief executive power, and has now been regarded, during several generations, as an essential part of our polity. Tet, strange to say, it still continues to be altogether unknown to the law ; the names of the noblemen and gentlemen who compose it are never officiaUy announced to the public ; no record is kept of its meetings and resolutions, nor has its existence ever been recognised by any Act of ParUament. \u2014 Macaulay's \" History.\" The \" Cabal.\" \u2014 During some years the word Cabal was popularly used as synonymous with Cabinet. But it happened by a whimsical coincidence that, in 1671, the Cabinet consisted of five persons the initial letters of whose names made up the word cabal \u2014 Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale. These ministers were, therefore, emphaticaUy called the \" cabal ; \" and they soon made that appellation so infamous that it has never since their time been used except as a term of reproach. \u2014 Ibid* * As here intimated, the word did not originate at this period. Butler, in \" Hudibras,\" written some years before, has the lines \u2014 \" Set up committees of cabals To pack designs without the walls,\" and earlier instances may be found."], [59, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 39 \" Cabinet Council \" or \" Ministry.\" \u2014 Iu January, 1711, a debate arose in the House of Lords on the affairs of Spain, and it was resolved to present an address to the Queen for some papers, the House then adjourning during pleasure. The address was carried up immediately to St. James's, and a favourable answer was returned, together with an intimation that her Majesty designed to hear the debate incognito. It was resumed on the Queen entering the house, but it soon diverged into a question of the meaning of the term \" Cabinet Council.\" Lord Scars dale had proposed a resolution in which this term was used, but he after wards changed it to \" Ministers,\" giving as his reason that the latter was better known than the former designation. Lord Cowper gave his opinion that the word \" Minister or Ministry would run into the same exception with Cabinet CouncU ; that they were both tenns of an uncertain signification.\" The Earl of Powlet urged that \" there's no distinction between the Ministry and the Cabinet CouncU, for those who were of the Cabinet were Ministers ; \" but it was rejoined that the word Ministry was more copious. The Earl of Islay said it was true neither term was commonly known in the law, \" and therefore they ought to use a plain English word.\" The famous Earl of Peterborough contributed the most effective passage to the discussion. He said \" he thought the word Cabinet CouncU not so proper as Ministers. He had heard a distinction between the Cabinet Council and the Privy Council; that the Privy CounseUors were such as were thought to know everything, and knew nothing ; and those of the Cabinet Council thought nobody knew anything but themselves. The same distinction might iu great measure hold as to Ministers and Cabinet Council. The word Cabinet Council was indeed too copious, for they disposed of aU ; they fingered the money ; they meddled with the war ; they meddled with things they did not under stand. So that sometimes there was no Minister in the Cabinet Council.\" Debate without Reason. \u2014 Lord Keeper Guilford (writes Roger North) once dining with Mr. Hugh May, in Scotland Tard, Sir Henry Capel, who was of his lordship's relation and long acquaintance, made one. Among other discourse, Sir Henry Capel was urged much to say why they (meaning the country party) urged a certain matter so violently in the House of Commons, and yet there was no tolerable reason in aU the debate given for it. At last he answered that \"they did not use to give the true reasons that swayed them in debates to the House.\" His lord ship thought it a strange account. A Quarrel on a Disputed Division. \u2014 May 10th, 1675, a debate took place in the Commons respecting the English regiments in tho French army, the King (Charles II.) having stated that it would be incon sistent with his honour to recaU them. On a division, the tellers were charged with negligence and fraud ; instantly the leaders, who sat on the lower benches, sprang to the table, and the other members on each side crowded to their support. Lord Cavendish and Sir John Hanmer distinguished themselves by their violence ; and epithets of insult, with threats of defiance, were reproaclifully exchanged. The tumult had lasted half an hour, when the Speaker, without asking permission, took"], [60, "40 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. possession of the chair ; the mace, after some resistance, was again placed upon the table ; the members resumed their seats, and, on the motion of Sir Thomas Lee, a promise was given by each in his turn that he would take no notice out of doors of what had happened within. \u2014 Lingard's \" History of England.\" Counting Ten for One. \u2014 The former Parliament (writes Burnet, 1680) had passed a very strict Act for the due execution of the Habeas Corpus, which was, indeed, all they did. It was carried by an odd artifice in the House of Lords. Lord Grey and Lord Norris were named to be the teUers. Lord Norris, being a man subject to vapours, was not at aU times attentive to what he was doing ; so a very fat lord coming in, Lord Grey counted him for ten, as a jest at first, but seeing Lord Norris had not observed it, he went on with his mis-reckoning of ten. So it was reported to the House and declared that they who were for the bill were the majority, though it, indeed, went on the other side. And by this means the biU passed. The Case Altered. \u2014 A division took place in the Commons, session 1685, on a motion to consider the King's speech before they should proceed to the supply, when it was carried by one only against the court. The Earl of Middleton, of Scotland, then a Secretary of State for England and a member of the House of Commons, here seeing many go out upon the division against the court who were in the service of the Government, went down to the bar, and, as they were told in, reproached them to their faces for voting as they did ; and a Captain Kendal being one of them, the earl said to him there, \" Sir, have not you a troop of horse in his Majesty's service ? \" \" Tes, my lord,\" replies the other ; \" but my brother died last night, and has left me \"001. a year.\" This I had from my uncle, the first Lord Onslow, who was then of the House of Commons and present. This incident upon one vote probably saved the nation. \u2014 Note by Onslow in Burnet's History. Setting his House in Order. \u2014 A question was raised in the House of Lords, 1677 (writes Burnet), as to the legaUty of a prorogation. Buckingham, Shaftesbnry, Salisbury, and Wharton, for the part they took in the debate, were offered the alternative of asking pardon as delinquents, or being sent to the Tower ; they chose the latter. The Duke of Bucking ham left the House while Lord Anglesea was arguing against their imprisonment, but he came into his place next day, and excused his departure by saying that, as he saw their lordships intended he should lodge some time in another place, and as he kept his family with very exact economy, he had been home to set his house in order, and was now ready to submit to their pleasure. \" For Ever.\"\u2014 Evelyn writes : \" Oct. 1, 1678. The Parliament and the whole nation were alarmed about a conspiracy of some eminent Papists for the destruction of the King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr. Tongue, which last I knew. .

In 1679 the Commons chose Mr. Edward Seymour, who had been Speaker in the previous Parliament, but was reluctant to serve again ou account of Ul-health. When he was presented for approval by the King, the ChanceUor informed him his Majesty had other need of his services, and that the House must make another choice. A warm debate and address to the King foUowed, but the King replied to the bearers of the address, \" Gentlemen, aU this is but loss of time ; and therefore I desire you to go back again, and do as I have directed you.\" Another address was foUowed by a prorogation. The House eventuaUy selected someone else, in the person of Mr. Serjeant Gregory. Slitting a Member's Nose. \u2014 Burnet, in his \" History,\" relates the circumstances connected with the outrage upon Sir John Coventry. Sir John made a strong reflection on the amours of Charles II. , and struggled much in the House against grants of money. Referring to the players, who, it was urged by the court party, were the King's servants and a part of his pleasure, Coventry asked whether did the King's pleasure lie among the men or the women that acted ? This was carried with great indignation to the court. Charles accordingly sent some of the guards to watch in the streets where Sir John lodged, and leave a mark on him. Sands, and O'Brian, and some others went thither, and as Coventry was going home they drew about him. He stood up to the wall and drew the flambeau out of his servant's hand, and, with that in the one hand and his sword in the other, he defended himself so weU that he got more credit by it than by all the actions of his Use. He wounded some of them, but was soon disarmed, and then they cut his nose to the bone. The affair was managed under the orders of the Duke of Monmouth, to whose house the ruffians repaired after pei-f orming their task. The House passed a bill of banish ment against the perpetrators of it, adding a clause that it should not be in the King's power to pardon them. Judge Jeffreys not \" Parliament Proof.\" \u2014 After the dissolu- tion of the Oxford Parliament, in 1679, the country party petitioned for the calling of a Parliament in terms offensive to the court ; and, in opposition to these petitions, the prerogative party addressed the Crown, expressing their abhorrence of the proceedings of the peti tioners. In encouraging these abhorrers, as they were termed, Jeffreys rendered himself eminently conspicuous, and, on the meeting of the new Parliament in 1680, he fell, with the rest of those who had opposed the petition for its assembling, under the censure of the Commons. Accord ingly, on the 13th of November, 1680, it was resolved, \" That Sir Georgo Jeffreys, Recorder of the City of London, by traducing and obstructing petitioning for the sitting of this Parliament, hath destroyed the right of the subject ; \" and it was ordered that an humble address should be pre-"], [62, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 42 sented to his Majesty (Charles II.) to remove Sir George Jeffreys from aU pubUc offices. To this address his Majesty replied that he would con sider of it. Jeffreys himself trembled at the prospect of popular indignation. Being brought to the bar of the House, he received a reprimand on his knees, and such was the effect of this discipline upon his spirits that he immediately resolved to resign his office of Recorder, which drew from the King the observation that he was not \" ParUament proof.\" \u2014 Roscoe's \" British Lawyers.\" A Subterfuge. \u2014 In the reign of Charles II. many of the abhorrers, or prerogative party, were seized by order of the Commons, and committed to custody. One Stowel, of Exeter, refused to obey the Serjeant-at-Arms, and said he knew of no law by which they pretended to commit him. The House, finding it equaUy dangerous to advance or recede, got off by evasion.

Earwigging the Parliament. \u2014 Evelyn writes in his Diary: \" March 10th, 1687. Most of the greate officers, both in the court and country, lords and others, were dismiss'd, as they would not promise his Majesty their consent to the repeal of tho Test and Penal Statutes against Popish recusants. To this end most of the Parliament-men were spoken to in his Majesty's closet, and such as refus'd, if in any place or office of trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments. This was a time of greate trial, but hardly one of them assented.\" Origin of the Terms \" Whig \" and \" Tory.\" \u2014 At this time (1679) were first heard the two nicknames which, though originaUy giveu in insult, were soon assumed with pride, which are stiU in daUy use, which have spread as widely as the English race, and which will last as long as the English literature. It is a curious circumstance that one of these nicknames was of Scotch and the other of Irish origin. Both in Scotland and in Ireland misgovernment had caUed into existence bands of desperate men, whose ferocity was heightened by religious enthusiasm. In Scotland, some of the persecuted Covenanters, driven mad by oppression, had lately murdered the Primate, had taken arms against the Government, had obtained some advantages against the King's forces, and had not been put down tiU Monmouth, at the head of some troops from England, had routed them at BothweU Bridge. These zealots were most numerous among the rustics of the western lowlands, who were vulgarly caUed Whigs. Thus the appeUation of Whig was fastened on the Presbyterian zealots of Scotland, and was transferred to those English politicians who showed a disposition to oppose the court and to treat Protestant Noncon formists with indulgence. The bogs of Ireland at the same time afforded a refuge to Popish outlaws, much resembling those who were afterwards known as Whiteboys. These men were then caUed Tories. The name of Tory was therefore given to Englishmen who refused to concur in excluding a Roman CathoUc prince from the throne. \u2014 Macaulay's \"His tory.\" Professor Pryme, who represented Cambridge University and was Chairman of Committees, says, in his \" RecoUections : \" \" O'ConneU showed me in the Ubrary of the House of Commons, as an iUustration"], [63, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 43 of the name of Tory, an Irish Act of Parliament for the suppression of ' Rapparees, Tories, and other Robbers.' The appeUation of Whig, as well as Tory, was also a nickname, and given by the opposite party in aUusion to sour milk.\" Freedom of Speech in Parliament. \u2014 What was thought by the House of Commons, in the reign of James II. , unreasonable latitude of speech, is illustrated in the foUowing extract from Macaulay. The Commons had presented an address to the King on the subject of infrac tions of the Test Act, and were met by a reprimand. On the reassembling of the House, \" Wharton, the boldest and most active of the Whigs, pro posed that a time should be appointed for taking his Majesty's answer into consideration. John Coke, member for Derby, though a noted Tory, seconded Wharton. ' I hope,' he said, ' that we are aU Englishmen, and that we shaU not be frightened from our duty by a few high words.' It was manfuUy, but not wisely, spoken. The whole House was in a tempest. ' Take down his words ! ' 'To the bar ! ' 'To the Tower ! ' resounded from every side. Those who were most lenient proposed that the'offender should be reprimanded, but the Ministers vehemently insisted that he should be sent to prison. The House might pardon, they said, offences committed against itself, but had no right to pardon an insult offered to the Crown. Coke was sent to the Tower.\"* A Standing Danger. \u2014 On June 28, 1689, the subject of the arrest of the Earl of Danby, then a member of the House of Commons, was dis cussed. He had fitted out his pleasure-yacht, and supplied it with arms. It was aUeged that this was done with a view to some treasonable project. Serjeant Maynard said, in the course of his speech : \" If we take notice of this, and let a member sit amongst us so accused, we cannot weU answer that. We are to vote it a breach of privilege, and then inquire what those treasonable practices are. At this rate, we may aU be imprisoned and whipped to our lives' end.\" \u2014 Parliamentary History. Longevity. \u2014 Of Serjeant Maynard it is also related that when the Prince of Orange received a deputation from the bar on his arrival in London, he thus addressed the member who forty-seven years before had conducted the proceedings against Strafford : \" Serjeant, you must surely have outlived aU the lawyers of your time.\" \" Tes, my lord,\" was the reply to the future King, \"and without your highness I might also have outUved our laws.\" Division Lists. \u2014 Macaulay mentions that Usts of divisions were, for the first time in our history, printed and dispersed for the information of constituent bodies at the general election in 1690. The first publica tion, however, of division lists of any kind occurred (Mr. R. Palgravo points out) in April, 1641, when the names of those who had voted against Strafford's attainder were posted up as \" betrayers of their country,\" and a simUar document emanated from the opposite side. The Speaker an Agent of Corruption. \u2014 Sir John Trevor, who was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons in 1689, was also, for * Compare, under \" Chatham,\" \" Strong Terms respecting a King's Speech.\""], [64, "44 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. a time, First Commissioner of the Great Seal. Bishop Burnet says of him : \" Being a Tory in principle, he undertook to manage that party, provided he was furnished with such sums of money as might purchase some votes ; and by him began the practice of buying off men, in which hitherto the King (WiUiam III.) had kept to stricter rules. I took the liberty once to complain to the King of this method. He said he hated it as much as any man could do ; but he saw it was not possible, considering the corruption of the age, to avoid it, unless he would endanger the whole.\" Committal for Receiving Money from the King. \u2014 In 1693, '\u2022 while the Commons were debating supplies, the commissioners they had appointed for t aking the public accounts were ordered to lay before the House an accouut of what money had been paid for secret service, and to members of Parliament, out of the public revenue. Upon examination of the whole matter, it was resolved on February the 17th (1694), ' That the Lord Falkland, being a member of that House, by begging and receiving 2000Z. from his Majesty, contrary to the ordinary method of issuing and bestowing the King's money, was guilty of a high misdemeanor and breach of trust ; and that he be committed to the Tower of London during the pleasure of the House.' Accordingly his lordship was sent to the Tower, from whence on February the 19th he presented a petition to the House, setting forth that he was highly sensible of their displeasure, and that a longer continuance of his confinement would be extremely prejudicial to him. Whereupon it was ordered that he should be dis charged from his imprisonment.\" \u2014 Parliamentary Debates, 1668 \u2014 1741. Royal Prerogative. \u2014 Sir John Trevor, speaking in the House of Commons on the royal prerogative, maintained that its exercise was by no means to be inquired into by Parliament. \" It is the King's prerogative,\" said he, \" to make peace or war ; 'tis he that makes it and he that breaks it. The disciples came to our Saviour in the ship, and said, ' Lord, save us, or we perish ! ' and we say no more to the King.\" Vote of Censure on the Speaker. \u2014 In 1695 a rumour rose and spread that the funds of the City of London and the East India Company had been largely employed for the purpose of corrupting great men, and the name of Sir John Trevor, Speaker of the House of Commons, was mentioned among others. A committee was appointed to examine the books of the two corporations. Foley was placed in the chair, and within a week reported that the Speaker had, in the preceding session, received from the City a thousand guineas for expediting a local biU. As soon as the report of the committee had been read, it was moved that he had been guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor. He had to stand up and to put the question. There was a loud cry of \"Ay!\" He caUed on the \" noes,\" and scarcely a voice was heard. He was forced to declare that the \" ayes \" had it. A man of spirit would have given up the ghost with remorse and shame ; and the unutterable ignominy of that moment left its mark even on the caUous heart and brazen forehead of Trevor. Had he returned to the House on the foUowing day he would have had to put the question ou a motion for his own expulsion. He therefore pleaded"], [65, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 45 illness, and shut himself up in his bedroom. Wharton soon brought down a royal message authorising the Commons to elect another Speaker. \u2014 Macaulay's \" History.\" Royal Assent to a Bill Refused by WiUiam III.\u2014 On the meeting of Parliament in November, 1693, \" there was a biU lay ready for the royal assent, ' Touching free and impartial proceedings in Parliament,' which had been prepared the last year, and was now again brought in and passed by both houses; but his Majesty thought fit again to refuse his assent to it ; which the Commons took so ill, that the next day, upon considering the state of the nation, they resolved ' That whoever advised the King not to give the royal assent to that act was an enemy to their Majesties and the kingdom,' and a representation was drawn up by a committee, and agreed to by the House, wherein they humbly laid before his Majesty \" a representation to that effect. The King returned a vague reply, whereupon a motion was proposed in the House, \" That an humble application be made to his Majesty for a further answer ; \" but the motion was negatived. (Parliamentary Debates, 1668 to 1741.) The last occasion on which the Royal assent to a bill was refused occurred in the foUowing reign (see p. 18, ante). The Commons Stopping a Royal Grant. \u2014 In 1695, a warrant was issued by William III., conferring upon the King's friend Bentinck, who had been made Earl of Portland, sundry lordships in Wales, amount- ing to about five-sixths of the county of Denbigh. The matter excited strong opposition, and a deputation of gentlemen from the Principality was heard on the subject before the Lords of the Treasury. It was also brought before Parliament by a petition to the Commons, when Mr. Price \u2014 one of the petitioners, but also a member of the House \u2014 made a plain- spoken address on the subject, saying that at this rate we were in danger of becoming a colony to the Dutch. He continued : \" I shall make no severe remarks on this great man, for his greatness makes us little, and will make the Crown both poor and precarious ; and when God shaU please to send us a Prince of Wales, he may have such a present of a crown made him as a Pope did to King John, who was surnamed Sans Terre, and was by his father, King Henry the Second, made Lord of Ireland ; which grant was confirmed by the Pope, who sent him a erown of peacocks' feathers, in derision of his power and the poverty of his revenue. I would have us to consider that we are Englishmen, and must, like patriots, stand by our country, and not suffer it to become tributary to strangers. We have rejoiced that wo have beat out of this kingdom Popery and slavery, and do now with as great joy entertain Socinianism and poverty; and yet we see our properties daily given away, and our liberties must soon foUow. I desire redress rather than punishment, therefore I shall neither move for an impeachment against this noble lord nor for the banishment of him ; but shaU only beg that he may have no power over us, nor wo any dependence upon him.\" He concluded by moving an address to the King that the lands should not be granted but by consent of Parliament ; and we are told by the reporter (Parliamentary Debates, 1668 to 1741) that \"this stout and eloquent"], [66, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 46 speech made so great an impression that Mr. Price's motion was carried .fey an unanimous consent.\"* The address was presented to the King by the Speaker, attended by the whole House, and his Majesty replied, \" I should not have given him these lands if I had imagined the House of Commons could have been concerned. I will therefore recal the grant. and find some other way of showing my favour to him.\" The Lords Rescinding a Committal by the Commons. \u2014 25th Jan., 1697-98.\u2014 Charles Duncombe, Esq., M.P., was charged with making false indorsements on Exchequer bUls, and was committed close prisoner to the Tower. 29th.\u2014 Being ill, his apothecary and his brother Anthony Duncombe were permitted to see him. He confessed his guilt, and was expeUed the House. A biU was brought in for seizure of his estate, which was passed 26th Feb. after great opposition, 138 against 103. This being sent to the Lords, they desired a conference with the Commons, and not being satisfied, though he had acknowledged the fact, they discharged him from the Tower. 31st March. \u2014 The Commons re committed him. We do not find in the Journals of the House that any thing further was done. \u2014 Bray's Notes to Evelyn's Diary. The Case of Ashby and White \u2014 Law versus Privilege. \u2014 The representative history of Aylesbury (writes Oldfield) is the most important in the annals of Parliament, as it involves the famous case of Ashby and White \u2014 a contest between Law and PrivUege, which produced a serious difference between the two Houses. Ashby had brought an action (1703) against White and others, the constables, returning officers of the borough, for not receiving his vote. The House of Commons con sidered the interference of a court of law, in a question which 'concerned the right of election, as a breach of their privilege, and ordered aU the parties concerned therein \u2014 counsel, attorney, and others \u2014 to be taken into custody. Lord Chief Justice Holt was also ordered to attend the House, but, disregarding the summons, the Speaker was directed to proceed with the mace to the Court of Queen's Bench and command his attendance upon the House. The Clues Justice is said to have replied, \" Mr. Speaker, if you do not depart from this court, I wiU commit you, though you had the whole House of Commons in your belly.\" The Queen was compeUed to prorogue the Parliament to put an end to the dispute. The Legislative Union with Scotland. \u2014 The copy of the treaty of Union between England and Scotland was registered by the Scottish Parliament on the 25th of March, 1707, and on the 22nd of April (writes Sir Walter Scott) \" the Parliament of Scotland adjourned for ever. Seafield, the Chancellor, on an occasion which every Scotsman ought to have considered as a melancholy one, behaved himself with brutal levity, and said that ' there was an end of an auld sang.' On the 1st of May, 1707, the Union took place, amid the dejection and despair which attended on the downfall of an ancient state, and under a suUen expression * Macaulay, strangely enough, questions the fact of this speech having been delivered, and alludes to it as an \" impertinence.\" \u2014 See note to his \" History \" Chap. XXI., 1G9G."], [67, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 47 of discontent, that was far from promising the course of prosperity which the treaty finaUy produced.\" A Scottish Patriot on the Union. \u2014 While the projected Union. was under discussion in the Scottish Parliament, in November, 1706, Lord Belhaven gave expression to the feelings of the party opposing it, in a forcible speech, part of which ran as foUows : \" I think I see the present peers of Scotland, whose noble ancestors conquered provinces, overran countries, reduced and subjected towns and fortified places, exacted tribute through the greatest part of England, now walking in the Court of Requests like so many English attorneys ; laying aside their walking swords when in company with the English peers, lest their self -defence should be found murder. I think I see the honourable estate of barons, the bold assertors of the nation's rights and liberties in the worst of times, now setting a watch upon their lips and a guard upon their tongues, lest they may be found guilty of scandalum magnatum, a speaking evil of dignities. I think I see the royal state of burghers walking their deso late streets, hanging down their heads under disappointments, wormed out of aU the branches of their old trade, uncertain what hand to turn to, necessitated to become 'prentices to their unkind neighbours, and yet, after aU, finding their trade so fortified by companies and secured by prescriptions, that they despair of any success therein. I think I see our learned judges laying aside their pratiques and decisions, studying the common law of England, gravelled with certioraris, nisi priuses, writs of error, verdicts, injunctions, demurs, &c, and frightened with appeals and avocations, because of the new regulations and rectifications they may meet with. . . But above aU, my lord, I think I see our ancient mother Caledonia, like C\u00e6sar, sitting in the midst of our senate, ruefuUy looking round about her, covering herself with her royal garment, attending tho fatal blow, and breathing out her last with an et tu quoque mi fill ! \" The effect of this harangue, says Scott, was in some degree dispelled by Lord Marchmont, who, rising to reply, said he too had been much struck by the noble lord's vision, but that he conceived the exposition of it might be given in a few words : \" I awoke, and behold it was a dream ! \" The Septennial Bill. \u2014 The biU extending tho duration of Parlia ment from three to seven years was passed in 1716. It was introduced by the Ministers of the clay in the House of Lords in the first instance. and, when it had passed that House, was sent down to the Commons by the hands of two of the judges. The preamble gave as reasons for the repeal of the Triennial Act that it had been found \" very grievous and burdensome, by occasioning much greater and more continued expenses in order to elections of members to serve in ParUament, and more violent and lasting heats and animosities among the subjects of this realm. than were ever known before.\" Lord Somers, who died on the day the bill was passed, was reported to have said of it, in his last moments, \" I think it wiU be the greatest support possible to the Uberty of the Country.\" A Dilemma. \u2014 The Earl of Peterborough, speaking in the House of Lords, April 14th, 1716, in opposition to the Septennial Bill, said that if"], [68, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 48 this present Parliament continued beyond the time for which they were chosen, he knew not how to express the manner of their existence, unless \u2014begging leave of that venerable bench (turning to the bishops)\u2014 they had recourse to the distinction used in the Athanasian Creed ; for they would neither be made nor created, but proceeding. \u2014 Parliamentary History. Expulsions from the House of Commons. \u2014 Many expulsions for commercial and other frauds took place in the early part of the eighteenth century. After the bursting of the South Sea bubble, several leading members who had been identified with it were expeUed from Parliament. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer, Aislabie, was one of these. He was said to have made a cpiarter of a miUion by transactions in the stock of the company, contrary to his oath of office. He was expeUed without a division, sent to the Tower, and ordered to refund his gains. The same fate befeU Sir George CasweU, a wealthy banker of the day. On the 23rd of January, 1721, the Commons, having ordered their doors to be locked and the keys to be laid on the table, summoned Sir Robert Chaplin, Bart., Sir Theodore Jansseu, Bart., Mr. F. Eyles, and Mr. Sawbridge (directors of the South Sea Company), to attend in their places immediately. General Ross acquainted the House \" that they had already discovered a train of the deepest villany and fraud that heU ever contrived to ruin a nation.\" It was then agreed nem. con. that Sawbridge and Janssen be expelled the House ; and on the 28th a like resolution was agreed to with respect to Chaplin and Eyles. \u2014 In 1723, Lord Barrington, an Irish peer, was expelled for \" promoting, abetting, and carrying on the fraudulent under taking caUed the Harburgh Lottery.\" In 1730, Sir Robert Sutton and two other members were dismissed for participating in the direction of a concern caUed the Charitable Corporation. A member (Mr. Ward) who in 1727 was prosecuted by the Duchess of Buckingham for forgery, and convicted, was expeUed and stood in the pillory, where he had his foot man in livery to attend him. He is referred to in Pope's line in the \" Dunciad,\" \" As thick as eggs at Ward in pillory.\" Paramount Dignity of Parliament.\u2014 On the 3rd of February, 1721, upon Lord ChanceUor Macclesfield's not coming in time to the House, and, when he came, excusing himself, \" that he had been sum moned to attend his Majesty at St. James's,\" the Lords said, \" That this is an indignity offered to the House, which is undoubtedly the greatest council in the kingdom, to which aU other councils ought to give way, and not to any other.\" \u2014 HatseU. A Courtier Censured by the Speaker.\u2014 Lord Southampton, then Colonel Fitzroy, being in attendance upon the King's person as one of the grooms of the bedchamber, and coming in late to make one of the forty members, the Speaker, Mr. Onslow, reprimanded him, as he came up the house, for not coming earlier. Colonel Fitzroy excused himself by saying \" he was in waiting upon his Majesty.\" \" Sir,\" said Mr. Onslow, with a loud and commanding voice, \" don't teU me of waiting ; this is your place to attend in \u25a0 this is your first duty.\" \u2014 Ibid."], [69, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 49 Keeping the King Waiting. \u2014 \" There happened within my memory,\" says HatseU, \" and since I have been in the service of the House of Commons, a very extraordinary case, which was in the first year of his present Majesty, King George III. (on the 20th of January, 1761), where the King was actually on the throne, and the Black Rod was coming with the message for the House of Commons to attend his Majesty ; but there not being forty members present, Mr. Onslow, then Speaker, declined taking the chair, and the King was kept waiting a considerable time. The reason of this was that it was generaUy known that the only purpose for which the King came at that time was to give the royal assent to a Money Bill. This bill had passed the House of Lords, but the House of Commons had received no message from the Lords to inform them that the Lords had agreed to it, and therefore tiU this message was received the Speaker could not take notice of their agree ment, or receive or take up the biU for the royal assent. And though the Lords' messengers were at the door, the Speaker could not, agreeable to the ancient rule and unbroken practice of the House, take the chair, for the purpose of admitting the messengers, tiU there were forty members present. If the Black Rod, instead of loitering, as he did, in the passage between the houses, had come forward and knocked at the door, the Speaker, though forty members were not present, must have immediately taken the chair and gone up to the King.\" Arbitrary Proceeding of the Commons. \u2014 When Lord Mayor Crosby and two of the aldermen had committed a messenger of the Houso of Commons to the Compter, in 1771, for attempting to arrest a citizen without their authority, not only were they sent to the Tower, but the Lord Mayor's clerk was ordered to attend at the bar of the Commons with the minute-books of his court, and he was thero forced to strike out the record of the commitment, and tho subsequent recognisances into which the messenger had entered. This arbitrary act may be compared with that of the Stuart King, who with his own hand erased from the Commons' Journals a declaration which offended him (p. 20). Mutual Jealousy of the Two Houses. \u2014 Speaker Denison, in giving evidence before the committee on House of Commons Witnesses in 1869, referring to the traditional jealousy of the two Houses, said that in 1772 Mr. Burke complained bitterly that he had been kept three hours waiting at the door of the Lords, with a biU sent up from the Commons. The Commons were so indignant at this treatment of one of their number that, shortly afterwards, when a bill was brought down from the Lords to impose a bounty on corn, the House rejected it by a unani mous vote. The Speaker then tossed it across the table on the floor, and a number of members rushed forward and kicked it out of the house. A Speaker Flouting the King. \u2014 In April, 1777, a messago was sent to Parliament by the King, asking for the payment of his debts, and a bill was brought in for the purpose, as weU as for the augmentation of his Majesty's revenue by 100,000?. a year. Horace Walpole writes : \" When the Speaker (Norton) presented this bill to the King in the House of Lords, he told him his faithful Commons had, in a time of pubU-- E"], [70, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 50 distress, full of difficulty and danger, and labouring under burdens almost too heavy to be borne, granted him a supply and great additional revenue, great beyond example, great beyond his Majesty's highest expense (he really used the word wants, but in his printed speech changed it to expense), but hoping that what they had contributed so liberaUy would bo employed wisely. This gave the King much offence, and was extra ordinary in such a tool, who had voted for the money himself. It was supposed that the Speaker acted from resentment, having been refused a peerage.\" A few days later, one of the members (Rigby) made some remarks on the subject. \"If I had spoken,\" said he, \" of the sense of this House in another place, I should have said a large majority approved it. I should not have said my constituents were labouring under burthens too heavy to be borne. If I had thought so I would not have voted the money, nor would have said the money granted was beyond his Majesty's highest wants.\" After the debate, the Speaker complained of Rigby's attacks, and Charles Fox proposed words in justification of the Speaker, which were agreed to without a division. \" Lord North was exceedingly alarmed during the debate, and wrote several notes to Rigby across the house to beg him to submit, which though he did and asked pardon, the Speaker was stout, and declared he would resign the chair next day unless the House itself gave him satisfaction.\" The Speaker Taking Part in Debate. \u2014 The foUowing passage from Walpole's \" Journal \" shows a Speaker of the House (Sir Fletcher Norton) taking what now seems an extraordinary part in its proceedings : \" March 13, 1780. Sir Edward Dering having attacked Mr. Rigby on his late doctrine of the Crown's unaUenable revenue, and the latter having defended himself, Charles Fox protested against such an unparUamentary declaration, and said he would appeal to the highest authority, the Speaker. On this appeal the Speaker came down from the gaUery, and made a warm and good speech against the increased influence of the Crown. But then he broke out into the most extravagant and profligate rhapsody that perhaps was ever heard in that place, accusing Lord North of duplicity, and professing himself his personal enemy on the grounds of a story that he had the impudence and absurdity to teU, with as Uttle modesty in the high estimation at which he rated himself. He acquainted the House that the Duke of Grafton, when Minister, had offered him the posts of Chief Justice in Eyre and the Speakership, with a promise of the best place in the law that should become vacant, without which, as he thought himself at the head of his profession, he would not quit his business. He asserted that Lord North had been privy to this bargain, and yet had broken it, by offering a large pecuniary bribe to Lord Chief Justice de Grey to quit that post in favour of Wedderburn. . . Lord North denied being tied by his predecessor's bargain \u2014 went farther, and denied his knowledge of it, in which few believed him, and stUl less did they beUeve Wedderburn, who denied knowing anything of the money part of the corruption. The dialogue degenerated into BiUingsgate between Lord North and Sir Fletcher Norton.\" A few days later Walpole adds : \" The Speaker made an apology for his late indecent"], [71, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 51 behaviour, but maintained the truth of what he had asserted. He said he knew how much he had been abused in newspapers for what he had said, but that he despised them, and only desired to excuse himself to the House.\" In a now Parliament, called a few months later, Mr. CornwaU was put forward by the Ministry as Speaker, in opposition to Sir Fletcher .Norton, and elected by 203 to 176. \u2014 The foUowing is a later instance of he Speaker's intervention. A biU for the relief of the Roman Catholics, introduced by Grattan in 1813, was read a second time by a good majority, but the effect of it was destroyed in committee, when Mr. Speaker Abbot moved the omission of the words, \" to sit and vote in either House of Parliament,\" which was carried by 251 against 247. The Commons and the Influence of the Crown. \u2014 On the <6th of April, 1780, Mr. Dunning moved a resolution, \" That the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.\" Mr. Dundas (Ministerialist) moved, as an amendment, to insert before the resolution the words, \" That it is now necessary to declare,\" &c. Lord North had on several occasions defeated the opposition by amending the words of their motions, but on this occasion Mr. Fox dexterously accepted Mr. Dundas's words, and the resolution, instead of being weakened, was strengthened by the amendment. On the whole resolution the House divided \u2014 for, 233; against, 215; majority, 18.* The Opposition then moved and carried two other resolutions to the following effect : \u2014 \" 2. That it is competent to this House to examine into and correct abuses in the expenditure of the civU list revenues, as well as in every other branch \u2022of the public revenue, whenever it shall appear expedient to the wisdom of this House so to do. 3. That it is the duty of this House to provide, as far as may be, an immediate and effectual redress of the abuses com plained of in the petitions presented to this House from the different counties, cities, and towns of this kingdom.\" Mr. Fox moved, notwith standing the lateness of tho hour, to report the motions immediately to the House, and although Lord North exclaimed loudly against such pro ceedings, as violent, arbitrary, and unusual, the motion was carried. \u2014 Russell's \" Life of Fox.\" The Dissolution of 1780. \u2014 A Pocket Majority. \u2014 The dissolu- tion of the Parliament which had been elected in 1774 took place on the 1st of September, 1780. It was on this dissolution that Mr. Burke lost his seat for Bristol, and that he made the famous speech, on giving up the contest, which is to be found in his works. It was at this election also that Mr. Fox was returned for Westminster for the first time, having defeated his competitor, Lord Lincoln, by a large majority. The general election did not make any great alteration in the numbers of the respective parties. Many seats were in those days in the hands of the Treasury ; a * Boswell relates that having asked Dr. Johnson whether he had not been vexed by \" that absurd vote of the House of Commons,\" \" That the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished,\" the doctor replied, \" Sir, I would have knocked tho factious dogs on the head; but I was not vexed.\" E2"], [72, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 52 number of others\u2014 making, together with the Treasury boroughs, a majority of the whole House\u2014 were in the absolute possession of indi. viduals whose interest led them to the support of the Minister. Thus (says Earl Russell) the sound of the national voice was often lost amid the comers and crannies of the House of Commons. The Mo Popery Riots. \u2014 In the session of 1779 an Act had been passed for tho relief of the Roman Catholics \u2014 a measure which induced the formation of the Protestant Association, with Lord George Gordon as its president. On Monday, May 29th, 1780, says the Annual Register, a meeting was held at Coachmakers' Hall, when it was resolved, \" That the whole body of the Protestant Association do attend in St. George's Fields on Friday next, at ten o'clock in the morning, to accompany his lordship to the House of Commons, on the delivery of the Protestant petition.\" Accordingly, on the clay appointed, many thousands assembled at the place of meeting, and marched in procession to Westminster, preceded by those who bore the petition against the CathoUc Relief Bill. About half- past two they arrived before the Houses of Parliament, when they gave a general shout. Members, as they arrived, were subjected to gross outrage and personal violence. Almost all were compeUed to put blue cockades in their hats and caU out \"No Popery!\" whilst some were forced to take oaths to vote for the repeal of the obnoxious law. While the mob were venting their fury on peers and commoners aUke, their leader harangued them from the top of the gaUery stairs, inciting stUI further by his language the storm of savage passions that he had raised. Colonel Gordon, a near relative of his lordship's, addressed him thus : \" My Lord George, do you intend to bring your rascally adherents into- the House of Commons ? If you do, the first man of them that enters I will plunge my sword, not into his, but into your body.\" The greater part of the day tho attention of the House of Commons was taken up in- debates concerning tho mob. When they had obtained some degree of order, Lord George introduced his business by informing them that he had before him a petition, signed by near one hundred and twenty thousand of his Majesty's Protestant subjects, praying a repeal of the Act passed the last session in favour of the Roman Catholics, aud moved to have tho said petition brought up. Mr. Alderman Bull seconded the motion, and leave was given accordingly. Having brought up the petition, his lordship then moved to have it taken into immediate consideration, and was again seconded by Mr. Alderman Bull. After some debate the House divided, and there appeared six for the petition and 192 against it. Soou after this the House adjourned, and, the mob having dispersed from the avenues of both houses, the Guards, who had been called out, were ordered homo. This demonstration at Westminster and attempt to overawe the Legislature was but a prelude to tho fearful riots which succeeded, and which resulted in 2S5 people being killed by the troops, and 173 wounded. The number of those who, sacking the houses, perished from inebriation and in the ruins of demolished buildings, is not known, but is believed to have been very considerable. A Foreign Critic in the House. \u2014 Mr. Moritz, a Prussian diviuo"], [73, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 53 who visited England in 1782, wrote a series of letters descriptive of his \"travels. In the metropolis he made his way to the House of Commons, \"where,\" says he, \"I now, for the first time, saw the whole of the British nation assembled in its representatives, in a rather mean-looking bmlding, that not a little resembles a chapel. The Speaker, an elderly man, dressed in an enormous wig with two knotted curis behind, and a black cloak, with a hat on his head, sat opposite to mo on a lofty chair. The members have nothing particular in their dress ; they even come into the house in their great coats, and with boots and spurs. It is not at all uncommon to see a member lying stretched out on one of the benches while others are debating; some crack nuts, others eat oranges, or whatever else is in season. Two short -hand writers sat not far from me, who endeavoured to take down the words of the speakers ; and thus aU that is veiy remark able may generally be read in print next day. The short-hand writers are supposed to be employed and paid by tho editors of the different news papers, and are constant attendants on the Parliament ; and so they pay the door-keeper a fee for the session. I have seen some of the members bring their sons, while quite little boys, and carry them to their seats along with them.\" Grattan's Parliament. \u2014 In an article in the Nineteenth Century for AprU, 1886, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky remarked : \" I have often wondered whether those gentlemen who assure us that Ireland wiU be satisfied with nothing less than Grattan's ParUament have ever seriously reflected what Grattan's Parliament under the Constitution of 1782 really was. It consisted, of course, of two Houses \u2014 a House of Lords as weU as a House of Commons. It was altogether Protestant. It was elected exclusively by Protestants, though, towards the close of its career, it, with signal liberality, admitted the Catholics to the franchise. It was drawn entirely from the section of the community which was indisputably loyal, and it was probably more eminently and speciaUy the representative of property than any Legislature that is now existing in the world. But, in order still further to secure a constant concurrence between this Legislature and the Legislature of Great Britain, the Government steadily upheld a system of representation under which about two-thirds of tho members of the Irish Parliament sat for nomination boroughs, a great proportion of which were at the absolute disposal of the Govern- ment. Tet, in spite of all these securities, the task of making the two Legislatures work iu harmony was not found to be an easy one, and it was on the great danger that might result from their coUision that Piit chiefly based his argument for the Union.\" The Legislative Union with Ireland.\u2014 The Parliamentary Union with Ireland, which came into effect on the 1st of January, 1801, was carried by the energy and determination of Lord CornwaUis (the Lord Lieutenant) and Lord Castlereagh. The secret measures adopted to effect it are revealed in tho \" Correspondence of Charles, First Marquis \u2022Coniwallis,\" published in 1858. There were three hundred members in the Irish House of Commons, of whom fifty were barristers. Tho sum -of 1,260,000?. was spent in the purchase of rotten boroughs from the"], [74, "54 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. persons who had the patronage, about 15,000Z. being given for each- Lord Downshire received 52,500?. for his interest of this kind, and Lord Ely 45,000?. Twenty-two Irish peerages were created as bribes, nineteen Irish peers received advancement to a higher grade, and five obtained English peerages. Pensions and places innumerable were given to less influential recipients. The Opposition was almost equally corrupt, and as much as 5000?. was given on either side for an individual vote. Last Meeting of the Irish Parliament. \u2014 The last sitting of the Irish House of Commons was held in College Green on the 10th of June, 1800. Mr. O'Flanagan, in his \" Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland,\" gives the foUowing description of the closing scene : \" At length the expected moment arrived ; the order of the day for the third reading. of the biU for a legislative union between Great Britain and Ireland was moved by Lord Castlereagh. . . He made his motion and resumed his seat with the utmost composure and indifference. Confused murmurs again ran through the House ; it was visibly affected ; every character in a moment seemed involuntarily rushing to its index \u2014 some pale, some flushed, some agitated : there were few countenances to which the heart did not despatch some messenger. Several members withdrew before the question could be repeated, and an awful involuntary silence succeeded their departure. The Speaker (Foster), a sincere and ardent enemy of the measure, rose slowly from his chair. For a moment ho resumed his seat ; but the strength of his mind sustained him in his duty, though his struggle was apparent. With that dignity which never failed to signalise his official actions, he held up the bill for a moment in silence ;. he looked steadily around him on the last agony of the expiring Parlia ment ; he at length repeated, in an emphatic tone, ' As many as are of opinion that this BiU do pass, say Aye ; the contrary, say No.' The affirmative was languid, but indisputable. Another momentary pause ensued. Again his Ups seemed to decUne their office. At length, with an eye averted from the object which he hated, he proclaimed, with a subdued voice, ' The Ayes have it.' The fatal sentence was now pro nounced \u2014 for an instant he stood statue-Uke, then indignantly, and with disgust, flung the biU upon the table, and sunk into his chair with an exhausted spirit.\" Political Jobbery and its Rewards. \u2014 The foUowing appeared in the Quarterly Review .- \u2014 During the reign of George III., 388 peers were created, nearly all for poUtical jobbery, which gcneraUy took the form of the manufacture of constituencies to return adherents of the Government. It was a common practice to carry an election by splitting up one freehold into ten, thus multiplying tenfold the influence of the local magnate. Lord Melville, during the first quarter of this century, was able to return thirty-nine out of the forty-five members for Scotland. Horace Walpole, in commenting on the death of Lord Clive in 1774,, writes with the utmost naivete, \" He had just named ten members for the new Parliament.\" The admission of honorary freemen just before the election was a common way of manufacturing votes. In the Uttle village of Maldon, in Essex, during the fifteen days of poUing, 2000>"], [75, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 55 honorary freemen were added to the electorate ; and ou the occasion of a contest in Carlisle, 1400 freemen, most of them from the coUieries of Lord Lonsdale, were admitted by the mayor the night before the election, though they had not any of the qualifications which the charter of the city required. Nominees in the Representative Chamber. \u2014 Oldfield's \" Representative History \" (published in 1816) contained the following estimate of the proportion of mere nominees in the House of Commons at the time. The calculation has been considered, by other examiners of the facts, to be as nearly accurate as possible : Members returned by 87 peers in England and Wales 218 \u201e \u201e 21 \u201e Scotland 31 \u201e ,, 36 ,, Ireland 51 Total returned by peers 300 Members returned by 90 commoners in England and Wales . . 137 ,, ,, 14 \u201e Scotland 14 \u201e \u201e 19 \u201e Ireland 20 \u201e nominated by Government 16 Total returned by commoners and Governmeut... 187 Total returned by nomination 487 Independent of nomination 171 Total of the House of Commons 658 Former Influence of the Aristocracy in the House of Commons. \u2014 When Canning was endeavouring to form a Government in 1827, Croker (an old politician, and Secretary to the Admiralty) thus wrote to him with regard to some of the forces which had to be kept in view in the days before Reform : \" Number of members returned to the House of Commons by the influence of some of the Peers : Tories \u2014 Lord Lonsdale 9, Lord Hertford 8, Duke of Rutland 6, Duke of New castle 5, Lord Tarbro' (for W. Holmes) 5, Lord Powis 4, Lord Falmouth 4, Lord Anglesey 4, Lord Aylesbury 4, Lord Radnor 3, Duke of Northumber land 4, Duke of Buecleuck 4, Marquis of Stafford 3, Duke of Bucks (2) 3, Lord Mount-Edgcumbe 4 \u2014 70 ; besides at least twelve or fourteen who have each two seats, say 26 \u2014 96. Whigs \u2014 Lord Fitzwilliam 8, Lord Darlington 7, Duke of Devon 7, Duke of Norfolk 6, Lord Grosvcnor 6, Dnko of Bedford 4, Lord Carrington 4 \u2014 42 ; with about half a dozen who have each a couple of seats, 12 \u2014 54.\" He added in another letter, \" I arrive at this conclusion, and a very important one it is, that tho old Tory and the steady Whig aristocracies have at least 150 members in tho House of Commons, not by influence or connection, but by direct nomina tion, and that no Government which did not divide them could stand for any length of time.'' Canning having requested some further particulars, Croker replied: \"There are about 30 Tory Peers, who have each one"], [76, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 56 seat; two Tory Commoners have each 4; sixteen Tory Commoners have each two seats ; and about seventeen Tory Commoners who have one seat each. Total, 203, in the hands of what may be called the Tory aristocracy. The Whig seats are about 73.\" The Roman Catholic Relief BUI.\u2014 The bill to remove the disabilities attaching to Roman Catholics was brought forward in 1829 by the Administration of Wellington and Peel, both of whom had pre viously resisted such a measure. The Duke, in proposing it to the House of Lords, justified it on the ground of the excitement existing in Ireland on the subject of the Catholic claims, and said, \" I am one of those who have probably passed a longer period of my life engaged in war than most men, and principally, I may say, in civil war ; and I must say this, that if I could avoid, by any sacrifice whatever, even one month of civil war in the country to which I am attached, I would sacrifice my life in order to do it.\" Mr. Peel said in the Commons, \" I believe that the time is come when less danger is to be apprehended to the general interests of the empire, and to the spiritual and temporal welfare of the Protestant Esta blishment, in attempting to adjust the Catholic question, than in allowing it to remain any longer in its present state.\" The bill passed both Houses by large majorities, and received the royal assent on the 13th of April, after a weak show of resistance on the part of George IV. On the 28th of April, the Duke of Norfolk and Lords Clifford and Dormer presented them selves in tho House of Peers to take the oaths and their seats, being the first Roman Catholics who entered the House under the provisions of the Act. Lord Surrey, son of the Duke of Norfolk, returned to the House ot Commons for Horsham, was the first Roman Catholic to claim a seat in the lower chamber. Mr. O'ConneU, who presented himself about the same time as representative for Clare, was refused admission on the ground that, as he had been elected while the old law was still in force, he must take the oath it prescribed ; but a new writ being issued, he was returned without opposition, and took his seat on the opening of the session of 1830. The Vote on the First Reform Bill.\u2014 The following account of the scene in the House of Commons, when the Reform Bill was carried for the first time by a majority of one, was given by Macaulay in March, 1831, in a letter to his friend Mr. Thomas Flower Ellis : \" Such a scene as the division of last Tuesday I never saw, and never expect to see again. It was like seeing C\u00e6sar stabbed in the Senate House, or seeing Oliver taking the maee from the table \u2014 a sight to be seen only once and never to be forgotten. The crowd overflowed the House in every part. When the strangers were cleared out, and the doors locked, we had six hundred and eight members present \u2014 more by fifty-five than ever were in a division before. The Ayes and Noes were like two voUeys of cannon from opposite sides of a field of battle. When the Opposition went out into the lobby, we spread ourselves over the benches on both sides of the House, for there were many of us who had not been able to find a seat during the evening. When the doors were shut we began to speculate on our numbers. Everybody was desponding. ' We have lost it. I do not"], [77, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 57 think we are two hundred and fifty. They are three hundred.' . . . As the tellers passed along our lowest row, the interest was insupportable. Two hundred and ninety-one \u2014 two hundred and ninety-two ! We were aU standing up, and stretching forward, teUing with the tellers. At three hundred there was a short cry of joy \u2014 at three hundred and two another, suppressed however in a moment ; for we did not yet know what the hostile force might be. We knew, however, that we could not be severely beaten. The doors were thrown open, and in they came. Each of them, as he entered, brought some different report of their numbers. We were all breathless with anxiety, when Charles Wood, who stood near the door, jumped up on a bench and cried out, ' They are only three hundred and one.' We set up a shout that might have been heard at Charing Cross, waving our hats, stamping against the floor, and clapping our hands.\" The Dissolution of 1831. \u2014 Excitement in the Houses. \u2014 Earl Russell, in the introduction to his \" Speeches,\" tells us : \" Lord Grey prepared the King for the decision to which the Cabinet arrived, to advise his Majesty to have recourse to an immediate dissolution of ParUament. The King, though averse to such a proceeding, little more than six months after the general election, was disposed, at this time, to trust implicitly to Lord Grey, and I am inclined to believe the popular story, that when it appeared necessary, in order to prevent remonstrance from the House of Lords, that the King should appear in person to dissolve the Parliament, and some trifling difficulty of plaiting the horses' manes was interposed as an objection, the King said at once, ' Then I'll go down to Parliament in a hackney coach.' . . The scenes which occurred in the two Houses of ParUament, so far as I was a witness of them, were singular and unprecedented. Before the King arrived, the House of Commons was assembled, and Sir Robert Peel and Sir Francis Burdett rose at the same time to address the House. Lord Althorp, amid the confusion aud clamour of contending parties, following the precedent of Mr. Fox moved that Sir Francis Burdett be now heard. Sir Robert Peel on the other hand, imitating a precedent of Lord North, said, ' And I rise to speak to that motion.' But instead of saying a few words, as Lord North had done, to put an end to all further debate, Sir Robert Peel quite lost his temper, and in tones of the most violent indignation attacked the impending dissolution. As he went on, the Tower guns began to fire, to announce tho King's arrival, and as each discharge was heard, a loud cheer from the Government side interrupted Sir Robert Peel's declama tion. Sir Henry Hardinge was heard to exclaim, ' The next time those guns are fired they will be shotted ! ' Presently we were aU summoned to the House of Lords, where the King's presence had put a stop to a violent and unseemly discussion. The King in his speech announced the dissolu tion, and retired to unrobo. The scene that foUowed was one of great excitement and confusion.\" \u2014 Mr. Duncombe, in the Life of his father, says, \" The change that had taken place in April, 1831, excited both the great parties equally. In the Commons the speech of Sir Robert Peel was interrupted by the sound of the cannon announcing the arrival of the"], [78, "58 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. King; every report elicited a burst of cheering from one side, and of yells and groans from the other. In the Lords the scene was equally extravagant, Lord Mansfield in his anger donbling up his fist, elbowing Lord Shaftesbury into the chair, and hooting Lord Brougham as he left the House.\" Passage of the Reform Bill.\u2014 The Threatened Creation of Peers. \u2014 The following particulars are given in Molesworth's \"History of the Reform Bill : \"\u2014On the 17th of May, 1832, Earl Grey and Lord Brougham waited on the King, who received them with evident ill humour, and, contrary to his usual practice, kept them standing during the interview. But he at once gave his consent to the creation of as many peers as the Ministry might think necessary to enable them to carry the Reform Bill through the House of Lords, with the understanding that this power was not to be exercised until every means of avoiding the necessity for it had been tried \u2014 a condition which the two lords readily agreed to, as they and all their colleagues were extremely averse to the proposed step, and many of them would even have abandoned a great part of their bill, if they dared, rather than have recourse to it. This having been arranged, and it being understood that the Ministers retained thoir offices, the King asked, \" Is there anything more ? \" \" Sire,\" said Lard Brougham, \" I have one further request to make.\" \" What,\" replied the King, \" have I not conceded enough ? \" \" Yes,\" replied the Chancellor; \" I do not wish to ask any fresh concessions of your Majesty, but simply to request yon to put in writing the promise you have made us.\" The King was evidently irritated at a demand which seemed to imply a want of confidence in his promise, but he also felt that he could not resist. After a moment's hesitation, he took a small piece of paper, on which he wrote the following words, which he then handed to Lord Brougham : \" The King grants permission to Earl Grey and to his Chancellor, Lord Brougham, to create such a number of peers as will be sufficient to ensure the passing of the Reform Bill \u2014 first calling peers' eldest sons. \u2014 Signed, William R. Windsor, May 17, 1832.\" The same evening Sir Herbert Taylor, who had been present at this interview, wrote the following circular note to the most active of the opposition lords : \" My dear Lord, \u2014 I am honoured with his Majesty's commands to acquaint your lordship that all difficulties to the arrangements in progress will be obviated by a declaration in the Honse of Peers to-night, from a sufficient number of peers, that in consequence of the present state of affairs they have come to the resolution of dropping their opposi tion to the Reform Bill, so that it may pass without delay, and as nearly as possible in its present shape. \u2014 I have the honour to be, yours sincerely, Herbert Taylor.\" This missive proved effectual. The bill was read a third time in the House of Lords (June 4, 1832) by 106 to 22 ; and the royal assent was given by commission a few days afterwards. A Vow.\u2014 In the month of April, 1832 (writes Lord Campbell), the Parliamentary Reform Bill again came up from the Commons, and was assailed by Lord Chief Justice Tenterden, in the last speech ho ever delivered in Parliament. In concluding his speech he said, \"This"], [79, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 59 measure, my lords, leaves nothing untouched in the existing state of the elective franchise. It goes to vest aU the functions of government in the other House of Parliament ; and if it were to pass, there would bo nothing left for this House, or for the Crown, but to obey the mandate of the Commons. Never \u2014 never, my lords, shaU I enter the doors of this House after it has become the phantom of its departed greatness.\" Lord Tenterdeu was as good as his word. After the Reform Bill received the royal assent, he never more entered the doors of the House. Mrs. Fartington. \u2014 It was on the rejection of the Reform BiU by the House of Lords in 1831 that Sydney Smith first brought forward this lady, as au illustration of the politics of the day. The foUowing weU known passage occurred in a speech of his at Taunton : \" The attempt of the Lords to stop the progress of reform reminds me very forcibly of the great storm at Sidmouth, and of the conduct of the excellent Mrs. Part ington on that occasion. In the winter of 1824 there set in a great flood upon that town \u2014 the tide rose to an incredible height, the waves rushed iu upon the houses, and everything was threatened with destruction. In the midst of this sublime aud terrible storm, Dame Partington, who lived upon the beach, was seen at the door of her house, with mop and pattens. trundling her mop, squeezing out the sea water, and vigorously pushing away the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic was roused. Mrs. Partington's spirit was up. But I need not tell you that the contest was unequal. The Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington. She was excellent at a slop or a puddle, but she should not have meddled with a tempest.\" A \" Curious Medley.\" \u2014 In Raikes's \" Diary,\" December, 1832, occurs the following : \" One of the effects of the Reform Bill is that the bone-grubber, W. Cobbett, is returned for Oldham, while, on the other hand, the notorious Mr. H. Hunt has been turned out of his seat at Preston. The new borough of Brighton, under tho very nose of the court, has returned two most decided Radicals, Wigney and Faithfull, who talk openly of reducing the allowance made to the King and Queen. The famous pugilist and bettor at Newmarket, Gully, has been returned for Pontefract. In short, the new Parliament will produce a curious medley.\" The First Quaker in Parliament.\u2014 A curious difficulty, writes Professor Pryme, \" occurred in the session 1832. A Quaker (Mr. Pease) was returned as the Whig member for the southern division of Durham. When ho came to the table to be sworn, previously to taking his scat, he claimed to affirm instead of taking tho oaths. The Speaker requested him to withdraw, and Lord Althorp moved that a committee be appointed to consider whether the Act of Parliament permitting affirmation in certain cases extended to this one. Their report, presented a few days after, was in favour of it, and the motion was agreed to unanimously. But another difficulty presented itself. It was a rule that the hat might be kept on when a member remained sitting, bnt must be taken off when moving in the house, and this dilemma was certain to occur daily. Some friend of Mr. Pease, to obviate this, instructed the doorkeeper gently to remove his hat and retain it tiU he quitted the house. In the course of a>"], [80, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 60 year or two he put it on and off for himself. It might have been thought that an individual of these peculiar habits would not have felt at home m such an assembly ; but this was not the case, and the feeling of bonhommie which generally prevailed in this ' best and pleasantest Club, as my friend Hope Vere designated it, placed him perfectly at his ease. As a proof of it, I will relate the following anecdote. After the termination of Peel's Short administration, when several of us were in the library of the House writing letters or conversing on the formation of Lord Melbourne s Ministry, one of those present jocosely asked Mr. Pease what place he was to have. He answered, ' There is but one place that I could think of taking, and it has not been offered to me.' 'What is that P' we exclaimed, and he replied, ' Of course, the Secretary at War.' \" Removal of Jewish Disabilities.\u2014 In 1849, Baron Lionel de Rothschild was returned as one of the members for the City of London, but was excluded (writes May) by an oath designed for Roman Catholics, whose disabilities had been removed. He sat there for two sessions in expectation of relief from the Legislature, but, being disappointed, he resolved to try his rights under the existing law, and accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. He was again returned, and in 1850 presented himself at the table. Having been allowed, after some discussion, to be sworn upon the Old Testament (the form most binding upon his conscience), the oaths of allegiance and supremacy were taken in the accustomed form ; but from the oath of abjuration he omitted the words \" on the true faith of a Christian,\" as not binding on his conscience. He was directed to with draw ; when, after many learned arguments, it was resolved that he was not entitled to sit or vote until he had taken the oath of abjuration in tho form appointed by law. He continued to attend the House until 1857, and during this period was accustomed to sit below the bar, and when notice was taken of the presence of strangers he still retained his seat. In 1851, Mr. Alderman Salomons, a Jew, having been returned fci* the borough of Greenwich, omitted from the oath the words which were the J ews' stumbling-block. He was directed to withdraw ; but on a later day, while his case was under discussion, he came into the house and took his seat within the bar, whence he declined to withdraw until he was removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms. The House agreed to a resolution in the same form as in the case of Baron de Rothschild. In the meantime, however, he had not only sat in the house, but had voted in three divisions, and for so voting he was fined 500?. by Baron Alderson in the Exchequer Court. In 1858 the Lords, yielding to the persuasion of the Conservative premier, Lord Derby, agreed to a concession. A biU passed by the Commons at once removed the only legal obstacle to the admission of the Jews to Parliament. To this general enfranchisement the Lords declined to assent ; but they aUowed either House, by resolution, to omit the excluding words from the oath of abjuration. The Lords' amendments found little favour with the Commons, but they were accepted under protest, and tho bill was passed. Baron de Rothschild was the first person who availed himself of the alteration. The House of Commons (says May) was indeed open to the Jew ; but he came as a suppliant. Two years later the"], [81, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 61 scandal was corrected, and the Jew, though stiU holding his title by a standing order of the Commons and not under the law, acquired a permanent settlement. \u2014 In 1885 the first Jewish peer took his seat in the House of Lords, Sir Nathaniel de RothschUd having been made a baron. Life Peerages. \u2014 The Wensleydale Case. \u2014 In January, 1856, the Government of Lord Palmerston determined to try the experiment of creating life peerages, and Sir James Parkc, a Baron of the Court of Exchequer, was created Lord Wensleydale, \" for and during the term of his natural life.\" A long debate ensued on the subject in the House of Lords, and a Committee of Privileges was appointed by the House to inquire into the legality of life peerages. The committee reported, in February, that such a creation could not confer the right to sit and vote in Parliament ; aud in consequence, a patent of peerage for Sir J. Parke was made out in the following July in the usual form, with remainder to \" the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten.\" \u2014 By the Appellate Juris diction Act, passed in 1876, two peers for life may be created, to assist the House of Lords in appeal cases. The two peers are entitled to sit and vote in Parliament. Disqualification of Peers. \u2014 In moving the second reading of the House of Lords (Discontinuance of Writs) BiU, in March, 1889, the Earl of Carnarvon said : \" There were only two cases in which that House had disquaUfied by resolution. First, there was the great ChanceUor, Lord Bacon, and then the Earl of Middlesex, Lord High Treasurer. The former was tried and convicted, fined 40,000?., aud sentenced to imprison ment. The Earl of Middlesex, who was prosecuted against the strenuous wish of James I., was also tried, found guilty, fined an enormous sum, and sentenced to imprisonment. In these two cases the House of Lords took the further step of disqualifying the delinquents from further service to the State and from sitting in that House. There was a third case, that of Lord Macclesfield, who was convicted of corruption, fined, and imprisoned; but the House on deliberation nogatived the resolution to disqualify him, thinking it was beyond their power to inflict such a sentence. There was only one case in which the House had proceeded by bill. There was a Duke of Bedford, George NeviU, who in the time of Edward IV. was disabled on account of poverty ; and the inference to be drawn from that example was that it was felt that if a peer was to be disabled from his constitutional functions, it could only bo done by the instrumentality of a bill. There was yet another instance which seemed strikingly applicable to the present bill. Iu the Irish House of Lords there was a Lord Straugford, who was found guUty of abusing his privileges as a member of the House by accepting a bribe. The Irish House of Lords resolved to disable him. and they did it by a bill. There fore, taking aU these cases into consideration, and recognising the dormant powers within their lordships' jurisdiction, he invited them to consider the second reading of this bill.\" \u2014 At the suggestion of the Marquis of Salisbury, the House divided on \"the previous question,\" which was carried by 73 to 14."], [82, "62 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Resignation of a Chancellor on Parliamentary Censure. \u2014 On the 3rd of July, 1865, the House of Commons passed, by 177 to 163, a resolution to the effect that Lord Westbury, Lord ChanceUor in the Palmerston Administration, had been guilty of \" a laxity of practice and a want of caution in sanctioning the grant of retiring pensions to public officers over whose heads grave charges are impending, and in filling up the vacancies made by retirement of such officers, . . and that such laxity and want of caution are highly reprehensible, and calculated to throw discredit on the administration of the high offices of State.\" In consequence of this vote, Lord Westbury on the foUowing day tendered his resignation to the Queen, and on the evening of the 5th he announced to the House of Lords that her Majesty had accepted it. \" With regard,\" said he, \" to the opinion which the House of Commons has pronounced, I do not presume to say a word. I am bound to accept the decision. I may, however, express the hope that after an interval of time calmer thoughts will prevail, and a more favourable view be taken of my conduct.\" The Reform Act of 1867. \u2014 By this measure the number of electors in England and Wales was nearly doubled, the figures being \u2014 in 1866, 1,056,659; in 1868, 2,012,631. Mr. Martin, in his \"Statesman's Tear Book,\" put the increase in borough constituences at 137 per cent., and in the counties, 46 per cent. It was said by Mr. Lowe at Grantham in 1879, \" Lord Beaconsfield in 1867, after having opposed the lowering of the franchise, ended by outbidding by an enormous amount the Liberals themselves.\" The Lodger Franchise. \u2014 An important question on this subject came before the courts of law in 1881, and the decision first given was stated at the time to have \" created something like universal suffrage.\" The Reform Act of 1867 included as conferring the franchise \" any part of a dwelling-house occupied as a separate buUding,\" and at the same time it conferred the franchise on any lodger who paid 10?. a year rent. In 1878, Sir Charles Dilke introduced what was then considered a simple measure, to regulate and facilitate the registration of voters, both municipal and parliamentary. One clause contained a new definition of a dweUing house, as \" any part of a house where that part is separately occupied as a dwelling.\" The judgment of some of the revising barristers having been disputed, the Queen's Bench Division, in December, 1881, decided that through the change just mentioned every person who \" separately occupied \" any part of a house woidd be entitled to the franchise, not as a lodger but as a householder. This decision, by two judges, was appealed from iu the same month, and judgment was given by the Master of the Rolls, four of the Lords Justices concurring. Sir George Jessel said, that where the owner of a house did not let the whole of a house, but retained a part for his own residence, and the lodger had merely a right of ingress and egress so far as the passages, staircases, and outer doors were con cerned, and where the landlord had a right of interference, in that case he was of opinion that the landlord was the occupying tenant, and the inmate a lodger. On the other hand, where the landlord let out the whole house"], [83, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 63 in separate apartments, so as to demise the passages, reserving simply to each inmate a right of ingress and egress, in that case he parted entirely with the legal ownership, and the inmates were occupying tenants. But there were many intermediate cases, which must all depend upon the particular circumstances. Applying these principles to the cases before him, he was of opinion that in the first two cases, where the landlord resided on the premises and exercised an immediate control, the inmates were lodgers, and the decision in the Queen's Bench ought to be reversed ; but in the third case, where the landlord let out the whole house, and exercised no control whatever beyond receiving his rent, the occupiers were tenants within the meaning of the Act, and the decision of Justices Denman and Cotton ought to be affirmed. The \"Ten Minutes' Bill\" and the \"Tea-room Party.\" \u2014 Both these phrases were current in 1867, when the Derby-Disraeli Cabinet were attempting to settle the question of Reform. The first proposals of the Ministry were said by one of its members (Sir J. Pakington) to have been decided on in the last ten minutes of a Cabinet Council ; which gave rise to the first-named expression concerning a measure which was afterwards withdrawn for one more comprehensive. A few weeks later, a section comprising about 40 or 50 members of the Liberal party, who dissented from the tactics of their leader (Mr. Gladstone) with respect to the Government BiU, assembled in the tea room of the House of Commons, and decided upon recommending him to modify them. As these members kept united action daring the discussion of the measure, they were commonly spoken of as the \" Tea-room Party.\" Their influence lent important aid to the Government in the passage of the Bill, and the renewed settlement of a question which for many years had agitated the House and the country. The \" Fourth Party.\" \u2014 It was remarked by the Times, in Sep tember, 1880, in an article reviewing the Parliamentary session : \" The rise of a smaU body of Conservative ' free lances ' below the gangway, of whom Lord Randolph Churchill and Mr. Gorst are the chiefs, is a curious incident, and has originated the half serious nickname of the Fourth Party \" (the other three being the Liberal, the Conservative, and the Irish sections). The party to which the new appellation was attached consisted at the time of scarcely half a dozen members, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff aud Mr. Arthur Balfour also being among the number. In one of the last visits of Lord Beaconsfield to the House with which he had formerly been so closely associated, he was asked by a friend why he had come, and replied that he had looked in \" to see the Fourth Party.\" The Franchise and Redistribution BiUs of 1884-85.\u2014 The foUowing is a summary of the history of these important measures. Mr. Gladstone introduced the biU for the assimilation of the county and borough franchise on the 28th of February, 1884 ; and in his speech touched also upon the principles of a Redistribution BiU, \" to come, I hope, next year;\" remarking, \"In order that it may have a sort of relative finality, to which we ought always to look forward, especiaUy when organic changes are in question, it must be a large measure.\" Tho"], [84, "64 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Franchise Bill passed through the Commons, but was rejected by the Lords on the ground that it was not accompanied by provisions for the re-arrangement of electoral boundaries and the redistribation of seats. Mr. Gladstone thereupon advised the Queen to prorogue Parliament and to caU it together again in the autumn, the Houses reassembling Oct. 23. The Franchise BUI was immediately reintroduced, and read a second time Nov. 7, an amendment demanding the simultaneous production of a redistribution scheme being rejected by 372 to 232. Mr. Gladstone in the course of the debate declared that the Government \" could never consent to the union of the two branches of the question in one bill, or to the simultaneous handling of two separate bills;\" but he promised that a measure for Redistribution should foUow shortly. The Franchise Bill passed through committee at a single sitting (Nov. 10), and on the following day was read a third time and passed to the Lords, who gave it a first reading on the 13th. It was understood, however, that a second reading woidd not be taken in the existing condition of affairs, and on the 17th Earl GranviUe put forward some suggestions for a compromise. He said that if the Government received satisfactory assurances that the Franchise BiU should pass, they wovdd be prepared to make the other scheme a subject of friendly communication between the two parties, and to proceed with it at once. Thereupon ensued the conferences which will be presently referred to. As a result, on the 4th of December the Redistribution BiU was read a second time in the House of Commons, and the same night the Lords passed the Franchise BiU through committee. Its third reading took place next day, and the Royal assent was given by commission the day foUowing, when both Houses adjourned until February. The Commons then took up immediately the consideration of the Redistribution BiU, the committee stage occupying twenty days, and the measure being read a third time on the 11th of Maj-. The Lords passed it without opposition, and the Royal assent was given to it by commission, June 25. Thus terminated a controversy which during its earlier course had become exceedingly embittered, and for a time had endangered the peace of the State. By the Franchise BUI it was estimated that two miUions of voters had been added to the electorate, and it was the boast of its most eager promoters that \" a revolution \" had been thereby effected. By tho Redistribution Act the total number of members of the House of Commons was raised from 658 to 670, thus allotted\u2014 to England, 465 ; to Wales, 30 ; Scotland, 72; Ireland, 103. The disfranchisement of boroughs in England and Wales under tho scheme was considerably greater than by the measure of 1832. The Compromise of 1884.\u2014 In the debate on the Address at the opening of the autumn session, Oct, 24, 1884, Mr. Gladstone said, with reference to the Franchise BiU, and the insistance of the House of Lords that a Redistribution Bill should accompany it, with other matters arising therefrom : \" I deprecate this extension of the controversy. I do not wish it, and I will not be responsible for adding anything to it. Gentlemen who are desirous to combine redistribution with the franchise, let them tako care lest they combine something more critical than either with them"], [85, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 65 both.\" The President of the Board of Trade in Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet (Mr. Chamberlain) had also said, in a speech at Hanley a few days before : \" The prime condition must be that the Franchise Bill shaU be passed. We cannot play with the rights of two millions of people. We cannot tamper with the hopes which have been excited. It is said that the Lords will not give way. Then, I say, neither wiU the people submit \" \u2014 with much more to the same effect. That being the stage at which the controversy had arrived, scarcely a month elapsed before the public were informed, through the press, that a conference had been held at the Prime Minister's residence between himself and the Marquis of Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote ; and on the following day (Nov. 22) they were told that \" a meeting of a very unusual kind had taken place in Downing - street,\" the gentlemen present on the part of the Government being Mr. Gladstone, Lord Hartington, and Sir Charles Dilke; and, on behalf of the Opposition, the two leaders already named. With regard to this meeting, aud the conferences which ensued, Mr. Gladstone informed his supporters, at a gathering held at the Foreign Office early in the session of 1885, that \" The discussions which had taken place between himself and their opponents had not been conducted upon what were generaUy known as party lines. It was an understanding between the two that in framing a satisfactory scheme of redistribution there was a great deal in common. and what were known as party differences had been entirely absent from their negotiations ; so much so, indeed, that to anyone who might have been concealed behind the curtain, and heard every word that was going on, it would have been almost impossible, to use tho words of Shakespeare. to know which was the magistrate and which was the thief.\" Sir Stafford Northcote, at a meeting of his constituents in North Devon in May, 1885, threw further light upon the negotiations which had transpired, in the following remarks : \" Tho Government wanted to pass the extension of the franchise by itself, aud to leave any question of redistribution of seats to be dealt with at some future time. The Conservatives said, ' We are ready to pass your extension of the franchise, provided you make your measure a fair and complete one, and accompany it with a proper redistribution of seats. And if we had not done that, your con stituencies belonging to the counties would have found that, although your franchise was greatly lowered, and a much larger number were admitted into it, your power was not increased, because you would have been swamped by those brought in from tho towns, and woidd not have had the number of members which your importance justified. The result of it all was that, after a great deal of discussion in the last session, after a great deal of animosity during the recess, the Government of Mr. Gladstone gave way to our demand. They agreed that the measures should be dealt with so as to be treated as one, and they did a very remarkable thing \u2014 they invited the leaders of the Opposition, Lord Salisbury and myself, to confer with them as to the measure which should be produced for the redistribution of seats ; and I am happy to say that wo were met in a very fair and liberal spirit. The objections and difficulties we raised were fairly considered, the proposals we made were F"], [86, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 66 fairly entertained, and in the result a Reform BiU has been passed which I think ought to give general satisfaction to the people.\" The com promise which was thus brought about at this excited time is one of the most remarkable occurrences in modem English history, and suggested reflections some of which are represented in later pages of this book* Lords' Protests in recent Legislation. \u2014 It appears from Pro fessor Rogers' \" CoUection of the Protests of the Lords \" that the Reform BiU of 1832 was protested against by 77 peers, the document being drawn up by the Duke of WeUington. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 evoked a protest which was signed by 89 peers. The abrogation of the Navigation Laws in 1849 wns protested against by 44. The Irish Church BiU of 1869 caUed forth a protest from 60 peers, of whom only four belonged to the bench of bishops. The Irish Land Act of 1870 was protested against by 16. Zeal in the House of Lords. \u2014 A correspondent of the Times wrote, in November, 1883 : \" At the instance of the Earl of Wemyss and March [many years in the House of Commons as Lord Elcho] the under mentioned peers, gravely impressed by the evUs hitherto attending the hasty and inconsiderate passing of Bills \u2014 often of great importance, complicated in detaU, and novel in principle \u2014 at the end of the session, have undertaken to be in their places in Parliament on the 15th of July of future sessions, prepared, in the proper discharge of their constitutional functions, to remain in London until the loth of September, or such time as may be necessary, for the purpose of carefully and eriticaUy examining whatever measures may be submitted to the House of Lords.\" The names of twenty-six peers foUowed. Reform in the House of Lords.\u2014 In the session of 1884, a motion was brought forward in the House of Lords by the Earl of Rosebery for the appointment of a select committee to consider the best means of promoting the efficiency of the House. After an able speech by the mover and some discussion, the resolution was rejected by 77 votes against 38. Motion against the House of Lords. \u2014 In November, 1884, a motion antagonistic to the House of Lords was brought forward in the House of Commons by Mr. Labouchere, and, after a debate in which Mr. Gladstone took part, was negatived by 145 to 71 \u2014 a result which was received with cheering by the Radical party. In the next Parliament (March 5, 1886) another motion by the same member, against the here ditary principle in the Legislature, was rejected by 202 to 166. Changes in the Peerage.\u2014 As an Ulustration of the constant change which is going on in the composition of the Upper House, the foUowing statement appeared in 1875 : \" Of 217 peerages created since the 1st of January, 1830, only 133 yet remain upon the roUs. The number of peers in 1830 was 393 ; the continual additions by successive Prime Ministers have raised it to 480. Of the peerages created in the Plan tagenet reigns only 14 survive ; of the Tudor reigns, 11 ; of the Stuart * Further details respecting it wiU be found in the \" Personal \" section."], [87, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 67 reigns, 46 ; of George I. and II., 26 ; of George HI., 131 ; of George IT., 43 ; of William IV., 41 ; and of Queen Victoria, 89. When it is borne in mind that more than 400 peerages were created in the reign of George III., and that the honour can be extinguished only by death, and not by resignation, the fact that so few as 130 now remain is a remarkable one.\" Peerage in Abeyance. \u2014 A correspondent of the Times wrote in 1879 : \" The recent re-appearance of the ancient barony of Braye on the roU of peers affords a curious iUustration of the vitality of a barony by writ of summons. Although the title dates from 1529, the Hon. Alfred Thomas Townshend Wyatt-EdgeU, who has recently inherited it, is only the third Lord Braye. The title has, however, been twice held in the female line \u2014 namely, by the grandmother and mother of the present peer, the latter of whom is recently deceased. The title feU into abeyance in 1557, and so remained for a period of nearly 300 years. The title having only been enjoyed in the male line for 28 years, and in the female line for 22 years, we have the curious fact that in the 350 years which have elapsed since its creation the title has only appeared upon the roll for 50 years.\" Irish Representative Peers. \u2014 Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, makes the foUowing remarks in his \" Reminiscences, Ancestral, Anecdotal, &c,\" in reply to the question, Can an Irish representative peer resign the representation ? \" It is quite clear that an Irish representa tive peer cannot resign. His election is for life, and a vacancy in the representation is only created by ' decease or forfeiture.' The late Earl of Charlemont, after he had acquired a seat in Parliament as a peer of the United Kingdom, would have been very glad to have resigned his position as a representative peer, but he could not. Even a declared lunatic, who happened to be a representative peer, would remain such representative until he died. It has been said that Lord Palmerston never established his right to vote as an Irish representative lord, from au apprehension that the Conservative majority in the Irish peerage might, if they pleased, have elected him one of their representatives, and thus removed him, nolens volens, from the House of Commons. He never, from the time he got his title tiU his death, would have his right to vote established, and for the reason that, until he did that, he was not eligible to be elected.\" The Commons a Nursery for the Lords. \u2014 Mr. Croker, shortly before his death at an advanced age, wrote as follows to Lord Hatherton : \" I have been once to see the new House of Lords, and whUe I was there, Brougham, I think, first, and then Monteagle spied me out, and came down to the bar to shake hands with me (it was since the beginning of my Ulness), and indeed I think half the House, or more, did me the same civUity ; and this caUed my attention to a fact that I think not unimportant to constitutional history. There were, I think, about thirty peers present ; and we observed that there was not one, not a single one, with whom I had not sat in the House of Commons, including the Duke of WeUington and the Lord ChanceUor. It shows how completely the House of Commons has been the nursery of the House of Lords.\" F 2"], [88, "68 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Hereditary Representatives.\u2014 It was remarked in Notes and Queries that nearly 230 years had passed since the election of the Long Parliament, and yet many of the names reappeared in the Reformed Parliament of Queen Victoria, as representatives of towns in the same districts, and, in some cases, of precisely the same places. Thus, an Ashton (Asslieton) then, as now, represented Clithero ; a Corbett, Shrop shire ; a Knightley, Northampton; a Lloyd, Cardigan ; a Montagu, Hunt ingdonshire ; a Morgan, Brecknockshire ; a Newport, Shropshire ; a Noel, Rutlandshire; a Parker, Suffolk ; a Russell, Tavistock; and a Whit more, Bridgenorth. The same periodical gave a list of fifty members in 1869 who were, so far as could be ascertained, the direct lineal descendants of persons who sat in the Long Parliament in 1640. Long Retention of Seats in Parliament. \u2014 The foUowing facts were pointed out by a writer to the Times: The late Colonel H. C. Lowther sat in Parliament from 1812 to 1867. He must have known Colonel James Lowther, who sat from 1775 to 1818. These two must, therefore, have had between them a parliamentary experience of 92 years, uninterrupted by a break. Colonel H. C. Lowther must also have known the first Earl of Lonsdale, whose parUamentary career commenced iu 1757. The Earl must have known Sir James Lowther, of Whitehaven, to whose wealth he succeeded, and whose parliamentary experiences extended from 1692 to 1754. Thus the parliamentary experiences of three lives went almost uninterruptedly back from 1867 to 1692. The \" Father of the House of Commons.\" \u2014 This designation belonged, in 1890, to Mr. Christopher Talbot, who entered Parliament iu 1830, at the age of twenty-seven, as member for Glamorganshire, and had retained this seat uninterruptedly for sixty years. He was the only living member who had voted at the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832. Mr. Gladstone became \" father\" on his death. Changes in the Composition of the House of Commons. \u2014 A remarkable example of the gradual changes in the representation produced, during one term of Parliament, by death or removal, was afforded by the House of Commons which was elected in February, 1874. In five years from that time, no less than 128 new members \u2014 nearly one fifth of the entire body \u2014 had taken their seats in response to the Speaker's writs for new elections to fiU up vacancies. Another year elapsed before the dissolution of this ParUament, when the total uumber of such changes amounted to over 140. Proportion of New Members in Recent Parliaments. \u2014 The general election of April, 1880, resulted in the return to the House of Commons of an unusual proportion of new members. The total number was 236, of whom 201 had never before sat in Parliament. So largo an amount of change had not taken place since the period of the Reform Act of 1832. Mr. Dod gava the foUowing figures as showing the return of new members to each ParUament since the passing of that Act : In December, 1832, at the general election, 280 persons ; in January, 1835, at the general election, 184 persons ; in August, 1837, at the general election, 121 persons ; in July, 1841, at the general election, 183 persons ; in July,"], [89, "RISE AND PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 69 1847, at tho general election, 213 persons ; in July, 1852, at the general election, 201 persons ; in April, 1859, at the general election, 131 persons ; in August, 1865, at the general election, 196 persons ; in December, 1868. at the general election, 227 persons ; in February, 1874, at the general election, 221 persons; and in April, 1880, at the general election, 236 persons. Narrow Majorities at Elections. \u2014 After the general election of 1880, which completely reversed the result of that in 1874, a list was published of fifty-eight seats which had been lost to the Conservatives by numbers all consisting of less than a hundred votes. They ranged from a single vote in a county election (South Norfolk) to 97 in a borough, the aggregate majority for the Liberals in the fifty-eight cases being 2490, and the average under 43. Another computation showed that less than 5 per cent, of voters decided the result in as many as 118 cases. A similar analysis on other occasions of general election has been found to lead to like conclusions, interpreted at the time to the credit of one or other political party ; but, whatever may be the moral of the day, the repeated recurrence of such incidents is a fact of striking importance. Two General Elections in a Few Months. \u2014 In June, 1885. Mr. Gladstone's Government was defeated by a vote on Mr. Childers' Budget, and Lord Salisbury assumed office. A general election foUowed towards the end of the year, and in January, 1886, the new Parliament met. An amendment to the Address was brought forward by Mr. Jesse CoUings, regretting \" that no measures had been announced in the Queen's speech for affording facilities to agricultural labourers to obtain allotments and smaU holdings.\" The division (Jan. 26) showed: For the amendment, 329 ; against it, 250 ; majority, 79. The consequence was the resignation of Lord Salisbury's Government, and the return of Mr. Gladstone to power. His Irish Government (Home Rule) BiU was now introduced, and the division on the second reading took place on the morning of the 8th of July, 1886. It produced the largest vote on record, as, including the Speaker and the teUers, 657 members were present out of the total of 670. The numbers were \u2014 For the second reading, 311 ; against, 341 ; majority, 30. A dissolution followed immediately, although the Parliament had been elected so recently as the previous December. The constituencies of Great Britain had then returned 333 representatives to support Mr. Gladstone, although the Irish vote was against him ; but in this last division 93 Liberals voted against his measure, and 10 abstained from voting. As the result of tho elections which foUowed, it was reckoned that 186 British representatives at the outside remained to uphold Mr. Gladstone's policy. Recent Changes in Parliamentary Rules.\u2014 A writer in the Quarterly Review for October, 1890, remarked that, during the few years just previous, the rules of the House of Commons had been modified in such a way as to leave many old members, who were not regular attendants, completely in the dark as to their operation. \" The hour of meeting has been changed, and so has the hour of adjournment. The Closure has been adopted, and can be set in action on the motion of"], [90, "70 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. a private member. No opposed business can be taken after midnight, unless by special resolution of the House, to be adopted at the commence ment of public business. New regulations have been made for morning sittings. The stages of committee and report on the address to the Crown, at the opening of Parliament, have been discontinued. Notices of questions can no longer be read out in the House. The Speaker or Chairman of Committees has power to put a motion for the adjournment of the House, or for reporting progress, without debate, or he may decUne to put it at aU. Power has also been given him to order a member ' who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his own arguments, or of the arguments used by other members in debate,' to discontinue his speech, and resume his seat. The presiding officer may furthermore order a member who is guilty of disorderly conduct to leave the House, and forbid him to return during that day's sitting. When a division is frivolously or vexatiously demanded, he may refuse to aUow it to be taken in the usual way, and direct the members who call for it to stand up in their places and be counted by the clerks \u2014 a somewhat trying ordeal to go through. Standing committees have been appointed to which all biUs relating to law and justice, trade, shipping, and manufactures, agriculture and fishing, are referred. There is no longer any committee of the whole House on any bUls coming within these categories. The Speaker now leaves the chair without putting the question when the order of the day is read for going into committee, unless it be a Committee of Supply or of Ways and Means. All these immense changes have been carried out within the last four years.\""], [91, "PAET II. PERSONAL ANECDOTES. SIR THOMAS MORE. (14S0\u2014 1535.) The King Thwarted by a \"Beardless Boy.\" \u2014 More was returned to the House of Commons in 1504, and he is recorded as the first member of that assembly who gained celebrity by public speaking, and who, as a successful leader of opposition, incurred the enmity of the Court. Henry VII. was entitled (says Lord CampbeU) according to the strictest feudal law to a grant on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter Margaret with James IV. of Scotland; but he thought it a favourable opportunity for gratifying his avarice, and he required a much greater sum than he intended to bestow on tho Scottish queen. When the consent of the Lower House was demanded, Sir Thomas, making a grave speech, pronounced such urgent arguments why these exactions were not to be granted, that thereupon aU the King's demands were crossed, and his request denied ; so that Mr. Tyler, one of the King's Privy Chamber, went presently from the House and told his Majesty that a beardless boy had disappointed him of his expectations. More, however, was twenty-four years of age when he made this effective speech. Wolsey's Attempt to Overawe the Commons. \u2014 Roper has the foUowing in his \" Life of More :\" At Parliament (1523) Cardinal Wolsey found himself much aggrieved with the burgesses thereof, for that nothing was so soon done or spoken therein, but that it was immediately blown abroad in every alehouse. It fortuned at that Parliament a very great subsidy to be demanded, which the Cardinal fearing would not pass the Commons' House, he determined, for the furtherance thereof, to be there present himself. Before his coming, after long debating there, whether it was better but with a few of his lords, as the most opinion of the House was, or with his whole train royaUy to receive him, \u2014 \" Masters,\" quoth Sir Thomas More (the Speaker), \"forasmuch as my lord Cardinal lately, ye wot weU, laid to our charge the lightness of our tongues for things uttered out of this House, it shaU not in my mind be amiss to receive him with aU his pomp, with his maces, his pUlars, his poll-axes, his hat, and great seal too; to the intent that if he find the like fault with us hereafter, we may be the bolder from ourselves to lay the blame on those whom his"], [92, "72 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. grace bringeth here with him.\" Whereuuto the House whoUy agreeing, he was received accordingly. After he had, by a solemn oration, by many reasons proved how necessary it was the demand then moved to be granted, and further showed that less would not serve to maintain tho prince's purpose, he, seeing the company sitting stiU silent, and thereunto nothing answering, and, contrary to his expectation, showing in themselves to his request no towardness of inclination, said to them, \" Masters, you have many wise and learned men amongst you, and sith I am from the King's own person (Henry VIH.) sent hitherto unto you, to the preservation of vourselves and of all the realm, I think it meet you give me some reasonable answer.\" Whereat every man holding his peace, then began Wolsey to speak to one Master Marney, afterwards Lord Marney. \" How say you,\" quoth he, \" Master Marney ? \" who making him no answer neither, he severaUy asked the same question of divers others, accounted the wisest of the company ; to whom, when none of them aU would give so much as one word \u2014 being agreed before, as the custom was, to give answer by their Speaker \u2014 \"Masters,\" quoth the Cardinal, \"unless it be the manner of your House, as of likelihood it is, by the mouth of your Speaker, whom you have chosen for trusty and wise (as indeed he is), in such cases to utter your minds, here is, without doubt, a marveUously obstinate sUenee.\" And thereupon he required answer of Mr. Speaker ; who first reverently, on his knees, excused tho sUenee of the House, abashed at the presence of so noble a personage, able to amaze the wisest and best learned in a realm, and then, by many probable arguments, proved that for them to make answer was neither expedient nor agreeable with the ancient liberty of the House ; in conclusion for himself showed that though they had all with their voices trusted him, yet except every one of them could put into his own head their several wits, he alone in so weighty a matter was unmeet to make his grace answer.

Once, however, he indulged in a burst of patriotism which cost him a long and bitter remorse, and which he never ventured to repeat. The Court asked for large subsidies and for speedy payment. The remains of Bacon's speech breathe aU the spirit of the Long Parliament. ' The gentlemen,' said he, ' must seU their plate, and the farmers their brass pots, ere this wiU be paid ; and for us, we are here to search the wounds of the realm, and not to skin them over. The dangers are these. First, we shall breed discontent, and endanger her Majesty's safety, which must consist more in the love of the people than their wealth. Secondly, this being granted in this sort, other princes hereafter wiU look for the like ; so that we shall put an evil precedent on ourselves and our posterity ; and in histories, it is to be observed, of aU nations the English are not to be subject, base, or taxable.' The Queen and her ministers resented this outbreak of public spirit in the highest manner. Indeed, many an honest member of the House of Commons had, for a much smaUer matter, been sent to the Tower by the proud and hot-blooded Tudors. The young patriot endeavoured to make the most abject apologies, and never offended in the same manner again.\" Exemplary Oratory. \u2014 Ben Jonson writes of Bacon, in his \" Discoveries made upon Men and Matter \" -. \" There happened in my time one noble speaker who was full of gravity in his speaking. His language, when he could spare or pass by a jest, was nobly censorious. No man ever spoke more neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No member of his speech but consisted of his own graces. His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss. He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his devotion. No man had their affections more in his power.

This question was foUowed by a long sUenee. Several speeches are reported in the letters of the times. Sir Nathaniel Rich observed that, \" confident as he was of the royal word, what did any indefinite word ascertain ? \" Pym said, \" We have his Majesty's corona tion oath to maintain the laws of England ; what need we, then, take his word ? \" He proposed to move, \" Whether we should take the King's word or no.\" This was resisted by Secretary Cooke : \" What would they say in foreign parts, if the people of England would not trust their King?\" He desired the House to caU Pym to order; on which Pym replied, \" Truly, Mr. Speaker, I am just of the same opinion I was \u2014 viz., that the King's oath was as powerful as his word.\" Sir John EUot moved that it be put to the question, \" because they that would have it do urge us to that point.\" Sir Edward Coke on this occasion (May 6) made a memor able speech. \" We sit now in Parliament, and therefore must take his Majesty's word no otherwise than in a parliamentary way ; that is, of a matter agreed on by both Houses \u2014 his Majesty sitting on his throne in his robes, with his crown on his head and sceptre in his hand, and in fuU ParUament ; and his royal assent being entered upon record, in perpetuam rei memoriam. This was the royal word of a King in Parliament, and not a word delivered in a chamber, and out of the mouth of a secretary, at the second hand. Therefore I motion that the House of Commons, more majorum, should draw a petition de droict to his Majesty ; which, being confirmed by both Houses and assented unto by his Majesty, will be as firm an act as any. Not that I distrust the King, but that I cannot take his trust but in a parliamentary way.\" In this speech of Sir Edward Coke we find the first mention, in the legal style, of the ever-memorable \"Petition of Right,\" which two days after was finished. \u2014 Isaac D'lsraeli. \"Magna Charta will have no Sovereign.\" \u2014 The addition which the Lords proposed to be made to the Petition of Right (May 17, 1628) contained the words, \"with due regard to leave entire that sovereign power wherewith your Majesty is trusted for the protection, safety, and happiness of your people.\" On this Sir Edward Coke (according to Rushworth) spoke as foUows : \" This is magnum in parvo. This is pro pounded to be a conclusion of our petition. It is a matter of great weight, and, to speak plainly, it wiU overthrow aU our petition. It trenches to aU parts of it ; it flies at loans, and at the oath, and at imprisonment, and billeting of soldiers : this turns aU about again. Look into aU the petitions of former times, they never petitioned wherein there was a saving of the King's sovereignty. I know that prerogative is part of the law, but sovereign power is no parliamentary word.

Magna Charta is such a fellow that he wUl have no sovereign.\" SIR JOHN ELIOT. (1590\u20141632.) A Parliamentary Martyr. \u2014 Sir John EUot was foremost of the champions of popular liberty in the Parliament which met in March, 1628 (the third under Charles I.), and which drew up the Petition of Right. He had been conspicuous in the previous Parliament for his persistence and abUity in opposing the high-handed measures of the King and his favourite adviser, the Duke of Buckingham, and in 1626 was committed to the Tower for an attack upon the Duke ; but the warm resent ment of the House of Commons at this infringement of its liberties (p. 21) compeUed the King to release him, after an imprisonment of eight days. After the last sitting of the ParUament in 1629, Sir John EUot was sum moned to the Council, accused of uttering certain words in the Lower House, committed, and his papers seized. The attorney-general laid an information against him in the King's Bench, to which he pleaded, deny ing jurisdiction, but he was sentenced to be imprisoned during the King's pleasure, and, \" as the greatest offender and ringleader in Parliament,\" to pay a fine of 2000?. Being shut up in the Tower, his health graduaUy declined, and he died there on the 27th of November, 1632, permission to remove his body to the family seat in CornwaU being denied to his relatives. When Parliament next assembled after a long interval, the recoUection of what Eliot had suffered was fresh in the minds of Pym and many of his associates, and doubtless helped to render the Commons implacable against Strafford and others. A Desperate Case. \u2014 On the 3rd of June, 1628, the King having sent an answer to the Petition of Right which was not deemed satisfac tory, Sir John Eliot got up, and in a long speech entered upon the pubUc grievances, and what ho caUed the \" desperate case \" of the nation. He commenced by saying, \" We sit here as the great council of the King, and in that capacity it is our duty to take into consideration the state and affairs of the kingdom.\" He then went into a review of the mismanage ment of the national affairs both at home and abroad, and brought his speech to a conclusion with tho foUowing passage -. * \" For the next, the ignorance and corruption of our Ministers, where can you miss of instances ? If you survey the court, if you survey the country, if the church, if the city be examined, if you observe the bar, if the bench, if the courts, if the shipping, if the land, if the seas \u2014 aU these wiU render you variety of proofs, and iu such measure and proportion as shows the greatness of our sickness, that if it have not some speedy remedy our case is most desperate.

What poverty can be greater, what necessity so great? What perfect EngUsh heart is not almost dissolved into sorrow for the truth ? For the oppression of the subject, which as I remember is the next particular I proposed, it needs no demonstration, the whole kingdom is a proof ; and for the exhausting of our treasures, that oppression speaks it. What waste of our provisions, what consumption of our ships, what destruction of our men have been ! Witness that journey to Argiers \u2014 witness that with Mansfield \u2014 witness that to Cadiz \u2014 witness the next \u2014 witness that to Rhe \u2014 witness the last (I pray God we may never have more such witnesses) ! Witness likewise the Palatinate \u2014 witness Denmark \u2014 witness the Turks \u2014 witness the Dun kirkers \u2014 witness aU, what losses we have sustained, how we are impaired in munition, in ships, in men. It hath no contradiction we were never so much weakened, nor had less hope how to be restored. These, Mr. Speaker, are our dangers, these are they do threaten us, and are like that Trojan horse, brought in cunningly to surprise us. In these do lurk the strongest of our enemies ready to issue on us, and, if we do not now the more speedUy expel them, these are the sign, the invitation to others. These wUl prepare their entrance that we shaU have no means left of refuge or defence ; for if we have these enemies at home, how can we strive with those that are abroad ? If we be free from these, no other can impeach us. Our ancient English virtue, that old Spartan valour, cleared from these disorders ; being in sincerity of religion once made friends with Heaven ; having maturity of councils, sufficiency of generals, incormption of officers, opuleney in the King, Uberty in the people, repletion in treasures, restitution of provisions, reparation of ships, pre servation of men, \u2014 our ancient English virtue thus rectified, I say, wUl secure us ; and, unless there be a speedy reformation iu these, I know not what hopes or expectations we may have. These things, Sir, I shaU desire to have taken into consideration \u2014 that, as we are the great council of the kingdom, and have the apprehension of these dangers, we may truly represent them unto the King; wherein I conceive we are bound by a treble obligation, of duty unto God, of duty to Ids Majesty, and of duty to our country.\" Eliot's Last Appearance. \u2014 The last scene in this patriot's history, before the Tower gates were closed upon him, was in every way a memorable one. He was aware that the King, who had already ordered an adjournment of the Parliament, was about to dissolve it, finding it determined not to grant money without the redress of grievances. On the day fixed for the temporary reassembling of the Houses, the 2nd of March, 1629, Eliot rose in his place immediately after prayers, to propose an emphatic resolution which he had prepared against tonnage and poundage. The Speaker (Sir John Finch, a tool of the court party) -endeavoured to check him, saying it was the King's order that they were to adjourn ; but the House insisted upon its right to adjourn itself, and declared it would hear Eliot. \"These men,\" said he\u2014 alluding to"], [97, "JOHN PYM. 77 Buckingham and other evil advisers of Charles \u2014 \" these men go about to break ParUaments lest Parliaments should break them.\" And he brought his speech to a conclusion by saying, \" I protest, as I am a gentleman, if my fortune be ever again to meet in this honourable assembly, where I now leave I will begin again.\" He then offered his resolution to the Speaker, who positively refused to read it, and was about to emit the chair, when he was thrust back by Denzil HoUis and others, and HoUis read the resolution, which was carried by acclamation. Tho doors, having been previously locked, were now thrown open, and the members, hurrying forth, found a King's guard had just been sent to clear the house by force. Sir Simonds D'Ewes notes this as \" the most gloomy, sad, and dismal day for England that had happened for five hundred years.'9 JOHN PYM. (1584\u20141643.) A Pithy Speech. \u2014 On the 4th of April, 1628, the House received a message from the King asking for supplies, and concluding, \" The more confidence you shaU show in his grace and goodness, the more you shall prevail to obtain your own desires.\" Upon this occasion (says Rush worth) Mr. Pym spake thus : \" In business of weight dispatch is better than discourse. We came not hither without aU motives that can be towards his Majesty, had he never sent in this message. We know tho danger of onr enemies ; we must give expedition to expedition : let us forbear particulars. A man in a journey is hindered by asking too many questions. I do believe our peril is as great as may be ; every man com plains of it, that doth encourage the enemy ; our way is to take that that took away our estates, that is, the enemy. To give speedily is that that tho King calls for. A word spoken in season is like an apple of silver, and actions are more precious than words. Let us hasten our resolutions to supply his Majesty.\" After some debate the House unanimously resolved that five subsidies be given to the King. A Sophistical Defence. \u2014 The following anecdote of Pym is related in Lord North's \" Narrative \" : \u2014 \" The House had newly received a message from his Majesty (Charles I.), which was so far from being satisfactory as many persons spoke against it with much vehemence, and among the rest Sir Henry Ludlow, who very resolutely used these terms, ' Ho who sent this message is not fit to be King of England.' Upon saying this, he was immediately interrupted, and the words that wero spoken agreed upon preparatory to a charge ; but before his withdrawing in order to a censure, Mr. Pym arose and said, ' That those words con- tained nothing of dishonour to the King ; ' which being foimd very strange he thus cleared his meaning : ' If these words bo such as a fair conclusion is naturally deducible from them, then they cannot be evil in themselves. Now, that a fair conclusion naturally ariseth from them may be proved by syllogism. He who sent this message is not worthy to be King of England ; but King Charles is worthy to be King of England; therefore, King Charles sent not this message Now,' saith Mr. Pym, ' I leave it to judgment whether or no this syUogism comprise anything"], [98, "78 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. in it worthy of censure.' This argument was so ingenious as Sir Henry Ludlow (with his iU meaning) came freely off without punishment.\" A Reprimand delivered to the Lords.\u2014 In the \" Short ParUa ment \" of April, 1640, the House of Lords passed resolutions to the effect that supply ought to have precedence of grievances (a point which the King was strenuously insisting upon), and that the Commons should be invited to a conference on the subject. Pym represented these resolutions to the House of Commons as a gross breach of its privileges, and was deputed by the House to go up to the Lords with a protest against it. He then made to the Upper Chamber the following outspoken declaration (\"Parliamentary History\")-. \"Tour lordships have meddled with, and advised concerning, both matter of supply and the time when the same should be made, and this before such time as the same was moved to your lordships by the Commons. As a course for the repair of this breach of privilege, the Commons beg to suggest that your lordships would, in your wisdoms, find out yourselves some sort of reparation, and of prevention of the like infringement for the future. And the Commons humbly desire, through me, to represent to your lordships that, in case your lord ships have taken notice of any orders or proceedings of the Commons concerning religion, property, and privileges, and that they were to proceed to the supply \u2014 which they have some cause to conceive by these words, ' That this being done, your lordships would freely join with the Commons in those three things,' \u2014 for the avoiding all misunder standings between your lordships and the Commons for time to come, they desire your lordships hereafter to take no notice of anything which shaU be debated by the Commons until they shaU themselves declare the same unto your lordships, which the Commons shaU always observe towards your lordships' proceedings, conceiving the contrary not to consist with the privileges of the House.\" The Commons passed a vote of thanks to Pym for the good service he did them on this occasion. The firmness of the House led to its dissolution a few days afterwards, greatly to the indignation of the country. Defence of Parliamentary Privilege. \u2014 In the course of an elaborate speech in the short-lived Parliament of 1640, Pym thus defended the privUeges of the Commons : \" The privdeges of Parliament were not given for the ornament or advantage of those who are the members of Parliament. They have a real use and efficacy towards that which is the end of ParUaments. We are free from suits that we may the more entirely addict ourselves to the public services ; we have liberty of speech that our counsels may not be corrupted with fear, or our judgments per verted with self respects. Those three great faculties and functions of Parliament, the legislative, judiciary, and consUiary power, cannot be weU exercised without such privUeges as these. The wisdom of our laws, the faithfulness of our counsels, the righteousness of our judgments, can hardly be kept pure and untainted if they proceed from distracted and restrained minds. These powers of Parliament are to the body politic as the rational faculties of the soul to a man: that which keeps all the parts of the Commonwealth in frame and temper ought to be most"], [99, "JOHN PYM. 79 carefuUy preserved in that freedom, vigour, and activity which belongs to itself.\" Extorting an Apology. \u2014 Pym met the question of the supply necessary for the forces to be sent into Ireland (Nov. 5th, 1641) by reviving the question of the King's evil counsellors. \" His Majesty must be told,\" said the member for Tavistock, \" that Parliament here finds evU counsels to have been the cause of aU their troubles in Ireland, and that, unless the Sovereign wUl be pleased to free himself from such, and take only counseUors whom the kingdom can confide in, Parliament wiU hold itself absolved from giving assistance in the matter.\" On this up sprang the member for St. Ives, Mr. Edmund WaUer, cousin to Hampden and to CromweU, yet one of Hyde's most eager recruits, nor more despised for his abject, veering, vaciUating spirit than he was popular for his wit, vivacity, and genius. These he had now placed entirely at the King's disposal. \" He begged the House to observe what Mr. Pym had just said, and to remember what formerly had been said by the Earl of Strafford. Where in effect was the difference between such counsel to a king, as that he was absolved from aU laws of government, on Parlia ment refusing his unjust demands, and such advice to a Parliament as that it should hold itself absolved from assisting the State, on the King's non-compliance with demands perhaps not more just ? \" The too ingenious speaker was not permitted to say more. Pym rose imme diately and spoke to order. \" H the advice he had given were indeed of the same nature as Lord Strafford's, then he deserved the like punish ment ; and he craved, therefore, the justice of the House, either to bo submitted to its censure, or that the gentleman who spoke last be com peUed to make reparation.\" Many and loud were the cries for WaUer which followed this grave and dignified rebuke ; but a strong party sup ported him in his refusal to give other than such modified explanation as he at first tendered, and it was not untU after long debate he was ordered into the committee chamber, and had to make submission in the required terms. It was near five o'clock on that November evening when Mr. WaUer \" publicly asked pardon of the House and Mr. Pym.\" \u2014 Forster's \" Remonstrance.\" A Vindication of Law. \u2014 Pym's speech on the last day of Straf ford's impeachment (April 13, 1641) was printed by order of the House of Commons, and appears in the contemporary volume, \" Speeches and Passages of this Great and Happy Parliament,\" as well as in Rushworth's later \" CoUections.\" It has been greatly admired by men of aU parties. Although occupying (according to one who was present) only half an hour in delivery, and so far extempore that it was spoken immediately after Strafford's defence, and took up many points of his argument, yet it is stately in tone and pregnant with logical force throughout. His vindica tion of law, which he accused Strafford of endeavouring to override by tyrannical authority, was one of the most striking passages. The Earl of Strafford's offence, said he, \" is an offence comprehending all other offences ; here you shall find several treasons, murthers, rapines, oppres sions, perjuries. The earth hath a seminary virtue, whereby it doth"], [100, "80 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. produce aU herbs and plants, and other vegetables : there is in this crime a seminary of aU evils hurtful to a state ; and, if you consider the reasons of it, it must needs be so. The law is that which puts difference betwixt good and evU, betwixt just and unjust. If you take away the law, all things will faU into a confusion, every man wUl become a law to himself, which, in the depraved condition of human nature, must needs produce many great enormities. Lust wiU become a law, and envy wdl become a law ; covetousness and ambition wiU become laws ; and what dictates, what decisions such laws will produce may easily be discerned in the late government of Ireland. The law hath a power to prevent, to restrain, to repair evils; without this, aU kinds of mischiefs and distempers wiU break in upon a State. It is the law that doth entitle the King to the allegiance and service of his people ; it entitles the people to the protec tion and justice of the King. It is God alone who subsists by himself ; all other things subsist in a mutual dependence and relation. He was a wise mau that said that the King subsisted by the field that is tiUed. It is the labour of the people that supports the Crown ; if you take away the protection of the King, the vigour and cheerfulness of aUegiance wUl be taken away, though the obligation remain. The law is the boundary, the measure betwixt the King's prerogative and the people's liberty. WhUes these move in theii own orb, they are a support and security to one another ; the prerogative a cover and defence to the liberty of the people, and the people by their liberty are enabled to be a foundation to the pre rogative. But if these bounds be so removed that they enter into contes tation and conflict, one of these mischiefs must needs ensue : if the prerogative of the King overwhelm the Uberty of the people, it wiU be turned into tyranny ; if liberty undermine the prerogative, it wiU grow into anarchy. The law is the safeguard, the custody of aU private interest. Tour honours, your lives, your Uberties and estates are aU in the keeping of the law ; without this every man hath a like right to anything.\" Attempt to Communicate the Plague to Pym. \u2014 Pym was sitting (writes Forster) in his usual place on the right hand, beyond the members' gallery, near the bar, on the 25th of October, 1641, when, in the midst of debate on a proposition he had submitted for aUowance of \" powder and bullet \" to the City Guard, a letter was brought to him. The sergeant of the House had received it from a messenger at the door, to whom a gentleman on horseback in a grey coat had given it that morning, on Fish Street HiU \u2014 with a gift of a shiUing, and injunction to deliver it with great care and speed. As Pym opened the letter, some thing dropped out of it on the floor ; but without giving heed to this he read to himself a few words, and then, holding up the paper, caUed it a scandalous Ubel. Hereupon it was carried up to the lately-appointed clerk's assistant, Mr. John Rushworth, who, in his unmoved way, read aloud its abuse of the great leader of the House, and its asseveration that if he should escape the present attempt, the writer had a dagger prepared for him. At this point, however, young Mr. Rushworth would seem to have lost his coolness, for he read the next few lines in an agitated way. They explained what had dropped from the letter. It was a rag that had"], [101, "JOHN HAMPDEN. 81 come from a plague wound, sent in the hope that infection might by such means be borne to him who opened it. Whereupon Rushworth, having read so far, threw clown the letter into the house, and so it was spurned away out of the door. JOHN HAMPDEN. (1594\u20141643.) His Dexterity and Influence. \u2014 Hampden (writes Clarendon) \" was not a man of many words, and rarely began the discourse, or made tho first entrance upon any business that was assumed ; but a very weighty speaker, and after he had heard a full debate, and observed how the House was like to be inclined, took up the argument, and shortly, and clearly, and craftily so stated it, that he commonly conducted it to the conclusion he desired ; and if he found he could not do that, he was never without the dexterity to divert the debate to another time, and to prevent the determining anything in the negative which might prove inconvenient in the future. . . When this (the Long) Parliament began, the eyes of aU men were fixed upon him as their patri\u0153 pater, and the pUot that must steer the vessel through the tempests and rocks which threatened it. And I am persuaded his power and interest at that time were greater to do good or hurt than any man's in the kingdom, or than any man of his rank hath had in any time.\" Allaying a Storm. \u2014 It was Hampden who moved (November 22, 1641) that the Great Remonstrance, which had just been passed by a majority of eleven only, should be printed ; it being intended by its pro moters to serve, among other purposes, as a declaration from tho House of Commons to the people. The proposal roused the opposite party to the utmost, and Hyde and other of its members endeavoured to enter a formal protest against the printing. \" We had catched at each other's locks,\" wrote Sir PhUip Warwick, \" and sheathed our swords in each other's bowels, had not the sagacity and great calmness of Mr. Hampden, by a short speech, prevented it, and led us to defer our angry debate untU the next morning.\" Marks of a Bad Subject. \u2014 The only recorded speech of Hamp den's is one purporting to have been deUvered in the House on the morning after tho King had sent to impeach the five members, and shortly before he himself appeared to arrest them. It was issued as a small pamphlet at the time, but has had doubt thrown upon its authenti city, some portions appearing too deferential to the Crown to be consistent with Hampden's general course. It must be remarked, how ever, that until the final rupture between Charles and the Parliament, expressions of loyalty, even when accompanied by protest against par ticular measures, were constant, and often profuse, in the speeches delivered in the House. Hampden's speech consists, in the main, of a comparison between the marks of a good subject and a bad one, closing with a vindication of the speaker's own actions as judged by the tests proposed. The foUowing passage is a specimen of the rest : \" I come now to the second means to know the difference between a good subject a"], [102, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 82 and a bad,\u2014 by their obedience to the laws, statutes, and ordinances made by the King, with the whole consent of his Parliament. And in this I observe a twofold subjection : in the particular members thereof dissenting from the general votes of the whole Parliament ; and, secondly, the whole state of the kingdom to a fuU ParUament, First, I confess, if any particular member of a Parliament, although his judgment and vote be contrary, do not willingly submit to the rest, he is an iU subject to the king and country. Secondly, to resist the ordinances of the whole state of the kingdom, either by stirring up a dislike in the hearts of his Majesty's subjects of the proceediugs of Parliament ; to endeavour, by levying of arms, to compel the King and Parliament to make such laws as seem best to them ; to deny the power, authority, and privUeges of Parliament ; to cast aspersions upon the same and its proceedings, thereby inducing the King to think ill of the same, and to be incensed against the same ; to procure the untimely dissolution and breaking off of the Parlia ment before aU things be settled by the same, for the safety and tran quiUity both of the King and State \u2014 is an apparent sign of a traitorous and disloyal subject against his king and country.\" THE EARL OF STRAFFORD. (1593\u20141641.) A Gift for a King. \u2014 Strafford in the earlier part of his career (while Sir Thomas Wentworth) was identified with the patriotic party, and, like others, was imprisoned for resisting the infliction of enforced loans without the authority of Parliament. His speeches during the session of 1628 made him among the most noticeable of the patriots, and he was especially prominent in advocacy of the principle that \" grievances and supply should go hand in hand together ; \" but the Court had reason to suspect that he was quite capable of being bought over. Towards the close of the session he thus addressed the House : \" Our persons have been injured both by imprisonment without law \u2014 nay, against law, bound less and without bank \u2014 and by being designed to some office, charge, and employment, foreign or domestic, as a brand of infamy and mark of disgrace. Oh ! Mr. Speaker, when it may not be safe to deny payments upon unjust exactions, but we must go to prison for it ; nor in this place to speak our consciences, but we must be stamped to unwilling and unfitting employ ments ! Our estates have been racked two ways ; one in the loan, wherein five subsidies were exacted, and that by commission of men of quality, and instructions to prosecute the same with an asperity which no times cau paraUel. And hence the other consideration, of the projectors and executioners of it. Nay, this w-as not all, but ministers in their pulpits have preached it as gospel, and damned the refusers of it \u2014 so, then, we are already doomed to damnation ! \" He went on to urge a committee on grievances, and said, \" Let no man judge this way a break-neck of Par liaments, but a way of honour to the King, nay, of profit ; for, besides the eupply which we shall readily give him, suitable to his occasions, we give him our hearts. Our hearts, Mr. Speaker!\u2014 a gift that God calls for, and fit for a King.\""], [103, "83 THE EARL OF STRAFFORD. A Promise Fulfilled. \u2014 A few weeks after the prorogation of 1628, Wentworth was made a peer ; and it is said that on the eve of his eleva tion an accidental meeting took place between himself and Pym, when the latter remarked, \" Tou are going to leave us, but I wiU never leave you whde your head is upon your shoulders.\" They did not meet again until the great occasion in Westminster HaU, when Pym set forth the Earl's impeachment on behalf of the Commons of England. At one critical point, in Pym's final address, where he was replying to Strafford's defence, \" If the law hath not been put in execution, as he aUegeth, these two hun dred and forty years, it was not for want of a law, but that aU that time hath not bred a man bold enough to commit such crimes as these,\" the speaker turned and met the haggard look of his old comrade, who had been intently regarding him ; and for the moment Pym is said to have been deprived of his self-possession. \" His papers he looked on,\" says one present, \" but they could not help him to a point or two, so he behooved to pass them.\" Strafford had anticipated in his defence the feeling he must have experienced at the moment, saying, \" That I am charged with treason by the honourable Commons is my greatest grief. It pierces my heart, though not with guilt, yet with sorrow, that in my grey hairs I should be so misunderstood by the companions of my youth, with whom I have formerly spent so much time.\" Strafford's Defence. \u2014 The most conclusive proof of Strafford's personal ability that has come down to us is perhaps to be seen in his defence delivered against the impeachment. There is every reason to believe in the accuracy of the report here coUated, which may be found in Whiteloeke, &c., and his last address, upou the scaffold, was printed in extenso from the shorthand notes of Rushforth. Throughout the impeachment, Strafford's demeanour, like his language, was becoming to the gravity of the occasion. He combated carefuUy the charge of \" constructive treason,\" arguing, \" When one thousand misdemeanors wiU not make one felony, shall twenty-eight misdemeanors heighten it to a treason ? \" and he brought his defence to a close as foUows : \u2014 \" My lords, it is hard to be questioned upon a law which cannot be shown. Where hath this fire lain hid so many hundreds of years, without smoke to discover it, till it thus burst forth to consume me and my children ? That punishment should precede promulgation of a law, \u2014 to be punished by a law subsequent to the fact, \u2014 is extreme hard j what man can be safe if this be admitted ? My lords, it is hard in another respect, that there should be no token set by which we should know this offence, no admoni- tion by which we should avoid it. If a man pass the Thames in a boat, and split himself upon an anchor, and no buoy be floating to discover it, he who owneth the anchor shaU make satisfaction ; but if a buoy be set there, every man passeth upon his own peril. Now, where is the mark, where the token, upou this crime, to declare it to be high treason ? My lords, be pleased to give that regard to the peerage of England as never to expose yourselves to such moot points, such constructive interpretations of laws : if there must be a trial of wits, let the subject matter be of somewhat else than the lives and honours of peers. It wUl be wisdom for G 2"], [104, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 84 yourselves, for your posterity, and for the whole kingdom, to cast into the fire these bloody and mysterious volumes of constructive and arbitrary treason, as the primitive Christians did their books of curious arts, and betake yourselves to the plain letter of the law and statute, that telleth us what is and what is not treason, without being more ambitious to be more learned in the art of kiUing than our forefathers. It is now fuU two hundred and forty years since any man was touched for this alleged crime, to this height, before myself. Let us not awaken these sleeping lions to our destruction, by raking up a few musty records that have lain by the waUs so many ages forgotten or neglected. May your lordships please not to add this to my other misfortunes \u2014 let not a precedent be derived from me so disadvantageous as this will be in its consequences to the whole kingdom. Do not, through me, wound the interest of the commonwealth ; and howsoever these gentlemen say they speak for the commonwealth, yet in this particular I, indeed, speak for it, and show the inconveniences and mischiefs that wiU fall upon it. For, as it is said in the statute 1 Henry IV., no man wUl know what to do or say for fear of such penalties. Do not put, my lords, such difficulties upon ministers of state, that men of wisdom, of honour, and of fortune may not with cheer fulness and safety be employed for the public. If you weigh and measure them by grains and scruples, the pubUc affairs of the kingdom wUl lie waste ; no man wiU meddle with them who hath anything to lose. My lords, I have troubled you longer than I should have done, were it not for the interest of those dear pledges a saint in heaven hath left me. (Strafford was here overcome for a few moments, but resumed:) What I forfeit myself is nothing ; but that my indiscretion should extend to my posterity, wouudeth me to the very soul. Tou wiU pardon my infirmity : something I should have added, but am not able ; therefore let it pass.\" He concluded with a few words expressing his confidence in the support of the Almighty, and submitting himself to the judgment of the tribunal before which he had pleaded. The poet's aUusion to Strafford, in \" St. Stephen's,\" may be recaUed to the memory here : \u2014 \" Still, of that voice which awed its age, one tone Comes, sad as flutes funereal, to our own ; When, at the last, the grand offender pleads, Tears drown our justice and efface his deeds ; And when poor Stuart, with his feeble ' Nay,' Signs the great life which shields his own away, Freedom, that needs the victim, rights his shade, And turns her axe towards him who has betray'd.\" LORD FALKLAND. (1610\u20141643.) A Forcible First Speech.\u2014 In the collection of \"Speeches and Passages of this Great and Happy Parliament\" (1641) Lord Falk land's first speech is recorded. It is characterised by the quaintness as well as the pithiness which marked most of the public oratory of the"], [105, "85 LORD FALKLAND. time. \"I rejoice,\" it commences, \"very much to see this day; and the want hath not lain in my affections, but my lungs, if to aU that hath been past I have not been as loud with my voice as any man's in this house.\" The speaker then aUudes to the recent impeachment of Strafford, and the necessity of taking proceedings also against certain of the judges, adding, \" I hope it will be believed that only public interest could have extorted this from me, and that which I would not say if I conceived it not so true and so necessary, that no undigested meat can lie heavier upon the stomach than this unsaid would have lain upon my conscience.\" After remarking that the persons who should have been as dogs to defend the sheep had been as wolves to worry them, he proceeds to specificaUy charge the judges with sundry crimes, among them the foUowing : \" When they had aUowed to the King the sole power in necessity, the sole judgment of necessity, and by that enabled him to take both from us what he would, when he would, and how he would, they yet continued to persuade us that they had left us our liberties and properties. The last is, which I confess moved most, that by the transformation of us from the state of free subjects \u2014 (a good phrase, Mr. Speaker) \u2014 unto that of viUains, they disable us by legal and voluntary supplies to express our affections to his Majesty, and by that to cherish his to us \u2014 that is, by Parliaments. . . We only accuse, and the House of Lords condemn ; in which condemna tion they usuaUy receive advice (though not direction) from the judges. And I leave it to every man to imagine how prejudicial to us \u2014 that is, to the Commonwealth \u2014 and how partial to their feUow malefactors, the advice of such judges is like to be.\" The speaker concludes by plain references to the Lord Keeper (Finch) as the worst of these \" male factors,\" and by moving for a select committee to investigate the matter, closing with the suggestion, \" if he (Finch) shall be found to have gone before the rest to this judgment, and to have gone beyond the rest in this judgment, in the punishment for it the justice of this House may not deny him the clue honour both to precede and exceed the rest.\" A Marked Protest. \u2014 There was once in the House of Commons such a declared acceptation of the good service an eminent member had dono to them, that it was moved that the Speaker might, in the name of the whole House, give him thanks ; and then that every member might, as a testimony of his particular acknowledgment, stir or move his hat to him ; the which when very many did, the Lord Falkland (who believed the service itself not to bo of that moment), instead of moving his hat, stretched both his arms out, and clasped his hands together upon the crown of his hat, and held it close down to his head. \u2014 Clarendon's History. His Saying about Bishops. \u2014 When Sir Edward Dering's biU \" for the extirpation of episcopacy \" was under discussion in committee, in 1641, as the proceedings were protracted from day to day, the House began to lose interest in the matter, and the attendance of members con sequently feU off ; \" they only who prosecuted the biU with impatience remaining in the house,\" says Clarendon, \"and the others who abhorred it, growing weary of so tiresome an attendance, left the house at dinner"], [106, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 86 time, and afterwards foUowed their pleasures ; so that the Lord Falkland was wont to say that ' they who hated bishops hated them worse than the devU, and that they who loved them did not love them so weU as their dinner.' \" Idle Bishops. \u2014 In his own speech on episcopacy, Falkland, whde careful to discriminate between \" some bishops and their adherents \" and others of the order, denounces the idle ones in a very homely illustration. \" Master Speaker, we shaU find them to have been like the hen in \u00c6sop, which laying every day an egg upon such a proportion of barley, her mistress increasing the proportion in hope she would increase her eggs, she grew so fat upon that addition that she never laid more ; so, though at first their preaching were the occasion of their preferment, they after made their preferment the occasion of their not preaching. Master Speaker,\" he continues, \" we shaU find them to have resembled another fable, the dog in the manger ; to have neither preached themselves, nor employed those that should, nor suffered those that would.\" This speech (given in \" Speeches and Passages,\" &c, 1641) abounds in weU chosen simile and iUustration, of which tho l^Uowing is another sample : \" We shaU make no little apology for thos.., yd whom these charges belong if we shaU lay the faults of the men upon the order of the bishops, upon the episcopacy. I wish we may distinguish between those who have been carried away with the stream, and those who have been the stream that carried them; between those whose proper and natural motion was towards our ruin and destruction, and those who have been whirled about to- it, contrary to their natural motion, by the force and swing of superior orbs ; and as I wish we may distinguish between the more and less guUty, so I yet more wish we may distinguish between the guilty and the innocent.\" HARRY MARTEN. (1602\u20141681.) An Avowed Republican. \u2014 Marten, a man of fortune and credit in his country, as Clarendon relates, was returned for Berkshire to the Parliaments of April and November, 1640. He was a Republican in opinion, and startled Clarendon on one occasion (whUe the latter was still Mr. Hyde, and they were on famiUar terms) by saying, \" I do not think one man wise enough to govern us aU.\" This, says Clarendon, was \" the first word he had ever heard any man speak to that purpose, and would without doubt, if it had been then communicated or attempted, been the most abhorred by the whole nation of any design that could be mentioned.\" In 1643 Marten was expelled the House and committed to the Tower for saying, \" It were better that one family should be destroyed than many,\" and declaring, in answer to a demand for explanation, that ho meant \" the King and his children.\" He was discharged from imprisonment after a short detention, and a resolution for his rcadmission to the House was passed in 1645\u2014\" which gave occasion to some to believe that the House began to be more averse from the King.\" He was one of the original councU of state of the Commonwealth. His name, among others, was specially excepted from the act of indemnity passed on the Restoration-"], [107, "HARRY MARTEN. 87 He was indicted for treason in compassing and imagining the death of Charles I., and condemned to death, but petitioned Parliament for. a reprieve, and his friends procured the commutation of his doom to imprisonment for life. He was consequently confined for twenty years in Chepstow Castle, dying there at the age of seventy-eight. Insight. \u2014 Marten was renowned for his wit as weU as his outspoken frankness. While he had been friendly with CromweU, aud on one occa sion moved the thanks of the House to the general for his eminent services, he yet opposed his growing power, saying in the House, \" If they were to be governed by a single person, their last king would have been as proper a gentleman for it as any in England, for he found no fault with his person, but his office only.\" When Monk was professing to serve the Commonwealth, but intriguing for the Restoration, Marten suspected his designs, and said of him, \" He is like a person sent to make a suit of clothes, who brings with him a budget fuU of carpenter's tools, and being told that such things are not at aU fit for the work he has been desired to do, answers, ' Oh, it matters not ! I will do your work weU enough, I warrant you.' \" Drowsy Members. \u2014 -Alderman Atkins (writes Aubrey), a member of the Long Parliament, made a motion that such scandalous members as slept, aud minded not the business of the House, should bo put out. Harry Marten, who was wont to sleep much in the house (at least dog sleep), starts up : \" Mr. Speaker, a motion has been made to turn out the nodders ; I desire the noddees may also be turned out.\" The Fools and the Profane. \u2014 A godly member of the Long Parliament made a motion to have all profane and unsauctified persons expelled the house. Harry Marten stood up and moved that all fools should be put out likewise, and then there would be a thin house. A Roland for an Oliver. \u2014 Oliver Cromwell once in the house caUed Harry Marten, either jestingly or scoffingly, \" Sir Harry Marten.\" \" I thank your Majesty,\" said Marten, rising and bowing, \" I always thought when you were king I should be knighted.\" A Scriptural Illustration. \u2014 Mr. Isaac DTsraeli relates the following : \" In drawing up the remonstrances of the army, which changed the monarchy into a commonwealth, this Sheridan of his day had said, ' restored to its ancient government of Commonwealth.' A member rose to reprimand and to wonder at the impudence of Harry Marten, asserting the antiquity of Commonwealth, of which he had never heard before. The wit rejoined by a whimsical iUustration of the pro priety of the term, and the peculiar condition of the man who had now heard it for the first time. ' There was,' said Harry, ' a text which had often troubled his spirit concerning the man who was blind from his mother's womb, but at length whose sight was restored to the sight which he should have had.'\" Spoiling a Martyr. \u2014 A curious pamphlet, republished in Lord Somers' Tracts, relates the condemnation to death of David Jenkins, a Welsh judge, and Sir Francis Butler, by a vote of the House of Commons. Jenkins, who was a stout RoyaUst, was brought before the Ctmmons to"], [108, "88 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. answer a charge of having, in 1642, condemned to death persons who had taken up arms against the King in the Welsh country. When desired to kneel at the bar of the House, the old judge peremptorily refused, saying, \" Since you, Mr. Speaker, and this House have renounced aU your duty and aUegiance to your sovereign and natural liege lord, the King, and are become a den of thieves, should I bow myself in this house of Rimmon, the Lord would not pardon me in this thing.\" Intense excitement and confusion broke out amongst the members upon this plain speaking, and both prisoners were condemned to suffer death for high treason. Then uprose Harry Marten, and said, \" Mr. Speaker, everyone must believe that this old gentleman here is fuUy possessed in his head that he is pro aris et focis mori, that he shaU die a martyr for this cause, for otherwise he never would have provoked the House by such biting expressions ; whereby it is apparent that if you execute him, you do what he hopes for and desires, and whose execution might have a great influence upon the people, since not condemned by a jury. Wherefore my motion is that this House would suspend the tlay'of execution, and in the meantime force him to live in spight of his teeth.\" This motion restored the House to good humour; they agreed to it, and sent both prisoners off to Newgate. Marten had rightly divined the mind of the old judge. Mr. Jenkins in the retirement of his prison occupied himself in devising the details of the manner in which he should go to the scaffold. \" He would eat much liquorice and gingerbread, thereby to strengthen his lungs, that he might extend his voice far and near ; he would come with Bracton's book hung upon his left shoulder, with the statutes at large hung upon his right shoulder, and the Bible with a riband put round his neck and hanging on his breast. So that when they should see him die, thousands would inquire into these matters, and having found aU he should tell them to be true, they would come to loath and detest the present tyranny.\" The elaborate programme of the old judge was, however, rendered nugatory, for his day of execution never arrived. OLIVER CROMWELL. (1599\u20141658.) His First Speech. \u2014 Cromwell was returned for Huntingdon to the ParUament which met in March, 1628. The first record of his addressing the House occurs in February of the following year. The House was receiving a report of committee concerning pardons granted by the Kino to certain persons censured by Parliament, when Cromwell, who had been of the committee, stood up and said, \" He had heard by relation from one Dr. Beard (his old schoolmaster at Huntingdon) that Dr. Alablaster had preached flat Popery at Paul's Cross, and that the Bishop of Winchester had commanded him as his diocesan he should preach nothin\u00b0- to the contrary. Mainwaring, so justly censured in this House for his sermons, was by tho same bishop's means preferred to a rich living. If these are the steps to church preferment, what are we to expect?\" The House ordered, \" That Dr. Beard of Huntingdon be written to by Mr. Speaker to"], [109, "OLIVER CROMWELL. 89 come up and testify against the bishop ; the order for Dr. Beard to be \u2022delivered to Mr. CromweU.\" His Personal Appearance. \u2014 The first time (writes Sir Philip Warwick) \" that ever I took notice of him was in the very beginning of the Parliament held in November, 1640, when I vainly thought myself a courtly young gentleman, for we courtiers valued ourselves much upon our good clothes. I came one morning into the House well clad, and per ceived a gentleman speaking, whom I knew not, very ordinarily apparelled, for it was a plain cloth suit, which seemed to have been made by an ill country tailor. His linen was plain, and not very clean ; and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his little band, which was not much larger than his coUar. His hat was without a hat-band ; his stature was of a good size ; his sword stuck close to his side, his countenance swoUen and reddish, his voice sharp aud untunable, and his eloquence fuU of fervour. For the subject-matter would not bear much of reason, it being on behalf of a servant of Mr. Prynne's who had dispersed libels against the Queen for dancing, and suchlike innocent and courtly sports ; aud he aggravated the imprisonment of this man by the CouncU-table unto that height that one would have believed the very Government itself had been in great danger by it.\" A Prophecy. \u2014 One day, when Cromwell had spokeu warmly in the House, Lord Digby asked Hampden who he was ; and Hampden is said to have replied, \" That sloven whom you see before you, hath no ornament iu his speech ; that sloven, I say, if we should ever come to a breach with the King (which God forbid!) \u2014 in such a case, I say, that sloven wiU be the greatest man in England.\" Cromwell Reprehended. \u2014 Lord Clarendon was often heard to mention one private committoe in which he (when Mr. Hyde) was put accidentally into the chair, upon au enclosure which had been made of great wastes, belonging to the Queen's manors, without the consent of the tenants; against which as well the inhabitants of other manors, who claimed common in those wastes, as the Queen's tenants of the same, made loud complaints, as a great oppression, carried upon them with a very high hand, and supported by power. The committee sat in the Queen's Court, and Oliver Cromwell, being one of them, appeared much concerned to countenance the petitioners, who were numerous together with their witnesses. CromweU ordered the witnesses aud petitioners in the method of the proceedings, and seconded and enlarged upou what they said with great passion ; and the witnesses and persons concerned, who were a very rude kind of people, interrupted the counsel and witnesses on the other side with great clamour when they said anything that did not please them, so that Mr. Hyde was compelled to use some sharp repro.ofs and some threats to reduce them to such a temper that the business might be quietly heard. Cromwell, in great fury, reproached the chairman for being partial, and that he discountenanced the witnesses by threatening them ; the other appealed to the committee, which justified him, and declared that ho behaved himself as he ought to do j which more inflamed him, who was already too much angry. In the end, his whole carriago"], [110, "90 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. was so tempestuous, and his behaviour so insolent, that the chairman found himself obliged to reprehend him, aud to teU him that if he proceeded in the same manner, he would presently adjourn the committee and the next morning complain to the House of him. Cromwell's Official Speeches.\u2014 My Lord General (says Carlyle) always spoke extempore ; ready to speak, if his mind were full of meaning ; very careless about the words he put it into. And never, except in one instance, does he seem to have taken any charge as to what report might be published of it. One of his Parliaments asking him for a correct report of a certain speech, spoken some days before, he declared \" he could not remember four lines of it.\" His Dissolution of the Long Parliament. \u2014 Mr. Carlyle, from several sources, gives a picturesque narrative more suo, which (with the liberty of sUght abbreviation) will best represent this scene : \u2014 \" April 20, 1653 : Toung Colonel Sidney, the celebrated Algernon, sat in the House this morning ; a House of some fifty-three. Algernon has left distinct note of the affair ; less distinct we have from Bulstrode, who was also there. SoUd Ludlow was far off in Ireland, but gathered many details in after years ; and faithfully wrote them down, in the unappeasable indig nation of his heart. Combining these three originals, we have obtained the foUowing : ' The Parliament sitting as usual, and being in debate upon the biU (for Parliamentary Reform), with the amendments, which it was thought would have been passed that day, the Lord General CromweU came into the house, clad in plain black clothes and grey worsted stock ings, and sat down, as he used to do, in an ordinary place.' For some time he listens to this interesting debate on the biU ; beckoning once to Har rison, who came over to him, and answered dubitatingly. Whereupon the Lord General sat still for about a quarter of an hour longer. But now the question being to be put, That this biU do now pass, he beckons again to Harrison, says ' This is the time I must do it ' \u2014 and so ' rose up, put off his hat, and spake. At the first, and for a good while, he spake to the commendation of the Parliament for their pains and care of the public good ; but afterwards he changed his style, told them of their injustice, delays of justice, self-interest, and other faults ' \u2014 rising higher and higher, into a very aggravated style indeed. An honourable member, Sir Peter Wentworth by name, rises to order, as we phrase it ; says, ' It is strange language this ; unusual within the waUs of Parliament this ! And from a trusted servant too ; and one whom we have so highly honoured ; and one .' ' Come, come ! ' exclaims my Lord General, in a very high key. ' We have had enough of this,' \u2014 and in fact my Lord General, now blazing all up into clear conflagration, exclaims, ' I wiU put an end to your prating,' and steps forth into the floor of the House, and ' clapping on his hat,' and occasionaUy ' stamping the floor with his feet,' begins a discourse which no man can report. He is heard sayinc, ' It is not fit that you should sit here any longer ! Tou have sat too long here for any good you have been doing lately. Tou shaU now give place to better men. Call them in ! ' adds he briefly, to Harrison, in word of command ; and ' some twenty or thirty ' grim musketeers enter, with"], [111, "SIR HENRY VANE. 91 bullets in their snap-hances ; grimly prompt for orders. . . ' You call yourselves a Parliament,' continues my Lord General, in clear blaze of conflagration : ' Tou are no Parliament ; I say, you are no Parliament ! Some of you are drunkards,' and his eye flashes on poor Mr. Chaloner, an official man of some value, addicted to the bottle ; ' some of you are, \u2014 ' and he glares into Harry Marten, and the poor Sir Peter, who rose to order, lewd livers both \u2014 ' living in open contempt of God's commandments.' ' Corrupt, unjust persons ; scandalous to the profession of the Gospel : how can you be a Parliament for God's people ? Depart, I say ; and let us have done with you. In the name of God \u2014 go ! ' The House is of course all on its feet \u2014 uncertain almost whether not on its head : such a scene as was never seen before in any House of Commons. History reports with a shudder that my Lord General, lifting the sacred mace itself, said, ' What shall we do with this bauble ? Take it away ! ' \u2014 and gave it to a musketeer. And now, ' Fetch him down ! ' says he to Harrison, flashing on the Speaker. Speaker Lenthal, more an ancient Roman than anything else,* declares he will not come till forced. ' Sir,' said Harrison, ' I will lend you a hand ; ' on which Speaker Lenthal came down, and gloomily vanished. They all vanished, flooding gloomily, clamorously out, to their ulterior business and respective places of abode : the Long Parliament is dissolved ! ' It's you that have forced me to this,' exclaims my Lord General : ' I have sought the Lord night and day that He would rather slay mo than put me upon tho doing of this work.\"' SIR HENRY VANE (1612\u20141662.) Respected and Feared. \u2014 Sir Henry Vane, commonly caUed Vane the Tounger, was son to one of the same name who was Secretary of State and Treasurer of the Household to Charles I. He appears to have adopted republican principles in early life, and when little more than twenty years of age he left his native land for America, to join a people whoso sentiments in politics and in religion more nearly approached his own, than did those of the circle in which he had been educated. He was elected Governor of Massachusetts before he had reached his twenty-fourth year, but ho returned to England in 1637, aud was sent to Parliament for Kingston-upon-HuU in April, 1640. Charles, courting his abilities, knighted him, and made him joint treasurer of the navy ; but he joined the party of Pym and Hampden in the Long Parliament, aud thence forward was one of the leading spirits of that side. On the restoration of Charles II. ho was indicted for \" helping to exclude the King from tho exercise of his royal authority,\" and sent to the scaffold. MUton's lines \u2014 \" Vane, young in years, but in sage council old, Than whom a better senator ne'er held The helm of Eome \" \u2014 expressed tho general opinion as to Vane's abilities, and Charles himself * Seo page 32, \" Attempt to Arrest the Five Members.\""], [112, "92 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. wrote to his ChanceUor (Clarendon), \" he is too dangerous a man to let live, if wo can honestly put him out of the way.\"* On the Bill against Episcopacy. \u2014 Sir Henry Vane's speech in committee on the Bill against Episcopal Government, June 11, 1641, is printed in the \" Speeches and Passages \" of that year, previously emoted, and is remarkable for the logical closeness of its argument. The foUow- ing were the opening passages : \" Master Hyde, \u2014 The debate we are now upon is whether the government by archbishops, bishops, chanceUors, &c, should be taken away out of the church and kingdom of England. For the right stating whereof we must remember the vote which passed yesterday, not only by the committee, but the House, which was to this effect -. That this government hath been found by long experience to be a great impediment to the perfect reformation and growth of religion, and very prejudical to the civil state. So that then the question will lie thus before us, Whether a government which long experience hath set so ill a character upon, importing danger not only to our religion but the civd state, should be any longer continued amongst us, or be utterly aboUshed ? For my own part, I am of the opinion of those who conceive that the strength of reason already set down in the preamble to this bid by yester- day's vote is a necessary decision of this question. For one of the main ends for which church government is set up is to advance and further the perfect reformation and growth of religion, which we have already voted this government doth contradict ; so that it is destructive to the very end for which it should be, and (which) is most necessary and desirable ; in which respect certainly we have cause enough to lay it aside, not only as useless iu that it attains not its end, but as dangerous in that it destroys and contradicts it. In the second place, we have voted it prejudicial to the civil state, as having so powerful and Ul an influence upon our laws, the prerogative of the King, and Uberties of the subject, that it is like a spreading leprosy, which leaves nothing untainted and unaffected which it comes near. May we not therefore well say of this government, as our Saviour in the fifth of Matthew speaks of salt \u2014 (give me leave upon this occasion to make use of Scripture, as weU as others have done in this debate) \u2014 where it is said that salt is good, ' but if the salt hath lost its savour, wherewith wiU you season it ? It is thence- forth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.' So church government, in the general, is good, and that which is necessary, and which we all desire ; but when any particular form of it hath once lost its savour, by being destructive to its own ends for which it is set up (as by our vote already passed we say this hath), then surely, Sir, we have no more to do but to cast it out, and endeavour, the best we can, to provide ourselves a better.

The newly-elected member was in a pecuniary condition which compelled him to accept the wages at that time paid by constituents to their representatives. He was almost the last representative who received wages for the performance of parliamentary duties.* Charles II. , says Cooke (\" History of Party\"), desirous to secure the powerful support of MarveU, sent Lord Danby, his Lord Treasurer, with offers of place and of money. The royal messenger found the object of his search occupying obscure apartments in a court near the Strand ; but aU his blandishments failed to produce any effect on the independent soul of MarveU. The Treasurer at parting \u2014 says a pamphlet which professes to give a minute record of the circumstances \u2014 slipped into MarveU's hand an order upon the Treasury for a thousand pounds, and was moving towards his carriage, when Marvell stopped him, and taking him again up-stairs, called his servant boy, when the following coUoquy ensued : \" Jack, chUd, what had I for dinner yesterday?\" \u2014 \" Don't you remember, sir, you had the little shoulder of mutton, that you ordered mo to bring from the woman in the market ? \" \u2014 Very right, child ; what have I for dinner to-day ? \" \u2014 \" Don't you know, sir, that you bid me lay by the blade-bone to brod ? \" \u2014 \" 'Tis so, very right, child ; go away.

A Happy Survival. \u2014 Algernon Sidney, second son of Robert, Earl of Leicester, entered the army with a commission in his father's regiment, but joined the Parliamentary party in 1644. He was the author of a treatise entitled \" A General View of Government in Europe,\" in which the writer remarks : \" Tho Parliament of France seems quite antiquated and subdued ; tho ghost and shadow of the defunct has appeared three or four times since Lewis the Xlth ; * but to revive that assembly in its full and perfect vigour requires a miracle like the Resurrection. So that, in effect, we may date the demise of the ParUamentary sovereignty in France from Lewis the Xlth, and the decay of that in Germany from Charles the Vlth. It is in England only that the antient, generous, manly government of Europe survives, and continues in its original lustre and perfection. . . Magna Charta, instead of being superannuated, renews and recovers its pristine strength and athletic vigour by the Petition of Right, with our many other expla natory or declaratory statutes.\" Manufactured Evidence. \u2014 Algernon Sidney (writes Hume) \" was in principle a republican, and had entered deeply into the war against Charles I. He had been named on the high court of justice which tried and condemned that monarch, but he thought not proper to take his seat among the judges, and had ever opposed CromweU's usurpation with zeal and courage. After the Restoration he went into voluntary banishment ; but in 1677, having obtained the King's pardon, he returned to England. When the factions arising from the Popish plot began to run high, Sidney, fuU of those ideas of liberty which he had imbibed from the great examples of antiquity, joined the popular party; but his conduct was deficient in practical good sense, and he labours under the imputation of accepting French gold.\" At his trial in 1683, for participation in the Rye-house conspiracy, \" the only witness who deposed against him was Lord Howard ; but as the law required two witnesses, the deficiency was supplied by producing some of his papers, in which he maintained the lawfulness of resisting tyrants, and the preference of Uberty to the government of a single person. The violent and inhuman Jeffreys was now Chief Justice, and by his direction a partial jury was easiV prevailed on to give a verdict against Sidney. His execution followed a few days after.\" The judgment against him was annulled in 16S9 and his attainder, like that of his associate and fellow victim Lord William RusseU, was reversed.

I presently went to the Painted Chamber, where those who were nominated for judges were assembled. A debate was raised, and I positively opposed the proceeding. CromweU using these formal words, ' I tell you, we wUl cut off his head with the crown on it,' I replied, ' Tou may take your own course, I cannot stop you ; but I wiU keep myself clean from having any hand in this business ; ' and saying thus I immediately left them, and never returned.\" THE FIRST EARL OF SHAFTESBURY (1621\u20141683.) Cromwell's House of Lords. \u2014 Anthony Ashley Cooper, first Earl of Shaftesbury, the son of a Hampshire baronet, was returned for Tewkes bury at an early age. After being an active supporter of the Common wealth, he was among the members of Parliament who went to Holland to invite the return of Charles IL, by whom he was taken into favour, and made Lord Chancellor in 1672. His connection with the Habeas Corpus Act and the Exclusion Bill, and the aUusions to him in Dryden's poems, cause him to be one of the best-remembered figures of our history. He died in HoUand in 1683, after having been sent to the Tower and tried for treason, but acquitted. He was one of the most brilliant speakers of his time. The following passage occurred in addressing the Commons in 1659, in support of a motion, \" that the other House be limited in time, aud last only for the present Parliament :\" \u2014 \" What I shaU speak of their quality, or anything else concerning them, I would be thought to speak with distinction, and to intend only of the major part ; for I acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, the mixture of the other House to be like the composition of apothecaries, who mix something grateful to the taste to qualify their bitter drugs, which else, perhaps, would be immediately spit out and never swaUowed. So, Sir, his Highness of deplorable memory to this nation, to countenance as weU the want of quality as honesty in the rest, has nominated some against whom there lies no other reproach but only that nomination ; but not out of any respect to their quality or regard to their virtues, but out of regard to the no-quality, the no-virtues of the rest ; which truly, Mr. Speaker, if he had not done, we could easily have given a more express name to this other House than he hath been pleased to do ; for we know a house designed for beggars and malefactors is a house of correction, and so termed by our law. But, Mr. Speaker, setting those few persons aside who, I hope, think the nomination a disgrace, and their ever coming to sit there a much greater, can we without indignation think of the rest ? He who is first in their roU, a condemned coward ;* one that out of fear and baseness did once what he could to betray our liberties, and now does the same for gain.

The third, a Cavalier, a Presbyterian, and Inde- pendent ; for the Republic, for a Protector, for everything, for nothing, but only that one thing \u2014 money. It were endless, Sir, to run through them all ; to tell you of the lordships of seventeen pounds a year land of inheritance ; of the farmer lordships, draymen lordships, cobbler lordships,. without one foot of land but what the blood of Englishmen has been the price of. These, Sir, are to be our rulers ; these the judges of our Uves and fortunes ; to these we are to stand bare whUst their pageant lordships deign to give us a conference on their breeches. Mr. Speaker, wo have already had too much experience how insupportable servants are when they become our masters. AU kinds of slavery are miserable in the account of generous minds ; but that which comes accompanied with scorn and contempt stirs up every man's indignation, and is endured by none whom nature does not intend for slaves, as weU as fortune. Mr. Speaker, I blame not in these men the faults of their fortune any other- wise than as they make them their own ; I object to you their poverty, because it is accompanied with ambition ; I remind you of their quality because they themselves forget it ; it is not the men I am angry with, but their Lordships. ... I must teU you, Sir, that most of them have had the courage to do things which, I may boldly say, few other Christians durst so have adventured their souls to have attempted. They have not only subdued their enemies, but their masters that raised and main tained them : they have not only conquered Scotland and Ireland, but rebellious England too, and there suppressed a malignant party of magistrates and laws ; and, that nothing should be wanting to make them indeed complete conquerors, without the help of phUosophy they have even conquered themselves. All shame they have subdued as per fectly as aU justice ; the oaths they have taken they have as easily digested as their old General could himself; public covenants and engagements they have trampled under foot. In conclusion, so entire a victory they have over themselves, that their consciences are as much their servants, Mr. Speaker, as we are. But give me leave to conclude with that which is more admirable than all this, and shows the confidence they have of themselves and us. After having many times trampled on the authority of the House of Commons, and no less than five times dissolved them, they hope, for those good services to the House of Commons, to be made a House of Lords.\" A Retort. \u2014 The seat on the left of the throne in Parliament had been appropriated to the Duke of Tork, as brother of Charles IL, that on the right being reserved for the Prince of Wales; but the Queen proving barren, the Duke was looked upon as successor to the Crown, and took the right-hand chair. When Shaftesbury, as Lord ChanceUor, presided for the first time in the House of Lords, he resolved to replace the duke in his proper seat. He informed the duke that he was in the wrong chair, and that his place was on the other side of the throne, as only heir pre sumptive. The duke being unwiUing to quit his seat, Lord Shaftesbury told him that he could not proceed upon business tiU the House was in form. At length the duke was obliged to submit, but said, in a passion,"], [117, "THE FIRST EARL OF SHAFTESBURY. 97 \" My lord, you are a rascal and a vUlain.\" Shaftesbury, with great com posure, replied, \" I am much obliged to your royal highness for not caUing me likewise a coward and a papist.\" Conjugal Relations. \u2014 At the opening of the eleventh session of the second Parliament of Charles II. (1672-3), the King's speech was foUowed by one from Lord ChanceUor Shaftesbury, who in the course of it said: \"Let us bless God that hath given this king signaUythe hearts of his people, and most particularly of this Parliament, who in affection and loyalty to their prince have exceeded all their predecessors ; a ParUament with whom the King hath for many years lived with aU the caresses of a happy marriage. Has the King had a concern? you have wedded it. Has his Majesty wanted supplies ? you have readily, cheers uUy, and fuUy provided for them. Tou have relied upon the wisdom and conduct of his Majesty in aU his affairs ; so that you have never attempted to exceed your bounds, or to impose upon him. . . And let me say, that though this marriage be according to Moses's law, where the husband can give a biU of divorce, put her away, and take another, yet I can assure you it is as impossible for the King to part with this Parliament as it is for you to depart from that loyalty, affection, and dutiful behaviour you have hitherto showed towards him.\" This Parliament, to which the name of \" the Long Parliament \" has frequently been given, lasted nearly eighteen years, not being dissolved untU 1679. Stepping in at the Breach. \u2014 In 1673, Lord Clifford, the Lord Treasurer and head of the \" Cabal,\" had undertaken to open a debate in the Lords, \" for establishing a perpetual fund, in order to advance the pre- rogative, and render Parliament inconsiderable. He prepared a set speech to that purpose, which he read to the Lord ChanceUor (Shaftesbury), who desired to hear it again ; and, upon the second reading, he charged his memory with the substance of it, promising he would likewise come roundly into the debate. This gave him an opportunity he wished for, to be revenged of the courtiers and the Lord Clifford, who, pursuant to the determination of the Cabal, began the debate with the very speech he had showed the Lord Chancellor ; whde his Majesty and the Duke of Tork were then in the house to countenance the design. The country lords, aud those who were not in the secret, stared at one another ; the whole House at the end of the speech, meditating the fate of England, remained in an awful sUenee ; when Chancellor Shaftesbury stood up, and answered Clifford's speech from the beginning to the end, showing that his proposi- tions were extravagant ; that what he aimed at would end in confusion, and the ruin of tho government ; that it might perhaps send the royal family abroad again, to spend their lives in exde, without hope of a return. All which he spoke with so much spirit and sharpness, that he confounded the court counsels. WhUe he was speaking, the Duke of Tork, enraged at him, whispered the King, ' What a rogue have you of a Lord ChanceUor !' Tho King briskly replied, ' 'Od's fish, what a fool have you of a Lord Treasurer.' \" \u2014 Parliamentary Debates, 1668 \u2014 1741. H"], [118, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 98 LORD HALIFAX. (1630\u20141695.) The \" Trimmer.\" \u2014 George SavUe, Viscount Halifax, was (writes Macaulay) the first in genius among the statesmen of his times. \" His polished, luminous, and animated eloquence, set off by the silver tones of his voice, was the delight of the House of Lords. He was the chief of those poUticians whom the two great parties contemptuously caUed Trimmers. Instead of quarreUing with this nickname, he assumed it as a title of honour, and vindicated, with great vivacity, the dignity of the appeUation. Everything good, he said, trims between extremes. The temperate zone trims between the climate in which men are roasted and the climate in which they are frozen. The English Church trims between the Anabaptist madness and the Papist lethargy. The English Constitu tion trims between Turkish despotism and Popish anarchy. Virtue is nothing but a just temper between propensities, any one of which, if indulged to excess, becomes vice. Nay, the perfection of the Supreme Being himself consists in the exact equUibrium of attributes, none of which could preponderate without disturbing the whole moral and physical order of the world. Thus Halifax was a trimmer on principle. He was also a trimmer by the constitution both of his head and of his heart.\" Influential Oratory. \u2014 Rejection of the Exclusion Bill. \u2014 In October, 1680, the Parliament met. The Whigs had so great a majority in the Commons that the Exclusion BUI went through aU its stages there without difficulty. The whole nation now looked with breathless anxiety to the House of Lords. The assemblage of peers was large. The King himself was present. The debate was long, earnest, and occasionaUy furious. Some hands were laid on the pommels of swords, in a manner which revived the recoUection of the stormy Parliaments of Henry the Third and Richard the Second. Shaftesbury and Essex were joined by the treacherous Sunderland. But the genius of Halifax bore down aU opposition. Deserted by his most important coUeagues, and opposed to a crowd of able antagonists, he defended the cause of the Duke of Tork in a succession of speeches which, many years later, were remem bered as masterpieces of reasoning, of wit, and of eloquence. It is seldom that oratory changes votes. Tet the attestation of contemporaries leaves no doubt that, on this occasion, votes were changed by the oratory of Halifax. The bishops, true to their doctrines, supported the principle of hereditary right, and the bill was rejected by a great majority. \u2014 Macaulay's History. Hume remarks that Halifax \" was animated as well by the greatness of the occasion as by a rivalship to his uncle Shaftesbury, whom, during that day's debate, he seemed in the judgment of aU to have totaUy eclipsed.\" LORD SOMERS.

He first came prominently into note as junior counsel for the Seven Bishops on their trial in 1688, and was sent to the Conven tion ParUament of that year. Under WUliam III. he received rapid preferment. In 1693, whUe attorney-general, he was made keeper of the great seal, and in 1697 was raised to the woolsack. \" John Somers (writes Macaulay) was the son of a country attorney. At thirty-seven he had been sitting in a stuff gown on a back bench in the Court of King's Bench. At forty-two he was the first lay dignitary of the realm. . Without one drop of patrician blood in his veins, he had taken his place at the head of the patrician order with the quiet dignity of a man ennobled by nature. His serenity and his modesty, his self-command, proof even against the most sudden surprises of passion ; his self-respect, which forced the proudest grandees of the kingdom to respect him ; his urbanity, which won the hearts of the youngest lawyers of the Chancery bar, gained for him many private friends and admirers among the most respectable members of the opposition. . . The instrument known by the name of the Declaration of Right was prepared by a committee of which Somers was chairman. The fact that the low-bom young barrister was appointed to so honourable and important a post in a Parliament fiUed with able and experienced men, only ten days after he had spoken in the House of Commons for the first time, sufficiently proves the superiority of his abUities.\" His Defence at the Bar of the Commons. \u2014 Various attempts were made to impeach Somers, on charges more or less frivolous. The poet Prior, writing in February, 1700, said, \" To-morrow is the great day when we expect that my Lord ChanceUor wUl be faUen upon, though God knows what crime he is guilty of, but that of being a very great man and a wise and upright judge.\" In 1701, hearing that the Commons were about to vote his impeachment, Somers requested permission to address them at their bar, which was granted. When he had finished, he was asked from the chair who had informed him that there was a debate respecting him in the House. He repUed, \" He was strongly surprised at a question that he never knew was put to any man that came to desire tho favour of being heard ; and that, if the question was asked to bring the least prejudice to any mau in England, he would not only be content to be under tho censure of the House, but suffer the worst thing that might befall him upon earth, rather than do a dishonourable thing.\" The im peachment was carried by 198 against 188. Mock Impeachment. \u2014 After sending up to the Lords their impeach ment of Somers and others, in 1701, the Commons delayed progress with the matter, whde the House of Lords insisted that the trials should either proceed or be dropped. The Commons demanded a joint committee of both Houses to consider the methods of proceeding, and urged that other wise they would be \" giving up the rights of the Commons of England, established by unquestionable precedents and the usage of Parliament, and making all impeachment (the greatest bulwark of the laws and hberties of England) impracticable for the future.\" But the Lords rejoined, \" They do not find that ever such a committee was appointed on H 2"], [120, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 100 occasion of impeachment for misdemeanors, and their lordships think themselves obliged to be extremely cautious in admitting anything new in matters relating to judicature.\" The Lords gave notice of their intention to bring on the trial on a certain day; the Commons passed an order forbidding any member of the House to appear at the \" pretended trial.\" The trial being opened with the usual formalities in Westminster HaU, and no member of the Lower House appearing with evidence against the defendant, the Lords adjourned to their own chamber, and declared the impeachment dismissed. ROBERT HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD. (1661\u20141724.) House of Commons Tact. \u2014 Confessedly one of the most in fluential of the members of the House of Commons was he whom the last three Parliaments of William III. elected for their Speaker ; yet no man would have listened patiently for five minutes to Robert Harley anywhere but in the House of Commons. There he was supreme. The country gentlemen voted for him, though they remembered that his family went to a meeting-house. The younger members put forth their most able and graceful representative to honour him, when Henry St. John seconded his third nomination. And posterity itself had cause to be grateful to him when, employing for once this influence in its service, he joined Tory and Whig in a common demand for the best securities of the Act of Settlement. It was not genius, it was not eloquence, it was not states manship that had given Harley this extraordinary power. It was House of Commons tact. \u2014 Forster on De Foe. Reputed Wisdom. \u2014 Harley's influence in Parliament (writes Macaulay) was out of aU proportion to his ability. His inteUect was both slender and slow. He was unable to take a large view of any subject. He never acquired the art of expressing himself in public with fluency and perspicuity. To the end of his life he remained a tedious, hesitating, and confused speaker. He had none of the external graces of an orator. His countenance was heavy, his figure mean and somewhat deformed, and his gestures uncouth. Tet he was heard with respect. For such as his mind was, it had been assiduously cultivated. He had that sort of industry and that sort of exactness which would have made him a respect able antiquary or King-at-Arms. He constantly had, even with his best friends, an air of mystery and reserve, which seemed to indicate that he knew some momentous secret, and that his mind was labouring with some vast design. In this way he got and long kept a high reputation for wisdom. It was not tiU that reputation had made him an Earl, a Knight of the Garter, Lord High Treasurer of England, and master of the fate of Europe, that his admirers began to find out that he was really a dull puzzle-headed man.

He was twenty-eight years old at the time. AU his connec tions were in the Whig interest, but he attached himself to the Tory party under Harley. His eloquence soon gained him influence in the House, and in 1704 he was appointed Secretary at War and of the Marine, Harley being Secretary of State. To the latter office St. John succeeded when Harley took the Chancellorship of the Exchequer in 1710, and he was raised to the peerage as Baron St. John and Viscount Bolingbroke in 1712. It was into the hands of Addison that he had to resign the seals, when the death of Anne in 1714 put an end to the hopes of his party ; and his attainder took place in the following year. Evanescence of Parliamentary Eloquence in Former Days. \u2014 In the case of Bolingbroke (remarks Lord Brougham), the defect, so often to be deplored in contemplating the history of modern oratory, attains its very height. Meagre as are the materials by which we can aim at forming to ourselves some idea of the eloquence of most men who flourished before our own day ; scanty as are the remains even of the speakers who figured during the Seven Tears War, and the earlier part of the American contest \u2014 when we go back to the administration of Walpole we find those vestiges to be yet more thinly scattered over tho pages of our history; and in Queen Anne's time, during which alone Bolingbroke spoke, there are absolutely none. It is correct to affirm that of this great orator \u2014 one of the very greatest, according to all contem porary history, that ever exercised the art, and these accounts are power fully supported by his writings \u2014 not a spoken sentence remains. Tho contemplation of this chasm it was that made Mr. Pitt, when musing upon its brink, and calling to mind aU that might be fancied of the orator from the author, and all that traditional testimony had handed down to us, sigh after a speech of Bolingbroke \u2014 desiderating it far more than the restoration of all that has perished of the treasures of the ancient world. \u2014 Statesmen of the Time of George III. The impression produced by Bolingbroke is shown iu the Earl of Chesterfield's remark in one of the letters to his son : \" I would much rather that you had Lord Boling broke's style and eloquence, iu speaking and writing, than all the learning of the Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society, and the two Universities united.\" Creation of Peers. \u2014 Oxford and Bolingbroke gazetted twelve new peers in one day. On their taking their seats, Wharton inquired if they were to voto, like a jury, by their foreman ; and Bolingbroke, on hearing that the question had been carried by a majority of one, exclaimed, \" If those twelve had not been enough, we would have given them another dozen.\" This is the solitary instance of a creation of peers in mass to carry a measure. \u2014 Hayward's Essays."], [122, "102 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. JOSEPH ADDISON. (1672\u20141719.) Successful Silence. \u2014 Addison sat for Malmesbury in the House of Commons which was elected in 1708. But the House of Commons (writes Macaulay) \" was not the field for him ; tho bashf utness of his nature made his wit and eloquence useless in debate. He once rose, but could not over come his diffidence, and ever after remained sUent. Nobody can think it strange that a great writer shoidd faU as a speaker ; but many, probably, wUl think it strange that Addison's faUure as a speaker should have had no unfavourable effect on his success as a politician. In our time a man of high rank and great fortune might, though speaking very little and very iU, hold a considerable post ; but it would now be inconceivable that a mere adventurer \u2014 a man who, when out of office, must live by his pen \u2014 should in a few years become successively Under Secretary of State, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and Secretary of State, without some oratorical talent. Addison, without high birth, and with Uttle property, rose to a post which dukes \u2014 the heads of the great houses of Talbot, RusseU, and Bentinck \u2014 have thought it an honour to fiU. Without opening his lips iu debate, he rose to a post the highest that Chatham or Fox ever reached ; and this he did before he had been nine years iu Parliament.\" Ineffectual Conception. \u2014 It was Lord Wharton (writes Mr- O'Flanagan) \" who brought Joseph Addison to Ireland, and appointed him Secretary of State. He represented the borough of Cavan in the Irish Parliament, iu 1709. Though famous as an easy aud graceful writer. he could not express himself with any degree of fluency. An anecdote related of him proves this. On a motion before the House, Addison rose, and having said \u2014 ' Mr. Speaker, I conceive ' \u2014 paused, as if frightened by the sound of his own voice. He again commenced \u2014 ' I conceive Mr. Speaker' \u2014 when he stopped, untU roused by cries of ' hear ! hear ! ' when he once more essayed with \u2014 ' Sir, I conceive.' Power of further utterance was denied, so he sat down amidst the scarce suppressed laughter of his brother members, which soon burst forth when a witty senator said, ' Sir, the honourable gentleman has conceived three times,. and brought forth nothing.' \" SIR RICHARD STEELE.

The \" Tatler.\" \u2014 Steele entered the House of Commons when the Tory party, whom he had exasperated by his political writings, were in the ascendant, and they determined to put him down. Alluding to Sir Thomas Hanmer's opposition to the Commercial Treaty, in 1714, he said, \" I rise to do lum honour ; \" on which many members, who had before tried to interrupt him, caUed out \" Tatler ! Tatler ! \" And as he went down the house several said, \" It is not so easy a thing to speak in the House ; he fancies, because he can scribble,\" &c, &c.

Robert Walpole and General Stanhope took their place on either side of him as he waited at the bar, and Addison prompted him throughout his spirited and temperate defence. He spoke, says one wha heard him, for near three hours, with such temper, eloquence, anl unconcern as gave entire satisfaction to aU who were not prepossessed against him. But perhaps the most interesting occurrence of that memorable day was the speech of Lord Finch. This young nobleman, afterwards famous as a minister and orator, owed gratitude to Steele for having repelled, in the Guardian, a libel on his sister, and he rose to make his maiden speech in defence of her defender. But baslifulness overcame him ; and after a few confused sentences he sat down, crying out as he did so, \" It is strange I cannot speak for this man, though I could readily fight for him ! \" Upon this such cheering rang through th> House, that suddenly the young lord took heart, rose again, and made the first of a long series of able aud teUing speeches. Of course, however, it did not save Steele, who was expelled by a majority of nearly a hundred, in a House of four hundred members. \u2014 Forster's Essay on S'eele. The Silent and the Eloquent. \u2014 On the death of Queen Anne, and the breaking up of the Tory party, Steele was again returned to Parliament, for Boroughbridge, and made some figure as a speaker. Ho wittily described the House, at the time, as consisting very much of silent people oppressed by the choice of a great deal to say, and of eloquent people ignorant that what they said was nothing to the purpose. Triennial Parliaments. \u2014 Steele was a warm advocate in the House of Commons of the repeal of the Act which limited the duration of Parliaments to three years. In a speech on the subject he said: \"Ever since the Triennial BiU has been enacted the nation has been in a series of contentions. The first year of a Triennial Parliament has been spent in vindictive decisions and animosities about the late elections. The second session has entered into business, but rather with a spirit of contradiction to what the prevailing set of men in former Parliaments had brought to pass than for a disinterested zeal for the common good. The third session has languished in the pursuit of what little was intended to be done in the second; and the approach of an ensuing election has terrified the members into a servile management, according as their respective principals wero disposed towards the question before them in the House. Thus the state of England has been like that of a vessel in distress at sea ; the pilot and mariners have been whoUy employed in keeping the ship from sinking ; tho art of navigation was useless, and they never pretended to make sad.\" Not a Good Pedestrian. \u2014 WiUiam Whiston, in his \" Memoirs,\" writes of Steele : \" I shall set down one encounter I had with him at Button's coffee-house, when he was a Member of Parliament, and had been making a speech in the House of Commons, in the days of King"], [124, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 104 George I., to please the court, but against his own conscience, for the South Sea directors, then under the great disgrace of the nation ; and against which South Sea scheme he had before for some time written weekly papers, till he saw he could not recover his post of Censor of the Playhouse, from which he had been turned out, which used to bring him some hundreds a year, without making such a speech. I accosted him thus : ' They say, Sir Richard, you have been making a speech in the House of Commons for the South Sea directors.' He replied, ' They do say so.' To which I answered, ' How does this agree with your former writing against that scheme ? ' His rejoinder was thus : ' Mr. Whistou, you can walk on foot and I cannot.' Than which a truer or an acuter answer could not have been made by anybody.\" THE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD. (1694\u20141773.) A Touthful Adversary Disarmed. \u2014 Chesterfield was returned to the House of Commons when Lord Stanhope, and before he had attained full age. He spoke soon after his entrance, attacking the Oxford ministry, and said, \" He never wished to spUl the blood of any of his countrymen, much less the blood of any nobleman, but he was persuaded the safety of his country required that examples should be made of those who had betrayed it in so infamous a manner.\" The reply of the Government was a very prudent one. It was privately intimated to the young speaker that he had displayed great abUity, but, in taking his seat although a minor,* he had exposed himself to a penalty of five hundred pounds, which would not be enforced against him unless he attempted to vote. Stanhope took the hint and left the house, to which he did not return tUl duly qualified. A Hint to Statesmen. \u2014 The Earl of Chesterfield deUvered a speech in the House of Lords, 1737, against the Play-house BiU. The foUowing extract is from the \" Parliamentary History : \" \u2014 \" It is not licentiousness, it is an useful Uberty, always indulged the stage in a free country, that some great men may there meet with a just reproof, which none of their friends will be free enough, or rather faithful enough, to give them. Of this we have a famous instance in the Roman history. The great Pompey, after the many victories he had obtained and tho great conquests he had made, had certainly a good title to the esteem of the people of Rome ; yet that great man, by some error in his conduct, became an object of general dislike. And therefore, in the representa tion of an old play, when Diphilus, the actor, came to repeat these words, ' Nostrd miserid tu es Magnus,' the audience immediately applied them to Pompey, who at that time was as well known by the name Magnus as by that of Pompey, and were so highly pleased with the satire that, as Cicero says, they made the actor repeat the words a hundred times over. An account of this was immediately sent to Pompey, who, instead of resenting it as an injury, was so wise as to take it for a just reproof ; he * See p. 20."], [125, "THE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD. 105 examined his conduct, he altered his measures, he regained by degrees tho esteem of the people, and then he neither feared the wit nor felt the satire of the stage. This is an example which ought to be foUowed by great men in aU countries.\" Dexterity with a Difficult Subject. \u2014 A bill for the reform of the Calendar was introduced in the House of Lords by Lord Chesterfield in 1751, and in his \" Letters \" he thus alludes to his speech : \" This biU was necessarily composed of law jargon and astronomical calculations, to both which I am an utter stranger. However, it was absolutely necessary to make the House of Lords think that I knew something of the matter, and also to make them beUeve that they knew something of it themselves, which they do not. For my own part, I could just as soon have talked Celtic or Sclavonian to them as astronomy, and they would have under stood me fuU as well; so I resolved to do better than speak to the purpose, and to please instead of informing them. I gave them, there fore, only an historical account of calendars, from the Egyptian down to the Gregorian, amusing them now and then with little episodes j but I was particularly attentive to the choice of my words, to the harmony and soundness of my periods, to my elocution, to my action. This succeeded, and ever will succeed. They thought I informed, because I pleased them ; and many of them said that I had made the whole very clear to them, when, God knows, I had not even attempted it. Lord Macclesfield, who had the greatest share in framing the bill, and who is one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers in Europe, spoke afterwards with infinite knowledge, and all the clearness that so intricate a matter would admit of ; but, as his words, his periods, and his utterance were not near so good as mine, the preference was most unanimously, though most unjustly, given to me. This wiU ever be the case ; every numerous assembly is a mob, let the individuals who compose it be what they will.9' Bleeding for One's Country. \u2014 Maty, in his memoir of Chester field, relates that Lord R , with many good qualities, and even leam ing and parts, had a strong desire of being thought skilful in physic, aud was very expert in bleeding. Lord Chesterfield, who knew his foible, and on a particular occasion wished to have his vote, came to him one morning, and, after having conversed upon indifferent matters, complained of the headache, and desired his lordship to feel his pulse. It was found to beat high, and a hint of losing blood given. \" I have no objection ; and, as I hear your lordship has a masterly hand, wiU you favour me with trying your lancet upon me ? Apropos,\" said Lord Chesterfield, after the operation, \" do you go to the House to-day ? \" Lord R answered, \" I did not intend to go, not being sufficiently informed of the question which is to be debated ; but you, who have considered it, which side will you be of ? \" The earl, having gained his confidence, easUy directed his judgment ; he carried him to the House, and got him to vote as he pleased. He used afterwards to say that none of his friends had done so much as he, having literally bled for the good of his country."], [126, "106 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. (1676\u20141745.) A Tory Physician and his Whig Patient.\u2014 During Walpole's residence at King's CoUege, Cambridge, he was seized with the small-pox, which was of a malignant sort, and he continued for some time in imminent danger. Dr. Brady, the famous historical advocate for the Tory principles of the EngUsh Constitution, who was his physician, said to one of the FeUows of King's CoUege, warmly attached to the same party, \" We must take care to save this young man, or we shall be accused of having purposely neglected him, because he is so violent a Whig.\" Notwithstanding Brady's political prejudices, he was so much pleased with the spirit and disposition of his young patient that he observed, with an affectionate attachment, \"His singular escape seems to be a sure indication that he is reserved for important purposes.\" \u2014 Coxe's \" Walpole.\" A Long Lease of Power. \u2014 Robert Walpole was sent to Parliament for King's Lynn in 1702, when twenty-six years of age. In 1708 he was made Secretary at War, and afterwards Treasurer of the Navy. He became Prime Minister for the first time in 1715, but resigned in 1717, and was reappointed in 1721, holding also the ChanceUorship of the Exchequer. Notwithstanding the personal dislike of George IL, he was confirmed in the Premiership on the accession of that King in 1727, and continued to hold the position for fifteen years longer, making altogether twenty-one years' uninterrupted administration \u2014 the longest term a single individual has ever remained at the head of the government. Committal to the Tower. \u2014 The accusation of corruption brought against Walpole by the Commissioners of Public Accounts was made (says Coxe) December 21st, 1711. They charged him with having taken two notes of hand \u2014 one for five hundred guineas, the other for five hundred pounds \u2014 while he was Seeretary-at-War, for forage contracts in Scotland. In consequence of these reports he was heard in his own defence, January 17th, 1712. Ultimately the House resolved that he had been guilty of a high breach of trust, that he should be committed to the Tower, and expeUed the House. Next morning- Walpole surrendered himself a prisoner, and was committed to the Tower, where he remained till the prorogation of ParUament. A new writ having been issued for Lynn, he was re-elected ; but on a petition by Samuel Taylor, the opposing candidate, the House declared Walpole incapable of serving in that Parliament. WhUe he remained in prison he was considered a martyr to the cause of the Whigs, and visited by persons of the highest distinc tion and abUity, his apartment exhibiting the appearance of a crowded levee. The Office of Prime Minister, and Government by Parlia ment. \u2014 The first (writes Mr. Ewald) who made the office of Prime Minister, such as we now understand it to be, was Sir Robert Walpole. \" It was not untU his rise that the Prime Minister began to be regarded as the recognised leader of his party, the responsible adviser of the"], [127, "SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. 107 Crown, and the head of the Cabinet. The history of the great ' minister of peace ' is the history of a man who understood to the fuU the nature of the change from government by prerogative to government by parUament. who saw that parUamentary government and government by party were synonymous terms, and who had deeply studied the then new poUtical doctrine that power was not dependent upon the royal approval, upon the intrinsic exceUence of the measures introduced, upon ability or popularity. lint upon the skilful working of a parliamentary majority. He was the first of English statesmen to recognise the advantages of a united Cabinet, and he gave proof of the light in which he regarded the influence of the House of Commons by being the first of our line of premiers who resigned office in obedience to an adverse vote of the Lower House. With the career of Sir Robert Walpole begins the history of the faults and the advantages, the patriotism and the selfishness, of government by Parliament.\" Limitation of the Peerage. \u2014 In 1717 a biU was introduced by tho Stanhope Ministry to limit the royal prerogative in the creation of peers. The existing number of the House of Lords was not to be increased beyond six, unless in the case of royal princes ; future peerages were to be limited to the grantees and their immediate heirs ; new creations were only to be made in cases of extinction ; and the sixteen representative peers of Scotland were to be replaced by twenty-five hereditary peers nominated by the King. These provisions were earned in the House of Lords by a large majority, but were strenuously opposed by Walpole in the Commons, and \" it may be doubted,\" writes Earl Stanhope the historian, \" if any harangue of so much eloquence and effect had ever yet been delivered in the House.\" In opening his speech Walpole said : \" Among the Romans the Temple of Fame was placed behind the Temple of Virtue, to denote that there was no coming to the temple of Fame but through that of Virtue. But if this biU is passed into a law, one of the most powerful incentives to virtue would be taken away, since there would be no arriving at honour but through the winding-sheet of an old decrepit lord or the grave of an extinct noble family : a policy very different from that glorious and enlightened nation, who made it their pride to hold out to the world iUustrious examples of merited elevation, ' Patere honoris scirent ut cuneti viam.' It is very far from my thoughts to depreciate the advantages or detract from the respect due to iUustrious birth; for though the philosophei may say with the poet, ' Et genu9 et proavos, et qu\u00e6 non fecimus ipsi, Vix ea nostra voeo,' yet the claim derived from that advantage, though fortuitous, is so generaUy and so justly conceded, that every endeavour to subvert the principle would merit contempt and abhorrence. But though iUustrious birth forms one undisputed title to pre-eminence and superior considera tion, yet surely it ought uot to be the only one. The origin of high titles was derived from the wiU of the sovereign to reward signal services"], [128, "108 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. or conspicuous merit by a recompense which, surviving to posterity, should display in all ages the virtues of the receiver and the gratitude of the donor. Is merit, then, so rarely discernible, or is gratitude so smaU a virtue, in our days, that the one must be supposed to be its own reward, and the other limited to a barren display of impotent goodwUl ? Had this bUl originated with some noble peer of distinguished ancestry it would have excited less surprise ; a desire to exclude others from a participation of honours is no novelty in persons of that class : Quod ex aliorum meritis sibi arrogant, id mihi ex meis ascribi nolunt. But it is a matter of just surprise that a bill of this nature should either have been projected or at least promoted by a gentleman (Lord Stanhope) who was not long ago seated amongst us, and who, having got into the House of Peers, is now desirous to shut the door after him. When great alterations in the Constitution are to be made, the experiment should be tried for a short time before the proposed change is finaUy carried into execution, lest it should produce evil instead of good ; but in this case, when the biU is once sanctioned by Parliament, there can be no future hopes of redress, because the Upper House will always oppose the repeal of an Act which has so considerably increased their power. The great unanimity with which this bill has passed the Lords ought to inspire some jealousy in the Commons ; for it must be obvious that whatever the Lords gain must be acquired at the expense of the Commons, and the dimininution of the regal prerogative ; and that in all disputes between the Lords and Commons, when the House of Lords is immutable, the Commons must, sooner or later, bo obliged to recede.\" Mainly in consequence of Walpole's speech, the biU was thrown out by a majority of 92. His Part Taken. \u2014 The Lord Sunderland of the reign of George I. (writes Horace Walpole) \" is said to have too much resembled as a politician the earl his father, who was so principal an actor in the reign of James IL, and in bringing about the Revolution. Between the earl and the Prince of Wales grew mortal antipathy, of which an anecdote told to me by my father himself will leave no doubt. When a reconcUiation had been patched up between the two courts, and my father became First Lord of the Treasury a second time, Lord Sunderland in a tete-a-tete with him said, ' WeU, Mr. Walpole, we have settled matters for the present ; but we must think whom we wiU have next ' (meaning, in case of the King's demise). Walpole repUed, ' Tour lordship may think as you please, but my part is taken ;' meaning, to support the established settlement.\" The Orders of the Bath and Garter.\u2014 A few days before the prorogation of Parliament, May 31st, 1724, the Order of the Bath was revived, and Walpole was created a knight, and in 1726 he was instaUed Knight of the Garter ; the value of which distinction is greatly enhanced by the consideration that, excepting Admiral Montague, afterwards Earl of Sandwich, he was the only commoner who, since the reign of James I., had been dignified by that order* On this event he had the honour of being congratulated by the author of the \" Night Thoughts,\" in a poem * See Miscellaneous section \u2014 \" The Garter in the Commons.\""], [129, "SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. 109 caUed the \" Instalment.\" \u2014 Coxe's \" Walpole.\" In his speech in his own defence in 1741, Walpole thus aUuded to his wearing of the Garter : \" Is ambition imputed to me ? Why then do I stUl continue a commoner \u2014 I, who refused a white staff and a peerage ? I had, indeed, like to have forgotten the Uttle ornament about my shoulders, which gentlemen have so repeatedly mentioned in terms of sarcastic obloquy. But surely, though this may be regarded with envy or indignation in another place, it cannot be supposed to raise any resentment in this House, where many may be pleased to see those honours which their ancestors have worn restored to the Commons.\" A Bid for Place. \u2014 Sir Robert Walpole, while Prime Minister to George I., was very much detested by the Prince of Wales. On the death of the King in 1727, he was, at the first court that George II. held at Leicester House, as much disregarded as possible ; but, by the following method (relates Mr. Henley), became in less than ten clays respected and homaged by the whole Court. Sir Spencer Compton, Speaker of the House of Commons, and favourite of the King when Prince of Wales, had a private conference with Queen Caroline with regard to her jointure, and told her Majesty that he hoped to be able to obtain her fifty or sixty thousand per annum. Sir Robert Walpole, who had his advices of every thing that happened then in private, was informed of this, and the Queen, being willing to know from the other party what they thought she ought to have, applied to Sir Robert, who, after teUing her Majesty that her jointure ought to be unlimited with respect to her merit, as she had sacri ficed being Empress on account of her religion (for she had refused being married to the Emperor of Germany), said that, as the nation had been involved in many wars, she could not exiger more than one hundred thousand pounds ; which so effectuaUy did his business that in a few days he was at the head of the administration. Compton was made Earl of Wilmington, and so far forgave Walpole his rivalry that some years later, when the minister was attacked, he rose from his bed, although suffering from fever, and went down to the House to vote for him \u2014 a circumstance which Horace Walpole mentioned as much to Wilmington's honour. A Picture of the Court. \u2014 Horace Walpole, in his \" Remi niscences,\" gives the following, which he temis \"a true picture of courtiers.\" George II. and his consort \" had removed from Richmond to their temporary palace in Leicester Fields on the very evening of their receiving notice of their accession to the crown ; and the next day all the nobility and gentry in town crowded to kiss their hands : my mother amongst the rest, who, Sir Spencer Compton's designation, and not its evaporation, being known, could not make her way between the scornful backs and elbows of her late devotees, nor could approach nearer to the Queen than the third or fourth row ; but no sooner was she descried by her Majesty than the Queen said aloud, ' There I am sure I see a friend !' The torrent divided and shrunk to either side, ' and as I came away,' said my mother, ' I might have walked over their heads, if I had pleased.' \" Ignorance of History.\u2014 On March 1st, 1733, Walpole's excise scheme was brought forward. A violent opponent of the measure had"], [130, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 110 during the debate asserted that its object was to revive the worse practices as Empson and Dudley. So grossly ignorant of EngUsh history was the Prime Minister (writes CampbeU), that he had been obliged te ask Sir PhUip Torke, sitting by him on the Treasury Bench, \" who Empson and DucUey were.\" Prepared for the Worst. \u2014 In his speech in defence of the Excise BiU, Sir Robert Walpole made a manly declaration of his readiness to answer for his poUtical conduct : \" Of late years,\" he said, \" I have dwelt but Uttle on the study of history, but I have a very good prompter, believe me (Sir Philip Torke, the Attorney-General), and by his means I can recoUect that the case of Empson and Dudley was so different from anything that can possibly be presumed from the case now before us, that I wonder how it was possible to bring them into the debate. Those men had, by virtue of old and obsolete laws, unjustly extorted great sums of money from people, under pretence that they had become liable to penalties for the breach of statutes which had for many years faUen into disuse. I must say (and I hope most of those who hear me wiU think) that it is very unjust to draw any paraUel between their characters and mine. If my character is, or should ever come to be, in any respects like theirs, I shaU deserve their fate. But whde I know myself innocent, I shaU depend upon the protection of the laws of my country ; as long as they can protect me I am safe ; and if that protection should faU, I am prepared to submit to the worst that can happen. I know that my political and ministerial life has by some gentlemen been long wished at an end, but they may ask their disappointed hearts how vain their wishes have been ; and as for my natural life I have lived long enough to learn to be easy about parting with it.\" Plots against his Life. \u2014 At the time of the Preston rebeUion, a Jacobite, who sometimes furnished Sir Robert with inteUigenee, sitting alone with him one night, suddenly putting his hand into his bosom and rising, said, \" Why do not I kiU you now ? \" Walpole, starting up, replied, \" Because I am a younger man, and a stronger.\" They sat down again, and discussed the person's information ; but Sir Robert afterwards had reasons for thinking that the spy had no intention of assassination, but had hoped by intimidating to extort money from him. Tet, if no real attempt was made on his life, it was not from want of suggestions to it. One of the weekly journals pointed out Sir Robert's frequent passing Putney Bridge late at night, attended but by one or two servants, on his way to New Park, as a proper place ; and after Sir Robert's death tho second Earl of Egmont told me that he was once at a consultation of the Opposition, in which it was proposed to have Sir Robert murdered by a mob, of which the earl had declared his abhorrence. \u2014 Horace Walpole's \" Reminiscences .\" The Lie Direct. \u2014 Earl Russell relates that one day, in the presence of the King, Walpole \" was so angry at the unfounded assertion of one of the Hanoverian ministers and favourites, that he exclaimed, with heat, ' Mentiris inipudentissime.' In order to account for the use of these Latin terms, it is necessary to say, that Walpole not being able to speak"], [131, "SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. 111 French, and George I. not understanding English, aU their intercourse, down to. the time of the King's death, took place in the Latin language.\" Walpole's Two Drawbacks. \u2014 A friend of mine (says Dr. King), who dined with Sir Robert Walpole one day tete-a-tete, took occasion to compliment him on the great honour and power which he enjoyed as Prime Minister. \"Doctor,\" says he, \"I have great power, it is true; but I have two cursed drawbacks \u2014 Hanover and the avarice.\" A Grateful Supporter. \u2014 Sir Robert Walpole wanted to carry a question in the House of Commons, to which he knew there would be great opposition, and which was disliked by some of his own dependents. As he was passing through the Court of Requests he met a member of the contrary party, whose avarice, he imagined, would not reject a largo bribe. He took him aside, and said, \" Such a question comes on this day; give me your vote, and here is a bank biU of 2000?.,\" which he put into his hands. The member replied, \" Sir Robert, you have lately served some of my particular friends ; and when my wife was last at court, the King was very gracious to her, which must have happened at your instance. I shoidd therefore think myself very ungrateful (putting the bank note into his pocket) if I were to refuse the favour you are now pleased to ask me.\" Magnanimity. \u2014 Lord North related the foUowing anecdote to Dr. Johnson : Sir Robert Walpole having got into his hands some treason able letters of his inveterate enemy, WiUiam Shippen, one of the heads of the Jacobite faction, he sent for him and burned them before his face. Some time afterwards, Shippen had occasion to take the oaths to the Government in the House of Commons, and while he was doing so, Sir Robert, who stood next him and knew his principles to be the same as ever, smiled. \" Egad, Robin,\" said Shippen, who had observed him, \" that's hardly fair.\" Even Temper. \u2014 Dr. Johnson had a high opinion of Sir Robert Walpole, notwithstanding that he had written against him in the early part of his life. He said of him that he was a fine feUow, and that his very enemies deemed him so before his death. He honoured his memory for having kept this country in peace many years, as also for the goodness and placability of his temper. Pulteney, Earl of Bath, in a conversation with Johnson, said that Sir Robert was of a temper so calm and equal, and so hard to be provoked, that he was veiy sure he never felt the bitterest invectives against him for half an hour. \u2014 Hawkins' \" Life of Johnson.\" Unusual Excitement. \u2014 In general (writes Brougham) Walpole's manner was simple, and even famUiar, with a constant tendency towards gaiety. In vehemence of declamation he seldom indulged, and anything very violent was foreign to his habits at aU times. Tet sometimes he deviated from this course, and once spoke under such excitement (on the motion respecting Lord Cadogan's conduct, 1717) that the blood burst from his nose, and he had to quit the House. But for this accidental relief, he probably would have afforded a singular instance of a speaker, always good-humoured and easy in his delivery beyond almost any other"], [132, "112 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. dropping down dead in his declamation, from excess of vehemence ; and at this time he was between forty and fifty years of age. An Unseemly Conflict. \u2014 The foUowing account of a scene between the brothers-in-law. Lord Townshend and Sir Robert Walpole, shortly before the retirement of the former from their joint ministry, shows that Walpole could occasionaUy lose his self-command. It is given in Ewald's biography : \u2014 Returning from the palace after a conference with the Queen. Walpole called upon Colonel Selwyn at Cleveland Court. Talking to Mrs. Selwyn was Townshend, and in the room were the Duke of New castle and his brother Mr. Pelham. The conversation turned upon a question of foreign politics, which Walpole had advised should be abandoned. Townshend, disapproving of this suggestion of his coUeague, recommended that tho House of Commons should be informed of the nature of the measure, and be told that it had faUen through at the insti gation of the First Lord of the Treasury. Walpole replied somewhat shortly that such a proceeding was inexpedient, and only calculated to give unnecessary trouble. To this Townshend hotly answered, \" Since you object, and the House of Commons is your concern more than mine, I shaU not persist in my opinion ; but, as I now give way, I cannot avoid observing that, upon my honour, I think that mode of proceeding would have been most advisable.\" Walpole, whose rage had long been smouldering against Townshend and only wanted the slightest provo cation to break out, said in his most scornful tones, \" My lord, for once there is no man's sincerity which I doubt so much as your lordship's ; and I never doubted it so much as when yon are pleased to make such strong professions.\" The choleric temper of Townshend was unable to brook this taunt, and, forgetful that Mrs. Selwyn was in the room, he rushed forward, seized Walpole by his coUar, and biography has to record that these two distinguished men were not ashamed to resent their wrongs by a personal struggle, which might have been approved of by the frequenters of a village taproom, but which was certainly out of place when we remember the high position of the combatants, and that the scene was laid in the house of a friend and in the presence of a lady. When the scuffle had ended, the rival ministers laid their hands on their swords, and prepared for an immediate duel. Mrs. Selwyn, iu terror, was on the point of summoning the guards, but was prevented by Mr. Pelham. Happily, the friends now interposed (indeed, one is surprised that they did not interfere sooner), and a cold and hollow reconcUiation between the two was effected \u2014 but neither ever forgot that day, and the bitterness with which it was remembered endured in the minds of both to the last. Patriotism. \u2014 In his speech on his own vindication in 1741, Walpole remarked: \" Gentlemen have talked a great deal of patriotism; a vene rable word, when duly practised. But I am sorry to say that of late it has been so much hackneyed about that it is in danger of faUing into disgrace ; the very idea of true patriotism is lost, and the term has been prostituted to the very worst of purposes. A patriot, sir ! why, patriots spring up like mushrooms. I could raise fifty of them within the four-"], [133, "SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. 113 and-twenty hours. I have raised many of them in one night. It is but refusing to gratify an unreasonable or an insolent demand, and up starts a patriot.\" The Balance of Power. \u2014 This expression occurs in the speech by Sir Robert Walpole in 1741, in which he defended himself against the motion for an address to George II. to remove him from his counsels. Alluding to the pacific policy of his administration, he said, \" We were not in honour obUged to take any share in the war which the Emperor brought upon himself in the year 1733, nor were we in interest obliged to take a share in that war, as long as neither side attempted to push its conquests farther than was consistent with the balance of power in Europe, which was a case that did not happen.\" His Resignation. \u2014 The immediate cause of the Minister's resig nation was the virtual success of Pulteney's motion (p. 108) in January, 1742. His once powerful majority I vrites Ewald) had dwindled down to three, and in a few days, when the question of the Chippenham election petition came before the House, even that feeble majority could not be commanded, and Walpole found himself for the first time for twenty years in a minority. He was strongly advised to give up the seals. \" I must iuforin you,\" he writes to the Duke of Devonshire, \" that the panic was so great among what I should caU my own friends that they all declared my retiring was become absolutely necessary, as the only means to carry ou the public business.\" His own family also urged him to submit to the verdict of parliamentary fortune, and not to oppose a hostile House of Commons. Had he consulted his own wishes, he would, he said, stiU have remained at the head of affairs, in spite of his political reverses ; but when he found that, in addition to a formidable majority in the House of Commons, and to a strong feeling against him out of doors, his Cabinet declined to serve under him and threatened desertion, he saw that there was no alternative but to tender his resignation. On handing the seals to the King, the Minister knelt down to kiss the royal hand, and it is said that his Majesty was so moved at the departure of his chief adviser, after the many years of faithful service he had rendered the Crown, that he burst into tears. Walpole was raised to the LTpper Houso by the title of the Earl of Orford, and a handsome pension was granted him. Faulty Premiers. \u2014 The Duke of Argyll said all First Ministers had been faulty, but that Sir Robert Walpole had the least faults of any minister with whom he had ever been concerned. Inquiring after Robin. \u2014 When Walpole resigned, and was raised to the peerage, the old clergyman of Walsingham, -who was master of the first school in which Sir Robert was instructed, went to his country seat at Houghton, and told him he had been his first master, and had predicted that he would be a great man. Being asked why he never called upon him while he was in power, he answered, \" I knew that you were sur rounded with so many petitioners, craving preferment, and that you had done so much for Norfolk people, that I did not wish to intrude. But,\" ho added, in a strain of good-natured simplicity, \" I always inquired how Robin went on, and was satisfied with your proceedings.\" i"], [134, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 114 His Opinion of History.\u2014 Upon his retirement, in 1742, he went immediately to Houghton ; but, accustomed all his life to political excite ment, having never been fond of reading, and much of his old company faUing, his time must have hung heavy on his hands. It is recorded that his son having one day proposed to read to him, and taking down a book of history, he exclaimed, \" Oh, don't read history; that I know must be false : \" \u2014 the judgment (remarks Earl RusseU) of a man better acquainted with pamphleteers than with historians. His Political Axiom.\u2014 Sir Robert Walpole is justly blamed (says Coxe) for a want of political decorum, and for deriding pubUc spirit, to which Pope alludes :\u2014 \" Seen him I have, bnt in his happier hour Of social pleasure, ill exchanged for power ; Seen him, uncumbered with the venal tribe, Smile without art, and win without a bribe. Would he oblige me P let me only find He does not think me what he thinks mankind.\" Although it is not possible to justify him, yet this part of his conduct has been greatly exaggerated. The political axiom generaUy attributed to him, that \" all men have their price,\" was perverted by leaving out the word \"those.\" Flowery oratory he despised; he ascribed to the interested views of themselves or their relatives the declarations of pretended patriots, of whom he said, \" AU those men have their price ; \" and in tho event many of them justified his observation. \u2014 Coxe's \" Life.\" Character of Walpole. \u2014 Lord CampbeU thus sums up the character of Walpole : \" He was probably the most dexterous party-leader we have ever had \u2014 equaUy skUled to win royal favour, to govern the House of Commons, and to influence or be influenced by public opinion. He like wise weU understood the material interests of the country, and, as far as was consistent with his own retention of power, he was desirous of pursuing them. But, that he might ran no personal risk, he would make no attempt to improve our institutions ; he was regardless of distant dangers ; he plunged into a war which he admitted to be unjust and impolitic, and, by his utter neglect of literature and literary men \u2014 in spite of the example set him by his immediate predecessors, Whig and Tory \u2014 he gave to official life in England that aristocratic feeling, and vulgar, business-like tone, which it has ever since retained.\" \u2014 Mr. Massey, in his \" History,\" says : \" Every variety of invective which faction, jealousy, and personal hatred could suggest, was heaped upon his head ; but the topics principally relied upon, and which could not be disputed, so far from being a reproach, are the very grounds on which his reputation as a wise and faithful minister must ever rest. That he was not scrupulous in the appUcation of public money is undoubted ; but the charge of personal peculation, by which the vindictive rage of his enemies sought his life as well as his honour, not only failed, but is discredited by the fact that he died largely in debt. The reaUy vulnerable parts of his character were never attacked. The evil example of his private life ; his utter contempt of decorum ; the proverbial gvossnpss of his conversation, and the perio-"], [135, "WILLIAM PULTENEY. 115 dical debaucheries of Houghton, which were the talk of the whole county \u2014 aU these passed uncensured. The truth is that the habits and manners of Walpole were congenial to the coarseness and depravity of the times.\" WILLIAM PULTENEY. (1682\u20141764.) A Powerful Speaker. \u2014 Sir Robert Walpole said of his great rival that he feared Pulteney's tongue more than another man's sword ; and his character as a debater was thus drawn by Speaker Onslow, who was also a political opponent : \" He had the most popular parts for pubUc speaking that I ever knew ; animating every subject of popularity with the spirit and fire that the orators of the ancient commonwealths governed tho people by; was as classical and eloquent in the speeches he did not pre pare, as they were in the most studied compositions ; mingUng wit and pleasantry, and the application even of little stories, so properly to affect his hearers, that he would overset the best argumentation in the world, and win people over to his side, often against their own convictions, by making ridiculous that truth they were influenced by before, and making some men to be afraid and ashamed of being thought within the meaning of some bitter expression of his, or within the laugh that generaUy went through the town at any memorable stroke of his wit.\" A Farcical Illustration. \u2014 Pulteney's speech against Walpole's Excise BiU gives us an example of his humour. \" I must say,\" he re marked, \" that the honourable gentleman has been of late mighty bountiful and liberal in his offers to the public. He has been so gracious as to ask us, ' WiU you have a land tax of two shiUings in the pound p a land tax of one shilling in the pound ? or wUl you have no land tax at aU ? Will you have your debts paid ? Will you have them soon paid ? Tell me but what you want, let me but know how you can be made easy, and it shall be done for you.' These are most generous offers ; but there is something so very extraordinary, so farcical in them, that reaUy I can hardly mention them without laughing. It puts me in mind of the story of Sir Epicure Mammon in tho ' Alehymist.' He was gulled of his money by fine pro mises ; he was promised the philosopher's stone, by which he was to get mountains of gold and everything else he could desire ; but aU ended at last in some little thing for curing the itch.\" A Horatian Bet. \u2014 On February 11th, 1741, Sandys informed Walpole in the House of Commons that he should, on the following Friday, bring an accusation of several articles against him. The minister, who received the intimation with great dignity and composure, imme diately rose, thanked him for his notice, and, after requesting a candid and impartial hearing, declared that he would not fail to attend the House, as he was not conscious of any crime to deserve accusation. He laid his hand on his breast, and said, with some emotion \u2014 \" Nil conscire sibi, nulli pallescere cnlp\u00e6.\" Pulteney observed that the right honourable gentleman's logic and Latin were equally inaccurate, and declared he had misquoted Horace, who had i 2"], [136, "116 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. written nulld pallescere culpd. The minister defended his quotation, and, Pulteney repeating his assertion, he offered a wager of a guinea. Pulteney accepted the chaUenge, and referred the decision of the dispute to the minister's friend, Nicholas Hardinge, clerk of the House, a man distinguished for classical erudition. Hardinge decided against Walpole ; the guinea was immediately thrown to Pulteney, who caught it, and holding it up to the House exclaimed, \"It is the only money I have received from the Treasury for many years, and it shaU be the last.\"\u2014 Coxe's \" Life of Walpole.\" The identical guinea may now be seen in the Medal Room of the British Museum, with the following memorandum in the handwriting of Pulteney : \u2014 \" This guinea I desire may be kept as an heir-loom. It was won of Sir Robert Walpole in the House of Commons, he asserting the verse in Horace to be nulli pallescere culp\u00e6, whereas I laid the wager of a guinea that it was nulld pallescere culpd. He sent for the book, and, being convinced that he had lost, gave me this guinea. I told him I could take the money without any blush on my side, but believed it was the only money he ever gave in the House, where the giver and receiver ought not equally to blush. This guinea, I hope, wiU prove to my posterity the use of knowing Latin, and encourage them in their learning.\" Keyhole Tactics. \u2014 On the 21st January, 1742 (writes Coxe), Pul teney made the celebrated motion for referring to a secret committtee the papers relating to the war, which had been already presented to the House. As this motion involved in it numerous charges against the conduct of the war, stated the necessity of a parliamentary inquiry, and brought on per sonal invectives against the minister, Sir Robert Walpole took a consider able share in the debate, and was roused to the utmost exertions. The motion was negatived by a majority of only three, in the fuUest house known for many years, for 503 members voted. The efforts were so great on both sides that numbers were brought in from the chamber of sickness. Several voted in that condition on the side of opposition ; but some who intended to have supported the minister were prevented from appearing at the division. They had been placed in an adjoining apartment, belong ing to Lord Walpole as auditor of the Exchequer, which communicated with the house. The adversaries, aware of this fact, filled the keyhole of the door with dirt and sand, which prevented their admission into the house tiU the division was over. On this occasion, as General ChurchiU was sitting next to the Prince of Wales, who was in the House of Commons to hear the debate, a member was brought in who had lost the use of his limbs. \" So,\" says the prince, \" I see you briug in the lame, the halt, and the blind.\" \" Tes,\" replied the general, \" the lame on our side, and the blind on yours.\" Disparaging the Peers.\u2014 \" When I have tumed out Sir Robert Walpole,\" remarked Pulteney on one occasion, \" I will retire into that hospital for invalids, the House of Peers.\" He afterwards entered the \" hospital \" as Earl of Bath. Turning the Key on Him.\u2014 For his earldom (observes Ewald) Pulteney had but to thank his old enemy. Walpole had prompted the"], [137, "HENRY PELHAM. 117 King to offer the leader of the Opposition a coronet, and Pulteney had succumbed to the proposal. Soon after his refusal of office, however, he wished to decline the honour, but Walpole, weU aware how public opinion would view the matter, advised the King to insist upon its original acceptance. \" I remember,\" writes Horace Walpole, \" my father's action and words when he returned from court and told me what he had done \u2014 ' I have turned the key of the closet on him ! ' making that motion with his hand.\" It is said that when Pulteney received the patent of his creation as Earl of Bath he flung the parchment down and trampled upon it. Insignificant Men.\u2014 By the faU of Walpole, Lord Bath enjoyed for some days a kind of sovereign power. But he ruined his character, and, from a most glorious eminence, sank down to a degree of contempt. The first time Sir Robert (who was now Earl of Orford) met him in tho House of Lords, he threw out this reproach : \" My Lord Bath, you and I are now two as insignificant men as any in England.\" \u2014 Dr. King's \" Anecdotes.\" Party Relations. \u2014 On the resignation of Sir Robert Walpole in 1742, the formation of an administration was, at his suggestion, offered to Pulteney, on condition that no prosecution should be instituted against the late minister. To this condition Pulteney declined to agree, saying, \" Even should my inclination induce me to accede to these terms, yet it might not be in my power to fulfil my engagement, the heads of parties being like the heads of snakes, which are carried on by their tails.\" HENRY PELHAM. (1696\u20141754.) His Intrepidity. \u2014 In the debates on the Excise Bill, in March, 1733, Pelham warmly supported that measure, in defiance of party and popular clamour. During this period of agitation he not only defended tho Minister (Walpole) in Parliament, but on one occasion evinced his personal attachment by an act of great intrepidity. After the last debate on tho bill, as Sir Robert Walpole was passing through the lobby of the House of Commons, accompanied by Mr. Pelham, he was surrounded by a clamorous mob, not of rabble, but of weU-dressed persons. When the two friends had nearly reached the steps leading to Alice's coffee-house, some individuals seized Sir Robert's cloak, and, as the collar was tightly fastened, nearly strangled him. At this moment of danger Mr. Pelham attacked the assailants, pushed Sir Robert into the passage leading to the coffee -house, and, drawing his sword, stationed himself at the entrance, exclaiming in a firm and determined tone, \" Now, gentlemen, who wiU be tho first to faU ? \" This spirited defiance overawed the assaUants, who quietly dispersed. \u2014 Coxe's \" Pelham Administration.\" The archdeacon adds in a foot-note that the above is a correct version of the occurrence, which was inaccurately given in his \" Memoirs of Sir Robert Walpole.\" A Posthumous Malediction. \u2014 The principal article of the Ways and Means in 1752 was the land tax, which the Minister (Mr. Pelham)"], [138, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 118 entertained hopes of reducing to the ordinary rate of two shillings in the pound. He discovered, however, that this reduction could not be effected without trenching on the sinking fund, and thus depreciating the public securities, and therefore he determined to continue the tax at three shillings. This resolution was resisted by some violent members, whom Lord Orford sarcasticaUy terms \" the sad refuse of aU the last Opposi tion,\" who contended that the land was already too much burdened to admit of the continuance of a tax at three shiUings. Mr. Pelham and his adherents, in reply, aUuded to the great rise in the value of land, which, they said, rendered, reduction unnecessary. The arguments and influence of the Minister prevailed, and the resolution was carried in the committee by 176 against 50. On the report the opposition was stiU more feeble y and Mr. Sydenham concluded a speech which closed the discussion, by a ludicrous parody of the weU-known epitaph on Sir John Vanbragh, which he applied to Mr. Pelham \u2014 Lie heavy on him, land, for he Laid many a heavy load on thee.\" The resolution was finally adopted by a majority of 58 against 19.\u2014 Ibid. THE FIRST DUKE OF NEWCASTLE. (1693\u20141768.) The Duke and the Leadership of the Commons. \u2014 The Duke became First Lord of the Treasury on the death of his brother, Henry Pelham, in 1754. He had some difficulty in finding a leader of the House of Commons, and opened negotiations with Henry Fox, afterwards Lord HoUand. Macaulay writes : \" The proposition which he made was that Fox should be Secretary of State, with the lead of the House of Commons; that the disposal of the secret service money \u2014 or, in plain words, the business of buying members of Parliament \u2014 should be left to the First Lord of the Treasury ; but that Fox should be exactly informed of the way in which this fund was employed. To these conditions Fox assented. But the next day everything was in confusion. Newcastle had changed his mind. The conversation which took place between Fox and the duke is one of the most curious in English history. ' My brother,' said Newcastle, ' when he was at the Treasury, never told anybody what he did with the secret service money. No more wiU I.' The answer was obvious. Pelham had been not only First Lord of the Treasury, but also manager of the House of Commons ; and it was therefore unnecessary for him to confide to any other person his dealings with the members of that House. ' But how, said Fox, ' can I lead in the Commons without information on this head ? How can I talk to gentlemen when I do not know which of them have received gratifications and which have not ? And who,' he continued, ' is to have the disposal of places ?' ' I myself,' said the duke. ' How then am I to manage the House of Commons ? ' ' Oh, let the members of the House of Commons come to me!' Fox then mentioned the general election which was approaching, and asked how the ministerial boroughs were to be filled up. ' Do not trouble yourself,' said Newcastle ; ' that is."], [139, "THE EARL OF HARDWICKE. 119 all settled.' This was too much for human nature to bear. Fox refused to accept the Secretaryship of State on such terms ; and the duke confided the management of the House of Commons to a dull, harmless man, whose name is almost forgotten in our time, Sir Thomas Robinson. 'Sir Thomas Robinson lead us ! ' said Pitt to Fox. ' The duke might as well send his jack-boot to lead us.'\" A Living Caricature. \u2014 There is scarcely any public man in our history of whose manners and conversation so many particulars have been preserved. Single stories may be unfounded or exaggerated. But aU the stories about him, whether told by people who were perpetuaUy seeing him in Parliament and attending- his levee in Lincoln's Inn-fields, or by Grub-street writers who never had more than a glimpse of his star through the windows of his gUded coach, are of the same character. Horace Walpole and SmoUett differed in then- tastes and opinions as much as two human beings could differ. They kept quite different society. Walpole played at cards with countesses, and corresponded with ambas sadors. Smollett passed his life surrounded by printers' devils and famished scribblers. Tet Walpole's duke and SmoUctt's duke are as like as if they were both from one hand. Smollett's Newcastle runs out of his dressing-room with his face covered with soapsuds to embrace the Moorish envoy. Walpole's Newcastle pushes his way into the Duke of Grafton's sick room to kiss the old nobleman's plasters. No man was so unmercifuUy satirised. But in truth he was himself a satire ready made. AU that the art of the satirist does for other men, nature had done for him. Whatever was absurd about him stood out with grotesque prominence from the rest of the character. He was a living, moving, talking carica ture. His gait was a shuffling trot ; his utterance a rapid stutter ; he was always in a hurry ; he was never in time ; he abounded in fulsome caresses and in hysterical tears. His oratory resembled that of Justice ShaUow. It was nonsense effervescent with animal spirits and impertinence. Of his ignorance many anecdotes remain, some well authenticated, some probably invented at coffee-houses, but aU exquisitely characteristic. \" Oh \u2014 yes \u2014 yes \u2014 to be sure \u2014 Annapolis must be defended \u2014 troops must be sent to AnnapoUs \u2014 Pray where is Annapolis ? \" \" Cape Breton an island ! wonderful ! \u2014 show it me on the map. So it is, sure enough. My dear sir, you always bring us good news. I must go and teU the King that Cape Breton is an island.\" And this man was, during nearly thirty years, Secretary of State, and, during near ten years, First Lord of tho Treasury! \u2014 Macaulay on Horace Walpole. Somebody said t'other day, \"Tet sure the Duke of Newcastle does not want parts.\" \"No,\" repUed Lord Talbot, \" for he has done without them for forty years.\" \u2014 Walpole's Letters to Mann. THE EARL OF HARDWICKE. (1690\u20141764.) A Distinguished Judge. \u2014 Sir Philip Torke, who has previously been referred to as Attorney-General in Sir Robert Walpole's Adminis tration, was made Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in 1733, and"], [140, "120 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. created a peer by the title of Baron Hardwicke. Being afterwards elevated to the woolsack, he remained Lord ChanceUor for twenty years, and he is distinguished as never having had a decision reversed, and only three even appealed against. Very Peremptory. \u2014 On the day, writes CampbeU, that Lord Talbot died (Feb. 14th, 1737), the great seal was delivered up by his executors into the hands of George II. Lord Hardwicke was now regarded as decidedly the most useful man to be introduced into the Cabinet, and to preside on the woolsack as Chancellor. But, there being some difficulty as to the accompanying arrangements, the great seal remained for a whole week in the personal custody of the King. Meanwhile, as Parlia ment was sitting, and there was no Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, it was necessary to provide a Speaker for the House of Lords, and the great seal, whUe in the King's possession, was (somewhat irregularly) put to a commission authorising Lord Hardwicke to act in that capacity. He accordingly did act for several days as Speaker, without being ChanceUor. During this interval it is related that Walpole, resisting some of Hard wicke's demands, said to him by way of threat, \" I must offer the seals to Fazakerly ! \" \" Fazakerly ! \" exclaimed Hardwicke, \" impossible ! he is certainly a Tory \u2014 perhaps a Jacobite ! \" \" It's aU very true,\" coolly replied Sir Robert, taking out his watch; \" but if by one o'clock you do not accept my offer, Fazakerly, by two, becomes Lord Keeper, and one of the stanchest Whigs in all England.\" The bargain was immediately closed, and Lord Hardwicke was contented with the promise that the next Tellership should be bestowed upon his son. Titles and Trappings. \u2014 The Earl of Hardwicke had been so long known and spoken of as Lord ChanceUor, that many of his friends even had forgotten his ordinary title. Upon his first appearance at the royal levee after his resignation (1756) he was announced as the Earl of Hardwicke, but the King, with whom he had been much in favour, not recognising the title, merely replied by his usual cold question, \" How long has his lordship been in town ? \" When ho advanced, the alteration in his appearance caused by the absence of tho wig and robes completed the delusion ; the Earl left the presence-chamber without being recognised by the master whom he had served so long. \u2014 Cooke's \" History of Party.\" THE EARL OF BUTE, (1713\u20141792.) An Unpopular Minister.\u2014 The First Lord of the Treasury (says Macaulay) was detested by many as a Tory, by many as a favourite, and by many as a Scot. He could hardly walk the streets in safety without disguising himself. A gentleman who died not many years ago used to say that he once recognised the favourite earl in the piazza of Covent Garden, muffled in a large coat, and with a hat and wig drawn down over his brows. His lordship's established type with the mob was a jackboot \u2014 a wretched pun on his Christian name and title. A jackboot, generaUy"], [141, "WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM. 121 accompanied by a petticoat, was sometimes fastened on a gallows, and sometimes committed to the flames. \" Blood Full of Prerogative.'9\u2014 In a conversation with Boswell in 1775, Dr. Johnson thus summed up the character of the Earl of Bute, who, when Prime Minister in 1762, had put Johnson on the pension Ust : \" Our several ministers in this reign have outbid each other in con cessions to the people. Lord Bute, though a very honourable man \u2014 a man who meant weU, a man who had his blood full of prerogative \u2014 was a theoretical statesman, a book-minister, and thought the country could be governed by the influence of the Crown alone.\" He went on to say, \" There is now no prime minister : there is only an agent for government in the House of Commons. We are governed by the Cabinet, but there is no one head there since Sir Robert Walpole's time.\" A Minute Gun Speech. \u2014 Lord Bute delivered a speech in favour of the Cider BiU in the House of Lords, on the 28th March, 1763, in reply to Lord Hardwicke, who opposed the measure. His deUvery on this occasion was so particularly slow and solemn that Charles Townshend, standing on the steps of the throne, caUed out, in an audible whisper, \" Minute guns ! \" \" These,\" says Lord CampbeU, \" might be considered as announcing the funeral of Lord Bute's Ministry.\" WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM. (1708\u20141778.) The Terrible Cornet. \u2014 The antagonist whom WiUiam Pitt first encountered, on his entering into public life (after having served in the Blues), was the veteran Walpole, who instinctively dreaded him the moment he heard his voice, and exclaimed, \" We must muzzle that terrible cornet of horse ! \" \u2014 Lord Brougham's \" Statesmen.\" Chatham's Personal Characteristics. \u2014 Those who saw him in his decay (writes Macaulay) \u2014 when his health was broken, when his mind was untuned, when he had been removed from that stormy assembly of which he thoroughly knew the temper, and over which he possessed un bounded influence, to a smaU, a torpid, and an unfriendly audience \u2014 say that his speaking was then, for the most part, a low, monotonous mutter ing, audible only to those who sat close to him ; that when violently excited he sometimes raised his voice for a few minutes, but that it soon sank again into an uninteUigible murmur. Such was the Earl of Chatham; but such was not WiUiam Pitt. His figure, when he first appeared in Parliament, was strikingly graceful and commanding, his features high and noble, his eye full of fire. His voice, even when it sank to a whisper, was heard to the remotest benches ; and when he strained it to its full extent, the sound rose like the sweU of an organ of a great cathedral, shook the house with its peal, and was heard through lobbies and down staircases to the Court of Requests and the precincts of Westminster HaU. He cultivated all these eminent advantages with tho most assiduous care. His action is described by a very malignant observer as equal to that of Garrick. His play of countenance was"], [142, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 122 wonderful ; he frequently disconcerted a hostUe orator by a single glance of indignation or scorn. Every tone, from the impassioned cry to the thrUling aside, was perfectly at his command. It is by no means impro bable that the pains which he took to improve his great personal advan tages had, in some respects, a prejudicial operation, and tended to nourish in him that passion for theatrical effect which was one of the most con spicuous blemishes in his character. His Imposing Manner. \u2014 In his earlier time, his whole manner is represented as having been beyond conception animated and imposing. Indeed, the things which he effected principaUyby means of it, or at least which nothing but a most striking and commanding tone could have made it possible to attempt, almost exceed belief. Some of these saUies are, indeed, examples of that approach made to the ludicrous by the sublime which has been charged upon him as a prevailing fault. It is related that once, in the House of Commons, he began a speech with the words, \" Sugar, Mr. Speaker,\" \u2014 and then, observing a smile to pervade the audience, he paused, looked fiercely around, and with a loud voice, rising in its notes and swelling into vehement anger, he is said to have pro nounced again the word \" Sugar ! \" three times ; and having thus quoUed the House, and extinguished every appearance of levity or laughter, turned round and disdainfuUy asked, \" Who wiU laugh at sugar now ? \"* \u2014 Brougham's \" Statesmen.\" Fixing a Charge. \u2014 On one occasion Chatham said, \" Who are the evil advisers of his Majesty ? I would say to them, Is it you ? Is it you ? Is it you ? \" (pointing to the ministers, until ho came near Lord Mansfield). There were several lords around him, and Lord Chatham said, \" My lords, please to take your seats.\" When they had sat down, he pointed to Lord Mansfield, and said, \" Is it you ? Methinks Felix trembles.\" Compelling' a Retractation. \u2014 Charles Butler relates that Mr. Moreton, the Chief Justice of Chester, happened to say in the House, \" King, Lords, and Commons, or (directing his eye towards Pitt), as that right honourable member would caU them, Commons, Lords, and King.\" Pitt arose with great deliberation, and called to order. \" I have,\" he said, \" heard frequently in this House doctrines which have surprised me; but now my blood runs cold. I desire the words of the honourable member may be taken down.\" The clerks of the House wrote the words. \" Bring them to me,\" said Pitt, in his loudest voice. By this time Mr. Moreton was frightened out of his senses. \" Sir,\" he said, addressing himself to the Speaker, \" I am sorry to have given any offence to the right honour able member or to the House. I meant nothing. King, Lords, and Commons \u2014 Lords, King, and Commons \u2014 Commons, Lords, and King; tria juncta in uno. I meant nothing; indeed, I meant nothing.\" \"I don't wish to push the matter further,\" said Pitt. \" The moment a man * Mr. Disraeli wrote, in his \" Life of Bentinck :\" \" Sugar was an article of colonial produce which had been embarrassing, if not fatal, to many govern ments.

When the Due do Choiseul informed me of the awe with which he was struck by you, he said he was not surprised at it \u2014 car le pauvre diable tremblait de pew en partant ; he was so much frightened that he wrote for a passport to return. The Due showed me this request in his own hand \u2014 the Due was with the King, at Marli, when he received it. His reflection upon it was : ' Apparemment, sire, qu'il a deplii, a M. Pitt, qui Vaura fait sauter par les fenetres.' I replied, ' Je n'aurais pas trouvi bon dans ce cas de faire la ineme gambade par maniere de represailles.' \" Peremptory Orders. \u2014 Earl RusseU writes of Pitt : \" He com manded his expeditions against France by placing a sheet of paper over the orders he gave, and leaving at the bottom of the page on which they were written only room for the signatures of the Lords of the Admiralty.\" And again : \" My grandfather, Lord Torrington, told mo that the first William Pitt sent a messenger to the Admiralty that the Channel fleet must sail on the Tuesday following. The Board of Admiralty answered that it was impossible that the fleet could be ready by Tuesday. Mr. Pitt rejoined that in that ease he should recommend to the King to name a new Board of Admiralty. The Channel fleet saUed on the Tuesday.\" His Oratory. \u2014 Macaulay observes, in his essay on Chatham, \" He was no speaker of set speeches. His few prepared discourses were com plete faUures. The elaborate panegyric which he pronounced on General Wolfe was considered as the very worst of aU his performances. ' No man,' says a critic who had often heard him, ' ever knew so little what he was going to say.' Indeed, his facUity amounted to a vice. He was not the master, but the slave of his own speech. So little self-command had he when once he felt the impulse, that he did not like to take part in a debate when his mind was full of an important secret of state. ' I must sit stiU,' he once said to Lord Shelburne on such an occasion ; ' for, when once I am up, everything that is in my mind comes out.' \" \u2014 Lord Brougham remarks, \" He was prolix in the whole texture of his discourse, and he was certainly the first who introduced into our Senate the practice, adopted in the American War by Mr. Burke, and continued by others, of long speeches \u2014 speeches of two and three hours \u2014 by which oratory has gained little, and business less.\" \u2014 Grattan said, \" I heard him several times when I was at the Temple \u2014 on the American War, on the King's speech in 1770, and on the privileges of ParUament . He was very great, and very odd. He spoke in a style of conversation ; not, however, what I expected;"], [144, "124 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. it was not a speech, for he never came with a prepared harangue. His style was not regular oratory, like Cicero or Demosthenes, but it was very fine and very elevated. He appeared more like a grave character advising than mingling in the debate. His gesture was always graceful ; he was an incomparable actor. Had it not been so, it would have appeared ridi culous. His address to the tapestry* and to Lord Effingham's memory required a fine actor, and he was that actor.\" Employment of Indians by Chatham. \u2014 The Earl of Chatham's famous speech against the employment of Indians in the war with the American colonies, was foUowed by his adversaries (soon afterwards, if not at the time) with the retort that he himself had employed Indians in a similar conflict. The following particulars were communicated to Lord Brougham by \" a most accomplished and venerable person, the ornament of a former age,\" and appear in an appendix to the \" Sketches of States men of the Time of George III.\" : \u2014 \" The very same thing had been done in the former war carried on in Canada, by his authority and under his own immediate superintendence ; the French had arrayed a tribe of these savage warriors against us, and we, without scruple, arrayed another against them. This he thought fit to deny in the most positive manner, although the ministers offered to produce documents written by himself that proved it, from among the papers at the Secretary's office. A warm debate ensued, and at length Lord Amherst, the general who commanded our troops in that Canadian war, was so loudly appealed to on aU sides, that it compeUed him to rise, and most unwiUingly (for he greatly respected Lord Chatham) falter out a few words ; enough, however, to acknowledge the fact \u2014 a fact admitted generaUy, and even assumed by the Opposition lords who spoke afterwards They seemed to lay the question quietly by, as far as it concerned Lord Chatham's veracity, and only insisted upon the difference between the two wars \u2014 the one foreign, the other civil; arguing, also, that we might have been under some necessity of using retaUation, since the French certainly first began the practice so justly abhorred. The Annual Register for 1777 states that Mr. Burke took the same course in the House of Commons. Upon hearing what had passed in the House of Lords, Lord Bute exclaimed with astonishment, ' Did Pitt reaUy deny it ? Why, I have letters of his stiU by me, singing lo P\u00e6ans over the advantages we gained through our Indian allies.' Could what he thus said have been untrue, when it was almost a soliloquy spoken rather before than to his wife and daughters, the only persons present ? The letters he mentioned were neither official nor confidential, but such common notes as might pass between him and Lord Chatham while stUl upon a footing of some intimacy. It must be observed that, in 1777, Lord Bute had long withdrawn from all political connections, Uved in great * \" I invoke the genius of the Constitution. From the tapestry that adorns these walls the immortal ancestor of this noble lord frowns with indignation at tbe disgrace of his country.

Lord Chatham said : \" There never was a more odious, a more infamous false hood imposed on a great nation. It degrades the King, it insults the Parliament. His Majesty has been advised to affirm an absolute falsehood. My Lords, I beg your attention, and I hope I shall be understood when I repeat that it is an absolute, a palpable falsehood. The King of Spain disowns the thief, while he leaves him unpunished, and profits by his theft. In vulgar English, he is the receiver of stolen goods, and should be treated accordingly.\" The Dignity of the House of Commons. \u2014 Henry Fox, writing to Lord Hartington on the subject of the Berwick election in 1754, at which Wilkes, although unsuccessful, spent between 3000?. and 4000?., says : \" Mr. Wilkes, a friend it seems of Pitt's, petitioned against the younger Delaval, chose at Berwick, on account of bribery only. The younger Delaval made a speech on his being thus attacked, fuU of wit, humour, and buffoonery, which kept the House in a continued roar of laughter. Mr. Pitt came down from the gaUery and took it up in his highest tone of dignity. He was astonished when he heard what had been the occasion of their mirth. Was the dignity of the House of Commons on so sure foundations that they might venture themselves to shake it ? Had it not, on the contrary, by gradations, been diminishing for years, tiU now we were brought to the very brink of the precipice, where, if ever, a stand must be made ? \" \u2014 Lord Waldegrave's \" Memoirs.\" A Forecast of Reform. \u2014 In a debate ou the right of Parliament to tax the American colonies, in December, 1765, Pitt made the foUowing remarks : \" There is an idea in some that the colonies are virtuaUy repre sented in the House. I woidd fain know by whom an American is represented here. Is he represented by any knight of the shire, in any county in this kingdom P Would to God that respectable representation was augmented to a greater number. Or will you teU me that he is repre sented by any representative of a borough ? \u2014 a borough which, perhaps. its own representatives never saw ? This is what is called the rotten part of the Constitution. It cannot continue a century. If it does not drop, it must be amputated. The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation.\" Stabbing the Constitution. \u2014 In the debate (May 1st, 1770) which arose on Lord Marchmont's famous midnight motion, \" That any inter ference of the Lords respecting the Middlesex election would be uncon stitutional,\" Lord Chatham exclaimed, \" If the Constitution must be wounded, let it not receive its mortal stab at this dark and midnight hour.\" A Confession of Error. \u2014 No one (writes Coxe) can suspect Pitt of paying a tribute of applause to the memory of Walpole from mean and"], [146, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 126 adulatory motives ; yet even he observed, in the House of Commons, that Sir Robert Walpole was a very able minister. Perceiving several members laugh, he added, \" The more I reflect on my conduct the more I blame myself for opposing the Excise BiU;\" and then concluded by saying, with his usual energy, \" Let those who are ashamed to confess their errors laugh out. Can it be deemed adulation to praise a minister who is no more ?\" The whole House seemed abashed, and became silent. The \" Gentle Shepherd.\" \u2014 Dashwood's financial statement (1762) had been confused and absurd beyond belief, and had been received by the House with roars of laughter. He had sense enough to be conscious of his unfitness for the high situation which he held, and exclaimed, in a comical fit of despair, \" What shall I do ? The boys will point at me in the street, and cry, ' There goes the worst ChanceUor of the Exchequer that ever was.'\" George GrenviUe came to the rescue, and spoke strongly on his favourite theme, the profusion with which the late war had been carried on. That profusion, he said, had made taxes necessary. He called on the gentlemen opposite to him to say where they would have a tax laid, and dwelt on this topic with his usual prolixity. \" Let them tell me where,\" he repeated in a monotonous and somewhat fretful tone. \" I say, sir, let them tell me where. I repeat it, sir ; I am entitled to say to them, Tell me where.\" Unluckily for him, Pitt had come down to the house that night, and had been bitterly provoked by the reflections thrown on the war. He revenged himself by murmuring, in a whine resembUng GrenviUe's, a line of a well-known song, \" Gentle shepherd, tell me where.\" \" If,\" cried GrenviUe, \" gentlemen are to be treated in this way \" Pitt, as was his fashion when he meant to mark extreme contempt, rose deliberately, made his bow, and walked out of the house, leaving his brother-in-law in convulsions of rage, and everybody else in convulsions of laughter. It was long before Grenville lost the nickname of the Gentle Shepherd. \u2014 Macaulay's Essay on Chatham. A Clinical Consultation. \u2014 Mr. Pitt's plan when he had the gout was to have no fire in his room, but to load himself with bed-clothes. At his house at Hayes he slept in a long room, at one end of which was his bed, and his lady's at the other. His way was, when he thought tho Duke of Newcastle had faUen into any mistake, to send for him and read him a lecture. The duke was sent for once, and came, when Mr. Pitt was confined to bed by the gout. There was, as usual, no fire in the room ; the day was very chiUy, and the duke, as usual, afraid of catching cold. The duke first sat down on Mrs. Pitt's bed, as the warmest place ; then drew up his legs into it, as he got colder. The lecture, unluckily, con tinuing a considerable time, the duke at length fairly lodged himself under Mrs. Pitt's bed-clothes. A person from whom I had the story suddenly going in saw the two ministers in bed, at the two ends of the room, while Pitt's long nose and black beard, unshaved for some days, added to the grotesque nature of the scene. \u2014 Walpoliana. Youth and Age. \u2014 There is a statement (writes Warburton, in his \" Memoirs of Horace Walpole \") which, having found its way into such an authority as \" Chandler's Debates,\" has been incorporated in works"], [147, "WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM. 127 pretending to historical accuracy. On a debate arising out of the BUI for the Encouragement and Increase of Seamen, in 1740, Pitt is represented as attacking Mr. Horace Walpole (uncle of the more celebrated Horace) for having ventured on a reference to his youth. The fact is that these debates were imaginary, or constructed on a very slight foundation. Dr. Johnson, as is well known, before he had obtained his colossal reputation, drew up fictitious reports of what took place in the House of Commons. Mr. Horace Walpole having in a discussion been severely handled by Pitt, Lyttleton, and the GrenvUles, aU of whom were much his juniors, lamented that though he had been so long in business young men should be found so much better informed in political matters than himself. He added that he had at least one consolation in remembering that his own son, being twenty years of age, must be as much the superior of Pitt, Lyttleton, and the Grenvilles, as they were wiser than himself. Pitt, having his youth thus mercilessly flung in his face, got up in a rage, com mencing, \" With the greatest reverence to the grey hairs of the gentle man \" but was stopped by Mr. Walpole puUing off his wig, and dis closing a grizzled poU beneath. This excited very general laughter, in which Pitt joined with such heartiness as quite to forget his anger. Professional Knowledge versus Eloquence. \u2014 Malone, the editor of Shakspeare, who was in the habit of noting anecdotes he heard in society, is the authority for the foUowing : On one occasion Pitt made a very long and able speech in the Privy CouncU relative to some naval matter. Everyone present was struck by the force of his eloquence. Lord Anson, who was no orator, being then at the head of the Admiralty, and differing entirely in opinion from Mr. Pitt, got up, and only said these words : \" My Lords, Mr. Secretary is very eloquent, and has stated his own opinion very plausibly. I am no orator, and aU I shaU say is that he knows nothing at aU of what he has been talking about.\" This short reply, together with the confidence the Council had in Lord Anson's professional skiU, had such an effect on every one present that they immediately determined against Mr. Pitt's proposition. Effect of his Elevation to the Peerage. \u2014 Those (says Macaulay) who had most loved and honoured the great Commoner were loudest in invective against the new-made Lord. London had hitherto been true to him through every vicissitude. When the citizens learned that he had been sent for from Somersetshire, that he had been closeted with the King at Richmond, and that he was to be First Minister, they had been in transports of joy. Preparations were made for a grand entertainment and for a general Ulumination. The lamps had actually been placed round the Monument, when the Gazette annoimced that the object of aU this enthusiasm was an Earl. Instantly the feast was countermanded, The lamps were taken down. The newspapers raised the roar of obloquy. Pamphlets, made up of calumny and seurriUty, fiUed the shops of all the bookseUers. . . It was now the fashion to compare the two WiUiams, William Pulteney and WUUam Pitt. Both, it was said, had, by eloquence and simulated patriotism, acquired a great ascendancy in the House of Commons and in the country. Both had been entrusted with"], [148, "128 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the office of reforming the Government. Both had, when at the height of power and popularity, been seduced by the splendour of the coronet. Both had been made earls, and both had at once become objects of aversion and scorn to the nation which a few hours before had regarded them with affection and veneration. The clamour against Pitt appears to have had a serious effect on the foreign relations of the country. His name had tiU now acted like a speU at VersaiUes and Saint Ildefonso. English travellers on the Continent had remarked that nothing more was necessary to silence a whole room full of boasting Frenchmen than to drop a hint of the probability that Mr. Pitt would return to. power. In au instant there was deep sUenee : aU shoulders rose, and all faces were lengthened. Now, unhappUy, every foreign court, in learning that he was recaUed to office, learned also that he no longer possessed the hearts of his countrymen. Ceasing to be loved at home, he ceased to be feared abroad. The name of Pitt had been a charmed name. Our envoys tried in vain to conjure with the name of Chatham. Insulting the Lion. \u2014 In December, 1777, an adjournment of the House for six weeks was proposed by the Ministry, Lord North promising that after the holidays he would lay before it a plan for treating with the Americans. Burke and Fox abused Lord North, and told him the Ministers thought of nothing but keeping their places ; and they argued strongly against adjourning for more than the Christmas days in times of such imminent danger. The Duke of Richmond and Lord Chatham urged the same plea, but Lord Suffolk (writes Horace Walpole) \" had the indecency to teU Lord Chatham that he only wanted the House to sit because he was sure he would be aUowed to give his advice nowhere else. This brutaUty from so stupid a creature to an old man who had made so great a figure was severely treated in the public papers.\" The Death of Chatham. \u2014 The following account of this event is abridged from Earl RusseU's \" Life of Fox : \" \u2014 The Duke of Richmond gave notice that on the 7th of April, 1778, he would move an address to the King, entreating him to withdraw his fleets and armies from America, and make peace with the revolted colonies. Lord Chatham was at the time at Hayes, slowly recovering from a fit of the gout ; but tho moment he heard of the intended address, he resolved to attend the House of Lords, and neither his fanidy nor his friends could induce him to desist from his purpose. On the 7th of April, accordingly, he came into tho House with feeble steps, leaning with one arm on his son, WUliam Pitt, and with the other on his son-in-law, Lord Mahon. After the Duke of Richmond had spoken, Lord Chatham rose. \" The earl spoke,\" writes Lord Camden to the Duke of Grafton, \" but was not like himself ; his speech faltered, his sentences broken, and his mind not master of itself. His words were shreds of unconnected eloquence, and flashes of the same fire which he, Prometheus like, had stolen from heaven, and were then returning to the place from whence they were taken. Tour grace sees even I, who am a mere prose man, am tempted to be poetical while I am discoursing of this extraordinary man's genius.\" The Duke of Richmond answered Lord Chatham. He rose to reply, but nature was exhausted;"], [149, "WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM. 129 \" he fell back,\" says Lord Camden, \"upon his seat, and was to aU appear ance in the agonies of death. This threw the whole House into confusion ; every person was upon his legs in a moment, hurrying from one place to another, some sending for assistance, others producing salts, and others reviving spirits. Many crowding about the earl to observe his coun tenance ; all affected ; most part really concerned ; and even those who might have felt a real pleasure at the accident, yet put on the appearance of distress.\" Lord Chatham was carried into the Prince's chamber, and laid upon the table, supported by pUlows. After a few days he recovered sufficiently to be removed to Hayes. But the attack was fatal. He expired at Hayes on the 11th of May foUowing. Examples of his Eloquence. \u2014 Lord Brougham gives the foUow ing, among other examples of Chatham's oratory, in his \" Historical Sketches of Statesmen \" : \u2014 \" All our knowledge of the peculiar nature of his oratory rests upon a few scattered fragments. There is, however, some security for our deducing from these a correct notion of it, because they certainly, accord ing to all accounts, were the portions of his discourse which produced the most extraordinary effect, on which its fame rests, and by which its quality is to be ascertained. \" His remark ou confidence, when it was asked by the Ministry of 1776. for whom he had some forbearance rather than any great respect, is weU known. He said their characters were fair enough, and he was always glad to see such persons engaged in the pubUc service ; but, turning to them with a smile, very courteous but not very respectful, he said, ' Confide in you ? Oh, no ; you must pardon me, gentlemen. Youth is the season of credulity ; confidence is a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom ! ' \" Some one, having spoken of the obstinacy of America, said ' that she was almost in open rebeUion.' Mr. Pitt exclaimed, ' I rejoice that America has resisted. Three millions of people, so dead to aU the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to let themselves be made slaves, would have been fit instruments to make slaves of aU the rest ! '* Then, speaking of the attempt to keep her down \u2014 ' In a just cause of quarrel you may crush America to atoms ; but in this crying injustice ' (Stamp Act) ' I am one who will lift up my hands against it. In such a cause even your success would be hazardous. America, if she fell, would faU like the strong man ; she would embrace the pillars of the State, and puU down the constitution along with her. Is this your boasted peace \u2014 to sheathe the sword, not in its scabbard, but in the bowels of your countrymen ? ' \" ' Those iron barons (for so I may caU them when compared with the silken barons of modern days) were the guardians of the people ; and three words of their barbarous Latin, nullus liber homo, are worth aU the * He added (remarks Russell), in allusion to a previous quotation of prece dents, \" I come not here armed at all points with law cases and Acts of Parliament, with the Statute-books dnnhled down in dog's -ears, to defend the cause of liberty.\" K K"], [150, "130 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. classics. Tet their virtues were never tried in a question so important as this ' (the pretension of privilege in the House of Commons). 'A breach is made in the constitution \u2014 the battlements are dismantled \u2014 the citadel is open to the first invader \u2014 the waUs totter \u2014 the place is no longer tenable. What, then, remains for us but to stand foremost in the breach, to repair it, or to perish in it ? Unlimited power corrupts the possessor ; and this I know, that where law ends, there tyranny begins.' \" Again, he said : 'Magna Charta \u2014 the Petition of Right \u2014 the Bill of Rights \u2014 form the Bible of the English constitution. Had some of the King's unhappy predecessors trusted less to the commentary of their advisers, and been better read in the text itself, the glorious Revolution might have remained only possible in theory, and their fate would not now have stood upon record, a formidable example to aU their successors.' \" In 1775 he made a most brilUant speech on the war. Speaking of General Gage's inactivity, he said it could not be blamed ; it was inevitable. ' But what a miserable condition,' he exclaimed, ' is ours, where disgrace is prudence, and where it is necessary to be contemptible ! Tou must repeal these Acts ' (he said, aUuding to the Boston Ports and Massachusetts Bay Bills), ' and you will repeal them. I pledge myself for it, that you will repeal them. I stake my reputation on it. I wUl consent to be taken for an idiot if they are not finally repealed.' Every one knows how true this prophecy proved. The concluding sentence of the speech has been often cited : ' If the Ministers persevere in misleading the King, I wUl not say that they can alienate the affections of his subjects from his crown ; but I wiU affirm that they wUl make the crown not worth his wearing. I wiU not say that the King is betrayed; but I wiU pronounce that the kingdom is undone.' \" Again, in 1777, after describing the cause of the war and ' the traffic and barter driven with every little pitiful German prince that seUs his subjects to the shambles of a foreign country,' he adds, ' The mercenary aid on which you rely irritates to an incurable resentment the minds of your enemies, whom you overrun with the sordid sons of rapine and of plunder, devoting them and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty. If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, whUe a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my arms \u2014 never! never ! never ! ' \" There are other celebrated passages of his speeches in aU men's mouths. His indignant and contemptuous answer to the Minister's boast of driving the Americans before the army \u2014 ' I might as weU think of driving them before me with this crutch ! ' \u2014 is well known. Perhaps the finest of them all is his allusion to the maxim of English law, that every man's house is his castle. ' The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail \u2014 its roof may shaKe \u2014 the wind may blow through it \u2014 the storm may enter \u2014 the rain may enter \u2014 but the King of England cannot enter ! \u2014 aU his force dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!\"9"], [151, "THE EARL OF MANSFIELD. 131 THE EARL OF MANSFIELD. (1705\u20141793.) Secret of Success in Parliament. \u2014 Lord Chesterfield, in one of his letters to his son, thus wrote of Mansfield, then Mr. Murray, SoUcitor- Geueral : \" Tour fate depends upon your success as a speaker, and take my word for it that success turns more upon manner than matter. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Murray are, beyond comparison, the best speakers. Why ? Only because they are the best orators. They alone can inflame or cpiiet the House ; they alone are attended to in that numerous and noisy assembly, that you might hear a pin fall while either of them is speaking. Is it that their matter is better, or their arguments stronger, than other people's ? Does the House expect extraordinary information from them ? Not in the least ; but the House expects pleasure from them, and therefore attends; finds it, and therefore approves.\" . Pitt's Antagonism. \u2014 Throughout the whole course of Murray's career in the House of Commons, he was the invariable object of Pitt's unsparing invective. \" Pitt,\" says Lord Waldegrave, \" undertook the difficult task of silencing Murray, the Attorney-General, the ablest man, as weU as the ablest debater, in the House of Commons.\" DissimUarity of character, no less than of political principles, added bitterness tu the eloquence of Pitt. Despising the policy and distrusting the principles of Murray, he eagerly availed himself of every occasion which presented itself of expressing his indignant sarcasms. Brilliant and argumentative as was the oratory of Murray, he did not always possess the nerve necessary to ward off or to return assaults so terrible as these, and for the most part he bore, in agitated silence, the attacks to which he did not venture to make any reply. In a letter from Lord Holland, describing a speech just given, the writer says, \" In both Mr. Pitt's speeches every word was Murray, yet so managed that neither he nor anybody else could or did take public notice of it, or in any degree reprehend him. I sat near Murray, who suffered for an hour.\" \u2014 Roscoe's \" British Lawyers.\" Mansfield's Powers in Debate. \u2014 One of the first occasions (says Roseoe) on which Lord Mansfield distinguished himself in the House of Lords, after his elevation to the peerage, was in the debate on the BiU for the Amendment of the Habeas Corpus Act. A gentleman having been impressed and confined in the Savoy, his friends applied for a writ of habeas corpus ; but, as the imprisonment was not for any criminal matter, it was found that the statute of 31 Car. IL, c. 2, did not apply. This palpable deficiency in the law attracted the attention of some friends to liberty, who introduced a bill into the House of Commons for the purpose of extending the provisions of the statute of Charles II. to cases where the imprisonment was not upon any criminal charge. The biU passed the Lower House, but was violently opposed in the House of Lords by Lord Mansfield and Lord Hardwicke. The King himself talked openly against tho bill at his levee, and the supporters of it were understood to incur his displeasure. Such was the earnestness and so great tho ingenuity and eloquence which Lord Mansfield exerted on the occasion, that the biU wta k 2"], [152, "132 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. ultimately rejected. \" The fate of the biU,\" says Horace Walpole, \"which could not be procured by the sanction of the judges, Lord Mansfield was forced to take upon himself. He spoke for two hours and a half; his voice and manner, composed of harmonious solemnity, were the least graces of his speech. I am not averse to own that I never heard so much argument, so much sense, so much oratory united. His deviations into the abstruse minuti\u00e6 of the law served but as a f oU to the luminous parts of the oration. Perhaps it was the only speech which, in my time at least, had real effect \u2014 that is, convinced many persons; nor did I ever know how true a votary I was to liberty, till I found that I was not one of tho number staggered by that speech.\" LORD NORTH. (1732\u20141792.) A Pattern of Good Humour. \u2014 A few only of his sayings have reached us, and those, as might be expected, are rather things which he had chanced to coat over with some sarcasm or epigram that tended to preserve them ; they consequently are far from giving an idea of his habitual pleasantly, and the gaiety of thought which generaUy pervaded his speeches. Thus, when a vehement deelaiiner, caUing aloud for his head, turned round and perceived his victim unconsciously indulging in a soft slumber, and, becoming still more exasperated, denounced the Minister as capable of sleeping while he ruined his country, the latter ouly complained how cruel it was to be denied a solace which other criminals so often enjoyed \u2014 that of having a night's rest before their fate. When surprised in a like indulgence during the performance of a very inferior artist, who, however, showed equal indignation at so Ul-timed a recreation, he contented himself with observing how hard it was that he should be grudged so very natural a release from considerable suffering ; but, as if recoUecting himself, added that it was somewhat unjust in the gentleman to complain of him for taking the remedy which he had himself been considerate enough to administer. The same good humour and droUery quitted him not when in opposition. Every one has heard of the speech which, if it had failed to injure the objects of He attack, was very effectual in fixing a name on its honest and much respected author. Or Mr. Martin's proposal to have a starling placed near the chair and taught to repeat the cry of \" Infamous coalition ! \" Lord North cooUy suggested that, as long as the worthy member was preserved to them, it would be a needless waste of the public money, since the starling might well perform his office by deputy.*\u2014 .Brour/Ziani's \" Statesmen.\" Earl RusseU gives the foUowing more concisely : \" North's good humour and readiness were of admirable service to him when the invectives of his opponents would have discomfited a more serious Minister. He often indulged in real or seeming slumber; an opponent in the midst of an invective exclaimed, ' Even now, in the midst of these perils, the noble lord is asleep.' ' I * \" I submit that this House is in possession of a Martin, who will serve the purpose quite as well.\" \u2014 RusseU's \" Life of Fox.\""], [153, "LORD NORTH. 133 wish to God I was,' rejoined Lord North. Alderman Sawbridge, having accompanied the presentation of a petition from BiUingsgate with accusa tions of more than ordinary virulence, Lord North began his reply in the foUowing words : ' I cannot deny that the hon. alderman speaks not only the sentiments, but the very language of his constituents.' \" Extracting a Compliment.\u2014 Butler relates that the assault of Mr. Adam on Mr. Fox, and of Colonel Fullarton ou Lord Shelburne, had once put the House into the worst possible humour, and there was more \u2022or less savageness in everything that was said. Lord North deprecated the too great readiness to take offence which then seemed to possess the House. \" One member,\" he said, \" who spoke of me, caUed me ' that thing caUed a Minister.' To be sure,\" he said, patting his large form, \" I am a thing ; the member, therefore, when he called me a thing said what was true, and I could not be angry with him. But when he added, ' that thing caUed a Minister,' he called me that thing which of aU things he himself wished most to be, and therefore I took it as a compliment.\" Sleeping through the Centuries. \u2014 On an occasion when Colonel Barre brought forward a motion on the British navy, Lord North said to a friend of his who was sitting next him in the House, \" We shall have a tedious speech from Barre to-night. I dare say he'll give us our naval history from the beginning, not forgetting Sir Francis Drake and tho Armada. All this is nothing to me, so let me sleep on, and wake me when we come near our own times.\" His friend at length roused him. when Lord North exclaimed, \"Where are we?\" \"At the battle of La Hogue, my lord.\" \" Oh, my dear friend,\" he replied, \" you have woke me a century too soon ! \" \u2014 Harford's \" Recollections of Wilberforce.\" A New Member. \u2014 Once, when speaking in the House. Lord North was interrupted by the barking of a dog which had crept in. He turned round, and archly said, \" Mr. Speaker, I am interrupted by a new member.\" The dog was driven out, but got in again, and recommenced barking, when Lord North, in his dry way, added, \" Spoke once.\" Fretting. \u2014 The Duke of Newcastle (says Horace Walpole) went to Lord North at Bushey Park, to lament the miscarriage at Charleston (during the War of Independence), aud to inquire into his cousin Cliutou's behaviour; but finding Lord North treat the affair with his usual indiffer ence and jollity, took notice of it to him. \"Faith, my lord,\" said Lord North, \"if fretting would make me thin, I would be as sorry as your grace; but since it wUl not have that effect, I bear it as well as I can.\" Impudent Silence. \u2014 Colonel Luttrell moved in the House of Commons, April 12th, 1774, that the sheriffs of Middlesex should be called to answer at the bar for their conduct in summoning Wilkes instead of himself to serve in Parliament. After a long pause, Charles Fox rose and said Colonel Luttrell should not want a second ; aud then poured out a torrent of invective against Lord North for his pusillanimity, and for what he called his impudent and shameless silence. Lord North, with great quickness and humour, replied that he had never before heard of impudent silence; that he had, indeed, seen gentlemen ou their legs whose shameless impudence had shocked all mankind."], [154, "134 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Laughing at the Bankers. \u2014 At the meeting of Parliament, January 13th, 1774, when tho Address was moved in the House of Commons, Mr. Prescott, a very rich banker, complained of the late regu lation of the g'old coin, by which, he said, there was not a banker in England that had not lost \u00a3500. Lord North laughed, and made the House laugh at him, by saying he was glad the loss had fallen on those who were the best able to bear it. \u2014 Walpole's \" George III.\" Complimenting his Adversary. \u2014 In the debate on an address in 1777, Lord George Germain was severely attacked by Fox for his conduct of tho American war, the speaker calling him an ill-omened and inaus picious character. Lord North (writes Walpole) handsomely defended Lord George, and owned he had invited him into the Administration. He said he was glad Fox had abandoned him, an old hulk, to attack a man-of war ; but afterwards he perhaps hurt Lord George as much as Fox bad done, for the latter coming to the Treasury bench, Lord North, who was thought not to love Lord George, said in his hearing, \" Charles, I am glad you did not fall on me to-day, for you was in full feather.\" Good Quarters. \u2014 Horace Walpole gives the following in his \" Journal \" : \u2014 Jan. 27, 1778. Charles Fox, in an admirable speech, attacked Lord North on having called himself an unfortunate Minister, aud proved that all the disgraces had happened by ignorance, blunders, aud misconduct, not by misfortune. Lord North answered with some humour, and, as Fox had accused him of idleness and listening to flatterers, be said he passed a great deal of time in that House, where he could not be idle, and it was plain was not flattered. . . Lord North, being asked, the day before the Parliament met after the holidays, if the army had good quarters at Philadelphia, replied, \" So good that I wish I was to pass the next three months there \" \u2014 meaning, rather than in the House of Commons. North and Parliamentary Reform. \u2014 The prevailing notion in 1780 (writes Earl Russell) was to diminish the representation of the boroughs and increase that of the counties ; or, at all events, to add 100 to the representation of the counties, by way, as it were, of diluting tho noxious ingredients. Lord Chatham highly approved of this remedy ; but Lord North, with characteristic humour, said, \" Some ask, with Lear, for a hundred knights ; and some, with Goneril, for fifty ; but I say, with Regan, what need of one ? \" The Opposition Over the Water.\u2014 During the American War, Lord North, at a City dinner, having announced the receipt of intelligence of an important advantage gained over the \" rebels,\" and being taken to task by Charles Pox and Colonel Barre, who were present; for applying such language to \" our fellow-subjects in America,\" exclaimed, with tbe inimitable talent for good-humoured raillery which distiuo-uished him, \" Well, then, to please you, I will call them the gentlemen in opposi tion on the other side of the water.\" This has been told mo (writes Lord Campbell) as a traditionary anecdote not hitherto in print. A Reluctant Apology. \u2014 In one of the debates on the American war, in 1782, Colonel Barre attacked Lord North violently, calling him the"], [155, "LORD NORTH. 135 scourge of the country. Upon this Lord North, for almost the only time in his life, lost his temper, and said '\u2022 he bad been used, from that quarter, to language so uncivil, so brutal, so insolent .\" At these words the House got into an uproar, and Mr. T. Townshend called upon Lord North to apologise. Lord North said he was ready to ask pardon of tbe House, but not of Barre. At the end of a tumult of three hours, he consented to ask pardon even of Barre.\" \u2014 Russell's \" Life of Fox.\" The PaU of Lord North.\u2014 In the session of 1782, the ministry of Lord North had several times narrowly escaped a vote of censure. \" On the 20th of March,\" says Earl Russell, \" Lord Surrey was to renew the motion in a different shape. When the day arrived, the House was remarkably crowded, and curiosity was on tiptoe to learn the event. Before Lord Surrey commenced, Lord North rose, and said he had some information to give to the House, which might make any further pro ceeding in the motion unnecessary, and might require an adjournment. Upon these words there was great confusion, many members calling out, ' No adjournment ! ' some ' Lord Surrey ! Lord Surrey ! ' and some ' Lord North ! Lord North ! ' Upon this Mr. Fox rose and moved, ' That Lord Surrey be now heard ; ' upon which Lord North, with great quickness, said, ' And I rise to speak to that motion.' Lord North then said he could assure the House, with authority, that the present Administration was no more, and that his Majesty had come to the full determination of changing his ministers. He then took leave of the House as minister, thanking them for the honourable support they had given him during so long a course of years, aud in so many trying situations. . . Lord North had borne his elevation with modesty; he showed equanimity in his fall. A trifling circumstance evinced his good humour. On the evening when he announced his resignation to the House of Commons, snow was falling, and the weather was bitterly cold. Lord North kept his carriage. As he was passing through the greatcoat room of the House of Commons, many members (chiefly his opponents) crowded the passage. When his carriage was announced, he put one or two of his friends into it, and then, making a bow to his opponents, said, ' Good night, gentlemen ; it is the first time I have known tho advantage of being in the secret.' Mr. Adam, from whom I heard this anecdote, says in his memoranda, ' No man ever showed more calmness, cheerfulness, and serenity. The temper of his whole family was the same. I dined with him that day, and was witness to it.' \" On the Defensive. \u2014 Sir N. Wraxall records a good example of the power Lord North could exhibit. He had been violently attacked by Sir Richard Hill for his conduct of the American war, and in reply said that. far from deprecating agitation of the subject, he demanded it. He denied that he had caused the calamities of the war, and called on his accusers to bring forward a circumstantial charge against him. \" I found,\" said he, \" the American war when I became minister. I did not create it. On the contrary, it was the war of the country, the Parliament, and the people. But if the gentlemen opposite think otherwise, let them come forward and accuse me. I shall not shrink \u2014 I am ready to meet and"], [156, "136 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to repel their charge. Nay, I demand it as a matter of justice. There can exist no reason now for withholding it. I am wholly unprotected. The Minister of this day has a House of Commons to accuse me, a House of Peers to try me. He is master of all the written evidence that can exist against me. And as to parole testimony \" (fixing his eyes on Dundas), \"almost all those individuals who were my confidential friends, in whom I reposed my secrets, are now his friends. Yet I court the inquiry. But if, when thus called upon, they do not grant it, I must insist that they do not henceforward argue upon the charge as if it were proved.\" His Affliction and its Solace. \u2014 Lord North during the last few years of his life was afflicted with total blindness, which he bore with resignation and even cheerfulness. Horace Walpole writes to a friend in 1787 : \" I dined last Monday at Bushy, and never saw a more interesting scene. Lord North's spirits, good humour, wit, sense, drollery, are as perfect as ever \u2014 the unremitting attention of Lady North and his children, most touching. Mr. North leads him about. Miss North sits constantly by him, carves meat, watches his every motion, scarce puts a bit into her own lips ; and if one cannot help commending her, she colours with modesty and sorrow till the tears gush into her eyes. If ever loss of sight could be compensated, it is by so affectionate a family.\" JOHN WILKES. (1727\u20141797.) The Middlesex Elections. \u2014 Wilkes had a seat in Parliament for the borough of Aylesbury, but was expelled from the House in 1764, for the publication of libels in the celebrated No. 45 of the North Briton, &c. He left the country to avoid sentence of the Conrt of King's Bench for the same offence, anl was outlawed in consequence. At the general election in 1768 he returned, and offered himself for the City of London, where he was in a minority, but immediately after was elected for Middlesex. Between the time of his election and the assembling of Parliament, he surrendered himself to the Court, and obtained a reversal of the outlawry, but was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. The House resolved by 219 to 137 that he be expelled ; but at the election which ensued he was again returned, when a motion was carried by 235 to 89 that, baring suffered expulsion, \" he was and is incapable of being elected a member to serve in this present Parliament.\" Three times the electors of Mid dlesex persisted in his return, with the same result ; and on the last occasion the House gave tbe seat to Colonel Luttrell, who had polled only 296 votes against Wilkes's 1143. The conduct of the House was denounced by Lord Camden (then Lord Chancellor) as a direct attack upon the first principles of the constitution \u2014 for which assertion of the popular right to choose a representative his lordship was dismissed from the Government. The Earl of Chatham spoke in a similar strain. The Common Council of the City of London presented to the King a strongly worded remonstrance against the course his Ministers had adopted, and a"], [157, "JOHN WILKES. 137 bold denunciation of the House of Commons, for which many of that body would have had the principal movers of the address committed to the Tower ; but fear of the popular indignation prevented them from proceeding to extremity. Luttrell continued to hold the seat for Middlesex until the Parliament was dissolved and a new one elected in 1774, when Wilkes was triumphantly returned, and took his seat without opposition. He moved repeatedly for the revisal of the pro ceedings relative to his former election, and to have the orders about his expulsion erased from the Journals, and in this he succeeded in 1782. Wilkes as a Speaker. \u2014 If we are to judge (writes Brougham) of his speaking by the very few samples preserved of it, we should indeed form a very humble estimate of its merits, \" Constant declamation about rights, and liberties, aud tyrants, and corruption, with hardly the merit of the most ordinary common-places on these hackneyed topics, seem to fill up its measure \u2014 with neither fact, nor argument, nor point, nor anything at all happy or new in the handling of the threadbare material. But what it wanted in force it probably made up in f ury ; and as calling names is an easy work to do. the enraged multitude as easily are pleased with what suits their excited feelings, gratifying the craving which excitement pro duces for more stimulus. That he failed, and signally failed, whenever he was called upon to address an audience which rejects such matter, is very certain. In Parliament he was seldom or never heard after his own case had ceased to occupy the public attention ; aud nothing can be worse than his address to the Court of Common Pleas when he was discharged. The occasion, too, on which he failed was a great one, when a victory for a constitutional principle had been gained perhaps by him \u2014 certainly in his person. All the people of London were hanging on the lips of their leader ; yet nothing could be worse or feebler than his speech, of which tho burden was a topic as much out of place as possible in a court of justice, where the strict letter of the law had alone prevailed, and that topic was verily handled with miserable inefficiency. ' Liberty, my lords, liberty has been the object of my life! Liberty ' and so forth. He might about as well have sung a song, or lifted his hat and given three cheers.\" A Newspaper Speech. \u2014 He spoke a speech in Parliament of winch no one heard a word, and said aside to a friend, who urged the fruitlessness of tho attempt at making the House listen, \" Speak it I must, for it has beeu printed in the newspapers this half hour.\" His Patriotism.\u2014 In public (says Russell) he affected a patriotism which he was far from feeling\u2014 indeed, he rather made a boast of his insincerity. Standing on the hustings at Brentford, his opponent said to him, \"I will take tho sense of the meeting.\" \"And I will take the nonsense,\" replied Wilkes, \" and we shall see who has the best of it \" Some years after, when his popularity had declined, the King, receiving him at his levee, asked him after his friend Serjeant Glyn. \" Sir,\" said Wilkes, \" he is not a friend of mine ; he was a Wilkeite, which I never was.\""], [158, "138 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Ready for Anything. \u2014 Lord Brougham relates that Colonel Luttrell aud Wilkes were standing on the Brentford hustings, when the latter asked his adversary privately whether he thought there were more fools or rogues among the multitude of Wilkeites spread out before them. \" I'll tell them what you say, and put an end to you,\" said the colonel; but perceiving the threat gave Wilkes no alarm, he added, \" Surely you don't mean to say you could stand here one hour after I did so?\" \"Why,\" the answer was, \"you would not be alive one instant after.\" \" How so ? \" \"I should merely say it was a fabrication, and they would destroy you in the twinkling of an eye ! \" Two Opinions. \u2014 At one time Mr. Wilkes came up to the Speaker in the chair, and told him that he had a petition to present to the House from a set of the greatest scoundrels and miscreants upon earth. When called upon, however, shortly afterwards to present it, he said, with the gravest possible face, \" Sir, I hold in my hand a petition from a most intelligent, independent, and enlightened body of men.\" \u2014 Life of Lord Bid-mouth. Strong Language. \u2014 Duel Between Wilkes and Martin. \u2014 While tbe House of Commons was debating the complaint of the King against the North Briton, in 1763, an incident arose which is thus referred to by Horace Walpole, in his letters to Mann : \" One Mr. Martin, who has much the same quarrel with Mr. Wilkes as King George, and who chose to suspend his resentment, like his Majesty, till with proper dignity he could notify his wrath to Parliament, did express his iudignation with rather less temper than the King had done, calling Mr. Wilkes to his face ' cowardly scoundrel.' Mr. Wilkes inquired of Mr. Martin by letter next morning if be, Mr. Wilkes, was meant by him, Mr. Martin, under this periphrasis. Mr. Martin replied in the affirmative, and accompanied his answer with a challenge. They immediately went into Hyde Park, and, at the second fire, Mr. Wilkes received a bullet in his body.\" Tho wound was considered dangerous, and to another person Walpole wrote : \" Wilkes has been shot by Martin, and instead of being burnt at an auto da fe, as the Bishop of Gloucester intended, is reverenced as a saint by the mob, and, if he dies, I suppose the people will squint themselves into convulsions at his tomb, in honour of his memory.\" Wilkes, it is well known, squinted horribly. CHARLES TOWNSHEND. (1725\u20141767.) A Logician out of Place. \u2014 When Sir Philip Yorke's friend and correspondent, James Harris, took his seat in the House of Commons, Charles Townshend inquired of some member who he was ; and being told in reply that he was a gentleman who had written on the subject of logic and grammar, he exclaimed, \" Why does he come here, where he will hear nothing of either?\" A Champagne Speech.\u2014 Horace Walpole, writing to Sir Horace Mann, May 12th, 1767, mentions \"a wonderful speech made by Charles"], [159, "CHARLES TOWNSHEND. 139 Townshend last Friday, apropos to nothing, and yet about everything \u2014 about ministers, past, present, and to come \u2014 himself in particular, whom I think rather past than to come. It was all wit and folly, satire and indiscretion. He was half drunk when he made it, and yet that did but serve to raise the idea of his abilities.\" Writing to Miss Berry on the same subject, he says, \" The speech lasted an hour, with torrents of wit, ridicule, vanity, lies, and beautiful language. Nobody but he could have made that speech ; and nobody but he would have made it if they could. It was at once a proof that his abilities were superior to those of all men, and his judgment below that of any man. It showed him capable of being, and unfit to be, first minister. The House was in a roar of rapture, and some clapped their hands with ecstacy, like an audience in a theatre. In this speech he beat Lord Chatham in language, Burke in metaphors, Grcnville in presumption, Rigby in impudence, himself in folly, and everybody in good humour.\" Pitt's Offer of the Chancellorship. \u2014 On undertaking the forma- tion of a ministry in succession to Lord Rockingham, the elder Pitt thus wrote to Charles Townshend : \" Sir, you are of too great a magnitude not to be in a responsible place : I intend to propose you to the King to-morrow for Chancellor of the Exchequer, and must desire to have your answer to-night by nine o'clock.\" Unprecedented (says Horace Walpole) as this method was of imposing an office of such consequence in so ungracious a manner (for it was ordering Townshend to accept 2700/. a year in lieu of 7000/., aud intimated that, accepting or refusing, he must quit the post of Paymaster), yet it was singularly well adapted to the man. It was telling him that no other man in England was so fit for that difficult employment; and it was telling him at the same time that. though his great abilities rendered him a useful servant, the lightness of his character made those talents not formidable in an enemy. Pitt had judged rightly. Townshend did not dare to fling both offices in his face ; but, without being incensed or flattered, fell into the most ridiculous distress imaginable. All he felt was the menace and the loss of the Paymaster's place ; and instead of concealing the affront or his own anxiety, he sat at home in his nightgown, received all that came, showed Pitt's mandate to them aud commented on it, despatched messengers for his brother and the Duke of Grafton, wdio were out of town, aud a.s the time lapsed ran to the window on every coach that passed to see if they were arrived. At last he determined on suing for leave to remain Paymaster, to which Pitt listened ; then, with his usual fluctuation, Townshend repented of not accepting the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, so leading a situation in the House of Commons, and begged he might have it. Pitt replied the place was full, being then inclined to retain Mr. Dowdeswell. Towushend renewed his supplication with tears, but for some time Pitt was firm. At length he yielded to the Duke of Graftcu's intercession ; and that very day Townshend told the King that Mr. Pitt had again pressed aud persuaded him to bo Chancellor of the Exchequer. Pitt diverted himself with his inconsistencies, and suffered him to be his Chancellor."], [160, "140 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. LORD LOUGHBOROUGH. (1733\u20141805.) Youthful Boldness. \u2014 Alexander Wedderburn (afterwards Lord Loughborough and Earl of Rosslyu) practised in his earlier years at the Scottish bar, but in 1757, having been provoked into using some violent language against one of his seniors, he was called upon by the bench to apologise, on pain of deprivation. Instead of doing so, he took off his gown and said, \" My lords, I neither retract nor apologise, but I will save you the trouble of deprivation ; there is my gown, and I will never wear it more ; virtute me involvo.\" He then went up to London, and, entering on practice there, eventually became Lord Chancellor. A Ministerial Watchman. \u2014 Wedderburn was, says Brougham, one of the few lawyers who have shone as much in political affairs as in Westminster Hall. When he entered the House of Commons he became, in a very short time, one of the two main supports of its ministerial leader (Lord North) ; the other was Thurlow ; aud while they remained there to defend him Lord North might well be, as Gibbon has described the \"Palinurus of the state,\" indulging in slumbers, with his Attorney and Solicitor General on either hand remaining at their posts to watch out the long debate. Completing a Quotation. \u2014 Lord Campbell relates that George Greuville, leader of the opposition, having brought forward his famous Bill for the Trial of Controverted Elections* (March 22nd, 1770), it was opposed by Lord North and the Government ; and De Grey, the Attorney- General, made a long speech against its dangerous innovations, conclud ing thus : \" In short, sir, although there no doubt have hitherto been irregularities and even abuses while the House retained to itself its consti tutional power of deciding election petitions, it is better to endure the evils of which we know the extent, than, in a sudden start of disgust and humour some passion, fly to others that we know not of.\" Wedderburn (then in opposition), rising immediately after, continued Hamlet's soliloquy \u2014 \" And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ; And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their current turn awry, And lose the name of artion.\" The Two Baths. \u2014 When Miss Pulteney was created Baroness Bath, there being a Marcpiis of Bath, of another family, existing. Lord Radnor made a motion in the House of Lords against the patent, contend ing that it was unconstitutional and illegal to create two peers with the same title, and that great inconvenience would arise from it ; as in their lordships' proceedings \" Bath \" might often appear opposed to \" Bath.\" Lord Loughborough thereupon said: \"My lords, in this case there is a sure way of preventing the future antagonism which haunts the imagination of the noble earl, for, the heir-apparent of the marquis being a bachelor, he may marry the young and beautiful baroness, and then Bath will be merged in Bath ! \" * See \" Miscel'aneous \" section \u2014 \" Controverted Elections.\""], [161, "EARL CAMDEN. 141 EARL CAMDEN. (1713\u20141794.) A Porty Days' Tyranny. \u2014 On the occasion of an Order in Council being promulgated to prohibit the exportation of corn (December, 1766). Lord Camden defended the proceeding in these terms : \" The necessity of a measure renders it not only excusable, but legal ; and consequently a judge, when the necessity is proved, may, without hesitation, declare that act legal which would be clearly illegal where such necessity did not exist. The Crown is the sole executive power, and is therefore intrusted by the Constitution to take upon itself whatever the safety of the State may require during the recess of Parliament, which is al most but a forty days' tyranny.\" The power exercised on this occasion was so moderate that Junius Brutus would not have hesitated to entrust it even to the discretion of a Nero. \u2014 Lord Charlemont's Correspondence. Creation of Peers. \u2014 Lord Campbell mentions that in the course of the debate on tho appointment of the Prince of Wales as Regent ( January 22nd, 1789), Lord Camden got into a scrape, in obviating the objection to the suspension of the power of making peers, by saying that \" on any nrgent call for a peerage it might be conferred by Act of Parliament \" \u2014 a proceeding which appeared to their lordships so unconstitutional and republican that he was obliged to explain aud retract. \" TJnwhig.\" \u2014 Lord Camdeu, writing to the Duke of Grafton (August 1st, 1782) respecting his intention of resigning the Privy Seal, said : \" Considering the perilous condition of the public at this conjuncture, I should be much concerned if your grace was to take a hasty resolution of retiring just now, because your retreat would certainly be followed by other resignations, and would t ot nlly ' uuwhig ' the Administration, if I may use the expression.\" The only other occasion (says Campbell) I recollect of this word being used was when Mr. Fox, on the King's illness, having contended that the heir-apparent was entitled as of right to be Regent, Mr. Pitt said, \" For this doctrine I will uiuvhig him for the rest of his days.\" A Friend of Freedom. \u2014 When the Libel Act was under discussion in the House of Lords (relates Brougham), iii 1792, Chancellor Thurlow-, as the last effort to retain the law iu judicial hands, asked if Lord Camden would object to a clause being inserted granting a new trial, in case tho court were dissatisfied with a verdict for the defendant. \" What ! \" exclaimed the veteran friend of freedom; \" after a verdict of acquittal? \" \" Yes,\" said Lord Thurlow. \" No, I thank you,\" was the memorable roply, and the last words spoken in public by this great man. The bill immediately was passed. LORD THURLOW. (1732\u20141806.) Leaving the Lawyer Behind. \u2014 Thurlow, as Attorney-General, took an active part, on the Government side, in the debates which pre luded the outbreak of tho American colonists. It is amusing (remarks"], [162, "142 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Campbell) to find him declaring that he did not speak on such occasions as a lawyer ; \" that he always did, and always would, leave the lawyer in Westminster Hall, and be in that House only a member of Parliament.\" Thurlow Abashed. \u2014 Mr. Fox having moved, in 1777, for the pro duction of certain papers relating to the American war, Thurlow, then Attorney-General, opposed the motion on behalf of the Government. The \" Parliamentary History \" says : \" He was contending against the ill policy of giving such information at the present critical moment, wheu news came from the Lords that the ministers in the upper house had agreed to the same motion. This intelligence produced a great deal of laughter amongst the minority, and the whisper, reaching the Attorney- General, threw him into a little confusion ; but, having recovered from it, he quitted the defence of the Administration, and said that, ' let ministers do as they please in this or in any other House, he, as a member of Parlia ment, never would give his vote for making public the circumstances of a negotiation during its progress.' However, this did not stifle the laugh, which continued for some time.\" Lord Campbell ascribes the laughter to \" the phenomenon that, for once in his life, Thurlow appeared to be abashed.\" The Great Seal Stolen. \u2014 Early in the morning of the 24th of March, 1784 (says Campbell), \" some thieves broke into the house of Lord Thurlow, in Great Ormond Street, which then bordered on the country. They carried off the great seal, two silver-hilted swords belonging to the Chancellor's officers, and a small sum of money. Though a reward was offered for their discovery, the thieves never could be traced. A charge was brought against the Whigs that, to prevent the then threatened dis solution, they had burglariously broken into the Lord Chancellor's house, and feloniously stolen and carried off the Clavis Regni.\" The theft and the custodian of the seal are thus alluded to in \" The Rolliad \" : \u2014 \" The rugged Thurlow, who, with sullen scowl, In surly mood, at friend and foe will growl, Of proud prerogative the stern support, Defends the entrance of Great George's court 'Gainst factious Whigs, lest they who stole the seal The sacred diadem itself should steal. So have I seen, near village butcher's stall (If things so great may be compared with small), A mastiff guarding on a market day, With snarling vigilance, his master's tray.\" Thurlow's Gush of Loyalty.\u2014 Tbe question of the Regency, on the illness of George III. in 1788, gave rise to vehement debates and much political intrigue. Lord Chancellor Thurlow's conduct in the. matter is well known ; he negotiated with the Whigs for the Recency, while he still occupied the woolsack for the Tories, who opposed it. On the 10th of December, 1788, Pitt presented a report to the House of Commons on the King's mental incapacity, and moved for the appoint ment of a committee to search for precedents. A similar motion was made the following dav ='n the Lords. Thurlow, who by this time had"], [163, "LORD THURLOW. 143 come to the conclusion that his interest lay on the King's side, left the woolsack and addressed the House, concluding his speech with this exclamation \u2014 \" And when I forget my King may my God forget me ! \" It seems scarcely possible (says Earl Stanhope, in his \" Life of Pitt \") to exaggerate the strong impression which that half-senteuce made. Within the house itself the effect perhaps was not so satisfactory. Wilkes, who was standing under the throne, eyed the Chancellor askance, and muttered, \" God forget you ! He will see yon d first ! \" Burke at the same moment exclaimed, with equal wit and with no profaneness, \" The best thing that can happen to you ! \" Pitt also was on the steps of the throne. On Lord Thurlow's imprecation he is said to have rushed out of the house, exclaiming several times, \" Oh, what a rascal ! \" In allusion to this scene, Burke afterwards remarked iu the House of Commons : \" The other House were not yet, perhaps, recovered from that extraordi nary burst of the pathetic which had been exhibited the other evening ; they had not yet dried their eyes, or been restored to their former placidity, and were unqualified to attend to new business. The tears shed in that House, on the occasion to which he alluded, were not the tears of patriots for dying laws, but of lords for their expiring places. The iron tears which flowed down Pluto's cheek rather resembled the dismal bubbling of the Styx than the gentle murmuring streams of Aganippe.\" Betrayed by his Hat. \u2014 Lord Campbell relates that when a council was to be held at Windsor, to determine the course which ministers should pursue on the Regency question, Thurlow had been there some time before any of his colleagues arrived. He was to be brought back to London by one of them, and, the moment of departure being come, the Chancellor's hat was nowhere to be fouud. After a fruitless search in the apartment where the council had been held, a page came with the hat in his hand, saying aloud, and with great naivete, \" My lord, I found it iu the closet of his royal highness the Prince of Wales.\" Tho other ministers were still in the hall, and Thurlow's confusion corroborated the inference which they drew. A Scarecrow to the Houses. \u2014 With reference to precedents cited of the Chancellor having directed the use of the greal seal during tho King's incapacity, Burke remarked, \" But what is to be done when the Crown is in a deliquium ? It was intended, he had heard, to set up a man (Thurlow) with black brows aud a large wig, a kind of scarecrow to the two Houses, who was to give a factitious assent in the royal name, and this to be binding on the people at large.\" An Imposing Aspect. \u2014 Although pretending (says Campbell) to despise the opinion of others, he was acting a part, and his aspect was more solemn and imposing than almost any other person's in public life \u2014 so much so that Mr. Fox used to say \" it proved him dishonest, since no mail could be so wise as Thurlow looked.\" A Masked Battery. \u2014 Speakiug generally, it was only on great occasions that he signalised himself.

His lordship, however, possessed a weapon which he often brought into action with great skill and effect. He would appear to be ignorant upon the subject in debate, and with affected respect, but visible derision, to seek for information upon it, pointing out. wdth a kind of dry solemn humour, contradictions and absurdities, which he professed his own inability to explain, and calling' upon his adversaries for their explanation. It was a kind of masked battery of the most searching questions and distressing observations; it often discomfited his adversary, and seldom failed to force him into a very embarrassing position of defence ; it was the more effective as, when he was playing it off, bis lordship showed he had the command of much more formidable artillery. \u2014 Butler's \" Reminiscences.\" A Crushing Reply. \u2014 At times (says Butler) Lord Thurlow was superlatively great. It was my good fortune to hear bis celebrated reply to tbe Duke of Grafton during the inquiry into Lord Sandwich's administra tion of Greenwich Hospital. His grace's action aud delivery when he addressed the House were singularly dignified and graceful ; but his matter was not equal to his manner. He reproached Lord Thurlow with his plebeian extraction, and his recent admission into the peerage. Particular circum stances caused Lord Thurlow's reply to make a deep impression on mo. His lordship had spoken too often, aud began to be heard with a civil, but visible, impatience. Under these circumstances, he was attacked in the manner we have mentioned. He rose from the woolsack, and advanced slowly to the place whence the Chancellor generally addresses the House ; then, fixing on the duke the look of Jove when he grasps the thunder, \" I am amazed,\" he said in a level tone of voice, \" at the attack the noble duke has made on me. Yes, my lords \" \u2014 considerably raising his voice \u2014 \" I am amazed at his grace's speech. The noble duke cannot look before him, behind him, and on either side of him, without seeing some noble peer who owes his seat in this House to his successful exertions in the profession to which I belong. Does be not feel that it is as honourable to owe it to these as to being the accident of an accident ? To all these noble lords the language of the noble duke is as applicable and as insulting as it is to myself. But I don't fear to meet it single and alone. No one venerates the peerage more than I do ; but I must say, my lords, that the peerage solicited me, not I the peerage. Nay, more; I can say, and will say, that as a peer of Parliament, as Speaker of this right honour able House, as Keeper of the Great Seal, as guardian of his Majesty's con science, as Lord High Chancellor of England \u2014 nay, even in that character alone in which the noble duke would think it an affront to be considered \u2014as A man \u2014 I am at this moment as respectable \u2014 I beg leave to add I am at this time as much respected \u2014 as the proudest peer I now look down upon.\" The effect of this speech, both within the walls of Parliament and out of them, was prodigious. It gave Lord Thurlow an ascendancy in the House which no Chancellor had ever possessed ; it invested him, in public opinion, with a character of independence and honour ; and this, though he was ever on the unpopular side in politics, made him always popular with the people."], [165, "THE EARL OF SHELBURNE. 145 THE EARL OF SHELBURNE. (1737\u20141805.) The Shelburne Ministry. \u2014 When Lord North resigned in March, 1782, the King offered Lord Shelburne to place him at the head of the Treasury, but he declined undertaking the formation of a ministry, in deference to the Marquis of Rockingham. \" My lord,\" said Shelburne to tho latter, \" you could stand without me, but I could not without you.\" A Cabinet was therefore formed by the marquis, in which Shelburne and Fox became Secretaries of State, and Burke Paymaster. Lord Rockingham dying in the following July, Lord Shelburne took the Premiership, and, the Fox party resigning, he adorned his new Board (as Walpole remarks ) with \" the most useful acquisition, and by the most artful address, of his whole administration \u2014 by offering the seals of Chancellor of the Exchequer to young William Pitt, who readily accepted them, and the more difficult task of enlisting himself as the rival of Charles Fox, who had wished to have him his friend.\" Flattery Missing its Mark. \u2014 Horace Walpole reports that Lord Shelburne, on coming into office, told Chancellor Thurlow, as a new dis covery he had just made, that he was amazed at the genius he found in tho King. The Chancellor laughed in his face, and instead of reporting the encomium to the King, as Shelburne expected, told it to everybody else with contempt. Provoking. \u2014 Lord Shelburne (remarked S. Rogers) could say the most provoking things, and yet appear quite unconscious of their being so. In one of his speeches, alluding to Lord Carlisle, he said, \" The noble lord has written a comedy.\" \" No, a tragedy.\" \" Oh, I beg pardon ; I thought it was a comedy.\" Duel between Lord Shelburne and Colonel Fullarton. \u2014 Colonel Fullarton, member for Plympton, complained to the House, on the 20th March, 1780, of the \" nngentleman-like behaviour of the Earl of Shelburne, who had in effect dared to say that he and his regiment were as ready to act against the liberties of England as against her enemies.\" A hostile meeting was the result, two days after. \" Colonel Fullarton,\" says the Annual Register, \" desired Lord Shelburne to fire, which his lordship declined, and Colonel Fullarton was ordered by the seconds to fire. He fired and missed. Lord Shelburne returned it and missed. Mr. Fullarton then fired his second pistol, and hit Lord Shelburne in the right groin.\" The seconds interposed, but his lordship refused to deliver up his other pistol, which was still loaded. The colonel returned to his position, and repeatedly desired his lordship to fire at him ; but Lord Shelburne replied. \" Sure, sir, you don't think I would fire my pistol at you,\" and fired it in the air. Colonel Fullarton then said, \" As your lordship is wounded, and has fired in the air, it is impossible for me to go on.\" Hereupon the seconds declared that their principals had both behaved as men of tho strictest honour. The Court of Common Council, having heard of the affair, sent officially to inquire \" after his lordship's safety, endangered in consequence of his upright and spirited conduct in Parliament.\" L"], [166, "146 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. WILLIAM PITT. (1759\u20141806.) A Child's Ambition. \u2014 In August, 1766, when the world was agitated by the news that Mr. Pitt had become Earl of Chatham, little William exclaimed, \" I am glad that I am not the eldest son. I want to speak in the House of Commons, like papa.\" Precocious Criticism. \u2014 When he was at home (writes Macaulay), he had frequent opportunities of hearing important debates at West minster ; and he heard them, not only with interest and enjoyment, but with a close scientific attention resembling that with which a diligent pupil at Guy's Hospital watches every turn of the hand of a great surgeon through a difficult operation. On one of these occasions, Pitt, a youth whose abilities were as yet known only to his family and to a small knot of college friends, was introduced on the steps of the throne in the House of Lords to Fox, who was his senior by eleven years, and who was already the greatest debater and one of the greatest orators that had appeared in England. Fox used afterwards to relate that, as the discussion proceeded, Pitt repeatedly turned to him and said, \" But surely, Mr. Fox, that might be met thus ; \" or \" Yes ; but he lays himself open to this retort.\" What the particular criticisms were, Fox had forgotten ; but he said he was much struck at the time by the precocity of a lad who, through the whole sitting, seemed to be thinking only how all the speeches on both sides could be answered. \" Never was a Boy.\" \u2014 The following entry occurs in the Journal of Francis Homer, 1805 : \" On one occasion, with Ward and John Ponsonby, when there was a great deal of conversation about the exercises and sports of the common people, the impolicy of suppressing them, &c., and when we ran over the names of the different public men, in the state and the law, whose opinions upon such a point of policy might come to be of importance, I hazarded Pitt's name. ' Oh ! ' exclaimed Windham, ' Pitt never was a boy; besides, such questions won't conduce to make a minister.' \" Rising Men. \u2014 When he first entered Parliament Pitt lived much in what may be termed a select club of his personal friends, young men of great talent, most of whom looked up to him as their political leader. They were about twenty-five in number, and met at the house of a man named Goosetree, in Pall Mall. Among them were Pratt (after wards Lord Camden), Althorp (afterwards Lord Spencer), Grenville (afterwards Lord Grenville), Robinson (afterwards Lord Rokeby), Smith (afterwards Lord Carrington), Lords Duncannon, Euston, &c. \u2014 Harford's \" Recollections of Wilberforce.\" Pitt's First Speech.\u2014 On the 26th of February (1781), Mr. Burke's renewed Bill for the Reduction of the Civil List was rejected by 233 to 190. On this occasion Mr Sheridan and Mr. John Townshend made their first speeches. But, above all, Mr. William Pitt spoke with a fluency, a precision, a dignity, and a method which are usually the acquirements of many years of practice. Lord North declared it was the best first speech"], [167, "WILLIAM PITT. 147 he had ever heard. The effect appears to have been prodigious. By no one was Mr. Pitt's success more warmly greeted than by Mr. Fox. Lord Holland has related an anecdote which illustrates the presence of mind of the young orator. \" As Mr. Fox hurried up to Mr. Pitt to compliment him on his speech, an old member, said to be General Grant, passed by and said, ' Ay, Mr. Fox, you are praising young Pitt for his speech. You may well do so ; for, excepting yourself, there's no man in the house can make such another ; and, old as I am, I expect and hope to hear you both battling it within these walls as I have done your fathers before.' Mr. Fox, disconcerted at the awkward turn of the compliment, was silent, and looked foolish ; but young Pitt, with great delicacy, readiness, and felicity of expression, answered, ' I have no doubt, general, you would like to attain the age of Methuselah.' \" Before long Mr. Fox had an opportunity of testifying in public the admiration he had avowed in private ; and early in the following year, in praising a speech of Mr. Pitt, he said \" he could no longer lament the loss of Lord Chatham, for he was again living in bis son, with all his virtues and all his talents.\" \u2014 Russell's \" Life of Fox.\" Macaulay relates in his biography: \" Pitt made his first speech in favour of Burke's plan of economical reform. Fox stood up at the same moment. but instantly gave way. The lofty yet animated deportment of the young member, his perfect self-possession, the readiness with which he replied to the orators who had preceded him, the silver tones of his voice, the perfect structure of his unpremeditated sentences, astonished and delighted his hearers. Burke, moved even to tears, exclaimed, ' It is not a chip of the old block ; it is the old block itself.' ' Pitt will be one of the first men in Parliament,' said a member of the Opposition to Fox. ' He is so already,' answered Fox, in whose nature envy had no place. It is a curious fact, well remembered by some who were very recently living, that soon after this debate Pitt's name was put up by Fox at Brookes's.\" Agamemnon and Achilles. \u2014 A debate on the Army Estimates took place in the House of Commons, December, 1781. Lord George Germain bad taken occasion two days before to declare that, be the con sequences what they might, he would never consent to sign the indepen dence of the colonies. Lord North, on the contrary, had shown strong symptoms of yielding. Pitt was inveighing with much force against these discordant counsels at so perilous a juncture, when the two ministers whom he arraigned drew close and began to whisper, while Mr. Welbore Ellis, a grey-haired placeman of diminutive size, the butt of \" Junius \" under the by-name of Grildrig, bent down his tiny head between them. Here Pitt paused in his argument, and, glancing at the group, exclaimed, \" I will wait until the unanimity is a little better restored. I will wait until the Nestor of the Treasury has reconciled the difference between the Agamemnon and the Achilles of tho American war.\" \u2014 Stanhope's \"Life of Pitt.\" Speaking under Difficulties. \u2014 Wilberforce said : \" When Pitt undertook, on February 21st, 1783, the difficult task of defending the recent peace, I well remember that he was so oppressed by a severe sick headache as to be scarcely able to hold up his head. Fox assailed him in L 2"], [168, "148 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. a very able speech, in the midst of which Pitt was obliged, from actual sickness, to retire to the entry door called Solomon's Porch, behind the Speaker's chair. I seem to see him holding the door in one hand, while he yielded to his malady, and turning his ear towards the House, that, if possible, he might not lose a single sentence that Fox uttered. Never do I recollect to have witnessed such a triumph of mind over physical depression. When Fox sat down he replied to him with great ability, though with less brilliancy than usual ; but on a renewal of the same discussion, a few days after, in a different form, he made one of the finest speeches ever delivered in Parliament.\" The King's Criticism on his Oratory. \u2014 On one occasion, in Pitt's earlier career as a Minister (1784), George III. thus wrote to him on his conduct of a debate : \" I cannot conclude 'without expressing my fullest approbation of the conduct of Mr. Pitt on Monday. In particular, his employing a razor against his antagonists, and never condescending to run into that rudeness which, though common in that House, certainly never becomes a gentleman. If he proceeds in this mode of oratory, he will bring debates into a shape more creditable, and correct that, as well as, I trust, many more evils, which time and temper only can effect.\" An \" Inspired \" Speaker. \u2014 Harford relates that on the breaking up of the House, after the memorable debate on the slave trade in which Pitt spoke so finely (1792), Windham, who was by no means partial to Pitt, and who did not take the abolition side, met Wilberforce and accosted him thus : \" Really, if your friend Pitt should speak often as he did last night, he will make converts of us all. It was as if he were inspired.\" His Most Effective Speech.\u2014 On the 18th of May, 1803, war was declared, and on the 23rd and 24th occurred one of the most memor able debates which ever took place in the House of Commons. On the first night Pitt spoke, and on the second, Fox, and both exerted their highest powers. Of Pitt's speech Lord Malmesbury says : \" Pitt's speech last night was the finest he ever made. Never was any speech so cheered, or so incessantly and loudly applauded.\" But the best account we have of this speech is from a letter of Lord Dudley, then Mr. Ward, to the Rev. E. Copleston (afterwards Bishop of Llandaff) : \" Whatever may have been its comparative merits, its effects were astonishing, and, I believe, unequalled. When he came in, which he did not till after Lord Hawkesbuiy had been speaking nearly an hour, all the attention of the House was withdrawn for some moments from the orator and fixed on him ; and as he walked up to his place, his name was repeated aloud by many persons, for want, I imagine, of some other way to express their feelings. Erskine aud Whitbread were heard with impatience, and when, at the end of a tedious hour and a half, he rose (twenty minutes to eight), there was first a violent and almost universal cry of ' Mr. Pitt ! Mr. Pitt ! ' He was then cheered before he had uttered a syllable \u2014 a mark of appro bation which was repeated at almost all the brilliant passages and remark able sentiments ; and when he sat down (nine), there followed one of the longest, most eager, and most enthusiastic bursts of applause I ever"], [169, "WILLIAM PITT. 149 heard in any place on any occasion. As far as I observed, however, it was confined to the parliamentary ' Hear him ! Hear him ! ' but it is possible the exclamations in the body of the house might have hindered me from hearing the clapping of hands in the gallery. This wonderful agitation, you will readily perceive, it would not bo fair to ascribe wholly to the superiority of his eloquence on that particular occasion. He was ap plauded before he spoke,* which is alone a sufficient proof. Much must be attributed to his return at such an awful moment to an assembly which he had been accustomed to rule, from which be had been long absent [ho had resigned office in 1801], and in which he had not left a successor ; some little, perhaps, to his addressing a new Parliament, in which there were many members by whom he had never or rarely been heard, and whose curiosity must of course have been raised to the highest pitch.\" \u2014 Russell's \"Life of Fox.\" Lord Lytton's lines in \" St. Stephen's \" recall the circumstances which lent to many of Pitt's speeches so much of their effect : \u2014 If read the orations, and forgot the age, Words that breathed fire are ashes on the page. Oh to have heard them in the breathless hall, When Europe paled before the maddening Gaul ; When marts resounded with tho trumpet's blare, Fleets on the deep and banners in the air. The very faults that later critics find Were merits then \u2014 the unhesitating mind, The self-reliance, lofty and severe, That grand monotony \u2014 a soul sincere, That scorn of fancy, that firm grasp of fact, That dread to theorise in the hour to act, Seem'd form'd to brave the elemental shock. And type to England her own Ocean-rock.\" The British Constitution. \u2014 In his speech on Fox's motion for an address to the King, in March, 1784, Pitt ihus described the British \u2022Constitution : \" The Constitution of this country is its glory. But in what a nice adjustment does its excellence consist ! Equally free from the distractions of democracy and the tyranny of monarchy, its happiness is to be found in its mixture of parts. It was this mixed constitution which the wisdom of our ancestors devised, and which it will be our wisdom inviolably to support. They experienced all the vicissitudes and distractions of a republic. They felt all the vassalage and despotism of a simple monarchy. They abandoned both, and, by blending each together, extracted a system which has been the envy and admiration of the world.\" Forbidding the Banns. \u2014 The finest, in all probability, of his speeches (remarks Brougham) is that upon the peace of 1783 and the Coalition, when he closed bis magnificent peroration by that noble yet * This was evidently most unusual in Pitt's time, although it has since become a common practice. The passage also shows that \"Hear him!\" was then the parliamentary sign of approbation."], [170, "150 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. simple figure, \"And if this inauspicious union be not already consum mated, in the name of my country I forbid the banns.\" Eve. \u2014 Pitt one night, alluding to bis small number of adherents on the Declaratory Bill, said that he appeared in the House of Commons as Eve in the garden of God, single and naked, yet not ashamed. \u2014 Orford's Memoirs. Exceptions. \u2014 On bis Additional Force Bill, in 1805, Pitt had a meeting of country gentlemen to consider the measure. One of them objected to a clause for calling out the force, which be insisted should not be done \" except in case of actual invasion.\" Pitt replied, \" That would be too late ; \" but the gentleman still insisted on the case of \" actual invasion.\" By-and-by they came to another clause to render the force more disposable; the same gentleman objected again, and insisted very warmly that he never would consent to its being sent out of England. \" Except, I suppose,\" rejoined Pitt, \" in case of actual invasion.\" His Classical Studies. \u2014 Pitt (said Lord Grenville) \" ascribed his fluency to the following circumstances : At Hayes (his father's seat), where they lived in great seclusion, it was his custom in the morning to construe his author, Virgil or Livy, to his tutor, Mr. Wilson ; and in the afternoon, after tea, to translate the same passage freely, with the book open before him, to his father and the rest of the family. He often mentioned this to me as the way he thought he acquired his fluency in public speaking ; and it is remarkable that in conversation, when an ancient writer was quoted, he always turned the passage into English (for his own use, as it seemed) before he appeared completely to enter into it \u2014 a habit I ascribe to this practice.\" Redhead Yorke mentions his being present when somebody quoted the following passage from the \" De Claris Oratoribus \" of Cicero to Mr. Pitt : \" Est cum eloquentia sicut flamma : materie alitur, motu excitatur, et nrendo clarescit.\" It was observed that it was untranslatable, on which Mr. Pitt immediately replied, \" No, I should translate it thus : ' It is with eloquence as with a flame. It requires fuel to feed it, motion to excite it, and it brightens as it burns.'\" \u2014 S. Rogers' \"Recollections.\" His Style. \u2014 Lord Brougham mentions that Pitt's style was called by Mr. Windham \" a state-paper style,\" in allusion to its combined dignity and poverty ; and the same nice observer, referring to the eminently skilful way in which Pitt balanced his phrases, sailed near the wind, and seemed to disclose much whilst he kept the greater part of his meaning to himself, declared that \" he verily believed Mr. Pitt could speak a king's speech off-hand.\" Finished Oratory.\u2014 Wilberforce said that Pitt came into Parlia ment so accomplished an orator that in the arrangement of his matter, the force of his reasoning, and in all the graces of finished elocution, his first speeches were almost equal to his last. Mr. Windham's speeches, he said, were known to have been prepared with assiduous care ; and, though interspersed with anecdotes which seemed spontaneous, to have been written down before delivery. Sheridan's were so diligently elaborated that he had been known often, before the occurrence of a great debate, to"], [171, "WILLIAM PITT. 151 shut himself in his room, day after day, where he was heard declaiming for hours. A Retort. \u2014 Lord Brougham told Bishop Wilberforce, in conversa tion : \" I have heard Pitt frequently. He was very great : not so persuasive as Fox ; you never so much lost sight of the great artist But wonderful \u2014 a power of endless speech \u2014 too much so with the same grandeur on every subject, perhaps. One of the finest I ever heard was on the attack on Lord St. Vincent's administration of the navy. Lord had said, ' We feel safe during this administration,' and Sir W. Curtis had said, ' Whilst the navy is in the hands it now is, the City is at rest, and we can sleep soundly in our beds.' We expected to hear more of all this, and when Pitt came forward he said, ' Confidence, Sir, in some minds strikes its roots so deep that nothing can shake it. I have no doubt that if our great enemy had posses sion of Plymouth, if his ships commanded Portsmouth harbour, if they already held the mouth of the Thames, that some men would still feel quite safe if the navy were administered by the noble lord, and that worthy aldermen might even sleep more soundly than ever.' \"' A Lady's Recollection. \u2014 Statesmen at Play. \u2014 Miss Frances Williams Wynn (sister of the Right Hon. C. W. Wynn, referred to among our \" Minor Celebrities \") in her \" Diaries of a Lady of Quality \" records some observations of Mr. Pitt, whom she met during a visit to her uncle, Lord Grenville, towards the close of the last century. Sho says: \"I was disappointed in that turned-up nose, and in that counte nance, in which it was so impossible to find any indication of the mind, and in that person which was so deficient in dignity that he had hardly the air of a gentleman. . . On the second day arrived Lord Wellesley,* whom I thought very agreeable. . . After we had retired for the night, I heard from the library, which was under my room, the most extraordinary noises \u2014 barking, mewing, hissing, howling, interspersed with violent shouts of laughter. I settled that the servants had come into the room, aud had got drunk and riotous; and I turned to sleep when the noise had ceased. Never can I forget my dismay (it was more than astonishment) when next day at breakfast I heard that my wise uncle and his two wise guests, whom we had left talking, as I supposed, of the fate of Europe, had spyed in the room a little bird ; they did not wish it to be shut up there all night; therefore, after having opened every window, these great wise men tried every variety of noise they could make to frighten out the poor bird.\" Pitt's Disinterestedness. \u2014 In the diary of the Right Hon. George Rose occurs tbe f oUowing : \"March 19, 1801.\u2014 With Mr. Pitt alone the whole evening, when a conversation arose about his own situa tion. On mentioning to him that an intention had been expressed by many friends of bringing forward a motion in the House of Commons respecting a grant to him, he assured me in the most solemn manner of * Then Earl of Mornington."], [172, "152 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. his fixed determination on no consideration whatever to accept anything from the public ; rather than do which he would struggle with any diffi culties ; that if he had had the good fortune to carry the country safe through all its\" dangers, and to have seen it in a state of prosperity, he should have had a pride in accepting such a grant ; but that under all the present circumstances of the situation of the country, and of himself, it was utterly inconsistent with his feelings to receive anything. In all which (notwithstanding the severe pressure I am sure he has upon him) I could not do otherwise than entirely concur with him.\" A Reconciliation Prevented. \u2014 Lord Brougham relates the following as a\" singular instance of the great effects of trivial circum stances.\" During the co-operation of all parties against Mr. Addington's Government, in the spring of 1804, Mr. Pitt and Mr. C. Long were one night passing the door of Brookes's club-house, on their way from the House of Commons, when Mr. Pitt, who had not been there since the Coalition of 1784, said he had a great mind to go in and sup. His wary friend said, \" I think you had better not,\" and turned aside the well conceived intention. When we reflect, says Brougham, on the high favour Mr. Pitt was then in with the Whigs, and consider the nature of Mr. Fox as well as his own, we can have little doubt of the cordial friend ship which such a\" night would have cemented, and that the union of the two parties would have been complete. The Statesman's Last. \u2014 Pitt died on the 23rd of January, 1806 \u2014 exactly a quarter of a century after his entrance into the House of Commons. He had been greatly affected by the news of Napoleon's successes at Ulm, and afterwards at Austerlitz, which to his mind more than counterbalanced the recent victory of Nelson over the French fleet at Trafalgar. His last words are said to have been, \" Oh ! how I leave my country \" \u2014 or \" how I love \" it ; for the word was indistinctly uttered. The first expression, however, appears the more probable. CHARLES JAMES FOX. (1749\u20141806.) Fox and Pitt in Childhood.\u2014 In 1767, Lady Holland, mother of Fox, paid a visit to Lady Chatham, of which she gave the following account to her husband : \" I have been this morning with Lady Hester Pitt ; and there is little William Pitt, now eight years old, and really the cleverest child I e-ver saw, and brought up so strictly and so proper in his behaviour that\u2014 mark my words\u2014 that little boy will be a thorn in Charles's side as long as he lives.\" A very singular prediction (remarks Earl Russell), showing not only the early cleverness of the two boys, but the cherished ambition of their parents, the wise strictness of Lord' and Lady Chatham, and the sagacity of Lady Holland. It is (wrote Walpole) a singular and perhaps a totally novel combination of circumstances that Charles Fox and William Pitt, the second sons of Henry Lord Holland and William Lord Chatham, who themselves were second sons, should"], [173, "CHARLES JAMES FOX. 153 become rivals and the first men in the House of Commons, as their fathers had been a little more than twenty years before. First Appearance of Fox in Parliament, and his Early Speeches. \u2014 Charles Fox was returned for Midhurst in May, 1768, when he was only nineteen years and four months old. He took his seat in the following November.* He made his first speech in the House of Commons on the 9th of March, 1769, when he was little more than twenty years of age. It seems to have been on a point of order \u2014 a singular topic for so young a man. On the 8th of May he spoke against the petition of the electors of Middlesex in favour of their right of electing Wilkes. Of this speech Horace Walpole observes : \" Charles Fox, not yet twenty-one, answered Burke with great quickness and parts, but with confidence equally premature.\" Sir Richard Heron, in a letter to Sir Charles Bunbury, says : \" Mr. Fox, who, I suppose, was your schoolfellow, and who is but twenty, made a great figure last night upon the petition of the Middlesex freeholders. He spoke with great spirit, in very parlia mentary language, and entered very deeply into the question on con stitutional principle.\" Lord Holland, proud of his favourite boy, writes thus to his friend Mr. Campbell, of Cawdor : \" I am told (and willingly believe it) Charles Fox spoke extremely well. It was all off-hand, all argumentative, in reply to Mr. Burke and Mr. Wedderburne, and exces sively well indeed. I hear it spoke of by everybody as a most extraordi nary thing, and I am, you see, not a little pleased with it. I am told Charles could never make a better speech than he did on Monday.\" \u2014 Russell's \" Life of Fox.\" Horace Walpole writes to Sir Horace Mann in April, 1772 : \" I went to the House of Commons the other day to hear Charles Fox, contrary to a resolution I had made never to set my foot there again. It is strange how disuse makes one awkward ; I felt a palpi tation, as if I were going to speak there myself . The object answered : Fox's abilities are amazing at so very early a period, especially under the circumstances of such a dissolute life. He was just arrived from New market, had sat up drinking all night, and had not been in bed. How such talents make one laugh at Tully's rules for an orator, and his inde fatigable application. His laboured orations are puerile in comparison of this boy's manly reason.\" An Artist's Sketch. \u2014 Lord Holland relates the following apropos of the personal appearance of Fox : \" I have in my possession a singular proof of the figure and impression Mr. Fox made on his first appearance as an orator. A young artist, and I believe a reporter of debates, a Mr. Surtees, of Mainforth, happened to be in the gallery when he first spoke. At that period no stranger was allowed to make notes, or take any paper or note-book into the gallery for that purpose. But this gentleman, struck with the appearance of the youthful orator, tore off part of his shirt, and sketched on it, with a pencil or burnt stick, a likeness of him, which he afterwards tried to finish at his lodgings, and which, owing to * S. Rogers mentions, on Fox's authority, that he wa3 abroad at the time of his election."], [174, "154 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the care of Mr. Sharpe and kindness of Mr. Fletcher, is still preserved in my possession at Holland House, retaining many traits of resemblance to the dark, intelligent, and animated features of Mr. Fox.\" Characteristics of his Speeches. \u2014 \"Conversation\" Sharpe relates of Mr. Fox that he sometimes put the arguments of his adversaries in such an advantageous light that his friends were alarmed lest he should fail to answer them. To state one by one the arguments of the Opposi tion, and one by one to reply to them, was the characteristic of his speaking, and without the aid of this text upon which to hang his comments he could make little progress. The opening of his speeches was almost always bad. Until he got warmed with his subject he hesitated and stammered, and he often continued for long together in a tame and common-place strain. Even in his highest flights he indulged in incessant repetitions, was negligent in his language, and was neither polished nor exact in his style. Notwithstanding these defects, he exercised a pro digious influence over his hearers. \" He forgot himself,\" says Sir James Mackintosh, \" and everything around him. He darted fire into his audience. Torrents of impetuous and irresistible eloquence swept along their feelings and convictions.\" \u2014 Quarterly Review. \" In the most imperfect relic of Fox's speeches,\" said Erskine, \" the bones of a giant are to be discovered.\" The Magician's Wand. \u2014 Macaulay mentions that a French gentle man expressed some surprise at the immense influence which Fox, a man of pleasure, ruined by the dice-box and the turf, exercised over the English nation. \" You have not,\" said Pitt, \" been under the wand of the magician.\" A Curt Dismissal. \u2014 Fox took office under the Administration of Lord North in 1770, but, disagreeing with his chiefs on their policy with regard to America, and showing a leaning towards more liberal measures generally, he was dismissed in 1774 by the following laconic letter from the head of the Government : \" Sir, \u2014 His Majesty has thought proper to order a new commission of the Treasury to be made out, in which I do not perceive your name. \u2014 North.\" Nine years after this, he and North jointly formed the celebrated Coalition Ministry under the Duke of Portland. The Westminster Scrutiny. \u2014 At the general election of 1784 Fox was returned for Westminster, after a contest which lasted from the 1st of April to the 16th of May. Lord Hood was at the top of the poll, Fox being next, with 6233 votes, against 5998 for the defeated Tory can didate, Sir Cecil Wray. The latter demanded a scrutiny, and the high bailiff of Westminster (a member of the Tory party) took upon himself on this account to withhold the return to the writ. Nothwithstanding repeated motions in the House, which were defeated by the Minis terialists, the matter stood over for eight months, Fox being compelled meanwhile to find a seat for a Scotch borough. Soon after the meeting of Parliament in 1785, the high bailiff was called to the bar of the House and examined on the subject, when he gave evidence that the scrutiny would probably take more than two years. Mr. Welbore Ellis moved that"], [175, "CHARLES JAMES FOX. 155 the high bailiff should be commanded to make a return to the writ ; but an amendment to the contrary effect was carried by 174 to 35. Motion and counter-motion were repeatedly made, with similar result, until, on tho 3rd of March, the Pitt party were beaten by 162 to 124, and the direction to the high bailiff was consequently issued. Hood and Fox were re turned, and Fox then brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas against the high bailiff for not returning him in the first instance, laying his damages at \u00a3100,000. The action was tried before Lord Lough borough, and the jury gave Fox the verdict, with damages of \u00a32000, which Fox allotted to the charities of Westminster. Quelling Interruption. \u2014 But for the inferiority of the subject (remarks Brougham), the speech upon the Westminster scrutiny, in 1784, might perhaps be placed at tho head of all Fox's speeches. A fortunate cry of \" Order ! \" which he early raised in the very exordium, by affirming that \" far from expecting any indulgence, he could scarcely hope for bare justice from the House,\" gave him occasion for dwelling on this topic, and pressing it home with aditional illustration ; till the redoubled blows and repeated bursts of extemporaneous declamation almost overpowered the audience, while they wholly bore down any further interruption. Election Pleasantries. \u2014 Many stories illustrative of Fox's good temper and ready wit at election times were current in his own day. Among them was one of his canvass at Westminster, where a shopkeeper on the opposite side, whom he asked for his vote and interest, produced a halter, which he said was all he could give him. Fox thanked tho man. but said he could not think of depriving him of it, as no doubt it was a family relic. The King's Dislike to Fox. \u2014 When Fox kissed hands on becoming one of the Coalition Ministry in 1783, Lord Townshend said \"he saw tho King turn back his ears and eyes just like the horse at Astley's when the tailor ho had determined to throw was getting on him.\" Good Humour in Defeat. \u2014 On the 18th of December, 1783, Mr. Fox was dismissed from office. On tho following day Mr. Pitt was made First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Upon the same day (says Russell) the House of Commons met. At three o'clock Lord North entered the house and took his seat on the Opposition bench. Mr. Fox, who soon followed, finding Mr. Dundas on the same bench, jocularly took him by the arm, saying, \" What business have you on this ? \u2014 go over to the Treasury bench.\" This incident, raising a laugh in which both parties joined, was a good humoured prelude to one of tho most violent party contests of modern times. The Right of Inquiry into Ministerial Negotiations. \u2014 In the spring of 1792, a vote of censure upon Pitt was proposed for his conduct in arming against Russia, while at the same time pursuing nego tiations with that power to adjust difficulties respecting Turkey. The speech of Fox on the occasion, against tho Minister, is a good example of his style, and at the same time so forcibly conveys ideas repeatedly urged in tbe House of CYinmons under almost identical circumstances, that it"], [176, "156 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. might be considered the model on which similar complaints have since been founded. In the opening of his speech Mr. Fox said : \" Never was there an occasion in which a minister was exhibited to this House in cir cumstances so ungracious as those under which he at present appears. Last session of Parliament we had no fewer than four debates upon the question of the armament in which the right honourable gentleman involved this country, without condescending to explain the object which he had in view. The minority of this House stood forth against the monstrous measure of involving the country without unfolding the reason. The minister proudly and obstinately refused, and called on the majority to support him. We gave our opinion at large on the subject, and with effect, as it turned out, on the public mind. On that of the right honour able gentleman, however, we were not successful ; for what was his con duct ? He replied to us, ' I hear what you say. I could answer all your charges; but I know my duty to my king too well to submit, at this moment, to expose the secrets of the State, and to lay the reasons before you of the measure on which I demand your confidence. I choose rather to lie for a time under all the imputations which you may heap upon me, trusting to the explanations which will come at last.' Such was explicitly his language. However I might differ from the right honourable gentle man in opinion, I felt for his situation. There was in this excuse some shadow of reason by which it might be possible to defend him, when the whole of his conduct came to be investigated. I thought it hard to goad him, when perhaps he considered it as unsafe to expose what he was doing. But when the conclusion of the negotiation had loosed him from his fetters, when he had cast off the trammels that bound him, I thought that, like the horse described by Homer (if I remembered I would quote the lines), exulting in the fresh pastures after he had freed himself from the bridle, the right honourable gentleman would have been eager to meet us with every sort of explanation and satisfaction. I thought that, restrained by no delicacy, and panting only for the moment that was to restore him to the means of developing and of expatiating upon every part of his conduct that was mysterious; of clearing up that which had been reprobated, of repelling on the heads of his adversaries those very accusations with which they had loaded him \u2014 the right honourable gentleman would have had but one wish, that of coming forward in a bold and manly manner, and endeavouring to make his cause good against us in the face of the world. Has he done so ? Has he even given us the means of inquiring fully and fairly into his conduct ? No such thing. He lays before us a set of papers, sufficient indeed, as I shall contend, to found a strong criminal charge of misconduct against him, but evidently mutilated, garbled, and imperfect, with a view of precluding that full inquiry which his conduct demands, and which we had every reason to expect he would not have shrunk from on this day.\" After a lengthy review of the whole of the circumstances, the speaker concluded as follows: \"A right honourable gentleman (Mr. Dundas), in excuse for withholding papers, asked what foreign power would negotiate with an English Cabinet if their secrets were likely to be developed and exposed"], [177, "CHARLES JAMES FOX. 157 to the idle curiosity of a House of Commons ? I do not dread such a consequence, but, if I must be pushed to extremes, if nothing were left me but an option between opposite evils, I should have no hesitation in choosing. ' Better have no dealings with them at all,' I should answer, ' if the right of inquiry into every part of a negotiation they think fit, and of knowing why they are to vote the money of their constituents, be denied the House of Commons.' But there is something like a reason why no foreign power will negotiate with us, and that a much better reason than a dread of disclosing their secrets, in the right honourable gentleman's example. I declare, therefore, for the genius of our Consti tution, against the practice of his Majesty's ministers. I declare that the duties of this House are, vigilance in preference to secrecy, deliberation in preference to dispatch.\" Tho vote of censure was rejected by 244 to 116. Fox and his Party. \u2014 Fox (says Earl Russell) was a great speaker, and, in the words of Burke, the greatest debater the world ever saw. Not place or power, but reputation as an orator, was the object of his ambition, as he declares in one of his earliest letters to an intimate friend and relation. He inspired affection rather than admiration. In his worst days an observer said of his party, \" There aro only forty of them, but every one of them is ready to be hanged for Fox.\" \u2014 Sir James Mackintosh records the words of Burke, six years after intercourse between himself and Fox had ceased : \" To be sure, he is a man made to be loved.\" The Sovereign People. \u2014 In the beginning of May, 1798, the Duke of Norfolk presided at a great dinner of the Whig Club. At the close of the evening he gave as a toast, \"Our Sovereign \u2014 the People;\" or, as Lord Holland relates it, \" The People \u2014 our Sovereign.\" Upon tho report of these doings he was dismissed by the Crown from the Lord Lieutenancy of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Fox, glad to defend what he con sidered the true doctrine, went afterwards to the Whig Club, and gave the same toast which had caused so much offence in the mouth of the Duke of Norfolk. For this Pitt struck his name out of the Privy Council. \"All the Talents.\"\u2014 On tho death of Pitt (January 23rd, 1806), the King, in spite of his antipathy to Fox, was compelled to apply to Lord Granville to form a Ministry in which he knew that statesman must be included. Its leading members were Lord Granville as First Lord of the Treasury ; Fox, Windham, and Spencer, Secretaries of State ; Erskine, Lord Chancellor; Addington, Privy Seal; Grey, First Lord of the Admiralty ; Lord Henry Petty, Chancellor of the Exchequer ; Sheridan, Paymaster General. To this combination the name of \" All the Talents\" was first applied by its friends, and afterwards as a term of ridicule by its opponents, especially Mr. Canning. A Candid Confession. \u2014 Lord Brougham wrote to Mr. Macvey Napier in 1838 : \"I believe Pitt was wrong in 1804, and I have said so, because it was true, and not because I am a Foxite, which I may be, aud yet greatly blame his conduct in particular cases; as I told Fox himself on Lord Ellenborough's being made a Cabinet Minister, when"], [178, "158 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. he replied, drolly enough: 'I like to be supported when I am in the wrong.' \" Foxiana. \u2014 The following facts respecting Fox are given in S. Rogers' \" Recollections \" : \u2014 Lord Grenville said, \" his speeches were full of repe titions. He used to say that it was necessary to hammer it into them ; but I rather think he could not do otherwise. \u2014 Lord Holland related that when Fox first entered office, being dissatisfied with his handwriting, he took lessons. \u2014 George III. (said the Duke of Wellington) was no listener. When Fox came out of the closet once, somebody said, \" You have had a long audience.\" \" Given one, you mean,\" was his answer. Grattan's Character of Fox. \u2014 His name excites tenderness and wonder. To do justice to that immortal person, you must not limit your view to his country. His genius was not confined to England ; it was seen three thousand miles off, in communicating freedom to the Americans ; it was visible I know not how far off, in ameliorating the condition of the Indian ; it was discernible on the coast of Africa, in accomplishing the abolition of the slave trade. You are to measure the magnitude of his mind by parallels of latitude. His heart was as soft as that of a woman ; his intellect was adamant. \u2014 Curran and his Contemporaries. Duel hetween Fox and Mr. Adam. \u2014 Earl Russell gives the following account of this affair : \u2014 Mr. Fox had made a vehement attack on Mr. Adam, who, having changed from the Opposition to the Ministerial side, gave as a reason for his change that, although the ministers were not very competent, no persons more competent were to be found among their opponents. Mr. Fox, confounding mental power with moral rectitude, described the minister as turning round on his new defender, and saying to him, \" Begone, begone, wretch ! who delightest in libelling mankind, confounding virtue and vice, and insulting the man whom thou pretendest to defend, by saying to his face that he certainly is infamous, but that there are others still more so.\" Mr Adam having in vain endeavoured to obtain an explanation of this speech from Mr. Fox, to bo inserted in the newspapers, sent Major Humberston to arrange the particulars of a hostile meeting. The meeting accordingly took place in Hyde Park, at eight in the morning of the 29th of November, 1799. After the ground had been measured, Mr. Adam desired Mr. Fox to fire ; to which Mr. Fox replied, \" Sir, I have no quarrel with you, do you fire.\" Mr. Adam fired; Mr. Fox then fired without effect. Upon this tho seconds, Colonel Fitzpatrick and Major Humberston, interfered, asking Mr. Adam if he was satisfied. Mr. Adam replied, \" Will Mr. Fox declare he meant no personal attack upon my character ? \" Upon which Mr. Fox said, \" That was no place for apologies,\" and desired Mr. Adam to go on. Mr. Adam fired his second pistol without effect. Mr. Fox fired his remaining pistol in the air, and said that, as the affair was ended, he had no difficulty in declaring he meant no more personal affront to Mr. Adam than he did to either of the other gentlemen present. Mr. Adam replied, \" Sir, you have behaved like a man of honour.\" Mr. Fox then mentioned that he believed himself wounded. On opening his waistcoat, it was found that Mr. Adam's first ball had taken effect, but that the wound was"], [179, "EDMUND BURKE. 159 very slight. The wits of the Opposition said that Mr. Adam had used Government powder, notorious for being deficient in strength. No men were greater friends in after life than Mr. Fox and Mr. Adam. The Rivals at Peace. \u2014 Pitt and Fox both died in the same year (1806), the former in January and the latter in September. Their graves, in Westminster Abbey, are situated within a few inches of each other. Sir Walter Scott thus moralises on the fact, in the introduction to the first canto of \" Marmion \": \u2014 \" Where \u2014 taming thought to human pride ! \u2014 The mighty chiefs sleep side by side. Drop upon Fox's grave the tear, 'Twill trickle to his rival's bier ; O'er Pitt's the mournful requiem sound, And Fox's shall the notes rebound. The solemn echo seems to cry \u2014 ' Here let their discord with them die. Speak not for those a separate doom, Whom fate made brothers in the tomb ; But, search the land of living men, Where wilt thou find their like agen ?' \" EDMUND BURKE. (1729\u20141797.) Burke in the Strangers' Gallery. \u2014 One giant attraction would draw the youthful genius from his desk, his journeys, and even from the intellectual tables of his friends. It was Burke's frequent and favourite custom to go alone to the House of Commons; to there ensconce himself in the gallery, and to sit for hours, his attention absorbed, and his mind enrapt in the scene beneath him. \" Some of these men,\" he remarked to a friend, \" talk like Demosthenes or Cicero ; and I feel when I am listening to them as if I were in Athens or Rome.\" Soon these nightly visits became his passion ; a strange fascination drew him again and again to the same place. No doubt the magic of his own master spirit was upon him, and the spell was working. He might be compared to the young eagle accustoming its eye to the sun before it soared aloft. \u2014 Burke's \" Life of Burke.\" His Acquisition of Estate. \u2014 Burke obtained initiation into political life when he was about thirty years of age, by taking the post of secretary to Gerard Hamilton (of the \"single speech\") at a salary of 300Z. a year. Prior to this he had been earning a small and precarious living by editing Dodsley's \" Register,\" and similar occupations. In 1765 he left Hamilton's service, and shortly after became secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham, acting in that capacity until the fall of the Rock ingham Ministry in 1766. Two years later he startled his friends by purchasing for more than 20,0007. an estate called \" The Gregories,\" near Beaconsfield. Tho Marquis advanced 10,000?. of this sum on a bond which it was understood would never be reclaimed ; and during fourteen years prior to his death, he is said to have assisted Burke in a similar"], [180, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 160 manner with sums amounting to about 30.000L (Macknight's \" Life and Times of Burke.\") On visiting Burke for the first time in his mansion, Johnson exclaimed in a reverie, \" Non equidem invideo ; \" and on taking leave of him remarked, \" I wish you all the success which ought to be wished you; which can possibly be wished you, indeed, by an honest man.\" His First Speech.\u2014 In January, 1766 (writes Prior), Mr. Burke seized the first opportunity of taking an active part in the discussion concern ing America. Mr. Pitt (the elder) immediately followed Mr. Burke in the debate, and complimented him by observing that \" the young member had proved himself a very able advocate. He had himself intended to enter at length into the details, but he had been anticipated with so much ingenuity and eloquence that there was little left for him to say. He congratulated him on his success, and his friends on the value of the acquisition they had made.\" On his quitting the House, all his friends crowded round him, expressing the greatest pleasure at the result, the praise of Mr. Pitt being of itself, in the general opinion, a passport to fame. Representative and Constituents. \u2014 When Burke was elected for Bristol in 1774, in returning thanks from the hustings he thus ex plained his views of the relations which should subsist between a member of Parliament and his constituents : \" Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness aud glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. . . But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened con science, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure ; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment ; and he betrays instead of serving yon if he sacrifices it to your opinion. . . Authoritative instructions ; mandates issued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the clearest con viction of his judgment and conscience \u2014 these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution. Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates ; but Parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole ; where, not local purposes, not local prejudices, ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole. You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of Parliament.\" A Bull. \u2014 In the course of his speech during the debate on the budget of 1772, Burke said : \" The minister comes down in state, attended by his"], [181, "161 EDMUND BURKE. creatures of all denominations \u2014 beasts clean and unclean. With such, however, as they are, he comes down, opens his budget, and edifies us all with his speech. What is the consequence ? One half of the House goes away. A gentleman on the other side gets up, and harangues upon the state of the nation ; and, in order to keep matters even, another half retires at the close of his speech. A third gentleman follows their example, and rids the House of another half (a loud laugh through the House). Sir (said he, turning the laugh with some address), I take the blunder to myself, and confess my satisfaction at having said anything that can put the House in good humour.\" A False Quantity.\u2014 Mr. Burke (relates Harford), in the course of some very severe animadversions which he made on Lord North, for want of due economy in his management of the public purse, introduced the well-known aphorism, Magnum vectigal est parsimonia, but was guilty of a false quantity by saying vectigal. Lord North, while this philippic went on, had been half asleep, and sat heaving backwards and forwards like a great turtle ; but the sound of a false quantity instantly aroused him, and opening his eyes he exclaimed, in a very marked and distinct manner, \" Vectigal.\" \" I thank the noble lord,\" said Burke, with happy adroitness, \" for the correction, the more particularly as it affords me the opportunity of repeating a maxim which he greatly needs to have reite rated upon him.\" He then thundered out, \" Magnum vectigal est parsi monia.\" \" Order \" in the Veins. \u2014 An attempt to prevent the publication of proceedings of the House was warmly opposed by Burke, and sup ported by a member named Onslow, who endeavoured to add weight to his opinions by claiming descent from three Speakers of the Commons. To this Burke scornfully replied ; \" I have not tho advantage of a parlia mentary genealogy. I was not born, like tho honourable gentleman, with ' Order ' running through my veins. But as that gentleman boasts of his father (Speaker Onslow), his son will never boast of him. The parlia mentary line is cut off.\" A Patchwork Cabinet. \u2014 In a debate on the taxation of the American colonies, April 19, 1774, Mr. Burke thus spoke of the ministry formed by the Earl of Chatham in 1766 : \" Ho made an administration so checkered and speckled ; he put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed ; a cabinet so variously inlaid ; such a piece of diversified mosaic ; such a tesselated pavement without cement ; here a bit of black stone, and there a bit of white ; patriots and courtiers, king's friends and republicans, Whigs and Tories, treacherous friends and open enemies ; that it was indeed a very curious show, but utterly unsafe to touch, and unsure to stand on. The colleagues whom he had assorted at the same boards stared at each other, and were obliged to ask, ' Sir, your name ? Sir, you have the advantage of me \u2014 Mr. Such-a-one \u2014 I beg a thousand pardons.' I venture to say it did so happen that persons had a single office divided between them, who had never spoken to each other in their lives, until they found themselves, they knew not how, pigging together, beads and points, in the same truckle-bed.\" M"], [182, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 162 A Turnspit a Member of Parliament. \u2014 Burke delivered a celebrated speech in the House of Commons, in the year 1780, on the subject of economy in the civil and other national establishments. Treat ing of the management of the royal household, and the sinecure offices which gave excuse for lavish expenditure, he said : \"At the beginning of his Majesty's reign Lord Talbot came to the administration of a great department of the household. Economy was then announced as a maxim of the reign. Lord Talbot attempted to reform the kitchen. But his whole scheme of economy was dashed to pieces ; his department became more expensive than ever ; the civil list debts accumulated. Why? It was truly from a cause which, although perfectly adequate to the effect, one would not have instantly guessed \u2014 it was because the turnspit in the King's kitchen was a member of Parliament. The King's domestic servants were all undone ; his tradesmen remained unpaid and became bankrupt \u2014 because the turnspit of the King's kitchen was a member of Parliament ! His Majesty's slumbers were interrupted, his pillow was stuffed with thorns, and bis peace of mind entirely broken \u2014 because the turnspit of the King's kitchen was a member of Parliament ! The judges were unpaid ; the justice of the kingdom bent and gave way ; the foreign ministers remained inactive and unprovided ; the system of Europe was dissolved ; the chain of our alliances was broken ; all the wheels of government at home and abroad were stopped \u2014 because the King's turn spit was a member of Parliament ! \" Honour where Due. \u2014 While speaking on the Civil List, Burke was annoyed by the repeated interruptions of a member who occupied a position in the royal household, and who, among other ejaculations, called upon the orator to remember his duty as a subject to tbe King. At this the speaker paused, and remarked that \" he was perfectly ready to honour the King, but he did not feel himself constrained therefore to honour the King's man-servant, his maid-servant, his ox, and \" \u2014 fixing his eyes upon the obnoxious intruder \u2014 \" his ass ! \" Optimism. \u2014 When a message from the King was read in the House of Commons, April 15th, 1782, recommending economy in the public expenditure, Burke rose to speak, and characterised the royal message as \" the best of messages to the best of people from the best of kings. Burke Seeking a Sinecure. \u2014 While the ministerial negotia tions which followed the death of the Marquis of Rockingham were in progress in 1782, Horace Walpole relates that he received a letter from Burke asking an interview. His business was to desire Walpole to propose to his brother, Sir Edmund Walpole, to resign his office of Clerk of the Pells (producing then \u00a37000 a year), in consideration of receiving the full yearly value of it for life. The resignation was to be made that very day, that Lord John Cavendish, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might bestow it on Burke before his lordship resigned office. Walpole was astonished at the request, and gave a dubious answer. He continues : \" Burke made his son write to me that night and come to me the next morning to persuade me of the goodness of the security ; but I so amply exposed to him the improbability of a man's resigning \u00a37000 a year for no"], [183, "EDMUND BURKE. 153 reason, and merely on a promise of indemnification, that the son saw the folly of the proposal and gave it up. One passage the son dropped that was very memorable. He said his father had always intended to get the office of Clerk of the Pells. This struck me, and explained what I had never comprehended, which was why in Mr. Burke's reforming bill that office had not been mentioned among the great sinecures that were to be annihilated on the deaths of the present incumbents.\" The \" Oftener-if-need-be's.\"\u2014 Burke (says Prior) opposed a motion by Mr. Flood for parliamentary reform, which produced a very candid confession from Mr. Fox, that though he thought such a measure advis able, the country at large did not seem to be of the same opinion. A jest of Burke on this question, widely disseminated in private society, threw much ridicule upon the enthusiasts in this cause. A new party of Reformers, he said, had arisen, still more pure in their creed than the rest, who deemed annual parliaments not sufficiently frequent, and quoted in support of their doctrine the latter words of the statute of Edward IH., that \" a parliament shall be holden every year once, and more often if need be.\" How to designate these gentlemen from their less orthodox associates he knew not, unless, indeed, their tenets furnished the hint, and they be known as the Oftener-if-need-be's. The Bright Particular Star. \u2014 In the session 1780-1, speaking on Irish affairs, Burke thus referred to the state of Ireland : \" So many and such great revolutions had happened of late, that he was not much surprised to hear the right honourable gentleman (Mr. Jenkinson) treat the loss of the supremacy of this country over Ireland as a matter of very little consequence. Thus one star, and that the brightest ornament of our orrery, having been supposed to be lost, those who were accustomed to watch and inspect our political heaven ought not to wonder that it should be followed by the loss of another. ' So star would follow star, and light light, Till all was darkness and eternal night.' \" The Spiritual Peers. \u2014 A phrase that has often been used in reference to the presence of the bishops in the House of Lords is to be found in Burke's \" Reflections on the French Revolution \" : \u2014 \" We have not,\" he says, \" relegated religion to obscure municipalities or rustic villages. No ! We will have her to exalt her mitred front in Courts and Parliaments.\" Young America. \u2014 Several of Burke's most famous sayings occurred in his speech in favour of conciliation with America, in tho House of Commons on the 22nd of March, 1775. For example, with reference to the rapid growth of the American colonies, he said : \" No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries ; no climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of Holland, nor the activity of Franco, nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of English enterprise, ever carried this most perilous mode of hard industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent people \u2014 a peoplo who are still, as it were, but in their gristle, and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood. When I m 2"], [184, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 164 contemplate these things ; when I know that the colonies in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours, and that they are not squeezed into this happy form by the constraint of watchful and suspicious govern ment, but that, through a wise and salutary neglect, a generous nature has been suffered to take her own way to perfection ; when I reflect upon these effects, when I see how profitable they have been to us, I feel all the pride of power sink, and all presumption in the wisdom of human con trivances melt and die away within me. My rigour relents ; I pardon something to the spirit of liberty.\" Compromise. \u2014 It was in the speech just referred to that Burke also remarked: \"We Englishmen stop very short of the principles upon which we support any given part of our Constitution, or even the whole of it together. . . This is nothing but what is natural and proper. All government \u2014 indeed, every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act \u2014 is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences ; we give and take ; we remit some rights that we may enjoy others ; and we choose rather to be happy citizens than subtle disputants. As we must give away some natural liberty to enjoy civil advantages, so we must sacrifice some civil liberties for the advantages to be derived from the communion and fellowship of a great empire.\" An Exciting Oration. \u2014 February 6, 1778, was (writes Horace Walpole) memorable for the chef-d'oeuvre of Burke's orations. He called Burgoyne's talk with the American Indians the \" sublimity of bombast absurdity,\" in which he demanded the assistance of seventeen Indian nations by considerations of our holy religion, by regard for our constitu tion ; and, though he enjoined them not to scalp men, women, or children alive, he promised to pay them for any scalps of the dead. Seventeen interpreters from the several nations, said he, could not have given them any idea of his reasons \u2014 but, added Burke, the invitation was just as if, at a riot on Tower Hill, the keeper of the wild beasts had turned them loose, but adding, \" My gentle lions, my sentimental wolves, my tender-hearted hyenas, go forth, but take care not to hurt men, women, or children.\" He then grew serious, and as the former part had excited the warmest and most continued bursts of laughter even from Lord North, Rigby, and the Ministers themselves, so he drew such a pathetic picture of the cruelties of the King's army \u2014 particularly in tho alleged case of a young woman on whose ransom, not beauty, they quarrelled, and murdered her \u2014 that he drew iron tears clown Barre's cheek, who implored him to print his speech, and said, with many invectives against the bishops, that it ought to be pasted up on every church under their proclamation for the fast, and that he himself would paste it upon some. Governor Jolmstone said he was now glad that strangers were excluded, as, if they had been admitted, Burke's speech would have excited them to tear the Ministers to pieces as they went out of the house. Biding his Time. \u2014 Directly after the return of Warren Hastings from India, Burke gave notice in the House of Commons that he would make a motion respecting his conduct. Nothing further transpired in the matter for some months, until at last Major Scott, a friend of Hastings,"], [185, "165 EDMUND BURKE. called upon Burke in the House to produce his charges. Mr. Burke's haughty reply to the major was the relation of the anecdote of the great Duke of Parma, who, being challenged by Henry IV. of France to bring his forces into open field, and instantly decide their disputes, answered, with a smile, \" that be knew very well what he had to do, and was not come so far to be directed by an enemy.\" Burke and Warren Hastings. \u2014 There was one man (writes Earl Russell) who had watched Hastings' conduct, aud for five years had mado it his peculiar study. He rose from that study convinced that Mr. Hastings had overstepped all the limits of conventional law, and broken the bonds of primitive morality. That man was Mr. Burke. He justified his animosity by alleging the patience and perseverance of his inquiries. He was not actuated, he said, by ignorance, inadvertency, or passion. \" Anger, indeed, he had felt, but surely not a blamable anger ; for who ever heard of a digesting anger, a collating anger, an examining anger, a deliberating anger, a selecting anger ? \" Yet this plea (continues Earl Russell) is not quite conclusive. Mr. Burke kindled his anger by the perusal of bulky documents, aud heaped up the fuel of his indignation by poring over a vast mass of despatches. The Grasshopper. \u2014 Sir Philip Francis once waited upon Burke by appointment, to read over to him some papers respecting Mr. Hastings' delinquencies. He called on Burke on his way to the house of a friend with whom he was engaged to dine. He found him in his garden holding a grasshopper. \" What a beautiful animal is this ! \" said Burke. \" Observe its structure \u2014 its legs, its wings, its eyes.\" \" How can you,\" said Sir Philip, \"loso your time in admiring such an animal, when you have so many objects of moment to attend to ? \" \" Yet Socrates,\" said Burke, \" according to the exhibition of him in Aristophanes, attended to a much less animal ; he actually measured the proportion which its size bore to the space it passed over in a skip. I think the skip of a grass hopper does not exceed its length. Let us see.\" \" My dear friend,\" said Sir Philip, \" I am in a great hurry ; let us walk in, and let me read my papers to you.\" Into the house they walked. Sir Philip began to read, and Burke appeared to listen. At length, Sir Philip having mislaid a paper, a pause ensued. \" I think,\" said Burke, \" that naturalists are now agreed that locusta, not cicada, is the Latin word for grasshopper. What's your opinion, Sir Philip?\" \"My opinion,\" answered Sir Philip, packing up his papers and preparing to move off, \" is that till the grass hopper is out of your head it will be idle to talk to you of the concerns of India.\" \u2014 Butler's \" Reminiscences.\" A Nightcap Wanted. \u2014 During one of the debates on Lord Pigott's recall from Madras, Burke had twice given way to other speakers, when, observing the chairman of the India Company proceeding to read a variety of well-known public papers, instead of adducing any new arguments, he interrupted him by observing, \" That if it were the object of the honourable member to tire and thin the House by reading all the heavy folios on the table, he supposed in courtesy he must submit ; but to prepare for the task ho begged leave to send for his nightcap.\" This"], [186, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 166 produced general laughter, and was followed by a shout to him of \" Go on ! go on ! \" The Lion Discomfited. \u2014 In a new Parliament which met in May, 1784, Burke was not viewed with much favour by many of the members. A prejudice or combination (says Prior), chiefly of the younger members of the House, was formed so strong against him, that the moment of his rising became a signal for coughing or other symptoms of pointed dislike, by men who had no chance of success against him in any other manner. On one occasion, instead of threatening, like Mr. Tierney when similarly assailed, to \" speak for three hours longer,\" ho stopped short in his argument to remark that \" he could teach a pack of hounds to yelp with more melody and equal comprehension.\" At another time, having occasion to rise with papers in his hands, a rough country gentleman. who had more ear, perhaps, for this melody of tbe hounds than for political discussion, exclaimed, with something of a look of despair, \" I hope the honourable gentleman does not mean to read that large bundle of papers and bore us with a long speech into the bargain.\" Burke is said to have felt so much irritation that, incapable of utterance for some minutes. he ran out of the house. \" Never before,\" said the facetious George Selwyn, who told the story with great effect, \" did I see the fable realised \u2014 a lion put. to flight by the braying of an ass.\" Burke and Wedderburn.\u2014 On December 3rd, 1777, an incident occurred in Burke's parliamentary life of which (remarks Prior) we have no other instance. \" There were high words,\" writes Mr. Crawford to Lord Ossory, \" between Wedderburn and Burke, which so offended the latter that he went out of the house, and I believe intended to challenge Wedderburn, but was prevented by a letter from Wedderburn, and an explanation likewise, which he sent through Charles \" (Fox). He had, it appears, laughed at a part of Wedderburn's speech when dead silence reigned in the house, so that it was heard ; this produced irritation, followed by what he understood to be either rudeness or a personal threat; and theuce the misunderstanding, which, however, was soon forgotten by both. Two made One. \u2014 On the day when the celebrated junction between the parties of Mr. Fox and Lord North was declared, Mr. Burke and Colonel North entered the House of Commons together, just as the Speaker was beginning to count the House, and as he pointed to them, and in the customary manner called out \"One, two \" Mr. Burke interrupted him with, \"Pardon me, sir; we were two yesterday, but are only one to-day.\" \u2014 Life of Lord Sidmouth. The Rupture between Burke and Fox. \u2014 Earl Stanhope gives the following account of this occurrence : \u2014 The progress of the Canada Bill (1791) was fraught with an interest far beyond its own. It was made memorable by a collateral incident which it produced \u2014 by the utter breach and lasting estrangement of the two great leaders of the Opposi tion. In arguing against the Canada Bill, Fox had not scrupled to draw some illustrations from the recent changes in France ; nor had he for borne from some reflections \u2014 or what seemed so \u2014 on the recent writings"], [187, "167 EDMUND BURKE. of Burke. A debate on a different subject had given Fox another oppor tunity for going over the same ground. On this second occasion Burke, who was not present on the first, had risen with signs of strong emotion ; but, the hour being late, and the House exhausted, he was stopped by loud cries of \" Question ! \" chiefly from the friends of Fox. At a later period Fox is known to have regretted the injudicious zeal of those who would not allow Burke to answer his remarks upon the spot. \" The contention,\" he said, \" might have been fiercer and hotter, but the remembrance of it would not have settled so deep and rankled so long.\" . . On the 6th of May the expectation of the House was wound up to the highest pitch. But by that time the friends of Fox had discovered that it was highly irregular and blamable to foist reflections upon France into debates upon Canada. This irregularity, which had not struck them while the practice was continued by Fox, appeared to them in the strongest light the moment a reply was announced by Burke. When, therefore, on the 6th of May, Burke rose in his place, and was proceeding with solemn earnestness to inveigh against the evil and the error of the French Revolution, there appeared a fixed design to interrupt him. Member after member from his own side started up to call him to order. There was, as Burke said, a most disorderly rage for order. When at last he was suffered in some measure to proceed, chafed and goaded as he had been, and even at length by Fox among the rest, he no doubt spoke against \" the right honourable gentleman \" (for now he dropped the name of friend) much more bitterly and strongly than he had at first designed. \" Certainly,\" he said, \"it is indiscreet at any period, but especially at my time of life, to provoke enemies, or to give my friends occasion to desert me. Yet, if my firm and steady adherence to the British Constitution place me in such a dilemma, I am ready to risk all, and with my last words to exclaim, Fly from the French Constitution ! \" Fox here whispered across to him that there was no loss of friends. \" Yes,\" re joined Burke ; \" yes, there is a loss of friends. I know the price of my conduct. I have done my duty at the price of my friend. Our friend ship is at an end ! \" And thus ended a friendship of twenty-five years. Entertaining his Friends. \u2014 While in town, Burke often asked political and literary friends to dine or sup, as it happened, on beefsteaks or a leg of mutton, and commonly gave no more than his invitation pro fessed. Of this an instance is related, which (says Prior) as an after dinner story tells amusingly. Having been detained late in the House, he asked Fox, Lord John Cavendish, and two or three more of the party to sup, when, on announcing the object of their visit to Mrs. Burke, a look of annoyance and despair sufficiently told the ill-provided state of the larder. A pause ensued. \" Surely,\" said the host, with a comic face, \" there is beef enough ! \" Fox and two or three others, making an apology for momentary absence, hurried off to a neighbouring tavern, provided themselves each with a dish of such fare as could be procured, and, amid much laughter from all parties \u2014 particularly the master of the house, who cracked some jokes on their skill as waiters \u2014 passed an amusing evening."], [188, "168 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Making Election Sure. \u2014 An instance of Burke's promptitude to seize any incident that offered to aid or illustrate his aim at the moment, was told frequently by the eminent dissenting divine, Robert Hall, as having come under his own knowledge. While canvassing Bristol, Burke and his friends entered a house where the wife of the owner was reading her Bible. \" I have called, madam, to solicit the favour of your husband's vote and interest in the present election. You, I perceive,\" placing his finger on a passage that caught his eye, \" are ' making your calling and election sure.' \" \" Ditto to Mr. Burke.\" \u2014 When Burke, on his election for Bristol in 1774, had returned thanks to his constituents in an eloquent speech from the hustings, \"a humorous incident terminated the day's triumph. Mr. Cruger, Burke's colleague, a worthy merchant in the American trade and a citizen of Bristol, but no orator, was dumbfounded by the eloquence of his mighty coadjutor. When his own turn came to thank the electors, he had recourse to a speech which, though savouring of his counting-house, was under the circumstances about the best he could make. He cried out, ' Gentlemen, I say ditto to Mr. Burke ! ditto to Mr. Burke ! ' A roar of laughter and applause marked the approval of his audience.\" The Day of No Judgment. \u2014 Dining with Pitt at Downing-street one day in the year 1791, Burke strove to alarm Pitt on the aggressive nature of French principles, antl the propagandise of revolution. Pitt made rather light of the danger, and said, in colloquial phrase, \" This country and constitution were safe to the clay of judgment.\" \" Yes,\" Burke quickly retorted, \" but 'tis the day of no judgment that I am afraid of.\" The Small and Noisy. \u2014 Burke describes this class of\" pcSticians in his most vigorous style : \" Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink, while thousands of great cattle beneath the shadow of the British oak chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field, that of course they are many in number, or that, after all, they are other than the little, shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome, insects of the hour.\" The Dagger Scene. \u2014 It was on the second reading of the Aliens Bill, the 28th of December, 1792, that Burke enacted the celebrated dagger scene. Lord Sidmouth used to relate to his friends this version of the scene : \" When Burke, after only a few preliminary remarks, the House being totally unprepared, fumbled in his bosom, and suddenly drew out the dagger and threw it on the floor, his extravagant gesture excited a general disposition to titter, by which most men would have been dis concerted ; but he, observing he had failed of making the intended im pression, immediately collected himself for an effort, and by a few brilliant sentences recalled the seriousness of the House. ' Let us,' said he, ' keep French principles from our heads, and French daggers from our hearts ; let us preserve all our blandishments in life, and all our consolations in death, all the blessings of time, and all the hopes of eternity.' \"\u2014It"], [189, "EDMUND BURKE. 169 appears from a statement by the Earl of Eldon in his grandfather's \" Life \" that the dagger had been sent from France to a manufacturer at Birmingham, with an order for a large number to be made like it, and that Burke had only received it that same day from Sir James Bland Burgess, on his way down to the House. Comparative Failure. \u2014 Lurd Liverpool, whose discretion more than anything else maintained him so long in the office of Prime Minister, wrote respecting Burke, in a letter to Mr. Croker in 1824 : \" Prior * has too much overlooked his defects. Why, it may be asked, being gifted with acquirements beyond all other men perhaps, living or dead, and surpassing all his contemporaries in the highest flights of eloquence, was he not the leader of his party ? First, because he wanted taste ; and secondly, because he was the most impracticable of men. He never knew when not to speak ; he never knew when to speak short. He never consulted the feelings and prejudices of his audience. I remember hearing Lord Thurlow say of him and Fox that the difference between them during the American controversy was, that Fox always spoke to the House, and Burke spoke as if he was speaking to himself.\" \u2014 Burke said on one occasion to Dr. Parr, \" You have criticised Fox's and Sheridan's speeches, but you say nothing of mine.\" The reply was, \" Ah ! yours was dislocated by parentheses, adumbrated by metaphors, debilitated by amplifications. \" Good Speeches never without Effect. \u2014 It is extremely dis couraging (remarks Prior) to be constantly out-voted, when possibly not out-argued; to spend time, labour, and ingenuity, \" to watch, fast, and sweat night after night,\" as Burke himself forcibly expresses it, and not emerge from the slough of constant minorities. No person felt this more than Burke ; yet none has more ably stated the necessity and even advan tages resulting to the country and to the members so situated from a well directed opposition, than ho has done in a conversation with Sir Joshua Reynolds. \" Mr. Burke,\" said the painter, \" I do not mean to flatter ; but when posterity reads one of your speeches iu Parliament, it will be diffi cult to believe that you took so much pains, knowing with certainty that it could produce no effect ; that not one vote would be gained by it.\" \" Waiving your compliment to me,\" said the orator, \" I shall say in general that it is very well worth while for a man to take pains to speak well in Parliament. A man who has vanity speaks to display his talents ; and if a man speaks well, he gradually establishes a certain reputation and consequence in the general opinion, which sooner or later will have its political reward. Besides, though not one vote is gained, a good speech has its effect. Though an Act of Parliament which has been ably opposed passes into a law, yet in its progress it is modelled and softened in such a manner, that we see plainly the minister has been told that the members attached to him are so sensible of its injustice or absurdity from what they have heard, that it must be altered.\" The Preservation of Order.\u2014 In 1769, in moving for an inqu'.ry * Burke's biographer."], [190, "170 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. into the conduct of the authorities in suppressing riots at St. George's Fields, Burke is reported in \" Cavendish's Debates \" to have said : \" Peace and order are to be preserved at any price. If the voice of the magistrate cannot do it, the constable must do it ; if the constable cannot do it, the sword of the soldier must do it ; if it cannot be purchased without blood, it must be purchased by blood. Liberty ought not to exist in a country where peace and order are not observed.\" The British Constitution. \u2014 Burke was impelled, by his \" Reflec tions on the Revolution in France,\" to write as follows respecting the British Constitution : \" Our political system is placed in a just correspon dence and symmetry with the order of the world, and with the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole at one time is never old, or middle-aged, or young ; but, in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression. Thus, in preserving that method of nature in the conduct of the State, in what we improve we are never wholly new ; in what we retain, we are never wholly obsolete.\" RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN. (1751\u20141816.) Introduction to Fox. \u2014 Sheridan was introduced to Fox, with whom he was in later life to be so closely associated, by Lord John Townshend. The latter writes : \" I made the first dinner party at which they met, having told Fox that all the notions he might have conceived of Sheridan's talents and genius from the comedy of The Rivals, &c, would fall infinitely short of the admiration of his powers which I was sure he would entertain at the first interview. Fox told me after breaking up from dinner that he always thought Hare, after my uncle Charles Townshend, the wittiest man he ever met with, but that Sheridan surpassed them both infinitely.'' His First Speech. \u2014 He made his first speech in Parliament on the 20th November, 1780, when a petition was presented to the House complaining of the undue election of the sitting members for Stafford (himself and Mr. Monckton). It was on this night, as Woodfall used to relate, that Sheridan, after he had spoken, came up to him in the gallery, and asked, with much anxiety, what he thought of his first attempt. The answer of Woodfall, as he had the courage afterwards to own, was, \" I am sorry to say I do not think that this is your line ; you had much better have stuck to your former pursuits.\" On hearing which, Sheridan rested his head on his hand a few minutes, and then vehemently exclaimed, \"It is in me, however, and by G\u2014 it shall come out!\"\u2014 Moore's \" Sheridan.\" The \"Angry Boy.\"\u2014 A debate occurred, February 17th, 1783, on the preliminary articles of peace, at the close of the American War of Independence, when tho following passage between Pitt and Sheridan enlivened and excited the House. Mr. Pitt (says the \"Parliamentary"], [191, "RICHARD BR1NSLEY SHERIDAN. 171 History\") was pointedly severe on the gentlemen who had spoken against the Address, and particularly on Mr. Sheridan. \" No man admired more than he did the abilities of that right honourable gentleman \u2014 the elegant sallies of his thought, the gay effusions of his fancy, his dramatic turns and his epigrammatic point ; and if they were reserved for the proper stage they would, no doubt, receive what the right honourable gentleman's abilities always did receive, the plaudits of the audience ; and it would be his fortune sui plausu gaudere theatri. But this was not the proper scene for the exhibition of those elegancies.\" Mr. Sheridan, on rising to explain, said : \" On the particular sort of personality which the right honourable gentleman has thought proper to make use, I need not make any comment. The propriety, the taste, the gentlemanly point of it, must have been obvious to the House. But let me assure the right honourablo gentleman that I do now, and will at any time he chooses to repeat this sort of allusion, meet it with the most sincere good humour. Nay, I will say more : flattered and encouraged by the right honourable gentleman's panegyric on my talents, if ever I again engage in the compositions he alludes to, I may be tempted to an act of presumption \u2014 to attempt an improvement on one of Ben Jonson's best characters \u2014 the character of the Angry Boy, in the ' Alchymist.' \" Invidious. \u2014 Lord Eldon left an anecdote book in manuscript, in which he noted tho following : During the debates on the India Bill, at which period John Robinson was Secretary to the Treasury, Sheridan, on one evening when Fox's majorities were decreasing, said, \" Mr. Speaker, this is not at all to be wondered at, when a member is employed to corrupt everybody in order to obtain votes.\" Upon this there was a great outcry made by almost everybody in the House. \" Who is it ? Name him ! Name him ! \" \" Sir,\" said Sheridan to the Speaker, \" I shall not name the person. It is an unpleasant and invidious thing to do so, and there fore I shall not name him. But don't suppose, sir, that I abstain because there is any difficulty in naming him ; I could do that, sir, as soon as you could say Jack Robinson.\" A Demosthenes. \u2014 A member of Lord North's administration made a speech which was highly commended by Mr. Rigby, who pronounced it the finest ho had ever heard, a proof of which was, he said, that it was tho speech which had most galled the Opposition. To this Sheridan replied that if those speeches were the best that gave most offence, Rigby himself was the Demosthenes of the House. The Begums Speech. \u2014 The charge touching the spoliation of the Begums was brought forward by Sheridan, in a speech which was so imperfectly reported that it may be said to be wholly lost, but which was, without doubt, the most elaborately brilliant of all the productions of his ingenious mind. The impression which it produced was such as has never been equalled. He sat down, not merely amidst cheering, but amidst the loud clapping of hands, in which the lords below the bar aud the strangers in the gallery joined. The excitement of the House was such that no other speaker could obtain a hearing, and the debate was adjourned. The ferment spread fast through the town. Within four-and-twenty hours,"], [192, "172 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Sheridan was offered a thousand pounds for the copyrights of the speech, if he would himself correct it for the press. The impression made by this remarkable display of eloquence ou severe and experienced critics, whose discernment may be supposed to have been quickened by emulation, was deep and permanent. Mr. Windham, twenty years later, said the speech deserved all its fame, and was, in spite of some faults of taste \u2014 such as were seldom wanting either in the literary or in the parliamentary performances of Sheridan \u2014 the finest that had been delivered within the memory of man. Mr. Fox, about the same time, being asked by the late Lord Holland what was the best speech ever made in the House of Commons, assigned the first place, without hesitation, to the great oration of Sheridan on the Oude charge. \u2014 Macaulay on Warren Hastings. Nevertheless, Lord Brougham remarks, the effect of this speech was, no doubt, owing partly to the occasion and the attendant circumstances. Although so telling at the time as an oration, it would not bear the test of perusal. Moore, who had the short-hand writer's report before him, declared it to be \" trashy bombast.\" His Speech on the Impeachment. \u2014 Mr. W. F. Rae sums up the most interesting particulars as to Sheridan's speech on this occasion : \" After tbe trial had begun, Sheridan addressed the House of Lords, as one of the managers of the impeachment, on the same charge which had been the subject of his great speech in the House of Commons. The un precedented success he had achieved on the first occasion made the second an ordeal of an unusually trying kind. To acquit himself as well a second time was to fall short of the expectations that had been raised. So greatly was the public curiosity excited, that fifty guineas were offered for a seat in Westminster Hall. He followed Burke, whose opening speech \u2014 wherein, in the name of the people of India, the Commons of England, and of human nature itself, he solemnly impeached Warren Hastings of high crimes aud misdemeanors \u2014 was one of the most finished and impassioned ever delivered by that wonderful master of language, and ever heard by an English audience. Yet Sheridan successfully bore the double test of comparison with himself and with Burke, and for three successive days electrified his hearers. Without a tithe of Burke's pro fundity, and with no portion of his genius, he was better able to influence an audience and excite their admiration, for, in addition to being an im pressive orator, he was also a consummate actor.\" \u2014 Lord Brougham men tions a trait which had its share in tbe general effect : \" His admirable manner was aided by an eye peculiarly piercing. It had the singularity of never winking.\" I Repelling Criticism. \u2014 Law (afterwards Lord Ellenborough) was called upon to settle the answer to the articles of impeachment in the Hastings trial. He was (says Lord Campbell) most afraid of Sheridan, but ventured to try to ridicule a figurative observation of his that \" the treasures in the zenana of the Begum were an offering laid by the hand of piety on the altar of a saint,\" by asking \"how the lady was to be considered a saint, and how the camels when they bore the treasure were to be laid upon the altar ?\" Sheridan : \" This is the first time in my life"], [193, "RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN. 173 that I ever heard of special pleading on a metaphor, or a bill of indict ment against a trope ; but such is the turn of the learned gentleman's mind that when ho attempts to be humorous no jest can be found, and when serious no fact is visible.\" An Unfettered Press.\u2014 The few sentences (remarks Brougham) with which Sheridan thrilled the House on the liberty of the press, in 1810, were worth, perhaps, more than all his elaborated epigrams and forced flowers on the Begum charge, or all his denunciations of Napoleon. \" Give them,\" said he, \" a corrupt House of Lords, give them a venal House of Commons, give them a tyrannical Prince, give them a truckling Court, and let me have but an unfettered Press, I will defy them to encroach a hair's breadth upon the liberties of England.\" Untimely Relief from Taxation. \u2014 Pitt having proposed a repeal of certain taxes in 1792, his policy was thus censured by Sheridan : \"A new feeling- of hope is to be inspired into the people, a new feeling of gratitude is to be planted in their bosoms \u2014 they are to be taught to petition for relief from taxes. This is a very delicate subject for gentle men to speak on ; it lays an embargo on the House. No man can put himself into the ungracious state of opposing the repeal of afflicting taxes. Who can deny to the poor family the boon of getting their candles a half penny cheaper ? Should a severe sense of duty urge any gentleman to look the true situation of the country in the face, and to oppose this artful and insidious way of attacking the privileges of tho Commons House of Parliament, I well know how easily a cry may be raised against him, and with what facility he may be made the victim of a little well managed misrepresentation. I remember a line or two of some verses made upon my honourable friend [Fox] by one of his constituents, which have never failed to produce a torrent of applause, not from the elegance of the poetry so much as from the sturdy ad captandum praise which it gives him. My friend, who with all his merits has certainly no pretension to this praise, will pardon me for repeating it : ' Whenever a tax in the House was projected, Great Fox he rose up and always objected.\" Now this, which is certainly untrue, may be turned very neatly to the detriment of those who may think it their duty to inquire before they act \u2014 to ascertain whether we really have a surplus before we give up our income ; and at any rate the grace ought to come constitutionally from that branch of the legislature which has the power of the purse, and which has been so unmercifully called on, by the same right honourable gentleman, to draw the strings. Why has he not waited and given to the House the grace of originating the measure P The truth is, it has craftily been considered as the best answer to all the imputations against him for the Russian and Spanish armaments ; so at least other men, who have less candour and respect for him than I possess, might insinuate. They might draw strange conclusions from the circumstances ; and the nation might be brought to think that blunders are more advantageous to them than wisdom\u2014 that when he is convicted of error he is distributing to"], [194, "174 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. them relief. A session without a blunder would be a session of calamity ; but an armament would be desirable. ' I have,' he might say, ' involved you in a quarrel with Spain \u2014 here, there's a tax upon malt for you. I have made the English name ridiculons all over the world by bullying Russia \u2014 here, take back the female servants, I have no use for them. I have involved you in a war with Tippoo Saib \u2014 take your candles a half penny cheaper in the pound,' Thus they are taught to love misfortune, to be enamoured of misconduct.\" His Wit and its Elaboration. \u2014 How little (says Brougham) Sheridan's wit was the inspiration of the moment all men were aware who knew his habits ; but a singular proof of this was presented by Mr. Moore, when he came to write his \" Life ; \" for we there find given to the world, with a frankness which must almost have made their author shake in his grave, the secret note-books of this famous wit ; and we are thus enabled to trace the jokes in embryo, with which he had so often made the walls of St. Stephen's shake, in a merriment excited by the happy appearance of sudden, unpremeditated effusion. Take an instance from this author, giving extracts from the commonplace book of the wit : \" He employs his fancy in his narrative, and keeps his recollections for his wit.\" Again, the same idea is expanded into \u2014 \" When he makes his jokes you applaud the accuracy of his memory, and 'tis only when he states his facts that you admire the flights of his imagination.\" But the thought was too good to be thus wasted on the desert air of a common-place book. So forth it came at the expense of Kelly, who, having been a composer of music, became a wine-merchant. \" Yon will,\" said the ready wit, \" import your music and compose your wine.\" Nor was this service exacted from the old idea thought sufficient ; so in the House of Commons an easy and apparently off-hand parenthesis was thus filled with it, at Mr. Dundas's cost and charge : \" who generally resorts to his memory for his jokes, and to his imagination for his facts.\" A Celebrated Joke. \u2014 George IV. said, in conversation with Mr. Croker, \" When I withdrew myself from the Opposition, Sheridan certainly became less forward in that party, but not solely out of any deference to me ; he had been on bad terms -with them from the very formation of their Government, and had increased their ill-humour towards him by those sentiments, which he afterwards condensed into the celebrated joke, that he had known men knock their heads against walls by accident, but that these Ministers were the first persons he ever had heard of who built the wall to knock their heads against.\" Resisting Temptation. \u2014 Once (relates Lord Byron) I saw Sheridan cry, after a splendid dinner. I had the honour of sitting next him. The occasion of his tears was some observation or other upon the subject of tho sturdiness of the Whigs in resisting office and keeping to their principles. Sheridan turned round, \" Sir, it is easy for my Lord O, or Earl G., or Marquis B., or Lord H., with thousands upon thousands a-year, some of it either presently derived or inherited in sinecure or acquisitions from the public money, to boast of their patriotism and keep aloof from temptation ; but they do not know from what temptation those have kept"], [195, "EDWARD GIBBON. 175 aloof who had equal pride, at least equal talents, and not unequal passions, and nevertheless knew not in the course of their lives what it was to have a shilling of their own.\" And in saying this he wept. An Ambiguous Compliment. \u2014 \"Before my departure from England,\" says Gibbon in his \" Autobiography,\" \" I was present at the august spectacle of Mr. Hastings' trial, in Westminster Hall. It is not my province to absolve or condemn the Governor of India, but Mr. Sheridan's eloquence demanded my applause ; nor could I hear without emotion the personal compliment which he paid me in the presence of the British nation.\" The passage in the speech of the orator that afforded so much gratification to the historian is thus reported in the Morning Chronicle, June 14th, 1788 : \" He said that the facts that made up the volume of narrative were unparalleled in atrociousness, and that nothing equal in criminality was to be traced either in ancient or modern history, in the correct periods of Tacitus, or the luminous page of Gibbon.\" On being asked by some one, at the conclusion of the speech, how he came to compliment Gibbon with the epithet \" luminous,\" Sheridan answered, in a half -whisper, \" I said ' voluminous.' \" \u2014 Byron, in his \" Monody on the Death of Sheridan,\" thus alludes to the appreciation in which a meed of praise from Sheridan was held : \u2014 \" In whose acclaim the loftiest voices vied, The praised \u2014 the proud \u2014 who made his praise their pride.\" EDWARD GIBBON. (1737\u20141794.) A Mute Member. \u2014 The historian of the Roman Empire was re turned for Liskeard in 1774, and sat in Parliament for eight sessions. Prudence, he says in his \" Autobiography,\" condemned him to acquiesce in the humble station of a mute. \" Timidity was fortified by pride, and even the success of my pen discouraged the trial of my voice.\" In a letter to a friend he writes, \" I am still a mute : it is more tremendous than I imagined ; the great speakers fill me with despair, the bad ones with terror.\" Gibbon supported Lord North's administration by his vote, and was appointed one of the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations. He was employed by the Government, at the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1778, to draw up the official manifesto on that occasion. A Contrast. \u2014 In a letter to a friend in 1783, describing his life at Lausanne, the ex-M.P. says : \" Acknowledge that such a life is more con ducive to happiness than five nights in the week passed in the House of Commons, or five mornings spent at the Custom House.\" But in his \"Autobiography \" he remarks, \" I never found my mind more vigorous, nor my composition more happy, than in the winter hurry of society and Parliament.\" His Application for Diplomatic Employment.\u2014 The follow ing letter is given in Gibbon's \"Autobiography and Correspondence.\" The communication is without date, nor does the name of the nobleman"], [196, "176 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to whom it was addressed appear : \" My Lord, \u2014 I am ignorant (as I ought to be) of the present state of our negotiations for peace; I am likewise ignorant how far I may appear qualified to co-operate in this important and salutary work. If, from any advantages of language or local connections, your lordship should think my services might be use fully employed, particularly in any future intercourse with the Court of France, permit me to say that my love of ease and literary leisure shall never stand in competition with the obligations of duty and gratitude which I owe to his Majesty's Government.\" Gibbon also applied to Lord Thurlow, soliciting an appointment as Secretary to the Embassy to Paris, in 1783. Of the result he writes : \" The scheme is completely vanished, and I support the disappointment with heroic patience.\" WILLIAM WINDHAM. (1750\u20141810.) Political Training. \u2014 In 1783, Mr. Windham was appointed principal secretary to Lord Northiugton, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Before leaving England he called upon his friend Dr. Johnson, to whom he expressed, says Boswell, some modest and virtuous doubts whether he could bring himself to practise those arts which it is supposed a person in that situation has occasion to employ. \" Don't be afraid, sir,\" said Johnson, with a pleasant smile ; \" you will soon make a very pretty rascal.\" A Very Palpable Hit. \u2014 Sometimes he would convulse the House by a happy, startling, and most unexpected allusion; as when on the Walcheren question, speaking of a coup-de-main on Antwerp, which had been its professed object, he suddenly said, \" A coup-de-main in the Scheldt ! You might as well talk of a coup-de-main in the Court of Chancery.\" Sir William Grant (Master of the Rolls) having just entered and taken his seat, probably suggested this excellent jest; and assuredly no man enjoyed it more. His habitual gravity was over powered in an instant, and he was seen absolutely to roll about on the bench which he had just occupied. \u2014 Brougham's \" Statesmen.\" Homely Saxon. \u2014 \" When some phrase of his,\" says Lord Brougham, \" long after it was first used, seemed to invite attack, and a great cheer followed, as if he had unwittingly fallen into the scrape, he stopped and added, ' Why, I said it on purpose ! ' or, as he pronounced it, ' a purpose ; ' for no man more delighted in the old pronunciation, as well as the pure Saxon idiom of our language, which yet he could enrich and dignify with the importations of classical phraseology.\" Instability.\u2014 Mr. Windham (says Earl Russell) was unstable and irresolute. He said one day to Lord Henry Petty, who was sitting beside him, towards the end of his speech, \" Which way did I say I would vote ?\" Convenient Illustration \u2014 Windham's happiness in illustration was thus alluded to by Lord John Russell, in speaking on Parliamentary Reform in 1854 : \" I know to those who do not like the measure a fit"], [197, "SIR PHILIP FRANCIS. 177 time is always wanting. Mr. Windham, who was a great master of illustration and allusion, when a measure of reform was introduced in a time of public quiet and peace, said, ' You are like the man in the Spectator, who had every symptom of the gout except the pain ; you are going to deal with a disease that causes you no inconvenience.' Times changed, and there was a vast deal of commotion, and agitation, and excitement, and still Mr. Windham opposed reform, saying, ' Surely you will not repair your house in a hurricane ! ' On both occasions he was ready with an illustration, and so it is with many of those who now say that this is not the time to introduce a measure of Parliamentary reform.\" SLR PHILIP FRANCIS. (1740\u20141818.) An Unready Speaker. \u2014 Sir Philip Francis, the reputed author of the \" Junius \" letters, was unsuccessful as a speaker. His own theory on the subject is given by Lady Francis in her \" Reminiscences :\" \u2014 \" Here I may account for his not being a ready speaker in Parliament, except when roused by indignation or feeling, when he electrified the House. He accounted for it from Lord Bacon's well-known axiom, ' Reading makes a full man, writing an exact man, speaking a ready man.' ' I had enough and too much of the former, and none of tho latter, in my youth. A vessel may be too full to part easily with its contents, and few orators are very exact men ; besides, I had too much sensibility, and felt the House was against me. The House was Pitt's, aud Pitt could not despise me, but he tried to make it believe he did.' \" Lady Francis adds another reason for his hesitation in speaking \u2014 namely, extreme anxiety to weigh every word lest it should convict him of being \" Junius.\" An Appeal from Son to Father. \u2014 Sir Nathaniel Wraxall writes as follows of Francis : \" However inferior he was to Burke in all the flowers of diction, more than once he electrified the Houso by passages of a pathos which arrested every hearer. A beautiful specimen of his ability in this point occurred during the debates on Pitt's India Bill. One of the regulations abolished the trial by jury for delinquents returning from India, and instituted a new tribunal for inquiring into their misdemeanors. Against such an inroad on the British constitution Francis entered his protest in terms of equal elegance and force. ' I am not,' said he, ' an old man, yet I remember the time when such an attempt would have roused the whole country into a flame. Had the experiment been made when the illustrious statesman, the late Earl of Chatham, enjoyed a seat in this assembly, he would have sprung from the bed of sickness, he would have solicited some friendly hand to lay him on tho floor, and thence, with a monarch's voice, ho would have called the whole kingdom to arms to oppose it. But he is dead, and has left nothing in the world that resembles him. Ho is dead ! and the sense, the honour, the character, and tho understanding of the nation are dead with him.' . . The repetition of the words, ' He is dead,' was attended with the finest effect ; and the reflections produced by it involuntarily attracted every eye N"], [198, "178 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. towards the Treasury bench, where sat his son. I have rarely witnessed a moment when the passions were touched in a more masterly manner within the walls of the House. The impression made by it on Pitt is said to have been of the deepest kind.\" GEORGE TIERNEY, (1761\u20141830.) The Fox and the Goose. \u2014 Mr. Tiemey was one of those Whigs who, partly through hostility to Mr. Pitt, and partly from a sincere gratitude for the peace abroad, and the mild aud constitutional govern ment at home, obtained for the country by Mr. Addiugton, first supported and afterwards formally joined that minister, upon his rupture with his patron and predecessor. When alluding to the difficulties the Foxites and Pittites had of passing over to join each other in attacking the Addiugton ministry, Mr. Tiemey (forgetting for the moment how easily he had himself overcome a like difficulty iu joining that ministry) alluded to the puzzle of \" the Fox and the Goose,\" and did not clearly expound his idea. Whereupon Mr. Dudley North said, \" It is himself he means \u2014 who left the Fox to go over to the Goose, and put the bag of oats in his pocket.\" \u2014 Brougham's \" Sketches.\" A Saying about Office. \u2014 Earl Russell remarks that Mr. Tierney used to say, as the fruit of his experience, that it was very difficult for a member of the House of Commons to attain high office, but that it was still more difficult to leave high office with credit on sufficient grounds. His lordship endorsed this by adding', \" The latter is, in fact, the more difficult operation of the two.\" Duty of an Opposition. \u2014 \" The duty of an Opposition,\" said Tierney, \" is to oppose everything, to propose nothing, and to turn out the Government.\" The Duel between Pitt and Tierney. \u2014 Pitt brought in a bill for the more effectual mauning of the navy, on the 25th May, 1798, and urged that it pass through all its stages in one day. Tierney opposed this \" precipitous course.\" In reply Pitt asked how the honourable gentleman's opposition to the measure was to be accounted for, but from a desire to obstruct the defence of the country. Refusing to retract or explain, Pitt received a challenge the next day from Tierney. Lord Sidmouth gives the following account of the preliminaries : \" I was dining with Lord Grosvenor when a note was brought me from Mr. Pitt stating that he had received a hostile message from Mr. Tierney, and wished me to go to him. Mr. Pitt had just made his will when I arrived. On the following day I went with Pitt and Ryder to where their chaise waited to take them to Wimbledon Common.\" On Sunday, the 27th, at three o'clock in the afternoon (says Earl Stanhope\"), the two parties met on Putney Heath. Mr. Pitt was attended by Mr. Dudley Ryder, afterwards Lord Harrowby, and Mr. Tierney by Mr. Georgo Walpole. The seconds had some conversation, and endeavoured to prevent further proceedings, but they did not prevail. The principals"], [199, "WILLIAM WILBERFORCE. 179 took their ground at tho distance of twelve paces, and fired at the same moment, each without effect. A second case of pistols was produced, and fired in the same manner, Mr. Pitt on this last occasion firing his pistol in the air. The seconds interfered, and thus ended the affair. His Style in Debate.\u2014 Lord Lytton, in \" St. Stephen's,\" gives the following graphic sketch of Tiemey's manner : \u2014 \" There is an eloquence which aims at talk \u2014 A muse, though winged, that prefers to walk ; Its easy graces so content the eye, You'd fear to lose it if it sought to fly ; Light and yet vigorous, fearless yet well bred, As once it moved in Tierney's airy tread. Carelessly, as a wit about the town Chats at your table some huge proser down, He lounged into debate, just touch'd a foe, \u2014 ' Laughter and cheers' \u2014 A touch, sir ? what a blow i Declaiming never, with a placid smile He bids you wonder why you are so vile ; One hand politely pointing out your crime. The other \u2014 in his pocket all the time.\" WILLIAM WILBERFORCE. (1759\u20141833.) Slave Trade Motions. \u2014 \"In 1787,\" said Wilberforce, \"I was staying with Pitt at Holwood \u2014 one has often a local recollection of par ticular incidents \u2014 and I distinctly remember the very knoll upon which I was sitting, near Pitt and Grenville, when the former said to me, ' Wilberforce, why don't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the slave trade ? You have already taken great pains to collect evidence, aud are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will insure you. Do not lose time, or the ground may bo occupied by another.' I did so, and upon that occasion Fox said ho had himself seriously entertained the idea of bringiug the subject before Parliament ; but ho was pleased to add that, it having got into so much better hands, he should not interfere. In 1789 I opened the question to the House. Burke, I remember, complimented me on my speech, and thanked mo for the information be bad received from it.\" As an instance of the ridiculous stories told in consequence to the speaker's disadvantage, Clarkson was travelling in a stage-coach, when, the conver sation turning on the abolition question, one of the passengers gravely said, \" Mr. Wilberforce is doubtless a great philanthropist in public, but I happen to know a little of his private history, and can assure you that he is a cruel husband, and even beats his wife.\" At this time Mr. Wilber force was a bachelor. \u2014 Harford's \"Recollections.\" His Parliamentary Dinners. \u2014 Mr. Wilberforce (says Harford) resided in Palace Yard for some time with his friend, Mr. Henry Thorn ton, as bachelors, where they kept an almost open house for members of Parliament. About three o'clock daily their friends began to drop in on their way to the House, and partook of a light dinner, the number of them N 2"], [200, "180 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. amounting to seventeen or twenty. Lord Eldon was not unfrequently one of the party. \" It delighted us,\" said Mr. Wilberforce, \" to see our friends in this way, especially as it gave us the opportunity of talking upon any important points of public business, without any great sacrifice of time. Those who came in late put up with a mutton chop or beefsteak. The Duke of Montrose called in one day as we were thus employed, but declined taking anything. Seeing, however, so many around him busy with tho knife and fork, he said, ' I cannot resist any longer,' and down he sat to a mutton chop. ' Ah ! duke,' said I, ' if your French cook could see you now, he would be quite affronted.' \" Power and Forbearance. \u2014 The singular kindness, the extreme gentleness of his disposition, wholly free from gall, from vanity, or other selfish feeling, kept him from indulging in any of tbe vituperative branches of rhetoric ; but a memorable instance showed that it was any thing rather than the want of power which held him off from the use of the weapons so often in almost all other men's hands. When a well-known and popular member thought fit to designate him repeatedly, and very irregularly, as tho \" honourable and religious gentleman,\" not because ho was ashamed of tho Cross he gloried in, but because he felt indignant at any ono in the British Senate deeming piety a matter of imputation, ho poured out a strain of sarcasm which none who heard it can ever forget. A common friend of the parties having remarked to Sir Samuel Romilly, beside whom he sat, that this greatly outmatched Pitt himself, the master of sarcasm, the reply of that great man and just observer was worthy to lie remarked : \" Yes,\" said he, \" it is the most striking thing I almost ever heard; but I look upon it as a more singular proof of Wilberforce's virtue than of his genius, for who but he ever was possessed of such a formidable weapon, and never used it?\" \u2014 Brougham's \" Statesmen.\" A Simile. \u2014 \" Few passages can be cited,\" says Brougham, \" in the oratory of modern times of a more electrical effect than Wilberforce's singularly felicitous and striking allusion to Mr. Pitt's resisting the torrent of Jacobin principles : ' He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was stayed.' \" Repenting of his Vote. \u2014 Lord Sidmouth told us that one morning at a Cabinet meeting, after an important debate in the House of Commons (tho subject of which he had forgotten), some one said, \" I wonder how Wilberforce voted last night.\" On which Lord Liverpool observed, \" I do* not know how he voted ; but this I am pretty sure of, that iu whatever way he voted, ho repents of his vote this morning.\" Lord Sidmouth added, \" It was odd enough that I had no sooner returned to my office than Wilberforce was announced, who said, ' Lord Sidmouth, you will be sur prised at the vote I gave last night, and, indeed, I am not myself altogether satisfied with it ! ' To which I replied, * My dear Wilberforce, I shall never bo surprised at any vote you may give.' Pursuing the con versation, I soon convinced him that he had really voted wrong, when he said, ' Dear me, I wish I had seen you last night before the debate.' \"\u2014 Life of Lord Sidmouth."], [201, "SIR SAMUEL ROMILLY. 181 SIR SAMUEL ROMILLY. (1757\u20141818.) An Advanced Liberal. \u2014 Romilly, who was identified with all tho liberal measures, and the political activity in a liberal direction, of the \u25a0early part of the nineteenth century, entered Parliament in 1806, when close upon fifty years of age ; and he was appointed Solicitor-General in the administration of which Fox was a leading member. Having sat for one pocket borough after another, in 1818 he was elected for West minster ; but the death of his wife in the same year had such an effect upon his mind that he destroyed himself. He was to the last one of the foremost spirits of the philanthropical party. Barbarians. \u2014 Earl Russell writes, in his \" Recollections :\" Sir Samuel Romilly tried to amend our criminal law; Lord Castlereagh successfully obstructed his progress. The same great and liberal man proposed to make freehold property subject to the payment of simple contract debts ; the law officers of the Crown would not hear of so dangerous an innovation. One of the Crown lawyers said that it was a mistake to say the law dated from the reign of Henry VIII. ; that its origin was as far back as the time of Edward I. \" What care I,\" retorted Romilly, \" whether this law was made by one set of barbarians or another p\" The Reform of the Criminal Code. \u2014 The name of reform in the criminal law had not been heard in the House of Commons for fifty eight years, when, in 1808, Romilly carried his bill for tho abolition of the punishment of death for privately stealing from the person to the value of five shillings ; in other words, for picking pockets. Romilly approached the subject of this reform with a caution which now looks almost like weakness. His object was originally to raise the valuo according to which a theft was rendered capital. In January, 1808, ho gave up the intention of bringing forward even this limited measure \u2014 ho was sure the judges would not approve of it. To another distinguished lawyer belongs the credit of having urged Romilly to a bolder policy. His friend Scarlett, he says, \" had advised me not to content myself with merely raising the amount of the value of property, the stealing of which is to subject the offender to capital punishment, but to attempt at once to repeal all the statutes which punish with death mere thefts unaccompanied by any act of violence, or other circumstance of aggravation. This sugges tion was very agreeable to me. But, as it appeared to me that I had no chance of being able to carry through the House a bill which was to expunge at once all these laws from the statute-book, I determined to attempt the repeal of them one by one, and to begin with the most odious of them, the Act of Queen Elizabeth which makes it a capital offence to steal privately from the person of another.\" Upon this prudential principle Romilly carried his first reform in 1808. \u2014 Martineau's History of the Peace. Modern Philosophy v. \" Experience.\"\u2014 The constant argument employed against the alterations proposed by Romilly in the criminal"], [202, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 182 laws was this\u2014 that of late years the offences which they undertook to repress were greatly increased. Justly did Romilly say, \" A better reason than this for altering the law could hardly be given.\" On the 24th of May, 1811, when three of Romilly's bills were rejected in the House of Lords, Lord Ellenborough declared, \" They went to alter those laws which a century had proved to be necessary, and which were now to be overturned by speculation and modern philosophy.\" Lord Chancellor Eldon, on the same occasion, stated that he had himself early in life felt a disposition to examine the principles on which our criminal code was framed, \" before observation and experience had matured his judg ment. Since, however, he had learned to listen to these great teachers in this important science, his ideas had greatly changed, and he saw the wisdom of the principles and practice by which our criminal code was regulated.\" Although Eldon frequently gave effectual opposition to Romilly's measures, the old Lord Chancellor, we are told, was unusually affected by his death. As he took his seat in court the following morning, \"he was struck by the sight of the vacant place which Romilly was accustomed to occupy, and bis eyes filled with tears. ' I cannot stay here/ he exclaimed, aud, rising in great agitation, broke up his court.\" SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH. (1765\u20141832.) A Philosopher's Peculiarities. \u2014 Unparliamentary Style. \u2014 Mackintosh entered the House of Commons in 1813 with a high reputation from his forensic oratory, but he failed to sustain it in Parlia ment. A contemporary in Colburn's New Monthly for 1832 (edited by Bulwer Lytton) gives a picture of the philosophic orator, then just deceased: \" We ourselves heard Sir James Mackintosh's great, almost wonderful, speech upon Reform. We shall never forget the extensive range of ideas, the energetic grasp of thought, the sublime and soaring strain of legislative philosophy with which he charmed and transported us ; but it was not so with the House in general. His Scotch accent, his unceasing and laboured vehemence of voice and gesture ; the refined and speculative elevation of his views, and the vast heaps of hoarded knowledge he some what prolixly produced, displeased the taste and wearied the attention of men who were far more anxious to be amused and excited than instructed or convinced. We see him now, his bald and singularly formed head working to and fro, as if to collect and then shake out his ideas ; his arm violently vibrating, and his body thrown forward by sudden quirks and starts, which, ungraceful as they were, seemed rather premeditated than inspired.\" Mackintosh's eloquence, remarks the same writer, like that of Burke aud Brougham, appeared \" addressed to another audience than that to which it was actually delivered. Intended for the House of Commons only, the style would have been absurdly faulty ; intended for the public, it was august and correct.\" Macaulay thus alludes to Mackin tosh's deficiency in Parliament : \" His talents were not those which enable a speaker to produce with rapidity a series of striking but transi-"], [203, "SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH. 183 tory impressions \u2014 to excite the minds of five hundred gentlemen at mid- night, without saying anything that any one of them will be able to re- member in the morning.\" An Attack on Prejudice.\u2014 The following characteristic passage is from a celebrated speech by Sir James Mackintosh on the reform of the old Criminal Laws : \" If a foreigner were to form his estimate of the people of England from a consideration of their penal code, he would un- doubtedly conclude that they were a nation of barbarians. This expres- sion, though strong, would be unquestionably true; for what other opinion could a humane foreigner form of us when he found that in our criminal law there were two hundred criminal offences against which the punish- ment of death was denounced, upon twenty of which only that punish- ment was ever inflicted \u2014 that we were savage in our threats, and yet were feeble in our execution of punishments\u2014 that we cherished a system which in theory was odious, but which was impotent in practice from its very severity \u2014 that in cases of high treason we involved innocent children in all tho consequences of their father's guilt \u2014 that in cases of corruption of blood we were even still more cruel, punishing the offspring when we could not reach the parent \u2014 and that on some occasions we oven proceeded to wreak vengeance upon the bodies of the inanimate dead ? If the same person were told that we were the same nation which had been the first to give full publicity to every part of our judicial system \u2014 that wo were the same nation which had established the trial by jury, which, blamable as it might be in theory, was so invaluable in practice \u2014 that we were tho same nation which had found out the greatest security which had ever been devised for individual liberty, the writ of habeas corpus, as settled by the Act of Charles II. \u2014 that wo were the same nation which had dis- covered the full blessings of a representative government, and which had endeavoured to diffuse them throughout every part of our free empire, he would wonder at the strange anomalies of human nature which could unite things that were in themselves so totally incompatible. If the same foreigner were, in addition to this, told that the abuses which struck so forcibly on his attention were the abuses of the olden time, whicli were rather overlooked than tolerated, he might perhaps relent in his judgment, and confer upon us a milder denomiuation than that of barbarians ; but if, on the contrary, he were told that influence aud authority, learning and ingenuity, had combined to resist all reformation of these abuses as dangerous innovations \u2014 if he were informed that individuals who, from their rank and talents, enjoyed not an artificial but a real superiority, rose to vindicate the worst of these abuses, even the outrages on the dead, and to contend for them as bulwarks of the constitution and land- marks of legislation, he would revert to his first sentiments regarding us though he might perhaps condemn the barbarism of the present instead of the barbarism of the past generation.\" Things taken for Granted. \u2014 \" How is it,\" Mackintosh was once asked, \" I never hear a word about the blessings of liberty, aud the glory of the British Constitution, in your debates?\" \"Because we take all that for granted,\" was his reply."], [204, "184 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. A Precaution. \u2014 I remember (writes Earl Russell) that in 1819, after the Manchester meeting known by the name of Peterloo, I was staying in the house of Sir James Mackintosh, in the country. We read every day in the newspapers accounts of meetings; it was generally stated that the meeting at Manchester, although legal, had been attacked and dispersed by military force. Sir James said to me, \" It will be worth while to look at my law-books, and see whether this assumption that the meeting at Manchester was legal is founded in law.\" We soon found reason to conclude that the Manchester meeting was an illegal meeting. Sir James Mackintosh and I agreed that in the approaching session of Parliament we would not affirm the legality of the Manchester meeting. FRANCIS HORNER. (1778\u20141817.) His First Canvass. \u2014 On the 19th of October, 1806, Francis Horner received an offer of a seat in Parliament from Lord Kinnaird, which he accepted, untrammelled by any conditions. St. Ives was the borough destined for him, and in a letter to his mother from that place he gives some account of the election proceedings. \" I am glad enough,\" he says, \" none of you were here to quiz me as I went through my duty ; entering every cellar in the place, and behaving as sweet as possible to every man, woman, and child. I did sometimes feel ashamed of myself, I own, and there were some hovels that went against my stomach, if it had not been for the number of pretty women, three or four of them quite beautiful, whom I found in these hovels.\" Treaties of Peace. \u2014 Mr. Horner took part in the debate which arose on the treaties of peace entered into consequent on the downfall of Napoleon. A speech delivered by him in the House of Commons, February 20th, 1816, attracted much attention at the time. Referring to the guarantees to be exacted from France, he said : \" The real security which was required from France, after the destruction of that military monarchy which oppressed the greatest part of the continent of Europe, combined the integrity of that kingdom with the establishment of a government agreeably to the wishes and deserving of the confidence of the people. The question of territorial cession had been discussed at great length, and he would merely state that, in his opinion, any attempt to dismember France, instead of being likely to afford any security for the continuance of peace, would be the certain source of inquietude and danger. . . There was no chance of the stability of peace if guarantees were sought for in measures that must be galling and irritating to the French people ; there was no chance of continued tranquillity but in conciliatory arrangements ; there was no chance of reconciling them to Europe but by allowing them to establish the government they liked. Wo could never rationally entertain confidence in the pacific dispositions of people upon whom we forced a government of conquest, which we main tained by arms.\""], [205, "HENRY ADDINGTON, LORD SIDMOUTH. 185 An Element of Stability. \u2014 Referring to the motion in the House of Commons for a new writ for St. Mawes in the room of Francis Horner, March 6th, 1817, and to the encomiums on the character of the deceased member embodied in the motion, Sir James Mackintosh, writing in his Journal, says : \"A Howard introduced, and an English House of Commons adopted, the proposition of thus honouring the memory of a man of thirty-eight, the son of a shopkeeper, who never filled an office, or had the power of obliging a living creature, and whose grand title to this distinction was the belief of his virtue. How honourable to the age and to the House ! A country where such sentiments prevail is not ripe for destruction.\" HENRY ADDINGTON, LORD SIDMOUTH. (1755\u20141844.) Respectable Mediocrity. \u2014 Henry Addiugton (Viscount Sidmouth) was nicknamed \" the Doctor,\" his father having been physician to tho elder Pitt. Earl Russell says of him, \" He was a man of average understanding, equal to the requirements of quiet times, of respectable prejudices, and undoubted courage ; but as minister for a great emergency he excited only ridicule and contempt. Little could he withstand the daily epigrams of Canning, and the scarcely more endurable compassion of Sheridan : \u2014 ' As London is to Paddington, So is Pitt to Addiugton.' ' When his speeches lag most vilely, Cheer him, cheer him, Brother Hile;. When his speeches vilely lag, Cheer him, cheer him, Brother Bragge.' ' The Pells* for his son, the pills for himself.' These and a thousand other arrows which wit squandered upon Addington utterly ruined him in public opinion.\" Spoiling Nature. \u2014 On the 8th of June, 1789, Addiugton, who had just completed his thirty-second year, was elevated to the dignity of Speaker of the House of Commons. Mr. Gilpin, in a congratulatory note, writes on that occasion : \" I was in some little pain at first how you could restrain the natural modesty of your disposition on so sudden an elevation to one of the most awful posts I know ; but Sir John Dayley and other gentlemen gave such an account of your setting out, that all apprehensions for you are now over; and I have only to regret, as a picturesque man, that such an enlightened countenance as God Almighty has given you should be shrouded in a bush of horsehair.\" _ A Cabinet of Mediocrities. \u2014 The following story was told by John Hookham Frere : \"I remember old Lord W . the father of the present lord, a fine specimen of a thorough-going old country Tory, coming to call on my father to tell him that Pitt was out of office, * The sinecure of Clerk of the Pells."], [206, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 186 and that Addiugton had formed a ministry. He went through all the members of the new Cabinet, and, rubbing his hands at the end, with an evident sense of relief, said, ' Well, thank God, we have at last got a ministry without one of those confounded men of genius in it !' \" A Necessary Evil. \u2014 Lord Dalling remarks in his \" Life of Palmerston \" that the necessity of pleasing George III. introduced Addington into so many administrations, as to justify Mr. Canning's criticism that he was like the small-pox, that everyone was obliged to have once in their lives. A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing. \u2014 A few days before the declaration of war with France, in 1803, a warlike message from the Crown was sent to Parliament. Addiugton, then being minister, appeared in the full dress of the Windsor uniform, and strutted up the house in the midst of a burst of laughter, just as the Speaker was reading a medicine bill. \" It must have been on this occasion,\" says Earl Russell, \" that Sheridan redoubled the laughter of the House by saying, ' The right hon. gentleman, who has appeared this evening in the character of a sheep in wolf's clothing,' &c. In fact, nothing could be more tragical than the occasion, nothing more comical than the chief actor iu the tragedy.\" A Royal Appeal. \u2014 Mr. Addiugton used to tell his friends that at the interview with which he was honoured on the 10th of May, 1804, the King again pressed upon him the acceptance of the peerage and pension, in terms which it must have been very difficult for so devoted a subject to resist: \"You are a proud man, Mr. Addington, but I am a proud man too ; and why should I sleep uneasy on my pillow because you will not comply with my request ? Why should I feel the consciousness that I have suffered you to ruin your family, and that through your attachment to me ? \" Taking Things Coolly. \u2014 At the time of the trial of Queen Caroline (1820) the general transports raised the popular exasperation against Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth, the supposed authors of the proceedings, to the highest point ; they never appeared in the streets without being booted and reviled by the mob, and both daily received anonymous letters threatening them with instant death if the bill against her Majesty were not abandoned. These intrepid men, however, disre garded those threats, and walked about the streets as usual, without any attendants; and the people, admiring this spirit, abstained from actual violence. One clay at this time they were walking together in Parliainent street, when, being recognised, a large mob got up round them, and they were violently hooted. \" Here we go,\" said Lord Sidmouth, \" the two most popular men in England.\" \"Yes,\" replied Lord Castlereagh, \" through a grateful and admiring multitude.\" \u2014 Alison's \" Life of Castle reagh.\" LORD CASTLEREAGH.

It was with some an amusement to beguile the tedious hours of their uuavoidable attendance upon the poor, tawdry, ravelled thread of his sorry discourse, to collect a kind of ana from the fragments of mixed, incongruous, and disjointed images that frequently appeared in it. \" The features of the clause ; \" \" the ignorant impatience of the relaxation of taxation ; \" \" sets of cir cumstances coming up and circumstances going down;\" \" men turning their backs upon themselves ; \" \" the honourable and learned gentleman's wedge getting into the loyal feelings of the manufacturing classes ; \"\" \" the constitutional principle wound up in the bowels of the monarchical principle ; \" \" the Herculean labour of the honourable and learned member, who will find himself quite disappointed when he has at last brought forth his Hercules \" (by a slight confounding of his mother's labour, which produced that hero, with his own exploits which gained him immortality) \u2014 these are but a few, and not the richest samples, by any means, of a. rhetoric which often baffled alike the gravity of the Treasury bench aud the art of the reporter, and left the wondering audience at a loss to con jecture how anyone could ever exist, endowed with humbler pretensions to the name of orator. \u2014 Historical Sketches of Statesmen. Courageous Leadership. \u2014 When the Tory party, \" having a devil,\" preferred Lord Castlereagh to Mr. Canning for their leader, all men naturally expected that he would entirely fail to command even the attendance of the House while he addressed it, aud that the benches, empty during his time, would only be replenished when his highly-gifted competitor rose. They were greatly deceived ; they under-rated the effect of place and power ; they forgot that the representative of a Government speaks \" as one having authority, and not as the scribes ; \" but they also forgot that Lord Castlereagh had some qualities well fitted to conciliate favour, and even to provoke admiration, in the absence of everything like eloquence, and without ever having written a line in tho Anti-Jacobin. He was a bold and fearless man : the very courage with which he exposed himself unabashed to the most critical audience in the world, while incap able of uttering two sentences of anything but the meanest matter, in the most wretched language ; the gallantry with which he faced the greatest difficulties of a question ; the unflinching perseverance with which he went through a whole subject, leaving untouched not one of its points, whether he could grapple with it or no, and not one of the adverse argu ments, however forcibly and felicitously they had been urged \u2014 neither daunted by recollecting the impression just made by his antagonist's dis play, nor damped by consciousness of the very rags in which he now presented himself \u2014 all this made him, upon the whole, rather a favourite with the audience whose patience he was taxing mercilessly, and whoso gravity he ever and anon put to a very severe trial.

Light out of Darkness. \u2014 On one occasion (relates Earl Russell) Castlereagh had gone on for an hour speaking upon what subject no man \u00abould guess, when he exclaimed of a sudden, \" So much, Mr. Speaker, for the law of nations.\" At another time, when he had spoken for an hour tediously and confusedly, he declared, \" I have now proved that the Tower of London is a common law principle.\" \u2014 \" Before he spoke,\" said Lord Granville, \" he would collect what he could on the subject, but never spoke above the level of a newspaper. Had three things in his favour : tact, good humour, and courage.\" \u2014 Thomas Moore's answer to the question, \" Why is a pump like Viscount Castlereagh ? \" will be remembered \u2014 Because it is a slender thing of wood, That up and down its awkward arm doth sway, And coolly spout and spout and spout away, In one weak, washy, everlasting flood.\" But some could see much more in Castlereagh than his opponents would allow. Thus Lytton, in \" St. Stephen's \" \u2014 \" They much, in truth, misjudge him who explain His graceless language by a witless brain. So firm his purpose, so resolved his will, It almost seem'd a craft to speak so ill \u2014 As if, like Cromwell, flashing towards his end, Through cloudy verbiage none could comprehend.\" Ignorant Impatience of Taxation.\u2014 Lord Castlereagh (says Alison) was at times eminently imprudent in expression, especially in those curt and pithy sayings which are easily recollected, and strike between wind and water the prevailing prejudices of the day. His sayings on these occasions were generally perfectly true, but that only rendered them more provoking, and induced the greater hostility against him. Never was a truer expression than \" the ignorant impatience of taxation,\" of which he complained when the income-tax was thrown out in 1816. \u2014 Life of Castlereagh. Mr. Gladstone quoted this phrase when he introduced his \" Commercial Treaty \" budget in 1860. He said, \" It was Lord Londonderry* who complained of the people of England as exhibiting an ' ignorant impatience of taxation ; ' but I think, were he to rise from the dead and again take his place in this House, he would be very much more likely to complain of an ignorant patience of taxation.\" * Castlereagh' s later title."], [209, "LORD CASTLEREAGH. 189 The Currycomb of the House. \u2014 The following entry appears in the Journal of Sir James Mackintosh : \" March 22nd, 1817. F said it was delightful to see how completely the currycomb of the House of Commons had taken off all the gilding and lackering that Castlereagh had brought from the Congress.\" Insulting Language in Parliament. \u2014 Nothing could be more just than the rebuke which, as connected with the question of personal courage, we may recollect his administering to a great man who had passed the limits of Parliamentary courtesy. \" Every one must be sensible,\" he said, \" that if any personal quarrel were desired, any insult ing language used publicly where it could not be met as it deserved, was the way to prevent and not to produce such a renconnter.\" \u2014 Brougham's \" Statesmen.\" It was Grattan who had attacked Castlereagh in the Irish Parliament, charging him with puerility, arrogance, and presumption. The reply raised him much in the estimation of the House. Castlereagh, however, afterwards felt inclined to send Grattan a message, but was dissuaded by his friends, who represented to him that by doing so he would be quitting the high ground on which he stood. His Duel with Canning. \u2014 Unknown (says Alison) to Lord Castle reagh, and without giving him the slightest reason to suspect its exist ence, a party had been formed in the Cabinet inimical to him, and tho object of which was to get him removed from his position as Minister at War, and Lord Wellesley substituted in his room. This was arranged by the whole Cabinet, with the exception of his lordship, as early as the 4th of April, 1809. It was not till Lord Castlereagh was shown the corre spondence of Mr. Canning by Mr. Perceval that ho showed any resent ment or unpleasant feeling on the subject. It was from that ho learned how early his removal had been consented to by his Majesty and his colleagues, and it was in that he met with passages which induced him to challenge Mr. Canning. . . Lord Castlereagh, conceiving that the whole was an intrigue of Mr. Canning's to get him removed from office in order to facilitate his own advancement, and that he himself had been ill used by being allowed so long, and at so critical a juncture, to retain tho responsibility of office, when his removal had not been only resolved on by the Cabinet, but submitted to his Majesty and approved by him, sent Mr. Canning a challenge. The parties met on Putney Heath, September 21st, and exchanged shots. Mr. Canning's fire did not take effect ; but that of Lord Castlereagh inflicted a severe flesh wound on the thigh of his adversary. Castlereagh in the Cabinet.\u2014 The letters given in the \" Memoirs and Correspondence\" of Castlereagh, edited by his brother, show the high estimation in which his personal qualities were held by his colleagues. Lord Ripon relates an anecdote of his firmness. Castlereagh was at the council when the question was raised respecting the reinforcement of Blucher's section of the Allied Army with two corps of Bernadotte's, without previous communication with the latter. \"The moment he understood that, militarily speaking, the proposed plan was indispensable to success, he took his line. He stated that, in that case, the plan must"], [210, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 190 be adopted, and the necessary orders immediately given ; that England had a right to expect that her allies would not be deterred from a decisive course by any such difficulties as bad been urged ; and he boldly took upon hiinself the responsibility of any consequences as regarded the Crown Prince of Sweden. His advice prevailed ; Blueher's army was reinforced in time; the battle of Laonwas fought successfully, and no further efforts of Buonaparte could oppose the march of the Allies on Paris, and the triumphant occupation of that city.\" \u2014 Sir Robert Peel said, \" I doubt whether any public man (with the exception of the Duke of Wellington), within the last half century, possessed the combination of qualities, intel lectual and moral, which would have enabled him to effect, under the same circumstances, what Lord Londonderry did effect in regard to the union with Ireland, and to the great political transactions of 1813, 1814, and 1815. To do these things required a rare union of high and generous feelings.\" Suggested as Prime Minister. \u2014 Mr. Charles Arbuthnot wrote respecting Castlereagh to Mr. Croker: \"Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, was not a favourite of George IV. His Majesty always preferred having confidential communications with Lord Castlereagh, in which Lord Liverpool not only acquiesced, but was also glad that his colleague should relieve him from personal discussions with the sovereign. Upon one occasion Lord Liverpool begged that I would see Lord Castlereagh, and let him know that, after the close of the session, he was resolved to retire, and that, considering him as the proper person in their Cabinet to succeed him, he wished to have a communication with him on the subject.\" Nothing, however, came of it. A Lover of Ireland. \u2014 \"It is said,\" remarks Earl Russell, \"that when Grattan's friends were assembled round his bed, the dying patriot said to them, ' Don't be hard upon Castlereagh \u2014 he loves our country.' It is added that when Lord Castlereagh heard of these words of his great opponent, he burst into tears. I cannot vouch for the truth of this anec dote, but I think it probably authentic.\" Death of Castlereagh. \u2014 The following are the particulars given by Sir A. Alison:\u2014 On tbe 9th of August, 1822, the Duke of Wel lington was so much struck with the manner of Lord Castlereagh that, after walking with him to the Foreign Office, he went to his medical attendant, Dr. Bankhead, and not finding him at home, wrote a letter expressing his apprehensions, and not obscurely hinting at mental delusions. Dr. Bankhead no sooner received this alarming intelligence than he went out to Cray Farm, Lord Castlereagh's seat in Kent, and seeing the Duke of Wellington's fears too well founded, he slept in tho house the next two nights, and gave orders to his valet to remove the razors from his lordship's dressing-case, and take other precautions against self-destruction. He did so without being observed ; but, unfor tunately, not recollecting that there was a penknife belonging to the case in one of the drawers of the washing-stand, he neglected to secure it. The consequences were fatal. During the 10th and 11th of August Castlereagh remained in bed, wandering, but expressing no alarming"], [211, "HENRY GRATTAN. jgi intentions. On the morning of the 12th of August, Lady Londonderry, who was with him, reported that he had passed a restless night, and that ho wished to see Dr. Bankhead, who was in an adjoining apartment. When Dr. Bankhead went into his dressing-room, he found him standing opposite the window, looking out, with his hands above his head, his throat cut and bleeding profusely. Consciousness, as is often the case, returned with the flow of blood. He threw his arms round the doctor's neck, and saying, in a feeble voice, \"Bankhead, let me fall on your arm; I have opened my neck ; it is all over ! \" sank on the ground and expired. HENRY GRATTAN. (1750\u20141820.) Preparation for Parliamentary Life. \u2014 Grattan had taken a residence near Windsor Forest, where he was preparing sedulously for his future destination by addressing imaginary audiences. His landlady took such manifestations much to heart. \" What a sad thing it was,\" she would say, \" to see the poor young gentleman all day talking to somebody he calls Mr. Speaker, when there's no speaker in the house except himself.\" Grattan's Manner in Speaking. \u2014 The chief difficulty (says Phillips) in this great speaker's way was the first five minutes. During his exordium laughter was imminent. He bent his body almost to tho ground ; swung his arms over his head, up and down and around him ; and added to the grotesqueness of his manner a hesitating tone and drawling emphasis. Truly, indeed, might it be said of him as he said of Chatham, \"he was very great, aud very odd.\" For a time the eye dis sented from the verdict of the mind ; but at last his genius carried all before it, and, as in the oracles of old, the contortions vanished as tho inspirations became manifest. His Grant of \u00c650.000.\u2014 In April, 1782, Grattan moved a resolu tion in the Irish Parliament, the main purport of which was the repeal of the statute of George I. by which England claimed a right to legislate for Ireland. He was at the time (says the Annual Register) in a most feeble state of health, his frame seemed bent down by debility, and every one supposed he must have sunk under the exertion. But as he proceeded he warmed with the subject, appeared to shake off not merely illness, but mortality, and, amid the tumultuous enthusiasm of the House, he carried his resolution, \" That no power on earth could make laws to bind Ireland except her own King, Lords, and Commons.\" The motion was after wards proposed and carried in the English Parliament. The delight and gratitude of the people were unbounded ; addresses poured iu on him from every village in Ireland, and statues were voted to his memory. The Parliament also voted him a grant of 50,000/., as some testimony of the estimation in which he was held. The grant of public money subsequently gave rise to a bitter dispute between Grattan and Flood in the house, which is commemorated in the following epigrammatic dialogue: \u2014"], [212, "192 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. '\u25a0' Question.\u2014 Say, what has given to Flood a mortal wound ? Answer.\u2014 Grattan's obtaining fifty thousand pound. Question. \u2014 Can Flood forgive an injury so sore ? Answer. \u2014 Yes, if they give him fifty thousand more.' His Oratory leading to the Expulsion of the Students. \u2014 The students of Trinity College, Dublin, were allowed free access to the Irish House of Commons to hear the debates, and, in 1792, better accom modation was provided for them than for the public who obtained admis sion by members' orders. \" This proud distinction the gownsmen, how ever, soon forfeited. Lord Fitzwilliam had been sent over as a popular viceroy, and, on his sudden recall, a strong feeling of disappointed pre vailed. On a night when the subject was brought before the House, our gallery was full, and I remember well the irrepressible excitement that seemed to actuate us all. At length it broke out. Grattan rose to depre cate the measure, as one calculated to cause the greatest disturbance in Ireland, by what was considered the perfidy of the Government, first exciting the high hopes of the people by promised measures of liberal policy, and then dashing them, by the sudden removal of the man who had been sent over expressly to accomplish them. At the conclusion of Grattan's inflammatory speech, the enthusiasm in the gallery was no longer capable of restraint. We rose as one man, shouting and cheering with the boisterous tumult of a popular meeting. When this subsided, Foster's (the Speaker's) peculiar voice was heard through his nose, ordering the students' gallery to bo cleared, and a sergeant-at-arms, with a posse of messengers, entered among us. We were pushed out in a heap without the slightest ceremony, and were never again suffered to enter as privileged persons.\" \u2014 Ireland Sixty Years Ago (1847). Party and Place. \u2014 Attacking the administration on one occasion in tho Irish House of Commons, Grattan made the following remarks : \" Sir, I will tell gentlemen what description of party is beneficial : party united on public principle, by the bond of certain specific public measures, which measures cannot be carried by individuals, and can only succeed by party. . . I have submitted a description of a party which I conceive to be a public benefit ; I will state to you a description of a party which I conceive to be a public curse : if party it can be called which is worse than a faction, aud nothing more than an impudent phalanx of political mercenaries, coining from their little respective offices to vote for their bribe and vapour for their character ; who have neither the principles of patriotism nor ambition, nor party nor honour ; who are governed not by deliberation but discipline, and lick the hands that feed and worship the patron who bribes them. Degraded men, disgraceful tribe ! When they vote for measures, they are venal ; when such men talk against party, they are impudent.\" Infirmity Overcome.\u2014 On the 15th of January, 1800, the parlia mentary session was opened in Ireland with a speech from the throne. Sir Laurence Parsons moved an amendment to the effect that it was their interest and their duty to maintain the local Parliament. A long debate ensued, which was carried far into the morning, when a scene occurred"], [213, "HENRY GRATTAN. 193 that seemed the climax of this exciting contest. \" J nst when Mr. Egan had risen to speak, the doors of the House of Commons were thrown open, and Henry Grattan, who had been returned for Wicklow the night before, entered the house. His form was emaciated by sickness, and his face was worn with anxiety ; his limbs tottered ; he was obliged to lean upon his friends Arthur Moore and George Ponsonby ; he advanced slowly to the table. Acting on the impulse of his really noble nature, Castlereagh rose at the head of the Treasury bench, and remained standing and uncovered while the patriot took the oaths. Grattan then moved slowly to his seat, selecting a place beside Mr. Plunket, and having obtained per mission to speak sitting, he addressed the House for nearly two hours in a speech of great power.\" \u2014 Life of Lord Plunket. An Unready Writer. \u2014 Grattan was utterly incapable (said Curran) of writing the simplest thing with rapidity. Upon one occasion he lost an important motion in the Irish House of Commons by his defect in this respect. The House being with him, the Speaker asked him to commit his motion to writing. Four lines would have embraced it, but Grattan wrote and tore, and wrote and tore, till, the House losing its patience, a ministerial member proposed that instead of a formal resolution of the House, the minister should give a verbal pledge, to which Grattan assented, and thus the motion was lost. \" Dragons' Teeth.\"\u2014 On the 24th of November, 1779, Mr. Grattau proposed the following short and decisive resolution in the Irish Parlia ment : \" That at this time it would be inexpedient to grant new taxes.\" This was carried against the Government by a majority of 123. On the ensuing day it was moved that the appropriated duties should be granted for six months only. This also was carried against the Government by a majority of 38. It was in this debate that Mr. Burgh, then Prime Serjeant, made a brilliant speech, which produced electric effects in the house and galleries, but which in a letter from the Viceroy was termed \" great violence.\" They rose in a mass and cheered him re peatedly as he concluded \u2014 \" Talk not to me of peace ; Ireland is not in a state of peace ; it is smothered war. England has sown her laws like dragons' teeth, and they have sprung up in armed men.\" \u2014 Grattan's Life and Times. Negative Defence. \u2014 On one occasion, in the Irish Parliament, Mr. Fitzgibbon had attacked Mr. Grattan, who was not at that time present. Mr. Yelverton defended his absent friend, saying, \" The learned gentleman has stated what Mr. Grattan is ; I will state what he is not. He is not styed in his prejudices ; he does not trample on the resusci tation of his country, or live like a caterpillar on the decline of her pro sperity; he does not stickle for the letter of the constitution with the affectation of a prude, and abandon its principles with the effrontery of a prostitute.\" A Pitiful Failure. \u2014 When Dr. Lucas, a very unpopular man, ventured on a speech in the Irish Parliament, and failed altogether, Henry Grattan said, \" Ho rose without a friend, and sat down without au enemy.\""], [214, "194 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Waiting for the Signal. \u2014 \" I have heard,\" says Lord Byron, \"that when Grattan made his first speech in the English Commons, it was for some minutes doubtful whether to laugh at or cheer him. The debut of his predecessor, Flood, had been a complete failure, under nearly similar circumstances ; but when the ministerial part of our senators had watched Pitt (their thei-mometer) for the cue, and saw him nod repeatedly his stately nod of approbation, they took the hint from their huntsman, and broke out into the most rapturous cheers. Grattan's speech, indeed, deserved them ; it was a chef-d'oeuvre.\" When he rose (says Phillips) every voice in that crowded bouse was hushed \u2014 the great rivals, Pitt and Fox, riveted their eyes on him. He strode forth and gesticulated \u2014 the hush became ominous \u2014 not a cheer was heard \u2014 men looked in one another's faces and then at the phenomenon before them, as if doubting his identity ; at last, and on a sudden, the indication of the master spirit came. Pitt was the first generously to recognise it ; he smote his thigh hastily with his hand \u2014 it was an impulse when he was pleased \u2014 his followers saw it and knew it, and with a universal burst they hailed the advent and the triumph of the stranger. HENRY FLOOD. (1732\u20141791.) A Wooden Oracle. \u2014 One of Flood's methods of \"disquieting\" a minister (remarks Phillips) was the plying him with inconvenient questions. On one of these occasions, in the Irish Parliament, the Secretary referred him to some subaltern who was absent. \" Well, well,\" said he, \" I must be content to wait. Formerly the oak of Dodona uttered its own oracles ; but the wooden oracle of our Treasury is compelled to give his responses by deputy.\" Whipping the \"Whip.\" \u2014 Flood once affrighted the \"whipper-in\" of the Irish House, as he crossed him during his speech, presumedly to pursue his usual negotiations among the members. \" What,\" he cried, '\u2022 is that I see ? Shall the Temple of Freedom be still haunted by the foul fiend of bribery and corruption ? I see personified before me an incar nation of that evil principle which lives by the destruction of public virtue.\" Retaliation. \u2014 Lord Byron relates that Conrtenay silenced Flood in the English House by a crushing reply to a hasty debut of the rival of Grattan in Ireland. \" I asked Court enay (for I like to trace motives) if ho had not some personal provocation ; for the acrimony of his answer seemed to me, as I read it, to involve it. Conrtenay said he had ; that, when in Ireland (being an Irishman), at the bar of the Irish House of Commons, Flood had made a personal and unfair attack upon himself, who, not being a member of that House, could not defend himself ; and that some years afterwards the opportunity of retort offering in the English Parliament, he could not resist it. He certainly repaid Flood with interest, for Flood never made any figure, and only made a speech or two afterwards, in the English House of Commons. I must except, however, his speech on"], [215, "195 JOHN PHILPOT CURRAN. reform, in 1790, which Fox called the best speech he ever heard upon that subject.\" Transplanted Too Late. \u2014 Grattan, in a review of some of his Irish contemporaries, thus wrote of Flood, after the death of the latter : \"Mr. Flood, my rival, as he has been called \u2014 aud I should be nnworthy the character of his rival if in his grave I did not do him justice \u2014 he had faults, but he had great powers, great public effect. He persuaded the old, he inspired the young ; the castle vanished before him. On a small subject he was miserable ; put into his band a distaff, aud, like Hercules, he made sad work of it ; but give him the thunderbolt, and he had the arm of a Jupiter. He misjudged when he transferred himself to the English Parliament ; he forgot that he was a tree of the forest, too old and too great to be transplanted at fifty ; and his seat in the British Parliament is a caution to the friends of union to stay at home, aud make the country of their birth the seat of their action.\" JOHN PHILPOT CURRAN. (1750\u20141817.) Independence. \u2014 Lord Longueville returned Curran to the Irish Parliament in 1783 for a pocket borough, under an idea of his own (says Phillips) that a barrister with a growing family, and totally dependent on his profession for subsistence, would scarcely suffer his principles to interfere with his interests. On the very first occasion, however, he not only voted against his patron, but, by at least an energetic speech, proved the total fallacy of all his anticipations. Lord Longueville of course warmly remonstrated ; but what was his astonishment to find Curran not only persevering in his independent opinions, but even appropriating the only five hundred pounds ho had in the world to the purchase of a seat, which he insisted on transferring as an equivalent for that given to him by Lord Longueville. A Parenthetical Speech. \u2014 Curran was once asked how a member of Parliament had spoken. The answer was, \" His speech was a long parenthesis.\" He was asked to explain. \"Why.\" said he, \"don't you know that a parenthesis is a paragraph which may be omitted from beginning to end, without any loss of meaning ? \" The Extinguisher.\u2014 Of a certain Serjeant Hewitt Curran once remarked, \" His speech put me exactly in miud of a familiar utensil called an extinguisher: it began at a point, and on it went widening and widening, until at last it fairly put out the subject altogether.\" Airing a Vocabulary. \u2014 An able speaker, but addicted to lofty language, had made a speech iu the House of Peers, at which Curran was present. He was asked what he thought of the debate. \" I had,\" said he, \" only the advantage of hearing Lord airing hi- vocabulary.\" The Ghost of a House.\u2014 On the union of the Legislatures, the Irish Parliament House was turned into a bank, and various changes took place in the structure ; among the rest, the interior was gutted, and the handsome domo taken clown. Hearing of Castlereagh 's remark that the o 2"], [216, "196 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. house looked \"like a traitor that had undergone the sentence of the law,\" Curran, in allusion to that noble lord's activity in carrying the Union, said, \"Ay, no man is likelier to make that remark \u2014 a murderer is always afraid of ghosts.\" Deliberate Aim. \u2014 During a debate in the Irish Parliament in 1789, Curran replied, with severe sarcasm, to a speech of Attorney- General Fitzgibbon, in which he had received a rather gross personal attack. The result of this reply was a hostile message from Fitzgibbon. Mr. Ogle was second to the Attorney-General. The parties were to fire by signal ; Fitzgibbon did not do so, but, reserving his fire, took deliberate aim at Curran ; and, having missed him, walked off the ground. Curran exclaimed to him. \"It was not your faidt, Mr. Attorney, if you missed me, for you certainly were deliberate enough.\" LORD PLUNKET. (1764\u20141854.) Effective Speaking, and its Method. \u2014 It was said of Plunket by Sir Rolert Peel, \" He was, in my opinion, the most powerful and able advocate the Catholics ever had. I will say that he, more than any other man, contributed to the success of the Roman Catholic question.\" Plunket came (writes Mr. Hoey) in the interval of two great parliamentary eras \u2014 while the contemporaries of Pitt and Fox were gradually retreating from public life, and before Peel, Canuing, or Brougham had yet risen to the full perfection of their powers. He spoke in a new and unexpected strain. It was more like the language of some great noble of the robe, speaking with the sense that the estates of the realm really hung upon his words, than the common partisan declamation of the House of Commons, which has no horizon but the opposite benches and the reporters' gallery. The greatest authorities in and out of the House declared that he reached the very highest style of parliamentary oratory. \" I wish you had heard him,\" wrote Lord Dudley of his Peterloo speech in answer to Mackenzie (November, 1819). \" He assailed the fabric of his adversary, not by an irregular damaging fire that left parts of it standing, but by a complete rapid process of demolition that did not let one stone continue standing upon another.\" That single speech admittedly saved the Cabinet. Most marvellous tribute of all, hardly credible of the House of Commons \u2014 he is said, on several of the Catholic Claims debates, to have converted various votes to his side (so many as six, it is alleged, on one occasion) by very dint of conscientious conviction. Of the method of his public speaking he told Sheil that he always carefully prepared to the very syllable tho best passages, and the best only, of his great speeches, and used these as a kind of rhetorical stepping-stones, trusting to his native fluency and force for sustaining the stylo. Sheil said, what all who ever heard and all who read Plunket will confirm, that so consummate was the art with which this was done, one could never discern where the prepared was welded into the extemporaneous."], [217, "LORD PLUNKET. 197 Lord Lytton's portrait gallery affords us this picture of Plunket : \u2014 \" Mark where he sits, his calm brow downward bent, Listening, revolving, passive, yet intent. Bevile his cause, his lips vouchsafe no sneer ; Defend it, still from him there comes no cheer \u2014 No sign without of what he feels or thinks ; Within, slow fires are hardening iron links. Now one glance round, now upward turns the bow ; Hush'd every breath ; he rises \u2014 mark him now ! No grace in feature, no command in height, Yet his whole presence fills and awes the sight. Wherefore ? you ask. I can but guide your guess \u2014 Man has no majesty like earnestness. . . Tones slow, not loud, but deep-drawn from the breast, Action unstudied, and at times suppress ; But, as he near'd some reasoning's massive close, Strain'd o'er his bending head his strong arms rose, And sudden fell, as if from falsehood torn Some grey old keystone, and hnrl'd down with scorn.\" Attraction and Repulsion. \u2014 Speaking in the Irish House of Commons against the Union, Plunket used the following illustration to refute an argument of his opponents : \" The two Parliaments may clash ! So in Great Britain may King and Parliament ; but we see they never do so injuriously. There are principles of repulsion \u2014 yes ; but there arc principles of attraction, and from these the enlighteued statesman extracts the principle by which the countries are to be harmoniously governed. As soon would I listen to the shallow observer of nature who should say there is a centrifugal force impressed on our globe, and therefore, lest we should be hurried into the void of space, we ought to rush into the centre to be consumed there. No; I say to this rash arraiguer of the dispensa tions of the Almighty, there are impulses from whose wholesome opposi tion eternal wisdom has declared the law by which we revolve in our proper sphere, and at our proper distance. So I say to the political visionary, from the opposite forces which you object to, I see the whole some law of imperial connection derived; I see the two countries preserv ing their due distance from each other, generating and imparting heat. -and light, and life, and health, and vigour ; and I will abide by the wisdom and experience of the ages which are passed, in preference to the speculations of any modern philosopher.\" Something to take Down. \u2014 A remarkable effect (relates Lord Brougham) is said to have been produced by Plunket in tbe Irish House of Commons, upon some one calling out to take down his words. \" Stop.\" said this consummate orator, \" and you shall have something more to take down ; \" and then followed in a torrent the most vehement and indignant description of the wrongs which his country had sustained, and had still to endure. The Departed Great. \u2014 Mr. Plunket made perhaps his most brilliant speech on the motion for a committee on the Roman Catholic"], [218, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 198 claims, introduced February 28th, 1821. In adducing names of authority in support of his arguments, he said : \" Backed by the memories of the great lights and ornaments of the late reign \u2014 of Dunning, Pitt, Fox, Burke, Sheridan, and Windham\u2014 backed, I say, by the name of every man who possessed buoyancy enough to float down the stream of time \u2014 I feel that I have made out, I had almost said that I had established, the position that I sought, triumphantly. But when I look around me, and reflect on those whom I miss, and who were present when I last had the honour of addressing the House on this question, I am checked. When I reflect that since that period we have lost Whitbread, the incorruptible sentinel of the constitution \u2014 that we have lost the aid of the more than dawning virtues of Homer \u2014 that we had then Romilly, whose mature excellencies shed a steady light on his profession, on his country, and his nature \u2014 that Elliott, the pure model of aristocracy \u2014 that the illustrious Ponsonby. the constitutional leader of the ranks of Opposition in this house, revering alike the privileges of the Crown and the rights of the subject \u2014 are no more ; but, above all, when I dwell on that last over whelming loss, the loss of that great man (Henry Grattan) in whose place I this night unworthily stand, and with the description of whose exalted merits I would not trust myself \u2014 God knows, I cannot feel any thing like triumph. Walking before the sacred images of these illus trious dead, as in a public and solemn procession, shall we not dismiss all party feeling', all angry passions, and unworthy prejudices ? \" The Felon Transformed. \u2014 Lord Plunket thus explained why he had become a Reformer, although he had before opposed the agitation : \" Circumstances,\" said he, \" are wholly changed ; formerly Reform came to our door like a felou \u2014 a robber to be resisted. He now approaches like a creditor; you admit the justice of his demand, and only dispute the time and instalments by which he shall be paid.\" Professional Acumen. \u2014 Lord Brougham records the following circumstance in the preface which he wrote for the \" Life of Lord Plunket\": \u2014 \"There was on one occasion a very remarkable instance of his readiness at taking up a subject under extraordinary difficulties, and of this my personal recollection is very distinct, for I had in the debate experience of his power. On the case of Windham Quin, brought before the House of Commons by the friends of Chief Baron O'Grady, we examined witnesses for above a week, and Sir Robert Peel sat by us supporting his friend Quin, heard all the evidence, and, indeed, took a part in the examination of the -witnesses. The evidence was, of course, printed, and Plunket's only knowledge of our proceedings was from reading it on his journey to London. Peel made an elaborate and able defence of his friend, and Plunket took the same side ; but there was. this remarkable difference between the two speeches : Peel, familiar with the case in all its particulars, spoke iu mitigation of censure, admitting the charge to have been proved. He bad gone over the ground without perceiving that there was enough to support a plea of not guilty. Plunket at once took that course ; he had found the materials for it in tho printed evidence, though absent during the whole proceedings ; and, having had"], [219, "LORD ERSKINE. 199 to answer his wonderful speech, I can truly say that no one could have supposed he had not been present. This incident was often referred to as showing the difference between an ordinary person, however able, but unprofessional, and one with the experience and habits of an advocate. The admirable defence by Plunket was justly ascribed to his professional skill, and no one questioned the ability of Peel or his heartiness in sup porting his friend.\" LORD ERSKINE (1750\u20141823.) His Maiden Speech and Parliamentary Failure. \u2014 Erskine was returned to Parliament for Portsmouth, November 20th, 1783, and delivered his maiden speech on Fox's India Bill. Pitt sat, evidently intending to reply, with pen and paper in his hand, prepared to catch the arguments of this formidable adversary. He wrote a word or two. Erskine proceeded; but with every additional sentence Pitt's attention to the paper relaxed, his look became more careless, and he obviously began to think the orator less and less worthy of his attention. At length, when every eye in the house was fixed upon him, with a contemptuous smile he dashed the pen through the paper, and flung them on the floor. Erskine never recovered from this expression of disdain. His voice faltered, he struggled through the remainder of his speech, and sank into his seat dispirited, and shorn of his fame. \u2014 Croly's \" Life of George IV.\" Sir N. Wraxall says of this speech : \" Erskine's enemies pronounced the performance tame, and destitute of the animation which so powerfully characterised his speeches in Westminster Hall. They maintained that, however resplendent he appeared as an advocate while addressing a jury, he fell to the level of an ordinary man, if not below it, when seated on the ministerial bench, where another species of oratory was demanded to impress conviction or to extort admiration. To me, who, having never witnessed his jurisprudential talents, could not make any such comparison, he appeared to exhibit shining powers of declamation.\" \u2014 Lord Byron said of Erskine's parliamentary oratory : \" I don't know what Erskine may have been at the bar, but in the House I wish him at the bar once more.\" \u2014 Butler, in his \" Reminiscences,\" relates that, Fox having made an able speech, Mr. Erskine followed him with one of the very same import. Pitt rose to answer them. He announced his intention to reply to both. \"But,\" said he, \"I shall make no mention of what was said by the honourable gentleman who spoke last; he did no more than regularly repeat what was said by the member who preceded him, and regularly weaken all he repeated.\" Defence of Liberty.\u2014 During the session of 1795-96 Mr. Erskine (says Roseoe) distinguished himself in Parliament by his strenuous oppo- sition to two measures, which were, as he conceived, directed against the liberty of the subject, Upon the first of these (the Seditious Meetings Bill) he spoke with an energy and boldness not often exhibited within the walls of Parliament. \" ' If the King's ministers,' \" said he, adopting the words of Lord Chatham, \" ' will not admit a constitutional question to be"], [220, "200 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. decided on according to the forms and on the principles of the constitu tion, it must then be decided in some other manner ; and rather than that it shoidd be given up \u2014 rather than the nation should surrender their birthright to a despotic minister \u2014 I hope, my lords, old as I am, I shall see the question brought to issue, and fairly tried between the people and the Government,' With the sanction of the sentiments of the venerable and illustrious Earl of Chatham, I will maintain that the people of England should defend their rights, if necessary, by the last extremity to which free men can resort. For my own part, I shall never eease to struggle in support of liberty. In no situation will I desert the cause. I was born a free man, and, by God, I will never die a slave ! \" Whitebait and Seal. \u2014 Lord Campbell relates that when Erskine was Chancellor, being asked by the Secretary to the Treasury whether he would attend the ministerial fish dinner to be given at Greenwich at the end of the session, he answered, \" To be sure I will ; what would your fish dinner be without the Great Seal?\" SIR WILLIAM GRANT. (1754\u20141832.) Hard to Answer. \u2014 Lord Brougham classes Sir William Grant with speakers of the first order, and says his style was peculiar ; it was that of the closest and severest reasoning ever heard in any popular assembly. The language was choice, perfectly clear, abundantly correct, quite concise, admirably suited to the matter which the words clothed and conveyed. In so far it was felicitous, no farther; nor did it ever leave behind it any impression of the diction, but only of the things said ; the words were forgotten, for they had never drawn off the attention for a moment from the things ; those things were alone remembered. No speaker was more easily listened to ; none so difficult to answer. Once Mr. Fox, when he was hearing him with a view to making that attempt, was irritated in a way very unwonted to his sweet temper by the conversation of some near him, even to the show of some crossness, and (after an exclamation) sharply said, \" Do you think it so very pleasant a thing to have to answer a speech like that ?\" \" The Wisdom of our Ancestors.\" \u2014 The signal blunder (remarks Brougham) which Bacon long ago exposed, of confounding the youth with the age of the species, was never committed by anyone more glaringly than by this great reasoner. He it was who first employed the well known phrase of \" the wisdom of our ancestors ; \" and the menaced innova tion, to stop which he applied it, was the proposal of Sir Samuel Romilly to take the step of reform, almost imperceptibly small, of subjecting men's real property to the payment of all their debts. A Syllogistic Speech.\u2014 Francis Horner writes (1803) : \"I contrived to get the second day of the debate on the Spanish papers. Fox was very slovenly, desultory, and incomplete. Pitt's reply was very angry and loud, and full of palpable misrepresentations. . . There was one extra-"], [221, "LORD ELDON. 201 ordinary oration that night \u2014 Sir William Grant's \u2014 quite a masterpiece of his peculiar and miraculous manner. Conceive an hour and a half of syllogisms strung together in the closest tissue, so artfully clear, that you think every successive inference unavoidable ; so rapid, that you have no leisure to reflect where you have been brought from or to see where you are to be carried ; and so dry of ornament or illustration or refreshment, that the attention is stretched \u2014 stretched \u2014 racked. All this is done without a single note. And yet, while I acknowledge the great vigour of understanding displayed in such performances, I have a heresy of my own about Grant's speaking : it does not appear to me of a parliamentary cast, nor suited to the discussions of a political assembly. The effect he produces is amazement at his power, not the impression of his subject ; now this is a mortal symptom. Besides this, he gives me a suspicion of sophistry, which haunts me through his whole deduction. Though I have nothing immediately to produce, I feel dissatisfied, as if there were some thing that might be said. And after all, there are no trains of syllogism nor processes of intricate distinctions in subjects that are properly political. The wisdom, as well as the common feelings that belong to such subjects, lie upon the surface in a few plain and broad lines. There is a want of genius in being very ingenious about them.\" LORD ELDON. (1751\u20141838.) His First Election Speech. \u2014 Mr. Scott (afterwards Lord Eldon) put up for Weobly in June, 1783, and being returned, took his seat for the first time as representative of that borough. He says he delivered his speech to the crowd from the top of a heap of stones. \" My audience liked the speech, and I ended, as I had begun, by kissing the prettiest girl in the place \u2014 very pleasant, indeed.\" Lengthy Tenure of Office. \u2014 Scott was appointed Solicitor- General in 1788, and Attorney-General five years later. He was made Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and raised to the peerage as Lord Eldon, in 1799. He received the great seals for the first time in 1801. \" I do not know,\" he said, \" what made George III. so fond of me, but he was fond of me. When I went to him for tho seals, be had his coat buttoned at the lower part, and putting his right hand within, he drew them out from the left side, saying, ' I give them to you from my heart.' \" On the death of Pitt in 1806, Eldon resigned the Chancellor ship, but was reinstated in 1807, on the dismissal of the Grenville ministry, and continued in the office until the breaking up of the Liverpool administration in 1826, having held it for nearly twenty-five years, and for the longest period during which it had been held by any individual since the Norman Conquest. Conquering the Gout. \u2014 Writing to a female friend (Mrs. Forster) Lord Eldon said : \"I will tell you what once happened to me. I was ill with the gout ; it was in my feet, so I was carried into my carriage, and from it I was carried into my court. There I remained all the day, and"], [222, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 202 delivered an arduous judgment, In the evening I was carried straight from my court to the House of Lords ; there I sat until two o'clock in the morning, when some of the lords came and whispered to me that I was expected to speak. I told them I really could not, I was ill, and I could not stand; but they still urged, and at last I hobbled, in some way or other, with their assistance, to the place from which I usually addressed the House. It was an important question, the peace of Amiens \u2014 I forgot my gout, and spoke for two hours. Well, the House broke up. I was carried home, and at six in the morning I prepared to go to bed. My poor left leg had just got in, when I recollected I had important papers to look over, and that I had not had time to examine them ; so I palled my poor left leg out of bed, put on my clothes, and went to my study. I did examine the papers ; they related to the Recorder's report, which had to be heard that day; I was again carried into court, where I had to deliver another arduous judgment, again went to the House of Lords, and it was not till the middle of the second night that I got into bed.\" Tailors and Turncoats. \u2014 While (says Campbell) the Catholic Relief Bill was making progress in the House of Commons, there were, from the commencement of the session, nightly skirmishes in the House of Lords on the presentation of petitions for and against the measure. The Chancellor (Lyndhurst, who had changed sides on the question) sometimes mixed in these, and received painful scratches. Lord Eldon presenting an Anti-Catholic petition from the Company of Tailors at Glasgow, the Chancellor, still sitting on the woolsack, said in a stage whisper, loud enough to be heard in the galleries, \" What ! do tailors trouble themselves with such measures ?\" Lord Eldon: \" My noble and learned friend might have been aware that tailors cannot like turncoats.\" (A loud laugh.) Offered the Reins of Government. \u2014 March 3, 1829 (writes Mr. Greville), \" the Catholic question was in great jeopardy. The Chancellor (Lyndhurst), the Duke, and Peel went to tell the King that unless he would give them his real, efficient support, and not throw his indirect influence into the opposite scale, they would resign. He refused to give them that support ; they placed their resignations in his hands and came away. The King then sent to Eldon, and asked him if he would under take to form a Government. He deliberated, but eventually said he could not undertake it. On his refusal the King yielded, and the bill went on ; but if Eldon had accepted, the Duke and his colleagues woidd have been out, and God knows what would have happened.\" Consistency. \u2014 When Lord Encombe, Lord Eldon's grandson, re ceived his doctor's degree at the hands of the Duke of Wellington \u2014 then Chancellor of the University of Oxford \u2014 Lord Eldon was present as High Steward, and was treated with great respect and attention. He himself related the following anecdote : \" What charmed me very much when I left the theatre, and was trying to get to my carriage, was : one man in the crowd shouted out, 'Here's old Eldon! Cheer him, for he never ratted ! ' I was very much delighted, for I never did rat. I will"], [223, "SPENCER PERCEVAL. \u00a303 not say I have been right through life ; I may have been wrong ; but I will say that I have been consistent.\" SPENCER PERCEVAL. (1762\u20141812.) His Parliamentary Career. \u2014 Mr. Spencer Perceval, who was second son of the Earl of Egmont, was returned to Parliament for North ampton in 1796, being at the time leader of the Oxford Circuit. He supported Pitt warmly, and the minister, on the occasion of his duel with Tierney, named Perceval as competent to succeed him in the government, should he fall. He took office as Attorney-General under Addington, and in the Duke of Portland's ministry was made Chancellor of the Exchequer. He became Premier on the death of the duke in 1807. A Chancellor's Difficulty. \u2014 The illness of George III. in 1811, wltieh incapacitated him for affixing his sign-manual to bills, gave rise to a singular discussion in the House of Commons. The matter is thus referred to in the Malmesbury Correspondence : \u2014 \" Mr. Ross to the Earl of Malmesbury. Spring Gardens, January 4th, 1811. The business that is to come on in the House of Commons to-night offers none of the least curious circumstances of the present eventful times. That two deputy clerks, whose salaries are not more than 1501. per annum each, should have had the power of stopping the issue of 1,500,000J. of the public money, seems extraordinary, but so it is. Mr. Perceval (Chancellor of the Exchequer) used every means to persuade them to put tho privy seal to the warrant, and amongst other reasons endeavoured to prove to them that, as the King only signed but did not write the bill (for so I under stand it is called), they might venture to do it without the sign-manual. Their oath is not to put the privy seal to any bill which has not the sign manual.\" The sum in question was required for the service of the army and navy, and to meet the emergency the Chancellor of the Exchequer moved a resolution which was agreed to by the House, commanding the auditor and officers of the Exchequer to pay such sums as the exigency required, upon the warrants of any three or more of the Lords Com missioners of the Treasury. This resolution of the Commons was also agreed to by the House of Lords. His Assassination.\u2014 On the 11th of May, 1812, Mr. Perceval was to give evidence before a committee of the whole house as to the effect produced on tho trade of the country by the Orders in Council, and, there being much excitement at the time, the lobby was full of members and visitors. As he entered it with his friend Mr. Stephen, a pistol shot was heard, and the Premier, staggering forward toward the door of the house, fell upon his face. The ball had struck him near the heart, and in a few minutes he was dead. The man who fired the pistol was seized by two members standing by\u2014 General Gascoyne and Mr. Joseph Hume \u2014and the former recognised him as John Bellingham, who had been a merchant in Liverpool, and who had been vainly seeking redress for an unjust imprisonment which he had suffered in St. Petersburg. He com-"], [224, "204 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. plained that his suit had been neglected by Lord Granville, the English ambassador there, and said he intended to shoot his lordship had not Mr. Perceval fallen in the way; but he had no grievance against the Minister personally. He was tried, condemned, and executed within a week after firing the shot. An annuity of 20002. was voted to Mrs. Perceval, and a sum of 50,000?. to be vested in trustees for the benefit of her children. It was remembered as a remarkable circumstance that Mr. Perceval had said in the House, in 1802, with reference to the trial of the Frenchman Peltier for a libel against Napoleon, \" There is something so base and disgraceful \u2014 there is something so contrary to everything that belongs to the character of an Englishman \u2014 there is something so immoral in the idea of assassination, that the exhortation to assassinate this or any other chief magistrate would be a crime against the honourable feelings of the English law.\" ROBERT JENKLNSON, EARL OF LIVERPOOL. (1770\u20141828.) Superlative Praise. \u2014 In the course of the year 1790, the authority of Sir James Lowther over the borough of Appleby \u2014 the same which had the honour of giving Pitt the first opportunity of displaying his pre- cocious genius to the Parliament of his country \u2014 was exerted to procure the election of Mr. Jenkinson (afterwards the second Lord Liverpool). He did not rise in the house till he had been for above a year a member of it ; though it is no slight proof how great was the expectation which was already formed of him that, on the occasion of Mr. Whitbread moving a censure on the Government on tho question known as the Russian Armament, Pitt selected him to open the debate on his side. Our parliamentary annals have recorded no maiden speech which made so great an impression. Pitt himself began his own harangue by pro- nouncing it \" not only a more able first speech than had ever been heard from a young member, but one so full of philosophy and science, strong and perspicuous language, and sound and convincing arguments, that it would have done credit to the most practised debater and most expe- rienced statesman that ever existed.\" \u2014 Yonge's \" Life of Liverpool.\" Respectable Mediocrity. \u2014 Lord Liverpool held office as Prime Minister for the fifteen years from 1812 to 1827 \u2014 a term exceeded only by Sir Robert Walpole and the younger Pitt, Lord Brougham says of him, \"No minister\u2014 nay, few men in any subordinate public station \u2014 ever passed his time with so little ill-will directed towards himself, had so much forbearance shown him upon all occasions, nay, few engaged uniformly so large a share of personal esteem. To what did he owe tho rare felicity of his lot ? This question may, perhaps, be answered by observing that the abilities of Lord Liverpool were far more solid than shining, and that men are apt to be jealous, perhaps envious, certainly distrustful, of great and brilliant genius in statesmen. Respectable mediocrity offends nobody. . . No popular outcry ever assailed Lord Liverpool. While others were the objects of alternate execration and scorn, he was generally respected. The fate that befel him was that which"], [225, "JOHN HORNE TOOKE. 205 might have mortified others, but well suited his tastes \u2014 to be little thought of, less talked about.\" His Character as a Debater. \u2014 He was never known (writes Brougham) to utter a word at which any one could take exception. He was, besides, the most fair and candid of all debaters. No advantage to be derived from a misrepresentation, or even an omission, ever tempted him to forego the honest and the manly satisfaction of stating the fact as it was, treating his adversary as he deserved, and at least reciting fairly what had been urged against him, if he could not successfully answer it. A Peculiarity. \u2014 Lord Aberdeen mentioned to Bishop Wilberforce, in conversation : \" Lord Liverpool always wanted to get rid of any persons who came to him. One of bis friends once said, ' I wonder what Liverpool is doing now ?' ' Trying,' answered another, ' to get rid of whoever is with him.' \" JOHN HORNE TOOKE (1736\u20141812.) His Return for Old Sarum. \u2014 Professor Pryme relates that Lord Camelford once took a freak to cross in a boat from Dover to Calais, while we were at war with France. The police, hearing of his design, apprehended him. Mr. Pitt, who was his kinsman, instituted an inquiry, and in a few days ordered his release. Lord Camelford was so angry at his not giving, on hearing who it was that had been arrested, an instant order for his discharge, that he said to Home Tooke, with whom he was well acquainted, \"How can I avenge myself r\" He answered that he could do it very well by putting his black servant, Mungo, into his borough of Old Sarum. Lord Camelford agreed, but tbe next day thought better of it, and told Home Tooke so. \" Well,\" said he, \" then the next best thing you can do is to put me in.\" This was done, and Home Tooke, who had in early life taken holy orders, sat till the end of that Parliament. Addington, then Prime Minister, timidly dreading his eloquent attacks, to get rid of him had a bill brought in to prevent clergymen being returned as representatives. Exclusion of Clergymen. \u2014 Homo Tooke entered the House on the 16th of February, 1801. He was introduced by Sir Francis Burdett and Mr. Wilson. This being done, Earl Temple rose and said, \"he had observed a gentleman who had just retired from the table after having taken the oaths, whom ho conceived incapable of a seat in that House, iu consequence of his having taken priest's orders and been inducted into a living. He should wait the allotted time of fourteen days, to see whethei thero was any petition presented against this return. If not, he should then move that the return for Old Sarum be taken into consideration.\" Three days after, the clerical member addressed the House on Mr. Sturt's motion respecting the failure of the expedition to Ferrol. In supporting the motion ho said : \" If the House refuse to go into a committee of inquiry, with what propriety can they enter into the merits of the borough of Old Sarum aud its member ? How can they plunge themselves into inquiries and discussions about what is or is not a priest, and whether a"], [226, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 206 thirty years' quarantine is not sufficient to guard against the infection of his original character ? Yet, in recommending this line of conduct to the House, I sacrifice my interest to my duty, as well as I sacrifice my wishes to truth, in defending the right honourable Secretary of State \u2014 a service which he never has done, and I daresay never will do, for me.\" On the 10th of March, at the instance of Earl Temple, a committee was appointed to inquire into the eligibility of persons in holy orders to sit in the House. The result was the passing of a bill (May 19th) to prevent it, and in con sequence Home Tooke was unable to offer himself for re-election, after the dissolution in the following year.* Before the bill passed, however, Tooke proposed an amendment, which was negatived. In support of his amendment he entertained the House with an illustrative anecdote. \" He had heard of casuists splitting hairs, but this was the first instance he ever heard of a casuist splitting sacraments ; and he was sure the learned gentleman (Sir W. Scott) must have borrowed the idea from a learned casuist in divinity, of whose intense research and perspicacity he would relate an anecdote. The divine alluded to wished to investigate the mystery related in the Scripture, of the legion of devils entering into a herd of swine ; and, in order first to ascertain the number of devils com posing a legion, he applied to his glossary, and found that a legion in the Roman army meant a certain number of men, more or less in different reigns ; but he took as his medium the number as it stood in the reign of Tiberius. He next set about inquiring into the number that composed a herd of swine, and for this purpose he directed his investigations into Syria and other countries ; and having taken the swineries of Mesopo tamia as the most probable standard, he divided the number of a herd there by the number he had before ascertaiued of a legion, and the quotient proved to him that each hog was possessed of exactly a devil and a half, or somewhat less than a devil and three-quarters.

Rogers' \" Recollections.\" LORD BYRON. (1788\u20141824.) Byron's First Speech.\u2014 He made his first speech in the House of Lords in February, 1812, on the Nottingham Frame-breaking Bill. He was then twenty-four years of age. In a letter addressed to a friend soon afterwards he writes : \" Lords Holland and Grenville, particularly the latter, paid me some high compliments in the course of their speeches, as * In 1873, the Hon. H. Villiers Stuart, who had been in holy orders but had divested himself of them under the provisions of a recent Act, was returned to Parliament for the county of Waterford, and was the first ex-clergyman after Home Tooke to enter the House of Commons."], [227, "LORD BYRON. 207 you may have seen in the papers, and Lords Eldon and Harrowby answered me. I have had many marvellous eulogies repeated to me since, in person and by proxy, from divers persons ministerial \u2014 yea, ministerial ! \u2014 as well as oppositionists ; of them I shall only mention Sir F. Burdett. He says it is the best speech by a lord since the ' Lord knows when,' probably from a fellow-feeling in the sentiments. Lord H. tells me I shall beat them all if I persevere ; and Lord G. remarked that the construction of some of my periods are very like Burke's ! ! And so much for vanity. I spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence, abused everything and everybody, and put the Lord Chancellor (Eldon) very much out of humour ; and, if I may believe what I hear, have not lost any character by the experiment. As to my delivery, lond and fluent enough, perhaps a little theatrical. I could not recognise myself or any one else in the newspapers.\" A Forgotten Grievance. \u2014 Byron's second display, says Moore, was less promising than his first. \" His delivery was thought mouthing and theatrical, being infected, I take for granted (having never heard him speak in Parliament), with the same chanting tone that disfigured his recitation of poetry.\" In the following year he made his third and last appearance as an orator in the Lords. \" In his way home,\" writes Moore again, \" he called at my lodgings. He was, I recollect, in a state of most humorous exaltation after his display, and spouted forth, in a sort of mock heroic voice, detached sentences of the speech he had just been delivering. ' I told them,' he said, ' that it was a most flagrant violation of the constitution \u2014 that, if such things were permitted, there was an end of English freedom.' 'But what was this dreadful grievance ? ' I asked, interrupting him in his eloquence. ' Tbe grievance ? ' he repeated, pausing, as if to consider. ' Oh, that I forget.' \" Prose versus Poetry. \u2014 Reviewing his own parliamentary ap pearances, Byron thus wrote : \" Sheridan told me he was sure I should make an orator, if I would but take to speaking, and grow a Parliament man. He never ceased harping upon this to me to the last; and I remember my old tutor, Dr. Drury, had the same notion when I was a boy; but it never was my turn of inclination to try. I spoke once or twice, as all young peers do, as a kind of introduction into public life ; but dissipation, shyness, haughty and reserved opinions, together with the short time I lived in England after my majority (only about five years in all), prevented me from resuming the experiment. As far as it went, it was not discouraging, particularly my first speech (I spoke three or four times in all) ; but just after it my poem of 'Childe Harold ' was published, and nobody ever thought about my prose afterwards, nor indeed did I ; it became to me a secondary and neglected object, though I sometimes wonder to myself -if I should have succeeded.\" Parliamentary Impressions. \u2014 \"I never,\" said Byron, \"heard the speech that was not too long for the auditors, and not very in telligible, except here and there. The whole thing is a grand deception, and as tedious and tiresome as may be, to those who must be often present, . . The impression of Parliament upon me was that its"], [228, "208 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. members are not formidable as speakers, but very much so as an audience ; because in so numerous a body there may be little eloquence (after all, there were but two thorough orators in all antiquity, and, I suspect, still' fewer in modern times), but there must be a leaven of thought and good sense sufficient to make them know what is right, though they can't express it nobly. Homo Tooke and Roscoe both are said to have declared that they left Parliament with a higher opinion of its aggregate integrity and abilities than that with which they entered it. The general amount of both in most Parliaments is probably about the same, as also the number of speakers and their talent. I except orators, of course, because they are things of ages, and not of septennial or triennial reunions. Neither House ever struck me with more awe or respect than the same number of Turks in a divan, or of Methodists in a bam, would have done.\" LORD BROUGHTON. (1786\u20141869.) Sent to Newgate. \u2014 Mr. John Cam Hobhouse (afterwards Lord Broughton), the friend and fellow-traveller of Byron, incurred, in 1819, the high displeasure of the House of Commons under the following circumstances : \u2014 On December the 10th, Mr. Courtenay rose to complain of a pamphlet which bad been published, entitled \" A Trifling Mistake in Thomas Lord Erskine's recent Preface shortly noticed, and respectfully corrected, in a Letter to his Lordship, by the author of ' The Defence of the People.'\" The following extract, amongst others, was read from the pamphlet : \" What prevents the people from walking down to the House and pulling out the members by the ears, locking up their doors, and flinging the key into the Thames ? \" On a subsequent day, the publisher of the brochure having been summoned to the bar, and the name of the writer divulged, it was moved and carried \" That John Cam Hobhouse, Esq., be, for his said offence, committed to his Majesty's gaol of Newgate.\" The offender remained in confinement till the death of George III., in the following January, occasioned a dissolution of Parliament. Shortly after this, Mr. Hobhouse took his seat as one of the members for Westminster, in the assembly he had denounced in such strong language, and delivered his maiden speech May 9, 1820. The occasion was on Mr. Alderman Wood's motion respecting the criminal conduct and proceedings of George Edwards, said to have been connected with the Cato Street Conspiracy. In the course of his address he referred to his own case in these terms : \" Now let me recall to the honourable member for Corse Castle the dreadful alarms, the prompt proceedings adopted against the author of a pamphlet in which it seemed possible that some recom mendations to a dispersion of this House might be found. Here was no plot, no grenades, no mischief either done or meditated ; but though this Edwards is to walk at large, the author of a single passage of disputable meaning is to be sent to prison without trial and without citation.\" His Majesty's Opposition.\u2014 It was Mr. Hobhouse who first spoke of \"His Majesty's Opposition.\" Canning accepted the appellation as"], [229, "SIR FRANCIS BURDETT. 209 appropriate. A distinguished member of the Opposition gave it the stamp of his approval, while adding a pithy exposition of its meaning. Tiemey said, \" No better phrase could be adopted ; for we are certainly a branch of his Majesty's Government. Although the gentlemen opposite are in office, we are in power. The measures are ours, but all the emolu ments are theirs.\" SLR FRANCIS BURDETT. (1770\u20141844.) A Favourite. \u2014 \"Burdett,\" said Byron, \"is sweet and silvery as Belial himself, and, I think, the greatest favourite in Pandemonium ; at least, I always heard the country gentlemen and the ministerial devilry praise his speeches upstairs, and run down from Bellamy's when he was upon his legs.\" Lord Lytton also must be quoted as to Burdett and his powers :\u2014 \" Too rich to bribe, and much too proud for power, And as to fear \u2014 a fieo for the Tower ! In youth more popular than Fox ; in age, When Burdett spoke, few actors more the rage. None gifted more to please the eye and ear, The form so comely and the voice so clear. Pitt's surly squires resign'd their port, and ran To hear the dangerous but large-aered man. . His speech ran over each \u00c6olian chord, So vaguely pleasing that it never bored. Nor was it rude ; whatever fear it woke In breasts patrician, a patrician spoke ; And if no letter'd stores it could display, Still over letters it would pause and play, Surprise an elegance, conceive a trope, And pose logicians with a line from Pope.\" Burdett's Committal to the Tower. \u2014 J. Gale Jones, the president of a debating club, published some resolutions of his society on a debate which arose in 1810 relative to the expedition to the Scheldt. For this he was summoned to the bar of the House, and committed to Newgate. Sir Francis Burdett took up his cause, and denied the power of the Commons to commit to prison any but their own members, and repeated his argu ments in a letter published in Cobbett's Weekly Register. This being brought before the House, he was committed to the Tower. Cooke, in his \" History of Party,\" thus describes the circumstances attending the execution of the order :\u2014 \" Crowds surrounded the house of Sir Francis, who affected to resist the warrant by force, and barricaded his doors. Twenty police officers, assisted by detachments of cavalry and infantry, were necessary to execute the warrant. Burdett still resisted ; and, lest the theatrical display should be incomplete, the constables, when they broke into the house, found him teaching his infant son to read and translate Magna Charta. As he was borne along to the Tower, the crowds assembled attacked the soldiery ; pistol-shots were fired on each side, and p"], [230, "210 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the troops did not return from their ungrateful duty without a sanguinary conflict, in which several people were slain. A more useless or unnecessary provocation of a scene of carnage does not occur iu our history. Sir Francis brought an action against the Speaker, and, being defeated, thus had the merit of formally establishing the important principle of the Constitution which he had attacked.\" Hoisting Canning with his own Petard. \u2014 In one of the debates of the pre-Reform period, Canning, in the course of an elaborate defence of the borough system, urged that it formed an essential element of the British Constitution, since it had \" Grown with onr growth, and strengthened with our strength.\" Sir Francis Burdett took up the quotation in reply, and said, \" The right honourable gentleman doubtless remembers the first line of the distich he has cited, and that it is ' The young disease, which must subdue at length, Grows with onr growth, and strengthens with our Btrength.' \" Canning acknowledged that the retort was a happy and a just one. An Extraordinary Debate. \u2014 Sir T. F. Buxton, writing to his brother-in-law, Mr. Gurney, in November, 1819, thus refers to a debate on the Manchester Riots, and Burdett's speech in it : \" We have had a wonderful debate ; really it has raised my idea of the capacity and ingenuity of the human mind. All the leaders spoke, and almost all outdid themselves. But Burdett stands first ; his speech was absolutely the finest, and the clearest and the fairest display of masterly under standing, that ever I heard ; and, with shame I ought to confess it, he did not utter a sentence to which I could not agree. Canning was second ; if there be any difference between eloquence and sense, this was the difference between him and Burdett. He was exquisitely elegant, and kept the tide of reason and argument, irony, joke, invective, and declamation, flowing for nearly three hours. Plunket was third ; he took hold of poor Mackin tosh's argument, and griped it to death; ingenious, subtle, yet clear and bold, and putting with the most logical distinctness to the House the errors of his antagonist. Next came Brougham \u2014 and what do you think of a debate in which the fourth man could keep alive the attention of the House from three to five in the morning, after a twelve hours' debate ? \" Burdett a High Tory.\u2014 Sir Francis Burdett, reverting to the notion that the prerogative of the Crown in choosing its servants ought to be unfettered and uncontrolled, said, in bringing forward a motion for reform of Parliament, \" If a country gentleman were to offer to a servant out of place to make him his butler, and the man were to answer, ' I will not be your butler unless you will take Harry for your coachman, and Thomas for your groom, and Dick for your footman,' the gentleman would be greatly astonished.\" This remark (says Earl Russell) proves that Sir Francis Burdett was, as he sometimes avowed himself to be, a high pre rogative Tory of the days of Queen Anne. His Duel with Mr. Paull.\u2014 The following particulars of the duel which took place between Sir Francis Burdett and Mr. Paull are taken"], [231, "WILLIAM COBBETT. 211 from the Annual Register. \" Mr. Paull, who was a candidate for the representation of Westminster in 1807, had advertised a meeting of his friends to dine at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand, the chair to be occupied by Sir Francis Burdett. A correspondence ensued upon this announcement, opening with a communication from Sir Francis, in which he disavowed any knowledge of the proposed gathering, and asserted that he had not sanctioned the use of his name in connection with it. The dispute between the two gentlemen, increasing in acrimony, finally culmi nated in a challenge being forwarded by Mr. Paull to Sir Francis Burdett. The parties met, attended by their seconds, at Combe Wood, near Wimbledon Common, on the 5th of May. They discharged two pistols each ; the second shot fired by Mr. Paull wounded Sir Francis in the thigh ; the second pistol fired by Sir Francis wounded Mr. Paull in the leg. This terminating the business, they both returned from Wimbledon in Mr. Paull's carriage.\" WILLIAM COBBETT. (1762\u20141835.) His First Appearance. \u2014 At the first general election after tho passing of the Reform Bill of 1832, Cobbett was returned for Oldham, and delivered his maiden speech January 29th, 1833, on the choice of a Speaker. The opening sentence with which he addressed the House was not of a very complimentary character : \"It appears to me that since I have been sitting here, I have heard a great deal of vain and unprofitable conversation.\" On the 11th of February he rose to move an amendment to the report of the Address in answer to the King's speech. \" Other honourable members,\" he said, \" may intercept the reading of the report where they please, and move that such or such parts be omitted; for my own part, I object to every tittle of the report after tho words ' Most Gracious Majesty.' \" Meeting with several interruptions by calls of \" Question \" and \" Order,\" he said, \" I have a very sacred duty to perform, and if the House be determined not to hear me to-night, I will certainly bring it forward to-morrow, and if the House will not hear me to-morrow, I will then bring it forward the day after. The statement I have to make I am determined to make, and that without any considerable interruption.\" His Demeanour in the House. \u2014 I know no other instance (writes Lord Dalling) of a man entering the House of Commons at Cobbett's age (between sixty and seventy) and becoming at once an effective debater in it. Looking carelessly round the assembly so new to him, with his usual self-confidence he spoke on the first occasion that presented itself, pro posing an amendment to the Address; but this was not his happiest effort, and consequently created disappointment, He soon, however, obliterated the failure, and became rather a favourite with an audience which is only unforgiving when bored. It was still seen, moreover, that nothing daunted him ; the murmurs, the \" Oh ! \" or more serious repre hension and censure, found him shaking his head with his hands in his pockets, as cool and defiant as when he first stuck up the picture of King p2"], [232, "212 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. George in his shop window at Philadelphia. He exhibited in Parliament, too, the same want of tact, prudence, and truth ; the same egotism, the same combativeness, and the same reckless desire to struggle with received opinions, that had marked him previously through life, and shattered his career into glittering fragments, from which the world could never collect the image nor the practical utility of a whole. In the Minister's Seat. \u2014 Lord Ronald Gower mentions a visit to Mr. Disraeli at Hughenden, when his host's recollections of Cobbett formed part of the conversation. \" On one occasion, he told us, Cobbett insisted upon taking Sir Robert Peel's seat on the Treasury bench. Sir Robert did all he could to show the intruder that he objected to this pro ceeding ; but all was in vain. At last Sir Robert requested Cobbett to move, politely but firmly. ' I'll be d \u2014 d if I do ! ' was all the answer that he got ; and Peel (continued Disraeli) had perforce to take a lower seat elsewhere.\" The Black Hole of St. Stephen's. \u2014 Complaining of the deficient accommodation for members in the House, Cobbett thus gave utterance to his discontent in the columns of the Weekly Register : \" Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm aud regular discussion, even from that circumstance alone ? Why do we live in this hubbub ? Why are we exposed to all these incon veniences ? Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows to each of us no more than a foot and a half square, while, at the same time, each of the servants of the King, whom we pay, has a palace to live in, and more unoccupied space in that palace than the little hole into which we are all crammed to make the laws by which this great kingdom is governed.\" The fire of 1834, however, burned down the \" little bole \" so contemptuously spoken of by the member for Oldham, and thus made way for a more commodious although still inadequate structure. Taking out the Sting. \u2014 Cobbett looked (remarks Professor Pryme) like a better sort of farmer. He was a very able man, but his career in the House was a complete failure. Though bold in public assemblies, he was timid and overawed iu Parliament, and was never able to say more than a few sentences. . . Cobbett was said to have \" a good face for a grievance.\" I remember one trait which shows it. He moved to bring in a bill to modify the Stamp Act, more especially that part of it which obliged every one to give a twopenny stamp on payment of any sum between 21. and hi. Lord Althorp said that it would require great time for modification, and that it should be taken into consideration, but that meantime the member for Oldham might, if he liked, have that par ticular grievance of the twopenny stamp redressed at once. We all who were opposite to him were amused to observe that Cobbett looked quite disappointed, as if feeling that the sting was taken out of his complaints. Political Nicknames. \u2014 Cobbett's talent (says Lord Dalling) for fastening his claws into anything or anyone by a word or an expression, and holding them down for scorn or up to horror, was unrivalled. \" Prosperity Robinson,\" \" \u00c6olus Canning,\" the \" bloody Times,\" the \" pink-nosed Liverpool,\" the \" unbaptised, buttonless blackguards \" (in which way ho"], [233, "JOSEPH HUME. 213 designated the disciples of Penn), were expressions with which he attached ridicule where he could not fix reproach ; and it is said that nothing was more teasing to Lord Erskine than being constantly ad dressed by his second title of Baron Clackmannan. JOSEPH HUME. (1777\u20141855.) Small Economies. \u2014 Hume had been a surgeon in India, and had made a fortune. He had an office and kept a clerk at his own cost, in order to examine the estimates and accounts of public moneys, and to pre pare his statements and facts ; and by his attention to economy effected a considerable reduction in the national expenditure. He had his faults .(writes Professor Pryme), which produced political errors, for he looked rather to what in his mind was desirable than to what was practicable. That kind of feeling predominated throughout. He suggested even the smallest economies. Gilt-edged paper was, I take it, given up in conse quence of his observation on the extravagance of using it for parliamentary notices. Parker, secretary to the Treasury, brought up some reports. Hume remarked, \" I think that splendid gilt paper is unnecessary.\" Parker, nettled at this, replied, \" Perhaps the honourable member may think the margins are too wide ; \" but it had its effect, and in a short time the paper in the library and writing-rooms, as well as all the future reports, had no gilt edges. Soon after it went out of fashion altogether. The Duties of an Archdeacon. \u2014 Lord Althorp, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, having to propose to the House of Commons a vote of 400Z. a year for the salary of the Archdeacon of Bengal, was puzzled by a question from Mr. Hume, \" What are the duties of an archdeacon ? \" So he sent one of the subordinate occupants of the Treasury bench to the other House to obtain an answer to the question from one of the bishops. The messenger first met with Archbishop Vernon Harcourt, who described an archdeacon as \" aide-de-camp to the bishop ; \" and then with Bishop Copleston, of Llandaff, who said, \" The archdeacon is oculus episcopi.\" Lord Althorp, however, declared that neither of these explanations would satisfy the House. \" Go,\" said he, \" and ask the Bishop of London (Blomfield) ; he is a straightforward man, and will give yon a plain \u25a0answer.\" To the Bishop of London accordingly the messenger went, and repeated the question, \" What is an archdeacon?\" \"An archdeacon?\" replied the bishop in his quick way \u2014 \" an archdeacon is an ecclesiastical officer who performs archidiaconal functions ; \" and with this reply (says the bishop's biographer) Lord Althorp and the House were perfectly satisfied. No Orator. \u2014 At a banquet to Lord Spencer in July, 1885, Mr. Bright proposed the health of the chairman, Lord Harrington, and in doing so related the following : \" Lord Harrington referred to an occasion when he and I met, at least twenty years ago. I suppose it must have been a short time after he came into Parliament, He was not very fond ,of politics, and did not care much about Parliament, and in conversation"], [234, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 214 with me he expressed the opinion that it was not very likely he would continue in Parliament. He gave as one reason that he had no practice in public speaking, and that it was desirable that members of Parliament should be able on occasion to express themselves intelligibly and forcibly. Well, with regard to the power of speaking in Parliament, I told him that it was very much a matter of practice ; that Mr. Hume, it is said, when he came into Parliament, could scarcely put two sentences together ; but we know he became a very frequent and a very fluent speaker, and in his day no man probably was of greater service in the House of Commons than he was.\" \" Humbug.\" \u2014 Mr. J. Grant, in his \" Random Recollections,\" de scribes a scene which took place in the House of Commons in 1836. The House was in committee of supply, and Mr. Joseph Hume (then member for Middlesex) was, as usual on such occasions, making a field day of it. He opposed almost every grant of money that was proposed for the public service, and while he was objecting to one vote, a Mr. Kearsley thus addressed the Chairman of Committees : \" Mr. Bernal, it has often been said in this house and elsewhere that the honourable member for Middlesex has been very useful to the country, by checking the extravagant expendi ture of Ministers. But, after what I have just seen with my own eyes, I put down his conduct as perfect humbug. (Interruptions.) Yes, and I must pronounce the honourable member himself to be a complete hum bug. (Order, order !) I do not mean any personal unkindness, but when a vote was put to the House for granting some secret service money \u2014 30,000?. odd, I believe \u2014 I saw an honourable gentleman, connected with the noble lord (John Russell) opposite, go up to him and give him a check for coming forward.\" \u2014 Mr. Hume replied to this attack, \" I am afraid that the honourable member's optics are not in the best possible state to-night, I think the honourable member sees double. I certainly did protest against voting 30,000?. secret service money ; but I am glad we have reduced the grant so low, for we formerly voted 60,000?. and upwards for the same purpose. As to the honourable gentleman's charge against me, I tell him that no person whatever spoke to me on the subject. No man has ever attempted to control or check me in my public conduct.\" \u2014 Mr. Kearsley jumped up with the rejoinder, \" I tell the honourable gentleman that if my sight is not so good as it ought to be, neither is his head so good as it ought to be. I tell him that I can see to count up the ' tottel of the whole ' [a common expression with Hume] as well as he can.\" (Loud laughter.)\u2014 Mr. Hume, whom it was impossible to put out of temper, replied, \" I beg the honourable member not to mistake me. I did not say anything about the infirmity of his eyes ; I did not accuse him of not seeing j I only accused him of seeing too much.\" The matter then dropped, after having caused much amusement to both sides of the House. Support of the Speaker's Warrant.\u2014 In 1845 a discussion occurred in the House of Commons on a question of privilege. The Serjeant-at-Arms, Sir William Gossett, had executed a Speaker's warrant against one Thomas Howard, but an action was brought in the Queen's,"], [235, "JOSEPH HUME. 215 Bench by the latter against the Serjeant for excess of authority in staying an unreasonable time in his house, and \u00a3200 damages were awarded to him. Execution was to be levied in a day or two, when Mr. Hume remarked : \" I hope the House will order any attempt that may be made to seize upon the property of the Serjeant to be most severely punished forthwith. If any one will draw up a resolution to that effect, I will move it, and, if necessary, I will assist in executing your warrant. It will not be the first time, sir, that I have personally assisted in promoting the ends of justice. I was the first to seize upon the person who committed an act of murder within the precincts of this place \u2014 I allude to the person who shot the late Mr. Perceval \u2014 and I kept him fast until a magistrate was found to whose custody he was delivered. I conceive, Sir, that every member of this House is bound to act in the same manner ; and, as you are authorised to call upon all magistrates and persons in authority to assist in carrying your warrant into effect, so I think you have a prior claim upon the assistance of the members of this House in enforcing and upholding your authority.\" The House adjourned the debate, and suffered the execution to be levied. Fighting against Majorities. \u2014 In a speech at Birmingham in 1849, Mr. Cobden thus alluded to Hume's parliamentary career : \" I wish our friend Mr. Hume was here to-night. You do well to receive his name with those plaudits. A more indefatigable, a more devoted, a more dis interested patriot never lived in this or in any other country. He has for nearly forty years fought against majorities in the House of Commons. But it is given to few men to possess his physical strength, his massive endurance, his powerful energies, his impassive temperament. But few men have the power to do that which he has accomplished. I confess that I have not physically the power of going through one-half of his work.\" Tracking the Minister. \u2014 In a discussion in the House of Com mons on the public expenditure, in February, 1873, Mr. Gladstone, then Prime Minister, referred as follows to the services Mr. Hume had rendered tho country : \"I believe that Mr. Hume has earned for himself an honourable and a prominent place in the history of this country, not by endeavouring to pledge Parliament to abstract resolutions or general declarations on the subject of economy, but by an indefatigable and unwearied devotion, by the labour of a life, to obtain a complete mastery of all the details of public expenditure, and by tracking, and I would almost say hunting, the Minister in every department through -all these details with a knowledge equal or superior to his own. In this manner I do not scruple to say Mr. Hume did more, not merely to reduce the public expenditure as a matter of figures, but to introduce principles of economy into the management of tho administration of public money, than all the men who have lived in our time put together. This is the kind of labour which we want above all things.\" A Sine qua Non. \u2014 I recollect (says Lord Broughton) a saying of Sir Robert Peel, that he could not conceive a House of Commons without a Joseph Hume."], [236, "216 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. A Warlike Errand. \u2014 Hume's surgical knowledge was once called into requisition under very remarkable circumstances. Mr. Greville writes respecting the duel between the Duke of Wellington and Lord Winchilsea : \" Hume was there, without knowing on whose behalf till he got to the ground. Hardinge (Sir Henry Hardinge, the duke's second) asked him to attend, and told him where he would find a chaise, into which he got. He found there pistols, which told him the errand he was on, but he had still no notion the duke was concerned ; when he saw him he was ready to drop. Hume gave the two lords a lecture on the ground after the duel, and said he did not think there was a man in England would have lifted his hand against the duke. Very uncalled for,\" continues Greville, \" as Lord Win chilsea did not fire.\" \" Radical.\" \u2014 This phrase, as designating a member of the Radical Reform section of politicians, was \" first used by myself,\" says Hume, writing to Sir Joshua Walmsley. Macaulay compares to the Radicals of recent times the \" Root-and-Branch \" men of two centuries previously. Unrequited Service. \u2014 Hume's sturdy character, and his work for the nation, aroused Lord Lytton's enthusiasm : \u2014 \u25a0' To me there's something bordering on the great In him who labours \u2014 not for self. The State, In its caprice, may give him no reward ; Perhaps he bores, and is not born a lord. The House may cough \u2014 his voice no coughs can drown ; Reports cut short \u2014 no Press can cut him down. Still he toils on\u2014 for what ? To be of use, To prune a tax, or weed up an abuse. Each hour for rest, for home, for health to grudge, Unpaid a servant, and nnthank'd a drudge ; And, his work done, sink tameless in the tomb : Such men have worth \u2014 nine such might make a Hume.\" THOMAS SLTNGSBY DUNCOMBE. (1797\u20141861.) Persevering Bribery. \u2014 Mr. Duncombe \u2014 a man of fashion as well as a leading Radical \u2014 first stood a contest for Pontefract in 1821 ; he took an enormous deal of trouble in canvassing, and spent much money in bribery, but was unsuccessful. In 1823 he was again in the field, and ventured to contest a family borough (Hertford) with its proprietor. He again failed, after spending much money. In the general election of 1826, Hertford was again canvassed by him in opposition to Mr. Henry Bulwer (afterwards Lord Dalling), who was then commencing his political career. There were three claimants for the suffrages of the electors ; the borough returned two, and the fight was for the second place. Mr. Duncombe having bribed handsomely (writes his son) secured a majority. After the passing of the Reform Bill Mr. Duncombe was elected for Finsbury, and for many years represented that borough. Borrowed Plumes. \u2014 Mr. Greville writes, Feb. 25, 1828 : \" The great event of the night was Duncombe's speech, which was delivered"], [237, "GEORGE CANNING. 217 with perfect self-possession and composure, but in so ridiculous a manner that everybody laughed at him, although they were amused with his im pudence and at the style and objects of his attack. However, the next day it was discovered that he had performed a great exploit ; he was loudly applauded and congratulated on all sides, and made into the hero of the day. . . The history of Tom Duncombe and his speech is instructive as well as amusing. Tommy came to Henry de Ros and told him that his constituents at Hertford were very anxious he should make a speech, but that he did not know what to say, and begged Henry to supply him with the necessary materials. He advised him to strike out something new, and having received his assurance that he should be able to recollect anything that he learned by heart, and that he was not afraid of his courage failing, Henry composed for him the speech which Dun combe delivered.\" Maintaining his Point.\u2014 In August, 1831, Mr. Goulburn brought an accusation against Lord Durham for interfering in an election. Mr. Duncombe pronounced it \" a base and wicked calumny.\" There was a tremendous call of \" Chair ! \" and the chairman administered a mild re monstrance, saying that in Mr. Duncombe's calmer and more sober moments he would not use such terms. The latter answered, un dauntedly, \" I am quite calm, and sober enough, and mean what I say.\" Down upon him came Sir Robert Peel, Sir Henry Hardinge, Sir Henry Inglis ; down upon him came the parliamentary magnates from both sides of the House, threatening, advising, and insisting on an explanation ; but the bold reformer heeded not the menaces, cared not for the advice, and openly declared that he had spoken the truth, and meant to maintain it. His firmness conquered his opponents, and Mr. Goulburn pocketed the affront.\u2014\" Life,\" by his Son. GEORGE CANNING, (1770\u20141827.) His Introduction into Parliament. \u2014 Canning's entry into public Use is thus mentioned by himself in a letter written in 1793 to his friend Henry John Richman, which was first printed by Charles Knight in 1868, among other interesting \" Unpublished Letters of George Canning \" : \u2014 \" You will probably have seen by the newspapers that I have come into Parliament. . . You may, in common with very many persons, have conceived that my acquaintance with some of the prin cipal characters of Opposition was something more than a mere personal familiarity, and amounted in fact to political attachment and obligation. In answer to this supposition, if you should have entertained it, I have only to say, upon the word of an honest man, the fact is otherwise. With differont individuals, indeed, of Opposition I have been much in habits of intimacy\u2014 with Mr. Sheridan, particularly, my friendship is from my cliildhood, and as with a family friend\u2014 and that friendship will, I trust, be uninterrupted by politics. I am sure it shall not be my fault if it be otherwise. But neither to him nor to any person else have I ever con-"], [238, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 218 sidered myself, nor have they considered me, as tied and bound by the smallest obligation, personal or political, that should govern my public sentiments, or fetter my free choice of my party. . . All that I wish to show to you is that my conduct has been strictly honourable, and in that I trust I shall have succeeded. The place for which I am returned is Newtown in the Isle of Wight. The seat comes to me, as I said before, from Mr. Pitt ; and, as I believe I did not before add, from him solely, and immediately to me, without the influence, or interference, of any other man or set of men whatever. And, which is no immaterial consideration to a person so far from being rich as myself, it comes without a farthing of expense.\" His Maiden Speech. \u2014 It was on the 31st of January, 1794, in his second session, that he made his first speech, in favour of a subsidy pro posed to be granted to the King of Sardinia. In a letter dated March 20th, 1794, addressed to Lord Boringdon, he thus expresses himself respecting the event : \" I intended to have told you, at full length, what were my feelings at getting up and being pointed at by the Speaker, and hearing my name called from all sides of the house ; how I trembled lest I should hesitate, or misplace a word in the first two or three sentences ; while all was dead silence around me, and my own voice sounded to my ears quite like some other gentleman's ; \u2014 how, in about ten minutes or less, I got warmed in collision with Fox's arguments, and did not even care twopence for anybody or anything ; how I was roused, in about half an hour, from this pleasing state of self-sufficiency by accidentally casting my eyes towards the Opposition bench, for the purpose of paying compli ments to Fox, and assuring him of my respect and admiration, and there seeing certain members of Opposition laughing (as I thought) and quizzing me ; how the accident abashed me, and, together with my being out of breath, rendered me incapable of uttering ; how those who sat below me on the Treasury bench, seeing what it was that distressed me, cheered loudly, and the House joined them ; and how, in less than a minute, straining every nerve in my body, and plucking up every bit of resolution in my heart, I went on more boldly than ever, and getting into a part of my subject that I liked, and having the House with me, got happily and triumphantly to the end.\" \" This first speech,\" says Lord Dalling, \" like many other first speeches of men who have become eminent orators, was more or less a failure. The subject was a subsidy to Sardinia, and the new member began with a scoff at the idea of looking with a mere mercantile eye at the goodness or badness of the bargain we were making. Such a scoff, uttered in an assembly which is the especial guardian of the public purse, was injudicious ; but the whole speech was bad. It possessed in an eminent degree all the ordinary faults of the declama tion of clever young men. Its arguments were much too refined; its arrangement much too systematic ; cold, tedious, and unparliamentary, it would have been twice as good if it had attempted half as much ; for the great art in speaking, as in writing, consists in knowing what should not be said or written.\" \"An Adventurer.\" \u2014 On presenting himself to the electors of"], [239, "GEORGE CANNING. 219 Liverpool in 1816, after his appointment as President of the Board of Control, Canning's return was contested; and, amongst other charges wrought against him by his opponents, he was reproached -with being an adventurer. He replied thus : \" To this charge, as I understand it, I am willing to plead guilty. A representative of the people, I am one of the people ; and I present myself to those who choose me only with the claims of character (be they what they may), unaccredited by patrician patronage or party recommendation. Nor is it in this free country, where, in any walk of Use, the road of honourable success is open to every individual \u2014 I am sure it is not in this place \u2014 that I shaU be expected to apologise for so presenting myself to your choice. I know there is a political creed which assigns to a certain combination of great families a right to dictate to the sovereign and to influence the people ; and that this doctrine of hereditary aptitude for administration is, singularly enough, most prevalent among those who find nothing more laughable than the principle of legitimacy in the Crown. To this theory I have never subscribed. 1\u00a3 to depend directly upon the people, as their representative in ParUament ; if , as a servant of the Crown, to lean on no other support than that of pubUc confidence \u2014 if that be to be an adventurer, I plead guilty to the charge, and I would not exchange that situation, to whatever taunts it may expose me, for aU the advantages which might be derived from an ancestry of a hundred generations.\" Men, not Measures ! \u2014 In a speech in 1801, in opposition to the Addington Ministry, Mr. Canning said : \" Away with the cant of ' Measures, not men ! ' \u2014 the idle supposition that it is the harness and not the horses that draw the chariot along. No, sir ; if the comparison must be made, if the distinction must be taken, men are everything, measures are comparatively nothing. I speak of times of difficulty and danger, when systems are shaken, when precedents and general rules of conduct fail ; then it is that not to that or to this measure \u2014 however prudently devised, however blameless in execution \u2014 but to the energy and character of individuals, a State must be indebted for its salvation.\" Subsidence of the Deluge. \u2014 In supporting the vote of thanks in the House of Commons, July 17th, 1813, to the Marquis of Wellington for the victory gained at the battle of Vittoria, Mr. Canning said : \" How was their prospect changed ! In those countries where, at most, a short struggle had been terminated by a result disastrous to their wishes, if not altogether closing in despair, they had now to contemplate a very different aspect of affairs. Germany crouched no longer trembling at the feet of the tyrant, but maintained a balanced contest, The mighty deluge by which the Continent had been overwhelmed began to subside. Tho Umits of nations were again visible, and the spires and turrets of ancient esta bUshments began to reappear. It was this victory which had defined theso objects, so lately involved in overwhelming confusion.\" Canning on Reform.\u2014 Sir Robert Peel, in reply to a repeal speech by O'Conncll in 1834, ridiculed the proposal by the exclamation, \" Repeal the Union ! As weU restore the Heptarchy ! \" Canning, however, had used it some years before, in a speech against parUamentary reform,"], [240, "220 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. which he treated as preposterous, saying, \" Reform the Parliament ! Repeal the Union ! Restore the Heptarchy !\" Taking Observations. \u2014 \" Sir Robert Peel, his distinguished rival, told me one day,\" says Lord DaUing, \" in speaking of Mr. Canning, that he would often, before rising in his place, make a sort of lounging tour of the House, listening to the tone of the observations which the previous debate had excited, so that at last, when he himself spoke, he seemed to a large part of his audience to be merely giving a striking form to their own thoughts.\" Taking Pains. \u2014 \" Nothing,\" observed Canning to Croker, \" can be done without a great deal of pains. I prepare very much on many subjects; a great part of this is lost and never comes into play; but sometimes an opportunity arises when I can bring in something I have ready, and I always perceive the much greater effect of these passages upon the House.\" Over Ingenious. \u2014 It was remarked by Croker in a letter to Brougham, some years after Canning's death, \" He preferred an in genious device for doing anything, to the ordinary processes. In lifting a coalscuttle to mend his fire (as I have been just doing) he would have preferred a screw or a pulley to his own arms. He could hardly 'take his tea without a stratagem.' \" Peace and War. \u2014 One of the most finished and effective of Canning's oratorical displays was a speech deUvered at Plymouth in 1823, in which the foUowing celebrated passage occurred : \u2014 \" While we control even our feelings by our duty, let it not be said that we cultivate peace either because we fear or because we are unprepared for war ; on the contrary, if eight months ago the Government did not hesitate to proclaim that the country was prepared for war, if war should be unfortunately necessary, every month of peace that has since passed has but made us so much the more capable of exertion. The resources created by peace are means of war. In cherishing those resources, we but accumulate those means. Our present repose is no more a proof of inability to act, than the state of inertness and inactivity in which I have seen those mighty masses that float in the waters above your town, is a proof that they are devoid of strength and incapable of being fitted out for action. You well know, gentlemen, how soon one of those stupendous masses now reposing on their shadows in perfect stillness \u2014 how soon, upon any caU of patriotism or of necessity, it would assume the likeness of an animated thing, instinct with life and motion \u2014 how soon it would ruffle, as it were, its swelling plumage \u2014 how quickly would it put forth aU its beauty and its bravery, coUect its scattered elements of strength, and awaken its dormant thunder. Such as is one of these magnificent machines when springing from inaction into a display of its might \u2014 such is England herself, while apparently passive and motionless she silently concentrates the power to be put forth on an adequate occasion. But God forbid that that occasion should arise. After a war sustained for nearly a quarter of a century \u2014 sometimes single-handed, and with aU Europe arrayed at times against her or at her side \u2014 England needs a period of tranquillity, and may enjoy it without fear of misconstruction.\""], [241, "GEORGE CANNING. g21 Ministerial Promptitude.\u2014 A Magniloquent Boast.\u2014 On the 12th of December, 1826, Canning, then Foreign Minister, made a masterly speech on the relations between Great Britain and Portugal. Mr. Brougham, who rose afterwards, said the Secretary's eloquence had been inspired \" with a degree of fervour, energy, and effect extraordinary and unprecedented in this House.\" In the course of his speech, Mr. Canning gave an instance of ministerial promptitude which has sometimes been cited in reproof of more dilatory Cabinets. He said: \"The precise information on which we could act only arrived on Friday last; on Saturday the decision of the Government was taken; on Sunday we obtained the sanction of his Majesty ; on Monday we came down to ParUament ; and at this very hour, while I have now the honours of addressing the House, British troops are on their march for Portugal.\" In his reply at the close of the debate, Mr. Canning again displayed great eloquence ; and on this occasion he used a famous but somewhat bombastic expression. \" If France,\" said he, \" occupied Spain, was it necessary, in order to avoid the consequences of that occupation, that we should blockade Cadiz ? No. I looked another way ; I sought materials of compensation in another hemisphere. Contemplating Spain, such as our ancestors had known her, I resolved that if France had Spain, it should not be Spain ' with the Indies.' I caUed the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old.\" \u2014 Mr. Greville writes respecting these last words, \" Canning gave offence to his coUeagues by the concluding sentence of his reply. The I was not relished.\" Canning in the Cabinet.\u2014 The Duke of Wellington (says Mr. Greville) talked of Canning the other day a great deal. He said, though he prided himself extremely upon his compositions, he would patiently endure any criticisms upon such papers as he submitted for the considera- tion of the Cabinet, and would aUow them to bo altered in any way that was suggested ; he (the Duke) particularly had often \" cut and hacked \" his papers, and Canning never made the least objection, but was always ready to adopt the suggestions of his coUeagues. It was not so, however, in conversation and discussion. Any difference of opinion or dissent from his views threw him into ungovernable rage, and on such occasions he flew out with a violence which, the Duke said, had often compelled Inm to be silent that he might not be involved in bitter personal altercation. He said that Canning was usually very sUent in tho Cabinet, seldom spoke at aU, but when he did he maintained his opinions wvth extraordi- nary tenacity. - , A Despatch in Cypher\u2014 Mr. BeU relates that Sir Charles Bagot, our ambassador at the Hague, was one day attending at court when a despatch in cypher was hastily put into his hand. It was very short, and evidently very urgent ; but, unfortunately, Sir Charles, not expecting such a communication, had not the key of the cypher with him. An interval of intense anxiety followed, until he obtained the key ; when to his infinite astonishment, he deciphered the foUowing despatch from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs :\u2014"], [242, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 222 \" In matters of commerce, the fault of the Dutch Is giving too little and asking too much ; With equal advantage the French are content, So we'll clap on Dutch bottoms a twenty per cent.

His speech (says Mr. BeU) was clear and able ; but some passages struck Mr. Canning's acute sense of the ridiculous so forcibly, that be scribbled a parody on them, while Mr. Whitbread was yet speaking.

It is not usual to mention the death of foreign sovereigns in the King's Speech. 2. We did not mention that of Louis XVIII. 3. The reason of this habitual silence is a sound one. The King mentions nothing that Parlia ment is not expected to echo. Parliament echoes nothing without discussion.

WILLIAM HUSKISSON. (1770\u20141830.) Legal Phraseology in the House of Commons.\u2014 Mr. Huskis- son will be remembered as one of the earliest advocates, among our statesmen, of the principles of Free Trade. His eloquence was often forcible, and his style at times very argumentative, while he knew how to make an effective reply. In February, 1826, Mr. Ellice, member for Coventry, had moved for a select committee on the silk trade, and he was seconded by Mr. Williams, a lawyer, member for Lincoln. To some severe remarks by the latter gentleman Mr. Huskisson thus replied : \" In the course of his speech the honourable and learned gentleman repeatedly told us that he was not at liberty to admit this, and to admit that. This, I presume, is a mode of expression in which gentlemen of the legal profession are wont to indulge, to mark that they keep within the strict limits of their briefs, and that the doctrines which they advocate are those prescribed to them by thoir instructions. However customary and proper such language may be in the courts of law, it certainly sounds new and striking in the mouth of a member of this House.\" He went on to say, \" To whom did the honourable and learned gentleman mean to apply tho description of an ' insensible and hard-hearted metaphysician, exceeding tho devU in point of malignity ? ' I appeal to the judgment of the House whether the language made use of by the honourable and learned gentle- man, with reference to me, was not such as to point to the inference that I am that metaphysician. . . It is for the honourable aud learned gentleman to reconcile such language with the general tenor of his sentiments on other occasions \u2014 to explain, as he best may, to those around him whether they are included in that insinuation ; and it is for me to meet that insinuation (as far as it was levelled at me l with those feeUngs of utter scorn with which I now repel it.\" The Duke of Wellington and Huskisson.\u2014 In 1828, when the Duke of WelUngton was Prime Minister. \" the question of ParUamentary Reform was brought under discussion upon a motion to disfranchise the two boroughs of Penrhyn and East Retford, and invest Manchester and"], [244, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 224 Birmingham with the electoral privileges thus vacated. In the course of the contest a division was taken on the particular substitution of Birming ham for East Retford. Government said ' No ' to the proposal, but Mr. Huskisson, though stiU Colonial Secretary, had managed to commit him self to an affirmative vote. Confused at his position, he sent the duke what was either a resignation or an offer of resignation, and what the duke chose to think was the former. There was, in plain truth, but little cordiality between them. Unpleasant jars had occurred already. Mr. Huskisson had publicly assured his Liverpool constituents that he had not entered the new administration without a ' guarantee ' for the general adjustment of its poUcy by that of Mr. Canning. This sounded as if a ' pledge ' had been exacted and given \u2014 an idea which the duke indig nantly repudiated, and parliamentary explanations had to be offered before the matter could be set at rest. So this time the difference was made final. In vain did the common friends and coUeagues of the two states men endeavour to ' explain ' the unlucky communication. The duke, iu terms which passed into proverbial use, replied that there ' was no mistake, could be no mistake, and should be no mistake.' He was not sorry, in fact, that so convenient an opportunity had been created to his hand. Mr. Huskisson therefore retired.\" \u2014 Times' Memoir of Wellington. His Death. \u2014 The Annual Register gave an account of the fatal accident to Mr. Huskisson at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester RaUway, on the 15th of September, 1830, from which the foUowing par ticulars are taken : \u2014 The procession, drawn by eight locomotive engines, left Liverpool at twenty minutes before eleven o'clock. The engine Northumbrian took the south Une of raUway, carrying amongst other passengers the Duke of Wellington. The other seven engines pro ceeded along the north line. On the stoppage of the Northumbrian at Parkside, Mr. Huskisson and several others got out; and Mr. Holmes, for the purpose of bringing Mr. Huskisson and the duke together, and of producing a renewed good feeling between them, led Mr. Huskisson round to that part of the car where the duke was stationed. The duke, perceiving the advance of the right honourable gentleman, immediately held out to him his hand, which was shaken in a very cordial manner. Almost at this moment the Rocket was seen to be advancing, and Mr. Huskisson, in attempting to enter the ducal car, feU upon the rails and had his right leg crushed by the wheel of the engine. The unfortunate gentleman lingered in great agony tiU the evening, when he expired. In the interval he showed a natural solicitude respecting his character as a statesman. \" The country,\" said he, \" has had the best of me. I trust that it wUl do justice to my pubUc character.\" On the 24th of September his remains were interred in presence of upwards of 15,000 spectators. EARL GREY. (1764\u20141845.) His First Appearance in the House.\u2014 Charles, second Earl Grey, was returned in July, 1786, at the age of twenty-two, for his native"], [245, "EARL GREY. 225 county (Northumberland). His maiden speech in the House was delivered in opposition to the address moved by Mr. Blackburne to thank his Majesty for the Commercial Treaty with France, negotiated by Mr. Pitt. Mr. Addington, afterwards Speaker, in a letter to his father thus describes the youthful orator : \" We had a glorious debate last night upon the motion for an address of thanks to the King for having negotiated the Commercial Treaty, &c. . . A new speaker presented himself to the House, and went through his first performance with an eclat which has not been equalled within my recollection. His name is Grey. I do not go too far in declaring that in the advantages of figure, voice, elocution, and manner, he is not surpassed by any member of the House, and I grieve to say that he is in the ranks of Opposition, from which there is no chance of his being detached.\" His own Estimate of his Debating Talent. \u2014 Writing to Lady Grey in 1804, after a discussion in the Commons on the King's Ulness, he remarked, \" You will see that I only said a few words, and those few were as bad as anything that could have come from the Doctor (Mr. Adding ton's usual sobriquet) himself. I feel very much the want of habit and experience in debate, which is absolutely necessary to give that readiness without which nothing can be done, and which I unfortunately do not naturally possess. I feel more and more convinced of my unfitness for a pursuit which I detest, which interferes with aU my private comfort, and which I only sigh for an opportunity of abandoning decidedly and for ever. Do not think this is the language of momentary low spirits ; it reaUy is the settled conviction of my mind.\" A Clear Head. \u2014 Stanley (writes Mr. Greville) gives the following instance of Lord Grey's readiness and clear-headed accuracy. In one of tho debates on the West India question in 1833, he went to Stanley, who was standing under the gaUery, and asked him on what calculation he had aUotted tho sum of twenty millions (for emancipation of the slaves). Stanley explained to him a complicated series of figures, of terms of years, interest, compound interest, value of labour, &c, after which Lord Grey went back to his place, rose, and went through the whole with as much clearness and precision as if aU these detaUs had been all along familiar to his mind. A Soft Answer.\u2014 The other night (says GreviUe) Lord Grey had caUed Lord Falmouth to order, and after the debate Falmouth came up to him with a menacing air, and said, \" My Lord Grey, I wish to inform you that if upon any future occasion you transgress in tho slightest degree the orders of the House, I shall most certainly call you to order.\" Lord Grey, who expected from his air something more hostile, merely said, \"My lord, your lordship wiU do perfectly right, and whenever I am out of order I hope you will.\" \" No, No,\" in the Lords. \u2014 In a discussion on the Church Tem poralities (Ireland) Bill, in the House of Lords in July, 1833, the Duke of Cumberland interrupted Earl Grey with a cry of \"No, no ;\" whereupon the noble earl \" trusted that the illustrious duke would have the decency not to interrupt him. The noble duke had a right to maintain his opinion : q"], [246, "226 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. he might, if he pleased, rise and defend it ; but, because he had an opinion, he was not justified in interrupting those who differed from him.\" Lord Kenyon appealed to their lordships whether the dissent expressed by using the word \" No \" deserved the character of indecency the noble earl had ascribed to it. Earl Grey certainly did conceive that the sort of interrup tion he had received was indecent. The Duke of Cumberland beUeved that there was no man in that House would more unwillingly commit an act of indecency than himself ; but if a noble lord were not to be allowed to call \" No, no,\" when he felt inclined to dissent from a proposition, there would (he said) be an end of all liberty of speech. Regrets. \u2014 In 1793 Grey brought forward his motion for referring to a committee the petition of the \" Friends of the People,\" praying for parliamentary reform. Respecting his connection with this society, General Grey says : \" During his last illness, when no longer able to walk, he used to be wheeled about the house in a chair, and on one occasion, when stopping, as he often did, before Mr. Fox's bust, and speaking of the influence he had held over him, he added, ' Yet he did not always use it as he might have done ; one word from him would have kept me out of aU that mess of the \" Friends of the People,\" but he never spoke it.' When I remarked that, considering he only advocated as one of the society the principles to which he had given effect as minister, this was hardly to be regretted, he replied, ' That might be true, but there were men joined with them in that society whose views, though he did not know it at the time, were widely different from his own, and with whom it was not safe to have any communication.' On mentioning this conver sation to the late Lord Dacre, he told me he remembered Mr. Fox used always to say he did not like to discourage the young ones.\" LORD ALTHORP. (1782\u20141845.) The Rival of Falmerston. \u2014 Sir Denis Le Marchant, in his \"Memoir of Viscount Althorp,\" says that when Earl Grey was caUed upon to form a ministry in succession to the Duke of Wellington, he said he should much prefer Lord Althorp being at the head of affairs, but the latter replied that on no consideration would he ever accept the place of Prime Minister, for which he felt his utter incapacity. It was with the greatest reluctance that he would entertain the idea of office at all ; but when Lord Grey positively assured him that unless he became Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons it would be useless to attempt a Whig Government, and the negotiation must be at once abandoned, he could not resist such an appeal, coming as it did from this noble old man, whom he had so long known and admired. Ho yielded, however, only with the distinct understanding that, in the event of Lord Grey's retirement, he should not be asked to succeed him. Lord Palmer ston the same afternoon actuaUy proposed himself to Lord Grey for tho leadership ; but, on the mere intimation that the post was reserved for Lord Althorp, he expressed himself perfectly satisfied. In the exhausted state"], [247, "LORD ALTHORP. 227 of the party, no other Whig could be named for whom Lord Palmerston could have been expected to waive his pretensions. Hatred of Office. \u2014 Lord Brougham wrote in his Autobiography : \" Nobody ever hated office as Althorp did. Others I have known hate it occasionaUy, but he detested it at aU times. He often said, when he got up in the morning, he wished he might be dead before night ; but he always went through his duty manfully. . . His powers were great. His ability was never so remarkably shown as in the Reform Bill, both in 1831 and 1832. He had a knowledge of all its details, and of aU the numberless matters connected with it, that was almost supernatural. The others knew it so ill, and got into such scrapes when opposed to formid able adversaries, such as Croker, who had attained something of Althorp's mastery of the subject, that it became necessary to prevent them from speaking, or, as it was then called, ' to put on the muzzle,' and Althorp reaUy did the wholo. His temper was admirable, and invariably equal. Sugden said he had learnt a lesson from it, or at least that it was his own fault if he had not \u2014 which was not ill said.\" His Influence with the House. \u2014 The foUowing instance of the influence which Lord Althorp exercised in the House of Commons is given by Sir D. Le Marchant : \" Once, in answer to a most able aud argumen tative speech of Croker, he arose and merely observed ' that he had made some calculations which he considered as entirely conclusive in refutation of the right honourable gentleman's arguments, but unfortunately he had mislaid them, so that he could only say that if the House would be guided by his advice they would reject tho amendment ' \u2014 which they did accor dingly. There was no standing against such influence as this.\" His Arrest by the Serjeant-at-Arms. \u2014 The foUowing account of this incident is from a note to the Greville Memoirs (1834) :\u2014 Mr. Hill, a member of Parliament, had stated in a speech that some of the Irish members who most vehemently opposed the Coercion Bill in the House of Commons had nevertheless privately stated to members of the Govern ment that they were glad the Act should bo renewed. This charge was denied with great heat by the Irish members in the House when Parlia ment met. But upon Mr. Sheil's caUing upon Lord Althorp to state whether he was one of the members aUuded to, Lord Althorp repUed that the honourable gentleman was one of them. Sheil immediately denied it in the most solemn and emphatic terms ; and, as it was feared that a hostile meeting might ensue between him and Lord Althorp, they were both taken into custody by the Serjeant-at-Arms. Further explanations ensued, and Lord Althorp subsequently withdrew the charge, stating that he believed Mr. Sheil's asseveration, and that he must himself have been misinformed. Vulgar Language in High Places.\u2014 I was sitting by Lord Althorp (writes Earl Russell) when be announced, in his own homely way, his resolution to resign. \" The pig's killed,\" he said. A porcine illustration was not new in our history. When Henry VIII. was con sidering of the best means of procuring his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, he gave his decision in favour of Cranmer's opinion by saying, Q 2"], [248, "228 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. \" Cranmer has got the right sow by the ear.\" When Sir Robert Walpole was asked how he had overcome Sir Spencer Compton, to whom the King was partial, he replied, \" He got the wrong sow by the ear, and I the right.\" So vulgar and idiomatic are the phrases of English monarchs and ministers. LORD MELBOURNE. (1779\u20141848.) His Manner in Debate. \u2014 Haydon, the painter, who was present in the House of Lords to hear a debate on the bill for the reduction of the Irish Church Establishment, in 1833, thus recorded his impressions of Melbourne's delivery : \" In the Irish Church debate the Duke (of WeUing ton) spoke weU, without hesitation, enforcing what he said with a bend of his head, striking his band forcibly, and as if convinced, on the papers. He finished, and, to my utter astonishment, up starts Melbourne like an artillery rocket. He began in a fury. His language flowed out like fire ; he made such palpable hits that he floored the duke as if he had shot him. But the moment the stimulus was over, his habitual apathy got a head ; he stammered, hummed, and hawed. It was the most pictorial exhibition of the night. He waved his white hand with the natural grace of Talma, expanded his broad chest, looked right at his adversary like a handsome lion, and grappled him with the grace of Paris.\" His Best Speech. \u2014 At the close of the session of 1836, Lord Lynd hurst made a review of its proceedings, and an attack on the Melbourne ministry, which elicited in reply what Melbourne's biographer (Mr. Torrens) terms the happiest and ablest speech of his life. He commenced by saying, \" I readily admit the great power and eloquence of the noble and learned lord. His clearness in argument and dexterity in sarcasm no one can deny ; and if he will be satisfied with a compliment confined strictly to ability, I am ready to render him that homage. But, my lords, ability is not everything. Propriety of conduct \u2014 the verecundia \u2014 should be combined with the ingenium, to make a great man and a statesman. It is not enough to be dur\u0153frontis, perdit\u0153 audaci\u0153. The noble and learned lord has referred to several historical characters, to whom he has been pleased to say that I bear some resemblance. I beg in return to remind him of what was once said by Lord Bristol* of a great statesman of former times (the Earl of Strafford), to whom, I think, the noble and learned lord might not inapplicably be compared ; ' The malignity of his practices was hugely aggravated by his vast talents, whereof God hath given the use, but the devil the application.' \" And the speaker concluded : \" The noble aud learned lord kindly advises me to resign, notwithstanding his own great horror of taking office after his ambition is already so fully satisfied. But I wUl teU the noble and learned lord that I will not be accessory to the sacrifice of himself, which ho would be ready to make if the burthen of the great seal were again forced upon him. I conscientiously believe * Lord Digby in the House of Commons, the Karl of Bristol in the Lords. See page 29."], [249, "LORD MELBOURNE. 229 that the well-being of the country requires in the judgment of the people that I should hold my present office \u2014 and hold it I wiU, until I am removed.\" It is recorded that the combatants on this occasion, Uke experienced men of the world, kept their temper, and good-humouredly owned the skiU of each other's fence. Lyndhurst crossed the house when it was over, and chatted laughingly with his former coUeague, as often was his way. Dismissal of the Melbourne Ministry. \u2014 Many accounts of this occurrence were current at the time and afterwards, but tho following particulars (gathered from Torrens' \" Life of Melbourne\") represent what appears to be a fairly correct version of the facts. The death of Earl Spencer in November, 1834, caUcd to the Upper House his son, Lord Althorp, the ChanceUor of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons. Lord Melbourne wrote to the King requesting an audience to submit for the royal consideration the views entertained by ministers of the general position of the Government in consequence, and their advice with regard to the future. William IV. received him without any seem ing diminution of kindliness or confidence. The conversation lasted for an hour and a half, and to the unsuspicious Minister it appeared the wish of the King to disembarrass the discussion of aU reserve. In answer to the inquiry who was to be charged with the conduct of public business in tho Lower House, he submitted the name of Lord John Russell as best qualified by experience, talent, and position ; but he suggested in the alter native the names of Spring Rice and Abercromby. Various difficulties and objections were discussed, but, without giving the Minister any reason to suspect what was contemplated, his Majesty said he would take time to think over the matter, and ended the consultation by saying, \" Now let us go to dinner.\" Nothing more occurred during the evening ; but next morning the King handed Melbourne a letter, evidently prepared with no little care, in which he stated that he was informed that Althorp's removal would speedily leave the Government in a minority in the Lower House ; and, as they were already in that condition in the Upper, it had become necessary to place the conduct of affairs in other hands. No alternative proposal was suggested, or qualification offered of the peremp tory nature of tho dismissal. Melbourne did not affect to conceal his surprise and concern, but, too proud to parley for the retention of office after confidence in his judgment had been so unceremoniously withdrawn, he rejected, in the briefest terms which deference would aUow, the offer of an earldom and the Garter. He desired to know when and to whom he should resign his trust. The King replied that he had made up his mind to send at once for the Duke of Wellington. As Melbourne passed through the adjoining room, he could not refrain from saying to Sir Herbert Taylor, by whose aid he knew that the written form of his dismissal had been prepared, \" Your old master would not have done this.\" The private secretary was embarrassed what to reply, and in his confusion said he had just concluded a letter to Sir Henry Wheatley which his master thought it of the utmost importance to have delivered that night. Would his lordship object to allowing his servant, on reach-"], [250, "230 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. ing town, to leave it at St. James's Palace p It was impossible not to divine that the missive which the perplexed amanuensis had just sealed contained a summons to the duke. The ludicrous aspect of the affair was irresistible ; and Melbourne with a grim smile undertook to play the part of first mute at his own funeral. The King Threatening Impeachment. \u2014 When Lord Melbourne was reinstated in the Premiership in 1835, after the defeat of Peel, the King could but ill conceal the dislike he felt for the Minister whom he had previously summarily dismissed from power ; and occasionaUy it would break forth vehemently. Lord Gosford had been named Governor of Canada, and no objection had been raised to his appointment. At a meeting of the Cabinet on the 11th of July, Melbourne said to his colleagues, \" Gentlemen, you may as weU know how you stand,\" and then proceeded to read a memorandum of a conversation between Lord Gosford and the King after a review the day before. His Majesty said, \"Mind what you are about in Canada. By I wiU never consent to alienate the Crown lands, nor to make the Council elective. Mind me, my lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet ; they had better take care, or by I will have them impeached. You are a gentleman, I beUeve ; I have no fear of you ; but take care what you do.\" The ministers present stared at one another, but agreed that it was better to take no notice of what had occurred, and see if the King's excitement would pass away. \" The Opposition \" an Irregular Epithet. \u2014 On the first day of the session of 1842, after Melbourne's retirement from office and the election of a new Parliament, Brougham took his seat on the front bench next to him, just as he had done (writes Torrens) seven years before, chatting with his former friends all round, whether they woidd or not. From that position he addressed the House on the notorious bribery of the last general election, apportioning the blame without fear, favour, or affec tion to the supporters of the party now in power, \" over and against whom he had the honour to stand, and the party in Opposition, in the front rank of which he had the honour to take his place.\" (Hear, hear, and a laugh from Lord Melbourne.) \" He was at a loss to know what was meant by the interruption. Was his noble friend lately at the head of the Govern ment annoyed at the term Opposition p \" Melbourne retorted by remind ing his implacable friend that so transcendent and impartial an arbiter of aU legislative measures ought not to declare himself beforehand a leader of Oppositiou. In the good old times men were not ranged in accordance with plighted vows of party. He could recoUect, when he was a member of the other House, a gentleman being caUed to order for designating some one as a member of the Opposition, and the Speaker ruling that the epithet was irregular. A Brief Reply. \u2014 The most crushing reply (says the Quarterly Revieic) that any assailant ever received was on an occasion when Lord Brougham closed one of his most brilliant displays with a diatribe against the Melbourne Government. Lord Melbourne's reply was comprised in a single sentence : \" My Lords, you have heard the eloquent speech of the noble and learned lord \u2014 one of the most eloquent he ever deUvered in this"], [251, "LORD MELBOURNE. 231 house \u2014 and I leave your lordships to consider what must be the nature and strength of the objections which prevent any Government from availing themselves of the services of such a man.\" Industry. \u2014 In the Diary of Bishop Wilberforce, at a time when he was under medical treatment by Dr. Copeland, he records: \"Dec. 25, 1845. \u2014 Copeland again fuU of anecdote. ' I had been attending Lord Melbourne for six weeks three times a day, when Minister. No one ever more mistaken. The most anxious painstaking man in the world. Worked aU day in his bedroom with secretaries, &c, that he might be able to send bores away with \u2014 My lord has not yet got out of his bedroom.' \" Ministerial Unanimity. \u2014 A familiar anecdote was thus related on one occasion by Sir Stafford Northcote to his constituents : \" Lord Melbourne's Ministry wanted to deal with the Corn Laws, and proposed an eight-shilling duty. His Government did this, and he was not very fond of it himself ; but when it had been agreed to by a majority of the Cabinet, what did he say P He remarked to his coUeagues, ' What are we to say about this P Is it intended to raise the price of corn, or to lower the price of corn, or to keep it steady P I don't care what we say it is, only we had better all have one story.\" Old-fashioned Language. \u2014 Lord Ossington (Mr. Speaker Denison) used to relate that, encountering Lord Melbourne when about to mount his horse at the door of his offi.e, he called his attention to some required modifications in his new Poor Law BiU. Lord Melbourne referred him to his brother George. \" I have been with him,\" was the reply, \" but he damned me, and damned the Bill, and damned the paupers.\" \" Well, damn it, what more could he do?\" was the rejoinder.\u2014 The Melbourne Papers. Indifference to Honours. \u2014 Mr. Charles Greville wrote of Mel bourne: \" He was perfectly disinterested, without nepotism, and without vanity ; he sought no emoluments for his connections, and steadUy declined all honours for himself. The Queen often pressed him to accept the Garter, but he never would consent, and it was remarked that tho Prime Minister of England was conspicuous at Court for being alone undecorated amidst the stars and ribands which glittered around him.\" Dispensation of Patronage. \u2014 He was on one occasion (remarks Torrens) pressed by the Sovereign to accept the blue riband, but declined. \" A Garter,\" said he, \" may attach to us somebody of consequence whom nothing else can reach ; but what would be the use of my taking it P I cannot bribe myself.\" . . As a rule, he generaUy would have dissuaded anyone he really liked from seeking a step in the peerage. He loved to tell the story of a certain earl whom Lord ComwaUis laughed at for wishing a marquisate : \" I have no son, and he has several, but if I had, I should remember that after such a promotion John and Tom could no longer afford to go to town on the top of the coach.\" Previous to the Queen's Coronation, when many were asking favours, an old friend wrote to say that he would caU on him to explain what he desired to"], [252, "232 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. have as a recognition of long fidelity. Ho happened to be the fourth who had come on similar business the same morning, and, the Minister's patience being rather exhausted, he said quickly, \" WeU, what can I do for you?\" Fearing to let the opportunity slip, the anxious visitor muttered, \" I don't very much care about it myself, but my lady wishes that I should be a marquis.\" Melbourne, who knew that he was not rich, opened his eyes, and said, \" Why, you are not such a fool as that, are you?\" On another occasion, an unfortunate member of the party, whom he had once described as a feUow who was asking for everything and fit for nothing, intimated that he had a new request to make, for reasons he wanted an interview to explain. The weary dispenser of patronage showed his note to Anson, saying, \" What the devil would he have now ! Does he want a Garter for the other leg ? \" Political Tutor to Queen Victoria. \u2014 Lord Melbourne's greatest service to his country was perhaps the painstaking care which he had the opportunity of showing, in the initiation of a new sovereign, both youthful and feminine, into the duty and the routine of the exalted functions she was called upon to exercise. The easy and amiable manners of the man made this task much less irksome to both than it might otherwise have been, and the manner in which it was discharged has been grate fully acknowledged by the Queen on more than one occasion. But the testimony of the greatest of Melbourne's political opponents may be quoted. The Duke of WeUington, in a speech in the House of Lords in 1841, said : \" I am wiUing to admit that the noble viscount has rendered the greatest possible service to her Majesty. I happen to know that it is her Majesty's opinion that the noble viscount has rendered her Majesty the greatest possible service, making her acquainted with the mode and poUcy of the government of this country, initiating her into the laws and spirit of the Constitution, independently of the performance of his duty as the servant of her Majesty's crown; teaching her, in short, to preside over the destinies of this great country.\" LORD BROUGHAM. (1778\u20141868.) Irrepressible Speech. \u2014 Henry Brougham received from the Duke of Bedford the offer of a seat for his borough of Camelford, and was returned in 1810. He spoke for the first time on the 5th of March in that year, in support of a motion by Mr. Whitbread for a vote of censure on the Government of the day, and on Lord Chatham, as commander-in-chief of the expedition to the Scheldt. He was expected to fire off an oration the very night he took his seat, but he had made a vow not to speak for a month, and he kept it. \"It was remarked.\" (writes CampbeU) \" that for the future he never was in his place a whole evening, in either House of Parliament, without, regularly or irre gularly, more than once taking part in the discussions.\" This (says tho Quarterly Review) is a Uttle overstated; but his oratory was irre pressible, and he would have suffered from suppressed speech as another"], [253, "LORD BROUGHAM. 233 man might suffer from suppressed gout. Although his first attempt was a failure, he soon fought his way to the front, and by the end of his first session was competing for the leadership of the Opposition, then held by the Right Hon. George Ponsonby, ex-Chancellor of Ireland. Careless whether his claim to the leadership was formaUy recognised or not, he took the lead on so many important questions that the general public could not weU help regarding him as leader, and the recalcitrant Whigs graduaUy succumbed to him. \" Broffam \" versus \" Broom.\" \u2014 Brougham did not get into regular practice at the bar tiU he had acquired celebrity in the House of Commons. He got a few Scotch appeals, and these brought him into early conflict with Lord Eldon, who persisted in calling him Mr. Broffam, tiU a formal remonstrance arrived through the assistant-clerk ; whereupon the ChanceUor gave in, and compUmented the offended counsel at the conclusion of the argument, saying, \" Every authority upon the question has been brought before us : new Brooms sweep clean.\" His Attack upon Canning. \u2014 Brougham took part in the debate on the Roman Catholic claims, April 17, 1823, and in the course of his speech said, referring to Canning, he \" had exhibited a specimen, the most incredible specimen, of monstrous truckling, for the purpose of obtaining office, that the whole history of political tergiversation could furnish.\" \" Hansard \" thus records what followed : \u2014 \" Mr. Secretary Canning : ' I rise to say that that is false.' The Speaker (after a per fect silence in the house during some seconds) said, in a low tone, ho hoped the right honourable Secretary would retract the expression he had used. An individual of his high rank and station could not faU to be aware that such an expression was a complete violation of the customs and of the orders of the House. He deeply regretted that, even in haste, it should have been used. Mr. Canning said he was sorry to have used any word which was a violation of the decorum of the House ; but nothing \u2014 no consideration on earth \u2014 should induce him to retract the sentiment. After an appeal to the House on the part of the Speaker, Mr. Canning expressed his regret, so far as tho orders of the House were concerned, at having attracted their displeasure, but said he could not in conscience recaU his declaration. Some further discussion ensued, when Mr. Bankes moved 'that the Right Honourable George Canning and Henry Brougham, Esq., be committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms attending this House.' Mr. Brougham opposed the motion, pointing out that with the unanimous assent of the House it had been declared by the highest authority that Mr. Canning had committed a breach of their rales ; and it was proposed by the motion to take himself also into custody, who had committed no offence whatever against the orders of the Honse. He admitted their power to take such a step if they chose, but declared if they did so it would be in flagrant violation of the principles of justice. He begged the House to understand he opposed the first part of the motion no less than the last. He would be the last man to hold up his hand for passing a censure upon the right honourable gentleman, or for committing him to custody for the expression which he had used on"], [254, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 234 hearing one half of the sentence which was about to be delivered. Ulti mately Mr. Canning\u2014 Mr. Bankes having withdrawn his motion\u2014 said he should think no more of the matter; and Mr. Brougham similarly expressing himself, the affair terminated.\" \u2014 Brougham's explanation, at the end of this scene, that he had used the offensive words \" only in a parliamentary sense,\" is pointed out by Lord CampbeU as having given Dickens the suggestion of the \"Pickwickian sense,\" in his most celebrated work. But Dickens, as a reporter, although too young to have been present at this particular scene, must have been famUiar with other occasions on which simUar incidents had occurred, and the \" parliamentary sense \" had been accepted as conveying \" no offence i' the world.\" AU the Difference. \u2014 Canning, when Premier, is said to have offered the post of Chief Baron of the Exchequer to Brougham, who refused it on the ground that it would prevent his sitting in Parliament. \" True,\" was the reply, \" but you wiU then be only one stage from the woolsack.\" \" Yes,\" returned Brougham, \" but the horses wiU be off.\" \" The Schoolmaster Abroad.\" \u2014 The debate on the Address which took place in the House of Commons on the 29th of January, 1828, was one of an unusually animated character, in consequence of the Duke of WeUington having resigned his office of Commander-in-Chief and formed a new administration. Brougham confessed that he felt a very great degree of objection to the arrangement. There was in it, he said, no security or compensation to the house or to the country for this union of power. He had no fear, however, of slavery being introduced into this country by the power of the sword. It would take a stronger, it would demand a more powerful man even than the Duke of WeUington to effect such an object. These were not the times for such an attempt. There had been periods when the country heard with dismay that \"the soldier was abroad.\" Now there was another person abroad \u2014 a less important person ; in the eyes of some, an insignificant person ; whose labours had tended to produce this state of things. The schoolmaster was abroad ! And he trusted more to the schoolmaster armed with his primer, than he did to the soldier in fuU miUtary array, for upholding and extending the liberties of his country. A Noble Boast. \u2014 Brougham's speech in the House of Commons on Law Reform, in February, 1828, was one of the most effective he ever delivered. The Quarterly Review says of it that, \" directly or indirectly, it has probably led to a greater number of important and beneficial results than any other speech, ancient or modern.\" He spoke on this occasion for six hours, and concluded thus : \" It was the boast of Augustus \u2014 it formed part of the glare in which the perfidies of his earlier years were lost \u2014 that he found Rome of brick and left it of marble ; a praise not unworthy a great prince, and to which the present reign also has its claims. But how much nobler will be the sovereign's boast when he shall have it to say that he found law dear and left it cheap ; found it a sealed book, left it a Uving letter ; found it the patrimony of the rich, left it the inheritance of the poor ; found it the two-edged sword of craft and oppres sion, left it the staff of honesty and the shield of innocence.\""], [255, "LORD BROUGHAM. 235 \"Measures, not Men.\" \u2014 Addressing the House of Commons in November, 1830, Mr. Brougham said : \" I beg here to state that, as a general principle, my intention is to support measures which meet with my approbation, and to oppose those of contrary tendency, let the one or the other come from whom they may. It is necessary, however, that I should qualify the doctrine of its being not men, but measures,* that I am deter mined to support. In a monarchy it is the duty of Parliament to look at the men as well as the measures ; because a set of men might make a treaty which would render war inevitable at some distant day, unless the honour and safety of the country were sacrificed. I say, therefore, as long as a set of men can act secretly, that we are imperatively caUed upon to look at them and their character, as well as at the measures they propound.\" \"Pawning Parasites.\" \u2014 In the House of Commons in 1830, Brougham launched out against the Wellington Ministry \" in a strain of bitter invective, of sarcasm vehement even to fierceness.\" Mr. Roebuck (\" Whig Ministry of 1830 \") gives the foUowing passage from his speech, which called forth an indignant protest from Sir Robert Peel : \" You will see in this, as in that country (France), that the day of force is now over, and that he who would rale his country by an appeal to royal favour or military power may be overwhelmed, may be hurled down by it, if he should enter tain such an idea \u2014 and I in no wise accuse him of such an attempt ; him I accuse not ; I \" and here the excited orator stretched out his long bony arm, and pointed with a lean and almost skeleton finger at the Treasury bench, \" I accuse you, I accuse his flatterers \u2014 those mean, fawning parasites \" Sir Robert rose at once, and, in grave indignant terms, caUed the speaker to order. \" I ask the honourable and learned gentleman, as I am one of those sitting on this side of the house, whether he means to accuse me of being a fawning parasite P \" Cheeked thus suddenly in mid-career, Mr. Brougham seemed at once to perceive that the phrase he had used and the charge he had brought were not to be justified, and instantly, therefore, disclaimed any intention of applying the words to Sir Robert Peel himself, who truly observed, on this retrac tation, that it was hardly sufficient, and declared that ho would therefore, on behalf of Mr. Brougham, make the apology and retractation which ought to have been made by the learned gentleman. This he did, and Mr. Brougham with great good sense and good feeling adopted it. His Election for Yorkshire. \u2014 Lord CampbeU thus speaks of Brougham's contest for the representation of the county of York, in 1830 : \" No man ever went through such fatigue of body and mind as he did for the three foUowing weeks. The assizes at York were about to begin, and he chanced to have a good many retainers. Instead of giving these up, he appeared in court and exerted himself as an advocate with more than wonted spirit. Having finished an address to the jury, he would throw off his wig and gown, and make a speech to tho electors in the \u2022 Lofty. \u2014 \" Measures, not men, have always been my mark ; and I vow,\" 4c. \u2014 Goldsmith's \" Good-Natured Man.\""], [256, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 236 Castle yard on ' the three glorious days of Paris,' and the way in which the people of England might peaceably obtain stiU greater advantages. He would then return to court and reply in a cause respecting right of common of turbary, having, in the twinkling of an eye, picked up from his junior a notion of all that had passed in his absence. But, what is much more extraordinary, before the nomination day arrived, he had held public meetings and delivered stirring speeches in every town and large village within the county ; stiU day by day addressing juries, and winning or losing verdicts. County elections at that time, lasting fifteen days, excited prodigious interest. All England looked with eagerness on this contest, and, when Brougham's return was actually proclaimed, the triumph was said to form a grand epoch in the history of parliamentary representation.\" His Stride to the Chancellorship. \u2014 In his own account of his \" Life and Times,\" Lord Brougham thus wrote : \"My return for the great county of York was my greatest victory, my most unsullied success. I may say, without hyperbole, that when, as knight of the shire, I was girt with the sword, it was the proudest moment of my life.\" The Government of Earl Grey, wishing to secure Brougham's co-operation, offered him the Attorney-Generalship, but this he refused. He said he would take the Mastership of the RoUs, which could be held conjointly with a seat in the House of Commons ; but to this both the Ministers and the King objected. The King, however, asked if the great seal had been offered to Brougham, and on Lord Grey's replying it had not, because he anticipated an objection from his Majesty, \" Oh no,\" said the King, \" there is no ono I would rather have for my Chancellor.\" He afterwards (writes Brougham) \"once or twice alluded to this when in particularly good humour, and caUed me his Chancellor, as named by himself and not by my coUeagues. In fact, I more than suspect that the Tories, on going out, warned him not to leave mo in the Commons, member for Yorkshire, chief of the popular party, and irremovable Master of the Rolls. In fact, I knoio that Huskisson told a friend of mine that he did not see how any Government could go on were I without office, and only member for Yorkshire ; but that if I had the Rolls too, I was absolute for life.\" A Maternal Preference. \u2014 Brougham, after his elevation to the woolsack, like a pious son \" as he ever showed himself,\" says Lord CampbeU, took a journey to Brougham HaU to visit his venerable mother, and, kneeling before her, to ask her blessing on a Lord Chancellor. The good old lady still preserved her fine faculties quite entire ; but whde she reciprocated her boy's affection for her, and was proud of his abilities and the distinction he had acquired, she said, with excellent good sense and feeling, \" My dear Harry, I would rather have embraced the member for Yorkshire ; but God Almighty bless you ! \" Treasonable Proceedings. \u2014 The Dissolution of 1831.* \u2014 At a Cabinet Council which was held April 22nd, 1831, immediately after the defeat of the Government in the Commons on the Reform question, * See also page 57."], [257, "LORD BROUGHAM. 237 it was resolved to advise the King to prorogue Parliament with a view to an early dissolution. Earl Grey and Lord Brougham weie deputed to wait on his Majesty and communicate to him the advice of the Cabinet. The interview which these ministers had with King WilUam, in discharge of their mission, is thus described by Mr. Moles worth, following Mr. Roebuck's account, which it was presumed Lord Brougham had authorised ; and the particulars in the main are corroborated by his lordship's Autobiography :\u2014 The ChanceUor approached the subject very carefuUy, prefacing the disagreeable message with which he was charged by a compliment on the King's desire to promote the welfare of his people. He then proceeded to communicate the advice of the Cabinet, adding that they were unanimous in offering it. \" What ! \" exclaimed the King, \"would you have me dismiss in this summary manner a Parliament that has granted me so splendid a civil list, and given my Queen so liberal an annuity in case she survives me ?\" \" No doubt, sire,\" Lord Brougham replied, \" in these respects they have acted wisely and honourably ; but your Majesty's advisers are aU of opinion that, in tho present state of affairs, every hour that this Parlia ment continues to sit is pregnant with danger to the peace and security of your kingdom, and they humbly beseech your Majesty to go down this very day and prorogue it ; if you do not, they cannot be answerable for the consequences. The King was greatly embarrassed; he evidently entertained the strongest objection to the proposed measure, but he also felt the danger which would result from the resignation of his ministers at the present crisis. He therefore shifted his ground, and asked, \" Who is to carry the sword of state and the cap of maintenance ? \" \" Sire, knowing the urgency of the crisis and the imminent peril in which the country at this moment stands, we have ventured to tell those whose duty it is to perform these and other similar offices, to hold themselves in readiness.\" \" But the troops \u2014 the Life Guards ; I have given no orders to have them caUed out, and now it is too late.\" This was, indeed, a serious objection ; for to caU out the Guards was the special prerogative of the monarch himself, and no minister had any right to order their attendance without his express command. \" Sire,\" replied the Chancellor, with some hesitation, \" we must throw ourselves on your indulgence. Deeply feeling the gravity of the crisis, and knowing your love for your people, we have taken a liberty which nothing but the most imperious necessity could warrant ; we have ordered out the troops, and we humbly throw ourselves on your Majesty's indulgence.\" The King's eye flashed, and his cheek became crimson ; he was evidently on the point of dismiss ing the ministry in an explosion of anger. \" Why, my lords,\" he exclaimed, \" this is treason ! \u2014 high treason ! and you, my Lord Chancellor, ought to know that it is.\" \" Yes, sire, I do know it ; and nothing but the strongest conviction that your Majesty's crown and the interests of tho nation are at stake could have induced us to take such a step, or to tender the advice we are now giving.\" This submissive reply had the desired effect : the King cooled ; his prudence and better genius prevailed; and, having once made up his mind to yield, ho yielded with a good grace."], [258, "238 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. He accepted, without any objection, the speech which had been prepared for him, and which the two ministers had brought with them ; he gave orders respecting the details of the approaching ceremonial, and, having completely recovered his habitual serenity and good humour, he dismissed the two lords with a jocose threat of impeachment. Brougham's Reform Speech in the Lords. \u2014 On the second reading of the Reform BiU in October, 1831, Brougham delivered his great speech in defence of it, which (says CampbeU) \" by many was considered his chef-d'\u0153uvre. It certainly was a wonderful performance to witness. He showed a most stupendous memory, and extraordinary dexterity in handling the weapons both of ridicule and of reason. Without a note to refer to, he went through aU the speeches of his opponents delivered during the five nights' debate, analysing them successively, and, with a little aid from perversion, giving them all a seemingly triumphant answer. The peroration was partly inspired by draughts of mulled port, imbibed by him very copiously towards the conclusion of the four hours during which he was on his legs or on his knees. . . ' I pray and I exhort you not to reject this measure. By all you hold most dear; by all the ties that bind every one of us to our common order and our common country, I solemnly adjure you \u2014 I warn you \u2014 I implore you \u2014 yea, on my bended knees [he kneels] I supplicate you \u2014 reject not this biU!' He continued for some time as if in prayer ; but his friends, alarmed for him lest he should be suffering from the effects of the muUed port, picked him up aud placed him safely on the woolsack. Like Burke's famous dagger scene in the House of Commons, this prostration was a failure ; so unsuited was it to the spectators and to the actor that it produced a sensation of ridicule, and considerably impaired the effect of a speech displaying wonderful powers of memory and of intellect.\" \u2014 Lord Campbell's account of this scene must be taken with some allowance. He was quite capable of occasional exaggeration ; and it wiU be remembered that when Brougham heard the biographer of \" The Chancellors \" had prepared for that work supplementary lives of himself and Lord Lyndhurst, he observed that Campbell had \" added a new terror to death.\" A Reform Cry. \u2014 Earl Russell, in his \" RecoUeetions,\" says that the cry of \" The Bill, the whole BiU, and nothing but the BiU,\" owed its origin to Lord Brougham, and was intended to meet the disposition exist ing in the House of Commons to introduce destructive amendments. It \" gave tho Government a very powerful lever in raising the country to tho height of their lofty proposals, while it did not prevent them from modi fying some clauses which were ill-considered or unpopular.\" The Threatened Creation of Peers.\u2014 Respecting the threatened creation of peers to secure the passage of the Reform BUI (see page 58, ante), Lord Brougham thus wrote in his later years : \" Since 1832, I have often askod myself the question whether, if no secession had taken place, and the Peers had persisted in opposing the biU, we should have had recourse to the perilous creation P Above thirty years have rolled over my head since the crisis of 1832. I speak as calmly on this as I now do upon any political matter whatsoever, and I cannot answer"], [259, "LORD BROUGHAM. 239 the question in the affirmative.* The list I had prepared of eighty new creations, when I went with Lord Grey to Windsor in May, 1832, was framed upon the principle of making the least possible permanent addi tion to the House. When I supported Grey in pressing the measure upon the King, I felt strongly the necessity of the case, circumstanced as we then were ; but so greatly did I fear the dreadful consequences of the act, that I am persuaded I should, when it came to the point, have pre ferred running the risk of the confusion which would have attended the loss of the bill. I know that Grey would have more than met me half way in resolving to face that or any risk, rather than expose the Constitu tion to the imminent hazard of subversion. . . He distinctly told me that I had very much understated his repugnance ; and that when the time came he never would have consented to take the step. When the Duke of WeUington read my statements to the above effect, two or three years before his death at Walmer, where I always passed a day or two before going to Cannes, he said : ' Oh ! then you confess you were playing a game of brag with me. Indeed, I always was certain it was a threat, and that you never would have created peers.' To this aU I could say was, that we were thoroughly convinced at the time of the necessity.\" Asserting a \" Right.\" \u2014 The House of Lords went into committee on the Abolition of Slavery BiU, Aug. 14th, 1833, when Lord Chan cellor Brougham, opposing an amendment of the Duke of WeUington, said that a slave who had been freed \" would have as good a right to sit in the other House of Parliament as the noble duke opposite (the Duke of WeUington), who was illustrious by his actions, and the iUustrious duke near him (the Duke of Cumberland), who was illustrious by the courtesy of that House.\" The Duke of Cumberland rose to order; he had not said one word to caU for such an attack. The Lord ChanceUor said, the iUus trious duke was most disorderly in caUing him to order on the score of having addressed the iUustrious duke. He had a right to address any one of their lordships. Ho had exercised the right of addressing the members of the other House for twenty years, and, please God, he would continue to exercise that right as regarded their lorships. \u2014 Hansard. Vituperation. \u2014 Lord Brougham was no more backward in exercising his vituperative powers, when occupying the dignified position of Lord Chancellor, than he had been in other stages of his career. A gross instance occurred in July, 1832, in his comparison of Sir Edward Sugden (afterwards Lord St. Leonard's) to a bug. Sir Edward had moved in the House of Commons for an inquiry into certain matters in which the Lord ChanceUor was concerned, aud the latter thus referred in the other House to the subject and the mover : \" My lords, we have aU read that it is this heaven-born thirst for information, and its invariable concomitants \u2014 a self -disregarding and candid mind \u2014 that most distinguishes men from the lower animals ; from the crawling reptUe, from the wasp that stings, and from the wasp that fain would but cannot sting : \u2014 distinguishes us, my * The italics are Lord Brougham's. f In Brougham's \" Political Philosophy,\" Part III."], [260, "240 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. lords, not only from the insect that crawls and stings, but from that more powerful because more offensive creature, the bug, which, powerful and offensive as it is, after aU is but vermin. Yes, I say, it is this laudable pro pensity upon which humanity justly prides itself, which, I have no doubt, solely influenced the learned gentleman to whom I aUude to seek for information which it would be cruel to stingily gratify.\" \u2014 On another occasion, the Marquis of Londonderry having accused the ChanceUor of resorting to vituperation, was met with the reply : \" The noble lord says that I am particularly fond of vituperation. I am not prone to a vitu perative style of argument. The noble lord is a person of that sort that if you were to bray him in a mortar you could not bray the prejudices out of him.\" Seal Fishing. \u2014 Brougham had been very sanguine in his opposition to the bill for repealing the Navigation Laws, in 1849, and was deeply mortified when it passed both Houses. \" While the biU was depending,\" says Lord CampbeU, \" I happened to caU upon him one morning, in Grafton Street, to talk to him about a Scotch appeal, and was shown into his library. He soon rushed in very eagerly, but suddenly stopped short, exclaiming ' Lord bless me ! is it you P They told me it was Stanley.' And notwithstanding his accustomed frank and courteous manner, I had some difficulty in fixing his attention. In the evening I stepped across the House to the Opposition bench, where Brougham and Stanley were sitting next each other, and, addressing the latter in the hearing of the former, I said, ' Has our noble and learned friend told you the disappoint ment he suffered this morning ? He thought he had a visit from the leader of the Protectionists to offer him the great seal, and it turned out to be only CampbeU come to bore him about a point of Scotch law.' Brougham : ' Don't mind what Jack Campbell says ; he has a prescriptive privilege to teU lies of aU ChanceUors dead and living.' Many jokes were circulated against Brougham on this occasion. A few days after his great speech, I myself heard Lyndhurst say to him, ' Brougham, here is a riddle for you. Why does Lord Brougham know so much about the Navigation Laws P Answer : Because he has been so long engaged in the Seal fishery.' \" Volatility. \u2014 At a Mansion House dinner in 1850 to promote the contemplated Great Exhibition of the foUowing year, Lord Stanley made an allusion to Lord Brougham (who was absent) as \" his noble and learned but somewhat volatile friend.\" For this Lord Brougham took him to task on the following evening in the House of Lords, saying, among other things, \" VolatUe means flighty; but I, to answer a speech made in my presence in the House of Lords, have never flown to the House of Mayors.\" Lord Stanley, in reply, expressed his regret that he had occasioned dis quietude to \" his noble and learned and very grave and discreet friend,\"' but justified the expression he had used on the previous evening. \" Iu point,\" said he, \" of acuteness, activity, rapidity, and pungency, sal volatile is nothing when compared with my noble and learned friend. You may put a stopper of glass or leather on that ethereal essence, but I defy any human power, even that of my noble and learned friend"], [261, "LORD BROUGHAM. 241 himself, to put any stopper, either of glass, or leather, or any other material, over the activity, ingenuity, and pungency of his mind.\" After some further bantering remarks, Lord Stanley expressed a hope that the long friendship between himself and Brougham would not be disturbed by the phrase he had used ; and the latter replied in a similar strain. The interlude provoked much laughter. Smelling Bottle for a Parliamentary Antagonist. \u2014 Charles WiUiams Wynn, for many years the \"father\" of the House of Commons, who from his youth upwards had been the great oracle of parliamentary law, deUvered an opinion in the House on a question of privilege, contrary to Brougham's, fortifying his position with many precedents and references to the Journals. Lord CampbeU relates the incident, and the compliment Brougham paid to the learned member, winding up with the statement that \"In short, he is a man whose devotion in this respect can only be equalled by that of a learned ancestor of his (Speaker Williams, temp. Car. II), who having fainted from excessive toil and fatigue, a smelling-bottle was caUed for, when one, who knew much better the remedy adapted to the case, exclaimed, ' For God's sake bring him an old black-letter Act of Parliament, and let him smell that ! ' I cannot help thinking that, in like manner, if my right honourable and learned friend should ever be attacked in a similar way, the mere smeUing of a volume of the Journals could not fail instantly to revive him.\" Claiming the Thunder. \u2014 It was once said of Brougham by Canning : \" The honourable and learned gentleman having, in the course of his parliamentary life, supported or proposed almost every species of innovation which could be practised on the Constitution, it was not very easy for Ministers to do anything without seeming to borrow from him. Break away in what direction they would, whether to the right or to the left, it was all alike. ' Oh,' said the honourable gontleman, ' I was there before you ; you would not have thought of that if I had not given you a hint.' In the reign of Queen Anue there was a sage and grave critic of the name of Dennis, who iu his old age got it into his head that ho had written aU the good plays which were acted at that time. At last a tragedy came forth with a most imposing display of hail aud thunder. At the first peal, Dennis exclaimed, ' That is my thunder ! ' So with the honourable and learned gentleman ; there was no noise astir for the good of mankind in any part of the world, but he instantly claimed it for his thunder.\" The Right of Public Meeting.\u2014 The foUowing remarks were made by Lord Brougham in a speech in the House of Lords in 1848 : \" I agree that it is most important for the peace of the country as weU as for the liberty of the subject, for the rights of the Crown as weU as for the people, that the unquestionably aU-important right of petition should be as little as may be, and unless where absolute necessity requires it, ever interfered with; and, my lords, I hold the right of public meeting for discussion to stand in the same position and on the same grounds. But I hold it to be an absolute essential condition to the exercise of that right, and to its existence as a matter of right, that the r."], [262, "242 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. meeting should be for discussion alone. Wherever it is a mere assemblage of numbers, too large for any possibility of discussion, it becomes an assemblage of numbers merely for the display of physical force, and can only have the intention of overawing the Government, and of forcing measures on the Government and on the Parliament. If people have a right to a display of force, they can only have the right when that force is called for by the Government of the country, under the sanction of the Parliament of the country. Therefore I have ever held that those meetings that are called, whether in England or in Ireland, ' monster meetings ' are in themselves essentially iUegal. They are mere exhibitions of physical force, and it is only by the perversion of language that they can be affected or pretended to be meetings for that which becomes an impossibility at them \u2014 discussion. AU never dream of speaking, but aU, if they do not dream of acting, place themselves in such a position that, without any wiU or intention of their own, they may be driven before they know it into illegal courses.\" LORD LYNDHURST. (1772\u20141863.) His First Appearance in the Commons. \u2014 In 1817 Mr. Copley (afterwards Lord Lyndhurst) was returned to serve in Parliament for Yarmouth, in the Isle of Wight. He first broke sUence in the House by a few observations in support of the practice, now abandoned and uni versally condemned, of giving rewards to witnesses upon the conviction of offenders. \" He entered his protest against the broad assertion hazarded by an honourable member, that the system of granting rewards had been productive of great confusion throughout the country. He Hmself,\" he said, \" had been engaged for fourteen years on the Midland Circuit, and had never known a single instance to justify such a statement.\" Views and Prospects. \u2014 Copley, when Solicitor-General, replying to a taunt of the Marquis of Tavistock during a debate on the Blasphemous Libel BiU in 1819, said, \" I would ask the noble lord on what grounds he brings charges against me for my former conduct ? Why am I taunted with inconsistency? I never, before my entrance into this House, belonged to any political society, or was in any way connected with politics ; and even if I had intended to connect myself with any party, I confess that during my short parliamentary experience I have seen nothing in the views of the gentlemen opposite to induce me to join them.\" Lord J. RusseU, in one of the prefaces to his Life of Moore, says with regard to this passage : \" I remember sitting by Mackintosh when a great lawyer, disclaiming from the Treasury Bench aU participation in the opinions of the Liberal party, said, ' I could see nothing to tempt me in the views of the gentlemen opposite.' 'For views read prospects,' whispered Mackintosh to me.\" A Plagiarism. \u2014 CampbeU, in his life of Lyndhurst, referring to the celebrated speech against Catholic emancipation delivered in March, 1827."], [263, "LORD LYNDHURST. 243 by the subject of his biography\u2014 who was at that time Master of the Rolls \u2014 states that, at the close of his harangue, he sat down amidst some cheers and a great deal of tittering. The latter arose from the circum stance that all the historical facts and arguments which Copley had used were to be found, nearly in the same order, in a very able pamphlet recently published by Dr. Philpotts, then Prebendary of Durham. Before Copley concluded, the plagiarism was detected by several members, and a stanza from a weU-known song was whispered through the House :\u2014 \" Dear Tom, this brown jug which now foams with mild ale, Out of which I now drink to sweet Nan of the Vale, Was once Toby Philpotts'.\" A Comparison and a Contrast. \u2014 Lord Lyndhurst, having before strongly opposed Catholic emancipation, supported from the woolsack the measure to effect it, when it was brought forward by his colleagues in 1829. Contrasting his speech in that year with one made in 1828, Lord Winchilsea said he knew of no parallel to the delivery of two such speeches by the same man within a year, except the delivery of a woman in a parish workhouse in Kent, who was brought to bed of a white baby and a black one at a birth. Not Too Old to Learn. \u2014 While advocating a change of poUcy regarding tho Catholics, Lord ChanceUor Lyndhurst urged, in reply to objections advanced, that members of that body had sat in Parliament after the Reformation, without danger to reformed principles. Lord Eldon interposed with the question, \"Did tho noble and learned lord know that last year? \" The Chancellor replied, \" I confess that I did not; but, my lords, I have since been prosecuting my studies. I have advanced in knowledge ; and, in my bumble opinion, even the noble and learned lord might improve himself in the same way.\" This sally, says CampbeU, set the House in a roar, and procured a favourable hearing for the ChanceUor during the rest of his speech. Proud Humility. \u2014 In the debate on the Reform Bill in the House of Lords in 1831, Lord Lyndhurst addressed the House on the fifth and last night, and was said to have had a powerful influence in increasing the majority by which the measure was then rejected. In the course of his speech he aUuded as follows to his own origin, and turned the fact to oratorical account. He said : \" My lords, I owe the situation I have the honour to hold in this house to the generous kindness of my late sovereign. I cannot boast an illustrious descent. I have sprung from the people. I am proud of being thus associated with the descendants of those illustrious names which have spread lustre upon the history of our country. But if I thought your lordships were capable of being influenced by the unworthy measures which have been resorted to, and that you could from such motives be induced to swerve from your duty on this important occasion, when everything valuable in our institutions is at stake, I should be ashamed of this dignity, and take refuge from it in the comparative obscurity of private life, rather than mix with men so unmindful of the obligations imposed upon them by their high station and illustrious birth.\" B 2"], [264, "244 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. The Judgment of Solomon. \u2014 Lord Lyndhurst was Chancellor on tho accession of WiUiam IV., when (says Campbell), by an order in councd, a new great seal was ordered to be prepared by his Majesty's chief en graver, but when it was finished and an order was made for using it, Lord Brougham was ChanceUor. Lord Lyndhurst claimed the old great seal on the ground that the transactions must be referred back to the date of the first order, and that the fruit must therefore be considered as having faUen in his time ; whUe Lord Brougham insisted that the point of time to be regarded was the moment when the old great seal ceased to be the \"clavis regni,\" and that there was no exception to the general rule. The matter being submitted to the King, as supreme judge in such cases, his Majesty equitably adjudged that the old great seal should be divided between the two noble and learned litigants, and, as it consisted of two parts for making an impression on both sides of the wax appended to letters patent \u2014 one representing the Sovereign on the throne and the other on horseback \u2014 the destiny of the two parts respectively should be deter mined by lot. His Majesty's judgment was much applauded, and he graciously ordered each part to be set in a splendid silver salver, with appropriate device and ornaments, which he presented to the late and present keepers of his conscience as a mark of his personal respect for them. The ceremony of breaking or \" damasking \" the old great seal consists in the Sovereign giving it a gentle blow with a hammer, after which it is supposed to be broken, and has lost all its virtue. Oratorical Preparation and Delivery. \u2014 Lord Lyndhurst once remarked to a friend, \" Brougham says that he prepares the great passages in his speeches ; and he weaves them with wonderful dexterity into tho extempore portions. The seams are never apparent. I am not able to perform that double operation. Such an effort of verbal memory would interfere with the free exercise of my mind upon the parts which were not prepared. My practice is to think my subject over and over to any extent you please ; but with the exception of certain phrases, which necessarUy grow out of the process of thinking, I am obliged to leave the wording of my argument to the moment of delivery.\" His latest biographer (Sir Theodore Martin) records that Lyndhurst, like aU great orators, never rose to speak without nervous emotion, although this in no way interfered with his power of thinking as he spoke, and calling into play the fittest language to express what he thought. He also mentions in a note that \"The late Lord Derby, to all appearance the most self possessed of orators, told the late Sir A. Alison that ' he never rose to speak, even in an after-dinner assembly, without experiencing a certain degree of nervous tremor, which did not go off tiU he warmed to the subject.'\" Sent for to Form a Ministry. \u2014 In May, 1832, during the crisis on the Reform BiU, Lord Lyndhurst was sent for by the King to form a Ministry, and consulted his friends Wellington and Peel on the subject, but they, with other prominent members of the party, declined to act at the moment. \"Peel said, with a tone of conceutrated resolution, that he could not and would not have anything to do with the settlement of the"], [265, "LORD LYNDHURST. 245 Reform question. . . Public men should maintain a character for consistency and disinterestedness, which he would for ever forfeit if, a second time, he were on any pretence to act, over again, anything like his part in tho Catholic question.\" \u2014 Croker Papers. An Octogenarian's Speech. \u2014 Lord Campbell, who was by no means prejudiced in favour of Lyndhurst, writes in his life of him : \" By one motion which he made, whoUy unconnected with party, he acquired immense eclat. This was for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the claims of Baron de Bode. He was now turned of 80 ; he was obliged to support himself on a walking-stick while he spoke, and he was nearly blind. But his voice was strong, articulate, and musical, his arguments lucid, his reasoning ingenious and plausible, and he displayed a power of memory which at any age would have appeared almost miracu lous. . . This was the most wonderful effort of a public speaker I ever witnessed in my time. He had a very bad case, yet he not only riveted the attention of all who heard him, but enUsted their sympathies on his side.\" Rejection of Money Bills by the Lords.\u2014 On the 21st of May, 1860, the Nestor of the House of Lords, as he was styled, then in his 88th year, delivered a long and able speech against the second reading of the BiU for the Repeal of the Paper Duty. He thus maintained the right of the Lords to reject a money bill : \" I do not dispute \u2014 nor can it be for a moment disputed \u2014 that we have no right whatsoever to amend what is caUed a money biU. We have, moreover, no right whatsoever to originate a biUof that nature. But that principle docs not apply to the rejection of money biUs. I take leave to say that there is not an instance to bo found in which the House of Commons has controverted our right to reject money bills. . . My lords, as I said I would confine myself to this question of privilege, I wiU only further observe that the iUusions \u2014 perhaps I may say the delusions \u2014 created by tho introduction of tho Budget seem to have passed away, and we have learned that, although brUliant eloquence has charms, yet, like other seductions, it is not without its dangers. The same schemes may bear tho impress of genius, of impru dence, of rashness. Satis eloquent i\u0153, sapienti\u00e6 parum, is not an irre concUable combination.\" * National Safety and its Cost. \u2014 In July, 1S59, when the public mind was agitated by the French war in Italy, and the announcement of the projocted annexation of Savoy to France, Lord Lyndhurst addressed the House of Lords on our continental relations, and said : \" Self-reliance is the best road to distinction in private Use. It is equally essential to the character and grandeur of a nation. It will be necessary for onr \u25a0defence that we should have a military force sufficient to cope with any Power or combination of Powers that may be brought against us. The -question of the money expense sinks into insignificance. It is the price we must pay for our insurance, and it is but a moderate price for so important an insurance. I know that there are persons who will say, ' Let See Mr. Gladstone's \" Gigantio Innovation.\""], [266, "246 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. us ran the risk.' Be it so. But, my lords, if the calamity should come, if the conflagration should take place, what words can describo the extent of the calamity, or what imagination can paint the overwhelming ruin that would fall upon us ? I shall be told, perhaps, that these are the timid counsels of old age. My lords, for myself, I should run no risk. Per sonally, I have nothing to fear. But to point out possible peril, and how to guard effectively against it, that is surely to be considered, not as timidity, but as the dictates of wisdom and prudence. I have confined myself to facts that cannot be disputed. I think I have confined myself also to inferences which no man can successfuUy contravene. I hope what I have said has been in accordance with your feelings and opinions. I shall terminate what I have to say in two emphatic words, V\u0153 victis ! \u2014 words of solemn and most significant import.\" THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. (1769\u20141852.) First Appearances of Wellington and Castlereagh. \u2014 Sir Jonah Barring-ton, in his \" Historic Memoirs of Ireland,\" wrote : \" My personal acquaintance with the Duke of Wellington originated acci- dentally, soon after I commenced public Use. Lu 1793, when I was in high repute, most prosperous at the bar, I occasionaUy gave large dinners. At one of those parties, Sir John ParneU brought with him, and intro- duced to me, Captain WeUesley and Mr. Stewart, two young members (of the Irish Parliament). Captain Arthur WeUesley had, in 1790, been returned to Parliament for Trim, county Meath, a borough under the patronage of his brother, the Earl of Mornington. He was then ruddy- faced, and juvenile in appearance, and rather popular among the young men of his age and station. He occasionaUy spoke in Parliament, but evinced no promise of that unparalleled celebrity and splendour which he has since reached. Mr. Stewart (afterwards Lord Castlereagh) was the son of a country gentleman, generally accounted a very clever man, in the north of Ireland. He began his career in the House by a motion for a committee to inquire into the representation of the people, with the ulterior object of a reform in Parliament. He made a good speech, and had a majority. At the period to which I allude, I feel confident that nobody could have predicted that one of those young gentlemen would become the most cele- brated general of his era, and the other the Minister of England. How- ever, it is observable that to the personal intimacy of those two individuals they owed their elevation. Sir Arthur WeUesley never would have had the chief command in Spain, but for the ministerial aid of Lord Castle reagh ; and Lord Castlereagh could never have stood his ground as a Minister but for Lord WeUington's successes.\" Barly Frivolity. \u2014 An Unfulfilled Prediction. \u2014 \" I remember,\" said Lord Plunket, \" being on a committee with him. The duke (then Captain WeUesley or Wesley) was, I recollect, playing with one of those toys called quizzes, the whole time of the sitting of the committee.\" \u2014 This trait of the duke (remarks Lord J. Russell in his \" Memoirs of"], [267, "THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. 247 Moore \") coincides perfectly with aU that I have ever heard about this great man's apparent frivolity at that period of his life. LuttreU, indeed, who is about two years older than the duke, and who lived on terms of intimacy with all the Castle men of those days, has the courage to own, in the face of aU the duke's present glory, that often, in speculating on the future fortunes of the young men with whom he Uved, he has said to himself, in looking at Wellesley's vacant face, \" WeU, let who wiU get on in this world, you certainly wiU not ! \" Traffic in Irish Boroughs. \u2014 In the \" Civil Correspondence and Memoranda of the Duke of WeUington \" during the time when he was Sir Arthur WeUesley and Chief Secretary for Ireland (1807 to 1809), the foUowing passages, among others of similar nature, show the way in which Parliamentary boroughs were at that time dealt with as political counters. Sir Arthur writes to the Right Hon. Charles Long : \" Pennefather has promised us the refusal of CasheU, but he has not stated his terms. We shaU have Athlone, I believe, but I have not yet seen Justice Day. Wynne has arranged for Sligo with Canning ; I don't know whether it is the Secretary of State or not. Lord Portarlington is in England, and the agent who settled for that borough upon the last general election was Mr. ParneU. We have no chance with him, and it would be best to arrange the matter with Lord Portarlington. I heard here that he had sold the return for six years at the last election, and if that should be true, of course we shaU not get it now. I have written to Roden, and have desired Henry to settle with EnniskiUen. The former is in Scotland, the latter in London. I have desired Lord H. to send to Lord Charlevillo about Carlow. Tell Henry to make me acquainted with the price of the day.\" And again : \" I have written to Henry (WeUesley) about a seat for myself ; of course I should not wish to pay much money for one. A man has offered me a seat for Wallingford; let me know who shaU be returned for it. Names for the following boroughs : CasheU, Tralee, EnniskiUen ; Athlone, possibly. Tell Lord Palmerston to give me his interest for Sligo, and desire his agent, Henry Stewart, to do as I order him.\" \" I have thought it advisable to encourage Mr. Croker to persevere at Downpatrick. He has promised allegiance, and all that he required was a sum of 2000Z. to carry on the contest, and I have, by the duke's advice, promised to supply it.\" First Appearance in the House of Lords. \u2014 The Duke of Wellington took his seat in the House of Lords for the first time on the 28th of June, 1814. \" Hansard \" records that a considerable concourse of persons had assembled below the bar to witness his grace's introduc tion, an unusual number of peers were present, and \"below the throne sat the Duchess of WeUington, and the Countess of Mornington, the venerable mother of the noble duke. His patents of creation as baron, carl, marquis, and duke, were severaUy read, and occupied a considerable time.\" The Lord ChanceUor (Eldon) addressed him, to convey the thanks of the House for the services he had rendered to his sovereign and his country, and remarked, '* In the execution of that duty he could not refrain from caUing his attention, and that of the noble lords present,"], [268, "248 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to a circumstance singular in the history of that House, that upon his introduction he had gone through every dignity of the peerage in this country which it was in the power of the Crown to bestow.\" The King not a Gentleman. \u2014 When Lord Liverpool was forming his administration in 1822, he insisted on the necessity of offering the Secretaryship of Foreign Affairs to Mr. Canning, and impressed his opinions on this subject so strongly upon the Duke of WeUington, that his grace, though he had some prejudices of his own to conquer, undertook to vanquish those of his Majesty against Mr. Canning's appointment. A lady who was an intimate friend of George IV., and at that moment of the duke also, and who was then staying at Brighton, told me (writes Lord DaUing) that the duke went down to Brighton and held an interview with the King, and she related to me parts of a conversation which, according to her, took place on this occasion. \" Good God, Arthur, you don't mean to propose to me that fellow as Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; it is impossible ! I said, on my honour as a gentleman, he should never be one of my ministers again. You hear, Arthur ; on my honour as a gentleman ! I am sure you wiU agree with me that I can't do what I said on my honour as a gentleman I would not do.\" \" Pardon me, sire ; I don't agree with you at aU. Your Majesty is not a gentleman.\" The King started. \" Your Majesty, I say,\" continued the imperturbable soldier, \" is not a gentleman, but the Sovereign of England, with duties to your people far above any to yourself ; and these duties render it imperative that you should at this time employ the abilities of Mr. Canning.\" \" WeU ! \" drawing a long breath, \" if I must, I must,\" was finally the King's reply. (Lord DaUing added, in a note, that the accuracy of the story having been disputed, he had it in some measure confirmed by Lady Palmerston ; but he thought that, like most tales of a simUar nature, it probably had some foundation, although not precisely correct either in details or date.) A Sovereign Mimicking his Ministers. \u2014 Mr. Raikes had the foUowing from the Duke of WeUington : \" When George IV. sent for me to form a now administration in 1828, he was then seriously iU, though he would never aUow it. I found him in bed, dressed in a dirty silk jacket and a turban nightcap, one as greasy as the other ; for, notwithstanding his coquetry about dress in public, he was extremely dirty and slovenly in private. The first words he said to me were, ' Arthur, the Cabinet is defunct,' and then he began to describe the manner in which the late Ministers had taken leave of him, on giving in their resignations. This was accompanied by the most ludicrous mimicry of the voice and manner of each individual, so strikingly like, that it was quite impossible to refrain from fits of laughter.\" The Premier also Commander-in-Chief. \u2014 It is a remarkable circumstance that the Duke's acceptance of the Premiership did not strike him at first as incompatible with his retention of the office of Commander-in-Chief. He thus alludes to the matter in a \" memorandum on Military Patronage,\" dated March 13, 1839 : \" In the winter of 1827-8, Lord Goderich having reported to George IV. that the Govern-"], [269, "THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. 249 ment was defunct, I being at that time Commander-in-Chief of the army, the King sent for me ; and, I conclude for my sins, I was told I was to form a Government for his Majesty. I acceded, and very shortly after the Government was formed, it was intimated to me by my colleagues that I ought to resign my office as Commander-in-Chief of the army. I resigned accordingly, and Lord HiU was recommended to the King to be my successor. I, at the same time, declared my determination never to interfere from that time in any mUitary affair or arrangement, and par ticularly not in one of a personal nature, unless I should be caUed upon for my advice or assistance by the general commanding the army in chief, by the sovereign, or his ministers.\" The Duel between the Duke of Wellington and the Barl of Winchilsea. \u2014 The Duke incurred great odium by the measure for Catholic Emancipation, which he had formerly opposed. The duel which arose out of it is thus referred to in the \" Memoir \" of the duke, published in the Times : \" One episode of the history is too remarkable to be omitted. The duke had been chosen patron of the new coUegiate insti- tution in the Strand, which, under the name of King's CoUege, was destined to combat the rival seminary in Gower Street. On the dis- closure of the ministerial policy, Lord Winchilsea, writing to a gentleman connected with the new establishment, spoke of the duke and his patron- ship in these terms : \u2014 ' Late political events have convinced me that the whole transaction was intended as a blind to the Protestant and High Church party, that the noble duke, who had for some rime previous to that period determined upon breaking in upon the coustitution of 1688, might the more effectually, under the cloak of some outward show of zeal for the Protestant religion, carry on his insidious designs for the infringement of our liberties and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State.' These expressions, coming from such a quarter, appeared to the duke to call for personal notice, and, after a vain essay of explanations, the Prime Minister of England, attended by Sir Henry Hardinge, and the Earl of WinchUsea, attended by Lord Falmouth, met in Battersea Fields on the 21st of March (1829), in full session, to discharge loaded pistols at each other on a question concerniug the Protestant religion. The life of the great captain, however, was not exposed to danger. Lord Winchilsea, after receiving the duke's shot, fired in the air, and then tendered the apology in default of which the encounter had occurred.\" \u2014 Mr. Gleig mentions that \" when the moment for action arrived, it was found that the duke did not possess a case of duelling pistols.\" With reference to this affair, the Duke of WeUington wrote as follows to the Duke of Buckingham (April 21, 1829) : \" The truth is that the duel with Lord Winchilsea was as much part of the Roman Catholic question, and it was as necessary to undertake it and carry it out to the extremity to which I did carry it, as it was to do everything else which I did do to attain the object which I had in view. I was living here for some time in an atmosphere of calumny. If I said a word, whether in Parliament or elsewhere, it was misrepresented for the purpose of fixing upon me some gross delusion or falsehood. Even"], [270, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 250 my conversations with the King were repeated, misrepresented, and commented upon ; and aU for the purpose of shaking the credit which the Parliament were inclined to give to what I said. I am afraid that the event itself shocked many good men ; but I am certain that the public interests at the moment required that I should do what I did.\" What was thought of the matter at the time is shown in the \" Greville Memoirs.\" \" At twelve o'clock the duke went to Windsor to teU the King what had happened. The King, it seems, was highly pleased with the affair, and he said, ' I did not see the letter ; if I had, I certainly should have thought it my duty to caU your attention to it.' . . I think (continues GreviUe) the duke ought not to have challenged Win chilsea. It was beneath his dignity ; it lowered him, and was more or less ridiculous. Lord Jersey met him coming from Windsor, and spoke to him. He said, ' I could not do otherwise, could I ? '\" An Undesigned Effect. \u2014 When (relates Earl RusseU) at the meeting of Parliament, Nov. 3rd, 1830, the Duke of Wellington declared that the constitution of the House of Commons was perfect, and that the wit of man could not a priori have devised anything so good, the general feeling was one of dismay. The House of Lords, usually so calm, showed signs of amazement and perturbation. The duke whispered to one of his colleagues, \" What can I have said which seems to make so great a dis turbance p \" \" You have announced the fall of your Government, that is all,\" replied his more clear-sighted colleague. The Government in One Man's Hand. \u2014 When the Melbourne Ministry was dismissed by the King in 1834, and the Duke of Wellington was sent for to form a Cabinet, Sir Robert Peel, on whom he chiefly relied for assistance, was absent in Italy. The arrangements consequently made are thus commented upon by Mr. Spencer Walpole, in his \" His tory of England from 1815 \" :\u2014 \" The King made Wellington First Lord of the Treasury ; he entrusted him with the seals of the Home Office, and gave him the seals of the two other Secretaries of State. These arrange ments virtuaUy placed the patronage and the power of the State in the hands of one man. They were severely reprobated at the time in the Whig press, and afterwards in Parliament, as ' an unconstitutional concentration of responsibility and power.' The politicians who used this language had, however, hardly thought out its meaning. There was nothing unconstitu tional in WeUington assuming four of the highest offices of State at the instance of his king. Three of those offices had, in fact, been evolved out of one within his own lifetime ; and one Secretary of State was and is technically competent to transact the business of aU the others. The one thing which was unconstitutional in 1834, or which, in more correct language, was opposed to the practice of the Constitution, was the dis missal of the Whig Ministry. AU that foUowed was only a coroUary to that proceeding, and Whig statesmen would have done weU to have con fined their censure to the act, and to have abstained from criticising the arrangements which were consequent upon it. The general public, judging the matter more accurately, were merely amused at the spectacle which the duke afforded them. They saw the man who had been the hero"], [271, "THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. 251 of their boyhood, who had again become the hero of their declining years, driving from office to office, signing letters, dictating minutes, and dis charging without assistance the work which it had previously taken four busy ministers to perform. Instead of blaming WeUington for straining the Constitution, most people praised him for his industry, and com mended the singleness of character which raised aU his actions above suspicion. Wellington had again become the hero of the nation; and the nation was gratified at the new proof which its hero was giving of his amazing capacity for work.\" The Premier and the Commons. \u2014 Guizot relates in his \" Memoirs of Peel \" that on the occasion just mentioned, when the Duke of Wellington was summoned to WiUiam IV. at Brighton, the old leader of the Tories gave a great example at once of modesty and power. \" It is not to me,\" he told the King, \" but to Sir Robert Peel that your Majesty must apply to form a Cabinet ; and to him it belongs to direct it. The difficulty aud the predominance are in the House of Commons ; the leader of that House must be at the head of the Government. I wiU serve tinder him in any post which your Majesty may please to entrust to me.\" A Great Country cannot have a Little War. \u2014 It was in a speech in Parliament in January, 1833, that the Duke of Wellington made this celebrated remark. He said : \" My lords, I entreat you, and I entreat the Government, not to forget that a great country like this can have no such thing as a little war. They must understand that if they entor on these operations they must do it on such a scale, and in such a manner, and with such determination as to the final object, as to make it quite certain that those operations will succeed, and that at the very earliest possible period.\" The Queen's Government must be Supported.\u2014 When the Com Laws Abolition Act came to the Houso of Lords, I said to Lynd hurst (writes CampbeU) that he was bound to defend it. \" No,\" answered ho, \" this is unnecessary, for the Duke of Wellington has secured a majority in its favour, although he thinks as badly of it as I should have done seven years ago. Thus he addressed a Protectionist peer, who came to lament to him that he must on this occasion vote against the Govern ment, having such a bad opinion of the biU\u2014 ' Bad opinion of the bill, my lord ! You can't have a worse opinion of it than I have ; but it was recommended from the throne, it has passed the Commons by a large majority, and wo must all vote for it. The Queen's Government must be supported ! ' \"\u2014The duke wrote to Mr. Croker in December, 1845 : \" Although there is no more sincere weU- wisher to the existing corn law sliding scale than myself, and although I have done and wiU do everything in my power to maintain it, my position is not the Corn Law, but it is to maintain a Government in the country. For that I have always contended, and always wiU contend.\" Advice to the House of Lords\u2014 In his speech on the second reading of the Com Law BiU in 1S46, the Duke of WeUington thus expressed himself as to the duty of the House of Lords to set aside their own opinion, under the circumstances : \" This measure, my lords, was"], [272, "252 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Tecommendcd by the speech from the throne, and it has been passed by a majority of the House of Commons, consisting of more than half the members of that house. But my noble friend (Lord Stanley) said that that vote is inconsistent with the original vote given by the same House of Commons on this same question, and inconsistent with the supposed views of the constituents by whom they were elected. But, my lords, I think that is not a subject which this house can take into its consideration \u2014 for, first, we can have no accurate knowledge of the fact ; and, secondly, whether it be the fact or not, this we know, that it is the House of Commons from which this biU comes to us. We know by the votes that it has been passed by a majority of the House of Commons; we know that it is recommended by the Crown ; and we know that if we should reject this biU, it is a biU which has been agreed to by the other two branches of the Legislature, and that the House of Lords stands alone in rejecting this measure. Now that, my lords, is a situation in which I have frequently stated to your lordships you ought not to stand. It is a position in which you cannot stand, because you are entirely powerless ; without the House of Commons and the Crown the House of Lords can do nothing. You have vast influence on public opinion, you may have great confidence in your own principles, but without the Crown or the House of Commons you can do nothing \u2014 till the connection with the Crown and the House of Commons is revived, there is an end of the functions of the House of Lords.\" Plain Language. \u2014 Sir Henry Taylor relates in his \"Autobio graphy \" that, a diplomatic dispute having occurred in connection with China, in 1840, the Duke of Wellington was led by certain papers to speak in the House of Lords on the subject. \" His speech was delivered without any of the hesitation and repetition which have been usual with him, aud was ardent, masterly, and impressive. . . Charles Greville saw the Duke soon after, and, expressing the pleasure he had felt in reading his speech, added that, however, many of the party were very angry with it ; to which the Duke replied, ' I know they are, and I don't care a damn. I have no time not to do what is right.' \" Mr. GrevUle relates the same in his \" Memoirs.\" Public Business and Gentlemen's \" Feelings.\" \u2014 When the Duke of WeUington had made his arrangements for a Ministry, in January, 1828, Mr. Croker had an interview with him, and thus wrote : \" He stated how he was beset and plagued with importunities and remonstrances, and compared himself to a dog with a canister tied to his tail. ' There,' he said, pointing to a formidable heap of green bags and red boxes, ' there is the business of the country, which I have not time to look at \u2014 aU my time being employed in assuaging what gentlemen caU their feelings. In short, the folly and unreasonableness of people are inconceivable.\" Wellington and Falmerston. \u2014 In a debate on the conduct of the war in the Crimea, in May, 1855, Lord Ellenborough related the foUow ing anecdote to the House of Lords, in depreciation of Lord Palmerston, who was then at the head of affairs: \"I recoUect sitting by the side of"], [273, "THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON. 253 the Duke of Wellington in the House of Lords, during the unfortunate difficulty between him and Mr. Huskisson, which led to the resignation of a portion of the gentlemen forming the Government. The Duke of Wellington was suddenly caUed out of the house, and when he returned he said to me, ' That was Palmerston who wanted to see me, to teU me if Huskisson went he must go too.' The duke continued, ' I said nothing ; it was not for me to fire great guns at smaU birds.' \" Characteristics of His Speeches. \u2014 In the House of Lords (wrote the Times) \" the duke was a regular attendant, and not unfrequently a speaker, but the journals of that august body supply few testimonies of our hero's excellence. His opinions and votes, excepting when his natural con servatism had not yet been sufficiently influenced by pressure from without, were rarely otherwise than soundly given, but his motives were often imperfectly expressed. It has been said that a collection of Crom weU's speeches would make the most nonsensical book in the world, and though such a remark is certainly not warranted by the orations of WeUington, yet on this point a certain resemblance is discoverable between the two great soldiers. The duke aUowed himself in addressing the House to bo carried away, not perhaps by his feelings, but by the impetus of a delivery which, without being either fluent or rapid, was singularly emphatic and vehement. He magnified his own opinions in order to impress them upon his hearers. If he recommended, as he did with great alacrity, a vote of thanks to an Indian general, the campaign was always ' the most briUiant he had ever known ; ' if he wished to stigmatise a disturbance of the peace, it was something transcending ' anything he had ever seen in all his experience,' though such a quality could hardly bo predicated of any disorders under the sun. The duke could appreciate events with unfailing nicety, but he faded in the capacity to describe them, and of late years his speeches, where they were not tautology, were often contradictions. Nor could the failing be trace able to age alone, for it was observed, though in a less degree, during tho earlier stages of his career, and is the more remarkable from the contrast presented by his despatches.\" A Military Style. \u2014 Macaulay (says Trevelyan) was fond of repeating an answer made to him by Lord Clarendon in the year 1829. Tho young men were talking over the situation, and Macaulay expressed curiosity as to the terms in which the Duke of Wellington would recom mend the Catholic Relief Bill to the Peers. \" Oh,\" said the other, \" it will be easy enough. He'll say, ' My lords ! Attention ! Right about face ! March ! ' \" This military style of the duke was burlesqued, in very similar words, some years later in the \" Bon Gaultier Ballads.\" A Blunt Denial. \u2014 In 1842 a petition from the farmers of Essex was presented to the House of Lords by Lord Western, who said the agricultural body had been deceived by Sir Robert Peel. This statement was at once denied by the Duke of Wellington, who said, in his charac teristic manner, \" The noble lord should have waited for the opportuuity of stating the when, and the where, and the how, and in what words my right honourable friend has deceived the pubUc. But, my lords, I deny"], [274, "254 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the fact ; and, as formaUy and emphatically as the noble lord has stated it, I say it is not true ; and that's the end of it.\" \" Down to the House \" in his Last Days. \u2014 The lobby of the House of Lords was sometimes, in the Duke's last years, the resort of persons who had travelled far to catch a sight of him. His well-known habit, even in the feebleness of eighty years, was to be driven daily from Apsley House in a cabriolet, and, after remaining in the Lords' chamber a short time, he would return as he came. One day, during the International Exhibition of 1851, a party of American gentlemen had gathered round the lobby, in eager expectation of the reappearance of the duke, who, they were informed, was within the house. Not many minutes had passed when he was seen advancing down the narrow passage to the outer porch. He tottered as he walked, almost swaying from side to side ; and as he reached the porch the Americans, some half dozen in number, took off their hats and pressed forward to within two or three yards. The duke's coming and going were not usuaUy noticed by anyone with formality, nor did he, as a rule, seem to remark things near him, his eyo apparently being intent on something far away \u2014 reminding an observer of how it might have looked, for instance, when detecting the weak point in Marmont's evolutions at Salamanca. But that distant sight, nevertheless, took in everything passing around, and on this occasion the duke paused for a moment, apparently interested by the unusual although silent demonstration before him, and he slowly raised a forefinger to his forehead in answering salute. In a few seconds he had entered his cab unassisted, and was driven away. The party present seemed to think a cheer might be an impertinence ; but immediately the duke had gone, the feeling of the spectators broke forth. \" There,\" said one of the Americans to an English gentleman who had been chatting with them, and informing them as to the men and things around, \" there \u2014 we have seen the Exhibition, but we wanted stiU more to see the Duke. It was worth coming aU the way.\"* The duke's systematic visits to the House of Lords terminated only by his death, in the foUowing year. SIR ROBERT PEEL. (1783\u20141850.) Patience Wanted. \u2014 Peel's first appearances in the House of Commons were not very promising. They were thus aUuded to at the time by the writer of a satire entitled \" The Last WiU and Testament of a Patriot:\" \u2014 \"I give and bequeath my patience to Mr. Robert Peel; he wiU want it all before he becomes Prime Minister of England ; but in the event of such a contingency, my patience is to revert to the people of England, who will stand sadly in want of it.\" Early Training for the Senate. \u2014 It is narrated in Peel's \"Memoirs \" that, soon after he was born, \" his father, the first baronet, finding himself rising daily in wealth and consequence, and beUeving * The compiler of this book was an eye-witness of the scene."], [275, "SIR ROBERT PEEL. 255 that money in those peculiar days could always command a seat in Parliament, determined to bring his son up expressly for the House of Commons. When that son was quite a chUd, Sir Robert would frequently set him on the table, and say, ' Now, Robin, make a speech, and I wiU give you this cherry.' What few words the Uttle feUow produced were applauded; and applause, stimulating exertion, produced such effects that, before Robin was ten years old, he could reaUy address the company with some degree of eloquence. As he grew up, his father constantly took him every Sunday into his private room, and made him repeat, as well as he could, the sermon which had been preached. Little progress in effecting this was made, and Uttle was expected at first; but by steady perseverance the habit of attention grew powerful, and the sermon was repeated almost verbatim. When at a very distant day the senator, remembering accurately the speech of an opponent, answered his argu ments in correct succession, it was little known that the power of so doing was originally acquired in Drayton church.\" A Paternal Caution. \u2014 An anecdote which I have from good authority (wrote M. Guizot) would give reason for believing that Sir Robert Peel had been long and naturally inclined to the tendency to which he yielded when, after having been a stubborn Conservative, he became an ardent reformer. It is said that in 1809, when he entered the House of Commons, his father, old Sir Robert Peel, went to Lord Liver pool and said to him, \" My son, you may be sure, is a young man of rare talent, and will one day play an important part ; but I know him weU ; at bottom his tendencies are Whig. If we do not immediately enlist him in our ranks, he wdl escape from us ; give him something to do, he will serve you weU, but you must make sure of him without delay.\" Father and Son. \u2014 On the appointment of a committee to inquire into the state of the Bank of England and the resumption of cash pay ments, in 1819, Peel was chosen chairman, and in that capacity he brought up the report, and proposed the resolutions it embodied. \" His speech,\" writes Francis in his \" Critical Biography of Peel,\" \" was heralded by one of those dramatic incidents which are so rare in our pubUc proceed ings ; rare, perhaps, because they reaUy exercise so slight an influence on the conduct of our public men. His father, Sir Robert Peel, in presenting a petition from merchants of the City of London against the proposed change in the currency laws, alluded to the relative positions of himself and his son with respect to the question. Speaking with much emotion, but with the unpretending frankness which marked his parliamentary conduct, he said : ' To-night I shall have to oppose a very near and dear relative. But while it is my own sentiment that I have a duty to perform, I respect those who do theirs, and who consider that duty to be paramount to aU other considerations. I have mentioned the name of Mr. Pitt. My own impression is certainly a strong one in favour of that great man. All of us have some bias, and I always thought him the first man in the country. I weU remember, when the near and dear relative I have aUuded to was a child, I observed to some friends that the man who discharged his duty to his country in the manner Mr. Pitt had done, was the man of"], [276, "256 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. all the world to bo admired, and the most to be imitated ; and I thought at that moment that if my life, and that of my dear relative, should be spared, I would one day present him to his country to foUow in the same path. It is very natural that such should be my wish, and I wiU only say further of him, that, though he is deviating from the proper path in this instance, his head and heart are in the right place, and I think they wiU soon recaU him to the right way.' The son did not pass unnoticed this allusion of his father. At tho close of an able and powerful speech, in which he explained his own reasons for a change of opinion, and the general views of the committee, he said : ' Many other difficulties pre sented themselves to me in discussing this question : among them is one which it pains me to observe \u2014 I mean the necessity I am under of opposing myself to an authority to which I have always bowed from my youth up, and to which I hope I shaU always continue to bow with deference. My excuse is now, that I have a great pubUc duty imposed upon me, and that, whatever may be my private feelings, from that duty I must not shrink.' \" Peel's Challenge to O'ConneU. \u2014 In August, 1815, in conse- quence of some expressions used by the great agitator at a pubUc meeting, a hostile correspondence took place between Peel (then Irish Secretary) and O'ConneU, which, however, ended without a hostUe meeting. O'ConneU was arrested, and bound to keep the peace within the kingdom ; they then agreed to go to the Continent, but O'ConneU was again placed under arrest on reaching London. MacGhee says much controversy occurred relative to this affair, and he conjectures that some friendly Argus kept the police on the qui vive, to prevent the shedding of valuable blood ; but tho fact is that no secret was made in the Irish newspapers of O'Connell's movements and intentions, and the notice of tho authorities was neces sarily drawn to the matter. It was with reference to this affair that Lord Norbury indulged in a jest at O'ConneU's expense a short time after wards. O'ConneU was addressing his lordship, who seemed to pay but indifferent attention to what he was saying. \" I am afraid, my lord,\" said O'ConneU, pausing in his argument, \"that your lordship does not apprehend me.\" \" I beg your pardon,\" replied the facetious judge, \" I do perfectly; and, indeed, no one is more easUy apprehended than Mr. O'ConneU, when he wishes to be.\" \" What is a Pound ? \" \u2014 In supporting his resolutions on the cur rency in 1819, Peel said : \" The main question is this, Can we go on safely without a standard of value ? AU the witnesses examined by the committee agreed that we could not, except one, a Mr. Smith ; who, on being asked if there should be no standard, said he would retain the 'pound.' Upon being further asked, What is a pound? he said it was difficult to explain, but that there was no gentleman in England who did uot know what a pound was. He added that a pound was a standard which had existed in this country eight hundred years \u2014 three hundred years before the introduction of gold coin ! I confess \" (continued Mr. Peel) \" that I can form no idea of a pound or a shilling, as detached from a definite quantity of the precious metals. I have the same difficulties to"], [277, "SIR ROBERT PEEL. 257 encounter as had Martinus Scriblerus in following the metaphysical specu lations of his tutor, the phUosophic Crambe. Being asked if he could form an idea of a universal man, he replied that he conceived him to be a knight of the shire, or tho burgess of a corporation, who represented a great number of individuals, but that he could form no other idea of a universal man. Farther to puzzle him, he was asked if he could not form the universal idea of a lord mayor. To which he replied, that never having seen but one lord mayor, the idea of that lord mayor always returned to his mind, and that he had therefore great difficulty to abstract a lord mayor from his gold chain and furred gown ; and that, moreover, unfortunately the only time he ever saw a lord mayor he was on horseback, and that the horse on which he rode, consequently, not a little disturbed his imagina tion. Upon this, says the history, Crambe, like the gentleman who can form an abstract idea of a pound, swore that he could frame a conception of a lord mayor, not only without his horse, gown, and gold chain, but even without stature, feature, colour, hands, feet, or any body whatever ; and this, he contended, was the true universal idea of a lord mayor.\" Catholic Emancipation. \u2014 On the 5th of March, 1829, Peel pro posed, in the House of Commons, the aboUtion of the political and civil disabilities which weighed upon the Catholics. Two cruel charges (relates Guizot) were brought against him \u2014 tergiversation and fear. He repeUed them with candid and high-minded good sense. \" I cannot,\" he said, ' ' purchase the support of my honourable friends by promising to adhero at all times aud at all hazards, as minister of the Crown, to arguments and opinions which I may have heretofore propounded in this House. I reserve to myself, distinctly aud unequivocaUy, the right of adapting my conduct to the exigencies of the moment and to the wants of the country. This has been the conduct of all former statesmen, at aU times and in aU coun tries.\" And, with regard to the charge of yielding to intimidation : \" In my opinion,\" he said, \" no motive can be more justly branded as igno minious than that which is usuaUy termed cowardice. But there is a temper of mind much more dangerous than this, though it may not be so base ; I mean the fear of being thought to be afraid. Base as a coward is, (he man who abandons himself to the fear of being' thought a coward dis plays little more fortitude.\" And when the debate drew near to its close, with his heart torn by the recollections of Canning, which had been so often invoked against him, he said, \" Tho credit belongs to others, and not to me. It belongs to Mr. Fox, to Mr. Grattan, to Mr. Plunket, to the gentlemen opposite, and to an illustrious friend of mine, who is now no more. . . I was on terms of the most friendly intimacy with my honourable friend down even to the day of his death ; and I say, with as much sincerity of heart as man can speak, that I wish he were now aUve to reap the harvest which he sowed, and to enjoy the triumph which his exertions gained. I would say of him as he said of the late Mr. Perceval: \u2022 Would he were here to enjoy the fruit of his victory ! ' \u2014 ' Tuque tuis armis, nos te poteremur, Achille.' The Preservation of Peace. \u2014 Sir Robert Peel anticipated, and at s"], [278, "258 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the same time contraverted, the saying, \" Peace at any price,\" when ho observed, in reference to the foreign policy of the Grey Ministry in 1830 : \"No man feels more than I do the immorality of war, and the necessity of avoiding the rekindling of its flames. But peace is not always to bo preserved at the wish of the Government, and I doubt the policy of too strong and determined a declaration that, at any hazard, the Ministry of the country wiU preserve peace.\" Finality in Reform. \u2014 Sir Robert Peel, addressing the electors of Tamworth in 1834, stated that he \" considered the Reform BiU a final and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question \u2014 a settlement which no friend to the peace and welfare of this country would attempt to disturb, either by direct or by insidious means.\" \" Register, Register, Register !\" \u2014 Addressing the electors at a Tamworth election dinner in August, 1837, Sir Robert Peel said : \"It may be disagreeable, and, indeed, inconvenient to attend to the registration of voters which annually takes place throughout the country. AU this may be revolting ; but you may depend upon it that it is better you should take that trouble than that you should allow the constitntion to become the victim of false friends, or that yon should be trampled under the hoof of a ruthless democracy. The advice which has been given by some persons was, ' Agitate, agitato, agitate ' ' The advice which I give you is this \u2014 Register, register, register ! \" An Honourable Distinction. \u2014 In a speech at Merchant Taylors' Hall in May, 1835, Sir Robert Peel said : \" Gentlemen, will you allow me to recaU to your recollection what was the grand charge against myself \u2014 that the King had sent for the son of a cotton spinner to Rome, in order to make him Prime Minister of England. Did I feel that by any means a reflection on me ? Did that make me at all discontented with the state of the laws and institutions of the country ? No ; but does it not make mo, and ought it not to make you, gentlemen, do all you can to reserve to other sons of other cotton-spinners the same opportunities, by the same system of laws under which this country has so long flourished, of arriving by tho same honourable means at a like distinction ? \" \u2014 Referring to the nume rous applications ho received for baronetages, peerages, &c, Sir Robert thus wrote to Mr. Croker in 1841 : \" The voracity for these things quite surprises me. I wonder people do not begin to feel the distinction of an unadorned name.\" Peel's Denunciation of Cobbett. \u2014 In 1833, Cobbett moved a resolution, the effect of which was to pray the King to dismiss Sir Robert Peel from his Privy Council, as the author of the Bill of 1819, which had been the cause of the distress of the country. A long, and, though occasionally violent, a feeble speech from Cobbett ushered in the motion, which was seconded by Mr. John Feilden. Sir Robert answered him (says Francis) in a magnificent speech, of which the most remarkable passage, though it has often been quoted, will bear repetition. After an elaborate refutation of all Cobbett's arguments, and a scornful repudiation of the impUed accusation that ho had himself gained by the change of currency, Sir Robert burst forth in these words : \" It is on public grounds"], [279, "SIR ROBERT PEEL. 259 that the honourable member assails me. The honourable member has not the same motives for attacking me which he has had for attacking others. I have never lent the honourable member my confidence ; from mo the honourable member has never received any obligation. His object in assailing me is, doubtless, to strike terror by the threat of his denunciations \u2014 to discourage opposition, from the fear of being signalised as a victim. But I teU the gentlemen of England that their best security is in boldly facing and defying such insidious efforts. God forbid that the honourable member's speculations on the prospect of public confusion should be realised. I labour under no anxiety that they wiU. I feel confident that whatever may be the political differences that divide public men, aU who .ire interested in the upholding of law and property wUl unite in their defence to put down such attempts. Not only would it be the bitterest calamity, but a calamity embittered by the greatest disgrace, to live under such an ignoble tyranny as ho would impose. ' Come the eleventh plague rather than this should be ; Come sink us rather in the sea ; Come, rather, pestilence, and reap us down ; Come God's sword, rather than our own. Let rather Roman come again, Or Saxon, Norman, or the Dane. In all the bonds we ever bore, We grieved, we sighed, we wept ; \u2014 we never blushed before.' Blush, indeed, we shall, if we submit to this base and vulgar domination. and I for one \u2014 believing as I do that I have been selected as an object of attack, for the purpose of discouraging resistance to the insidious efforts which the honourable gentleman is daily making to weaken the founda tions of property and the authority of the law \u2014 I will, at least, preserve myself from the reproach of having furthered the objects ho has in view by any symptom of intimidation or submission.\" The passage from old Abraham Cowley, delivered with the fine sonorous voice and lofty manner into which Sir Robert Peel fell in moments of real excitement, produced an electrical effect. WeU (continues Francis) we remember the scene. Cobbett, his grey hairs pleading for his sincerity, had been heard as a duty, but with regret. His antagonist had borne himself along on the rising sympathy of the House. Rarely, indeed, does the British senate even seem to do injustice ; but now, the disgust of the listeners, and their excitement under Sir Robert's stirring address, overpowered aU fomis. Cobbett rose, was met with a shout almost of execration, retired to his scat, rose again, again was met with an indignant repulse, once more and yet once more essayed to speak against the storm of passion, till at last ho staggered to his place beside his seconder, for the first time, perhaps, in his life utterly queUed by bis fellow-men. The accused statesman, gathering himself up with dignity, declared he would not vote on a question so personal to himself, and left the house majesticaUy, amidst a hurricane of cheers. Four members only \u2014 John O'ConneU, Thomas Attwood, James Roe, and Patrick Leader \u2014 were found supporting Cobbett s 2"], [280, "260 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. and Feilden, while the voters for Peel numbered 298. Then came an incident scarcely less dramatic. Lord Althorp, the Whig chief of tho House, moved that the resolution should be expunged from the Journals. On a division there were stiU only four against the motion, Feargus O'Conuor supplying the place of John O'ConneU ; and, the votes on the other side amounting to 295, the resolution of Lord Althorp was carried out. The \" Shock of Collision \" between the Houses. \u2014 In a speech at Merchant Taylors' Hall in 1838, Sir Robert Peel said, \" My object for some years past has been to lay the foundations of a great party, which, existing in the House of Comi .ons, and deriving its strength from tho popular will, should diminish the risk and deaden the shock of collisions between the two deliberative branches of the Legislature.\" The Bedchamber Question. \u2014 On being invited to form a Ministry on the resignation of Lord Melbourne in 1839, Peel requested that the principal offices in the Royal household, and among them those of the Queeu's ladies of the bedchamber, might be placed at his disposal. It was not (says M. Guizot) with Sir Robert Peel, but with the Duke of WeUington, that the idea of making this request would appear to have originated. The young Queen was shocked at it ; it was, the Whigs told her, an exorbitant pretension, utterly unauthorised by precedent. It was added that the great ladies of the Conservative party had spoken of it as of a triumph over the Queen, and had said that when they composed her Court they woidd be better able to restrain her within constitutional limits than the Whigs had been. On the day after Sir Robert Peel had made Iris demand, he received from the Queen the following note : \" The Queen, having considered the proposal made to her yesterday by Sir Robert Peel, to remove the ladies of her bedchamber, cannot consent to adopt a course which she conceives to be contrary to usage, and which is repugnant to her feelings.\" Sir Robert replied in a long and respectful letter, sensible and constitutionaUy true, but rather heavy, and as devoid of elegance as of complaisance. He was evidently better suited to a Par liament than to a Court. The negotiation was broken off, and furnished a subject for debate in both Houses. The Conservatives, Wellington and Peel, maintained their ground ; the Whigs vindicated the Queen's refusal, and declared themselves ready to accept the responsibility of it. They at once returned to office, and Sir Robert Peel on his side resumed, for two years more, his position as the ruling spirit of the Opposition. An Unconciliatory Manner.\u2014 Sir Robert Peel's manner was frequently unfortunate. The Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, in 1829, alluding to their joint iniuistry, \" How are we to get on with the thing? I have no small talk, and Peel has no manners.\"\u2014 \" When I first went into Parliament,\" said one of Peel's followers to Mr. Maddyn, \" I was not personally acquainted with Sir Robert Peel. I greatly admired his talents, and I approved of his principles, and many of his connexion were anxious to see me in the House. I publicly avowed myself at the hustings as one of his supporters, and I sacrificed money, time, aud trouble to gain a seat for bis cause. After being about a fortnight in the House, it was proposed to me by that I should be personally int ro-"], [281, "SIR ROBERT PEEL. 261 duced to Sir Robert, and it was arranged to wait for a leisure moment to do so. It was while we were sitting in the temporary edifice, just before going into Sir Charles Barry's new house. We were both in the lobby, and Sir Robert walked slowly across, and went into the long passage that used to lead into the House of Lords. Nobody was with him. ' Now is the time,' said Lord , and he ran after Sir Robert Peel, calling him by name. I followed at a short distance, and heard my name mentioned. I advanced to meet him, and raised my hat. A freezing bow was aU that I received \u2014 not a smile, not a single word of encouragement, not the slightest civility.\" \u2014 Another illustration of the unfortunate effect of Peel's manner will be found in a speech delivered by Mr. Cobden at a public meeting, Dec. 17, 1845. He said : \" I have no reason, and I think you will all admit it, to feel any very great respect for Sir Robert Peel. Hi' is the only man in the House of Commons that I can never speak a word to in private without forfeiting my own respect, and the respect of all those men who sit around me.\" Aud yet the Minister was then on the eve of adopting Mr. Cobden's policy, and paying a handsome tribute to his eloquence and his exertions. (See, under Cobden, \" Unadorned Eloquence.\") Peel as a Humourist. \u2014 Peel shone (writes Mr. Hayward) where such a man would be least expected to shine, in humour. He also excelled in quiet sarcasm. In tho debate on commercial distress (Dec. 3, 1847). Alderman Reynolds, one of the members for Dublin, had asked, \" Did not everybody know that the profit and advantage of banking consisted very much in trading on your credit in contradistinction to your capital ? \" In the course of the masterly reply with which Peel closed the debate he said : \" I have the greatest respect for bankers in general, and Irish bankers iu particular, and among Irish bankers I well know the position enjoyed by the honourable gentleman. Now, with all the respect to which he is entitled, and with all suavity and courtesy, I will toll him that, in his banking capacity, I would rathor have his capital than his credit. \"\u2014In 1848 Feargus O'Connor was charged in tho House with being a Republican. He denied it, and said he did not care whether the Queen or the Devil was on the throne. Peel replied : \" When the honourable gentleman sees the sovereign of his choice on the throne of these realms, I hope he 'U enjoy, and I 'm sure he 'U deserve, the confidence of the Crown.\" \u2014 Shed had learnt and forgotten the exordium of a speech which began with the word \"necessity.\" This word he had repeated three times, wheu Sir R. Peel broke in \u2014 \"is not always the mother of invention.\" Effect of Mr. Disraeli's Attacks.\u2014 \" It has always (wrote Mr. Hayward) seemed unaccountable to us that Peel, who had joined battle without losiug heart or ground with such antagonists as Brougham, Canning, Stanley, and Lord RusseU, should have quailed before Mr. Disraeli ; or, if quailed be too strong a term, should have allowed himself to be so ruffled and annoyed : Contempsi Catilin\u0153 gladios : non perti mescam twos. He was so irritated on the night of the third reading of tho Com Law Bill that he came after the debate to Lord Lincoln (the late Duke of Newcastle) at Whitehall Place, and insisted on his carrying"], [282, "262 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. a hostUe message to Mr. DisraeU* On Lord Lincoln's positive refusal, Sir Robert was going off in search of another second, and was with difficulty driven from his purpose by the threat of an application to a magistrate. The most plausible explanation is that he was maddened by the clamorous cheers of his quondam friends and followers : ' Non me tua f ervida terrent Dicta, ferox ; Du me terrent ' \u2014 the DU being understood in the theatrical sense \u2014 the gods that thunder their applause or censure from the gaUery. It must be remembered also that there was twice over some foundation for the charge so pointedly leveUed at him, of having acted like the Turkish admiral who steered the fleet under his command straight into the harbour of the enemy ; and that Mr. Disraeli was in his happiest vein. This was the night (May 15, 1846) when he declared Peel's life to be ' one great appropriation clause ; ' termed the Treasury bench ' poUtical pedlars that bought their party in the cheapest market and sold us in the dearest ; ' and compared the conversion of the Peelites to that of the Saxons by Charlemagne, ' who, according to the chronicle, were converted in battalions and baptised in platoons.' \"\u2014In the House, Sir Robert gave the foUowing reply to Mr. Disraeli's attack : \" I feel that I should be offering an insult to the House \u2014 I should be offering an insult to the country \u2014 if I were to condescend to bandy personalities upon such an occasion. Sir, I foresaw that the course which I have taken from a sense of public duty would expose me to serious sacrifices. I foresaw, as its inevitable result, that I must forfeit friendships which I most highly valued, that I must interrupt political relations in which I felt sincere pride; but the smaUest of all the penalties which I anticipated were the continued venomous attacks of the member for Shrewsbury. Sir, I wiU only say of the honourable gentleman that if he, after reviewing the whole of my public Use \u2014 a life extending over thirty years previously to my accession to office in 1841 \u2014 if he then enter tained the opinion of me which he now professes; if he thought I was gudty of those petty larcenies from Mr. Horner and others, it is a little surprising that in the spring of 1841, after his long experience of my public career, he should have been prepared to give me his confidence. It is stiU more surprising that he should have been ready, as I think he was, to unite his fortunes with mine in office, thus implying the strongest proof which any public man can give of confidence in the honour and integrity of a Minister of the Crown.\" Egotism. \u2014 In a letter written by Bishop Wilberforce, Jan. 28, 1846, he remarked: \"Last night I went under the gallery of the House of Commons to hear the debate. I never saw anything received so sulkUy as Peel's statement. There was a kind of thundery sullenness, such as even that house, I suppose, had seldom seen. It is altogether a most per- * It has been asserted by Professor Goldwin Smith and others that Mr. Hayward was in error here, and that it was Lord George Bentinck whom Sir Eobert wished to challenge."], [283, "SIR ROBERT PEEL. 263 plexing question. There is so much of vanity about Peel's whole argument, so much of 'I made this alteration, and this good effect foUowed, therefore I wiU go on and make another,' as to be quite alarming.\" The Fall of Sir Robert Peel.\u2014 On the evening of the 25th of June, 1846, the announcement was made to the House of Commons that the Lords had agreed to Sir Robert Peel's Corn and Customs BiUs (effecting the Repeal of the Corn Laws) without amendment. This was the signal for the closing of a lengthened debate on the Irish Coercion Bill, then before the House. The circumstances attending the division which hurled Sir Robert Peel from power are thus described by Mr. Disraeli, in his \" Life of Lord George Bentinck\" :\u2014 \" At length, about half -past one o'clock, the galleries were cleared, tho division caUed, and the question put. In almost all previous divisions where the fate of a Government had been depending, the vote of every member, with scarcely an exception, had been anticipated ; that was not the case in the present instance, and the direction which members took as they left their seats was anxiously watched. More than one hundred Protectionist members followed the Minister ; more than eighty avoided the division, a few of these, however, had paired; nearly the same number followed Lord George Bentinck. But it was not merely their numbers that attracted the anxious observation of the Treasury bench, as the Pro tectionists passed in defile before the Minister to the hostile lobby. It was impossible that he could have marked them without emotion ; the flower of that great party which had been so proud to follow one who had been so proud to lead them. They were men to gain whose hearts and the hearts of their fathers had been the aim aud exidtation of his Use. They had extended to him an unlimited confidence and an admiration without stint. They had stood by him in the darkest bom-, and had borne him from the depths of political despair to tho proudest of living positions. Right or wrong, they were men of honour, breeding, and refinement, high and generous character, great weight and station in the country, which they had ever placed at his disposal. They had been not only his foUowers but his friends; had joined in the same pastimes, drank from the same cup, and in the pleasantness of private life had often forgotten together the cares and strife of politics. \" He must have felt something of this, while the Manners, the Somer sets, the Bentincks, the Lowthers, and the Lennoxes passed before him. And those country gentlemen, ' those gentlemen of England,' of whom, but five years ago, the very same building was ringing with his pride of being their leader \u2014 if his heart were hardened to Sir Charles BurreU, Sir William JoUiffe, Sir Charles Knightly, Sir John Trollope, Sir Edward Kerrison, Sir John TyrreU, he surely must have had a pang when his eye rested on Sir John Yarde BuUer, his choice and pattern country gentle man, whom he had himself selected and invited, but six years back, to move a vote of want of confidence in the Whig Government, in order, against the feeling of the Court, to install Sir Robert Peel in their stead. They trooped on : all the men of mettle and large-acred squires, whose"], [284, "264 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. spirit he had so often quickened, and whose counsel he had so often solicited in his fine Conservative speeches in Whitehall Gardens. . . \" When Prince Mettemich was informed, at Dresden, with great osten tation, that the Emperor had arrived \u2014 ' Yes ; but without his army,' was the reply. Sir Robert Peel was still First Minister of England, as Napoleon remained Emperor for a whUe after Moscow. Each, perhaps, for a moment had indulged in hope, it is so difficult for tfiose who are on the pinnacle of life to realise disaster. They sometimes contemplate it in their deep and far-seeing calculations, but it is only to imagine a contin gency which their resources must surely baffle ; they sometimes talk of it to their friends, and oftener of it to their enemies, but it is only as an insurance of their prosperity and as an offering to propitiate their Nemesis. They never believe in it. \" The news that the Government were not only beaten, but by a majority so large as 73, began to circulate. An incredulous murmur passed it along the Treasury bench. ' They say we are beaten by 73 ! ' whispered the most important member of the Cabinet, in a tone of surprise, to Sir Robert Peel. Sir Robert did not reply, or even turn his head. He looked very grave, and extended his chin, as was his habit when he was annoyed and cared not to speak. He began to comprehend his position, and that the Emperor was without his army.\" The Minister's Valediction. \u2014 The speech in which Sir Robert announced the resignation of his Ministry, June 29, 1846, was concluded by the foUowing passage : \" Within a few hours, probably, that power which I have held for the period of five years will be surrendered into the hands of another \u2014 without repining, without complaint on my part \u2014 with a more lively recollection of the support and confidence I have received during several years, than of the opposition which during a recent period I have encountered. In relinquishing power, I shaU leave a name, severely censured I fear by many who, on public grounds, deeply regret the severance of party ties \u2014 deeply regret that severance, not from interested or personal motives, but from the firm conviction that fideUty to party engagements \u2014 the existence and maintenance of a great party \u2014 consti tutes a powerful instrument of government. I shall surrender power severely censured also by others who, from no interested motive, adhere to the principle of protection, considering the maintenance of it to bo essential to the welfare and interests of the country. I shall leave a name execrated by every monopolist who, from less honourable motives, clamours for protection because it conduces to his own individual benefit. But it may be that I shall leave a name sometimes remembered with expressions of good will in the abodes of those whose lot it is to labour, and to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow, when they shall recruit their exhausted strength with abundant and uutaxed food, the sweeter because it is no longer leavened by a sense of injustice.\" A Political Moral. \u2014 Mr. Cobden, in his pamphlet \" The Three Panics,\" published in 1862, narrated the following : \" On the evening of the 24th of February, 1848, whilst the House of Commons was in session, a murmur of conversation suddenly arose at the door and spread through-"], [285, "SIR ROBERT PEEL. 265 out the house, when was witnessed \u2014 what never occurred before or since, in the writer's experience \u2014 a suspension for a few minutes of aU attention to the business of the House, whilst every member was engaged in close and earnest conversation with his neighbour. The intelligence had arrived of the abdication and flight of Louis Philippe, and of the pro clamation of the Republic. . . The writer of these pages was sitting by the side of the late Mr. Hume when the tidings reached their bench. Sir Robert Peel was on the opposite front seat, alone, his powerful party having been broken and scattered by his great measure of Corn Law Repeal. 'I'll go and teU Sir Robert the news,' exclaimed Mr. Hume, and stepping across the floor, he seated himself by his side and communi cated the startling intelligence. On returning to his place, he repeated, in the foUowing words, the commentary of the ex-minister : ' This comes of trying to cany on a government by means of a mere majority of a chamber, without regard to the opinion out of doors. It is what these people (pointing with his thumb over his shoulder to the Protectionists behind him) wished me to do, but I refused.' \" Dread of Office. \u2014 Mr. Charles Greville wrote iu his Journal, under date Feb. 15, 1847: \" Arbuthnot [the Duke of Wellington's secretary and confidant] said he was quite sure Peel would never come into office again. He gave me a more detailed account of his parting request to the Queen, when he said, after begging her never to ask him to take office again, that he could not help remembering that Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Canning had aU died in office, and victims of office ; that ho did not dread death, and this recollection would not deter him ; but when bo recollected also that Lord Castlereagh and Lord Liverpool had also died in office, the one a maniac and the other an idiot, that recollection did appal him, and he trembled at the idea of encountering such a fate as theirs.\" \" The Greatest Member of Parliament.\" \u2014 Mr. Disraeli, who had done so much to overthrow the Minister, nevertheless thus wrote of him in his \" Life of Bentinck,\" published soon after Sir Robert's death : \" One cannot say of Sir Robert Peel, notwithstanding his unrivalled powers of despatching affairs, that he was the greatest Minister that this country ever produced, because, twice placed at the helm, and on the second occasion with the Court and the Parliament equally devoted to him, ho never could maintain himself in power. Nor, notwithstanding his con summate parliamentary tactics, can he be described as the greatest party leader that ever flourished among us, for he contrived to destroy the most compact, powerful, and devoted party that ever followed a British statesman. Certainly, notwithstanding his great sway iu debate, wo cannot recognise him as our greatest orator, for in many of the supremo requisites of oratory he was singularly deficient. But what he reaUy was, and what posterity wiU acknowledge him to have been, is tbe greatest member of Parliament that ever lived. Peace to his ashes! His name wiU be often appealed to in that scene which he loved so well, and never without homage even by his opponents.\""], [286, "266 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. SIR JAMES GRAHAM. (1792\u20141861.) The Child Father of the Man.\u2014 As a boy (says Professor Pryme) Graham exhibited the future bent of his life. When other boys were choosing what they would be, he would say, \" I will be a statesman.\" A stone is stiU shown in his native village on which the youthful politician stood and harangued his playmates. A Contemptuous House. \u2014 Mr. Graham was first returned for HuU in 1818, at the age of twenty-six. His election cost his family 6000?. His first appearances in the House were failures. Among his early displays was a speech with regard to a biU which had been intro duced to prevent any person not an inhabitant or freeman of a town from taking part in its political meetings. Mr. Torrens says : \" Mr. Graham wished to know if a member who sat for a borough of which he was neither an inhabitant nor freeman would come within the mischief of the Act ? He paused to listen for the report of his shot ; but few were attending, and nobody cried ' Hear.' He looked to see if it had hit, but the under-secretaries were talking to one another on the Treasury bench, and Lord Castlereagh was occupied in smelling the hot-house flower in his button-hole. Mr. Graham repeated his question in other words, but with no better effect. He felt half vexed with himself at having got up, but he was up, and must go on ; so he thought he would argue the point. The case was not an imaginary one, he said, for it was his own, as lie happened to sit for a borough of which he was neither a freeman nor an inhabitant, and of which he was not likely to become either, having no connection with the place. At this unlucky proffer of irrelevant informa tion he beard, or thought he heard, something like a suppressed laugh. He felt himself getting confused, a Uttle at first, and then very much so. For a few minutes he rambled on through commonplace and reiteration, but no timely cheer came to his rescue, and he sat down without any distinct recoUection of what he had said or what he had intended to say. Mr. Henry Lascelles, who sat opposite, whispered to a mutual friend, ' WeU, there is an end of Graham ; we shaU hear no more of liim.' \" His later Appearances. \u2014 Very tall in person (says Mr. Maddyn), \" with a handsome and inteUectual countenance, Sir James Graham possessed great advantages for addressing an aristocratic assembly. His manner, at first, was apparently so mdd that in commencing one of his elaborate attacks, the hearer could scarcely conceive how much hoarded ammunition was about to be exploded, with the certainty of doing dreadful damage to his adversaries. When just about to make a spring upon his political foe, there was an air of drawing-room lassitude about the wily descendant of the Gr\u00e6ines that reminded one of his ancestors; sudden in attack, and about as mereUess as sudden. Standing at the table in the calm attitude of a Mayfair fine gentleman, who could have expected so much fierceness of nature to dweU within that breast ? \" \" Hats Off ! \"\u2014On the 20th of June, 1837, tho King died at Windsor;"], [287, "SIR JAMES GRAHAM. 267 aud on the same day both Houses met for the purpose of taking the oath of aUegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria. On the foUowing day Lord John RusseU appeared at the bar of the Commons charged with a message from the Queen. A cry instantly arose (says Torrens) of \" Hats off ! \" and the Speaker, forgetful for the moment of the precise usage on such occasions, announced from the chair that \" members must be uncovered.\" Everyone present forthwith complied, with the exception of Sir James Graham, who excited some observation by continuing to wear his hat until the first words of the message were pronounced. As nothing at the time escaped the vigilance of party criticism, a paragraph appeared the same evening in the True Sun, reflecting on the supposed indecorum. At the meeting of the House next day the right honourable baronet caUed attention to the fact, for the purpose of explaining that ho had only complied with the older, and, as he thought, better custom, of waiting until the initiatory word \" Regina,\" or \" Rex,\" was uttered before uncovering ; a mode of testifying respect for the Crown which was more emphatic, and which had, he thought, a better effect. The Speaker said that the honourable member for East Cumberland was correct in his observance of the practice of the House ; and he accounted for his own apparent deviation therefrom by his desire to preserve order and to save time. Opening of Letters by the Home Office. \u2014 In June, 1844, Mr.. T. S. Duncombe presented petitions to the House of Commons from several gentlemen, one of whom was M. Mazzini, complaining that their letters had been delayed and opened by the Post Office authorities, and praying for a committee of inquiry on the subject. Sir James Graham. who was then Home Secretary, said that power was given to the Secretary of State by statute to open letters passing through the Post Office, and he had given his warrant in the case of one of the petitioners accordingly. Sir Robert Peel defended the action of his coUeagne. by saying that Fox and Grenville had exercised tho same power. There was a strong feeling in the House, however, against it, and a motion which virtually amounted to want of confidence in the Ministry was defeated only by 206 against 162. EventuaUy the Government agreed to the appointment of secret committees of both Houses to inquire into and report upon the subject. It appeared from the reports presented that the power in question was exercised under the statute 9th Anne, cap. 10, which directs that no letters sent by post should be opened or delayed without an express warrant under the hand of one of the principal Secretaries of State; aud 1st Victoria. cap. 36, which contains a similar direction. The Lords' committee reported that 182 warrants had been issued since 1822, aud added that \" the issue of six or seven' warrants annuaUy upon a circulation of 220 milUons of letters cannot be regarded as materially interfering with the sanctity of private correspondence.\" The Commons' committee found that \" the last two warrants rested on grounds connected with the personal safety of a foreign sovereign (the Emperor of Russia! intrusted to the protection of England,\" aud added, \" It appears to your committee that under circumstances so peculiar, even a slight suspicion of danger would"], [288, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 268 justify a minister in taking extraordinary measures of precaution.\" Infor mation obtained from some of the opened letters, respecting an intended insurrection in Italy, was found by both committees to have been commu nicated to a foreign power, but \"it was not (added the Commons) of a nature to compromise the safety of any individual within reach of that power, nor was it made known to that power by what means that informa tion had been obtained.\" The matter excited great commotion in the country, and for some time afterwards envelopes and seals, with such mottoes as \" Not for Sir James Graham,\" were commonly exhibited for sale. Disposing of \" Hansard.\" \u2014 In 1846 Sir James Graham had made up his miud to defend a Corn Law no more. Sentence after sentence and phrase upon phrase, which had faUen from him in the heat of rhetorical indiscretion in the days when he sat on the left of the Speaker's chair, were now dug up out of \" Hansard,\" and flung at him by exasperated Protectionists, amid the angry cheers of those around him, and the loud laughter of those opposite. But he had anticipated this, and had made up his mind how to deal with it. When chaUenged by Mr. Stafford to say whether or not he had changed his opinion, he replied, \" I freely admit that past declarations of opinions made by members of the House who have subsequently arrived at power, or who aspire to power, much more the declarations made by the First Minister of the Crown, if at all at variance with the course which he has subsequently pursued, are subjects worthy of reference, and which call for explanation. The honourable member for Northamptonshire made a direct appeal to the Government, and challenged us, if wo had changed our opinions, manfully to own it. I auswer that challenge. I do frankly avow my change of opinion, and by that avowal I dispjose of whole volumes of ' Hansard,' and of all the charges which have Ijeen made on the ground of inconsistency.\" \u2014 Torrens. Altered Circumstances. \u2014 When addressing the House one even ing on the oft-debated subject of the connection between the rate of wages and the price of food, Sir James reiterated his declaration that experience had convinced him that the former had a constant tendency to rise as the latter fell. Lord George Bentinck, who was sitting on the front Opposi tion bench below him, threw back his head, and looking round at him exclaimed, \" Ah ! yes ; but you know you said the other thing before.\" A shout of laughter, in which Sir James joined, was followed by cheers and counter-cheers, and curiosity was on tip-toe for the retort. From his perch, as he used to caU it, the ex-minister looked down at his noble antagonist, and said, in a tone of ineffable humour, \" The noble lord's taunts fall harmless upon me ; I am not in office now.\" \u2014 Ibid. Curliness and Sarcasm. \u2014 On the vote of want of confidence which defeated Lord Derby's Ministry in 1859, Mr. Disraeli referred to a speech \u2022Sir James Graham had made at Carlisle during the recent general election, while introducing a young relative* as a candidate for that * Mr. (afterwards Sir Wilfrid) Lawson."], [289, "DANIEL O'CONNELL. 269 borough. He affected to understand Sir James's remarks, when he read them, as coming from this young candidate, and said : \" When I read that charge upon the Ministry, which was made without the slightest founda tion, and with a bitterness which seemed to me to be perfectly gratuitous, I naturally said, ' Young men wiU be young men.' Youth wiU be, as we aU know, somewhat reckless in assertion, and when we are juvenile and curly, one takes a pride in sarcasm and invective. One feels some interest in a young relative of a distinguished member of this House ; and, although the statements were not very agreeable to her Majesty's Ministers, I felt that he was a chip of the old block. I felt \u2014 and I hope my coUeagues share in the sentiment \u2014 that when that young gentleman entered this House, he might, when gazing upon the venerable form and listening to the accents of benignant wisdom that feU, and always fall, from the right honourable gentleman the member for Carlisle (laughter) \u2014 he might learn how reckless assertion in time might mature into accuracy of statement \u2014 and how bitterness and invective, however organic, can be controlled by the vicissitudes of a wide experience \" (much laughter). Sir James replied to this a few nights afterwards : \" The right honourable gentleman remarked upon the mUd influences of age, presenting in his own person a contradiction to the Horatian maxim, ' Lenit albescens animos capillus,' because he was an iUustra tion of the fact that one might lose one's curls and still retain one's taste for sarcasm. . . The right honourable gentleman wiU pardon me if I express to him an opinion. I regard him as the Red Indian of debate. By the use of the tomahawk he has cut his way to power, and by a recurrence to the scalping system he hopes to prevent the loss of it \" (cheers and laughter). DANIEL O'CONNELL. (1775\u20141847.) Introduction of the Repeal Question.\u2014 The year 1834 was rendered remarkable by the introduction of the Repeal question into the House of Commons. O'ConneU told me (says Mr. Daunt) he was forced to take this step bitterly against his wiU. \" I felt,\" said he, \" like a man who was going to jump into a cold bath; but I was obUged to take the plunge.\" His motion was rejected by a majority of 484. A Wonderful Shower of Rain.\u2014 In the session of 1833 (writes his son) a speech of Mr. Daniel O'Connell's, upon an Irish question of considerable interest and importance, was not only grievously abbre viated (by the reporter), but the sense of it entirely perverted in several passages. As I recollect, it was a speech on tho then very exciting and difficult subject of the tithes of the Protestant Church in Ireland ; and Mr. O'ConneU, among other things, was made to say that he would vote in a certain way on the immediate point under consideration, \" although it was directly in the teeth of all his former opinions on the subject ! \" On his bringing the matter before the House, under the usual form of a \" Breach of Privilege,\" and making complaint of being thus treated, the defence set up by the reporter was that, during his walk from the House"], [290, "270 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to the newspaper office, the rain, which was faUing heavily at the time, had most unfortunately streamed into his pocket, and washed out the notes he had made of Mr. O'Connell's speech. Upon which the latter remarked that it was the most extraordinary shower of rain he had ever heard of, inasmuch as it had not only washed out the speech he did make, but had washed in. another, and an entirely different one. Reprimanded from the Chair. \u2014 In February, 1838, O'ConneU made a speech at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in which he asserted that the Tory election committees of the day were guUty of foul perjury. Attention was caUed to this language on the following night in the Houso of Commons by the young Lord Maidstone (afterwards Earl of Win chilsea), who moved a vote of censure upon the member for Carlow. This was carried by a majority of nine. Consequently, on the 28th of the month O'ConneU, being in his place, was ordered by the Speaker to stand np \u2014 and was gravely reprimanded. \" Beastly Bellowings.\" \u2014 Macaulay writes in his Journal, June 11, 1840 : \" Tho House was engaged upon Stanley's Irish Registration Bill. The night was very stormy. I have never seen such unseemly demeanour, or heard such scurrilous language in ParUament. Lord Norreys was whist ling, and making all sort of noises. Lord Maidstone was so ill-mannered that I hope he was drunk. At last, after much grossly indecent conduct, a furious outbreak took place. O'ConneU was so rudely interrupted that he used the expression ' beastly beUowings.' Then rose such an uproar as no O. P. mob at Covent Garden Theatre, no crowd of Chartists in front of a hustings, ever equalled. Men on both sides stood up, shook their fists, and bawled at the top of their voices. Freshfield, who was in the chair, was quite unable to keep the smaUest order. O'ConneU raged like a mad bull ; and our people \u2014 I for one \u2014 while regretting and condemning his violence, thought it was much extenuated by the provocation. . . A short and most amusing scene passed between O'ConneU and Lord Maidstone, which in the tunralt escaped the observation of many, but which I watched carefuUy. ' !\u00a3,' said Lord Maidstone, ' the word beastly is retracted, I shaU be satisfied. If not, I shaU not be satisfied.' ' I do not care whether the noble lord be satisfied or not.' 'I wish you would give me satisfaction.' ' I advise the noble lord to carry his liquor meekly.' At last the tumult ended from absolute physical weariness. It was past one, and the steady beUowers of the Opposition had been howling from six o'clock with little interruption.\" His Duel with D'Esterre. \u2014 O'ConneU was not sufficiently guarded in his language when speaking of other men, and on one occasion some one opposite to him said, \" Such language might provoke a duel.\" \" Oh, no,\" remarked O'ConneU, pointing to one of his hands with the other; \" there's too much blood upon this hand already.\" I heard him say this, and the effect, as he suited the action to the word, was very great. \u2014 Professor Pryme. O'ConneU here referred to the incident of his duel with D'Esterre, which is thus related by Phillips : \u2014 \" In one of his many mob-speeches, O'ConneU called the Corporation of Dublin a ' beggarly corporation.' A gentleman named D'Esterre affected to feel this as a"], [291, "DANIEL O'CONNELL. 271 personal affront, he being one of that very numerons body, and accordingly fastened a quarrel on the offender. . . Being one of those who accom panied O'ConneU, he beckoned me aside to a distant portion of the very large field, which had a slight covering of snow. ' Phillips,' said ho to me, ' this seems not a personal, but a political affair. I am obnoxious to a party, and they adopt a false pretence to cut me off. I shaU not submit to it. They have reckoned without their host, I promise you. I am one of the best shots in Ireland at a mark, having, as a public man, considered it a duty to prepare, for my own protection, against such un provoked aggression as the present. Now remember what I say to you. I may be struck myself, and then skill is out of the question ; but if I am not, my antagonist will have cause to regret his having forced me into this conflict.' The parties were then very soon placed on the ground, at, I think, twelve paces distance ; each having a case of pistols, with directions to fire when they chose, after a given signal. D'Esterre rather agitated himself by making a short speech, disclaiming aU hostility to his Roman Catholic countrymen, and took his ground, somewhat theatricaUy, crossing his pistols upon his bosom. They fired almost together, and instantly on the signal. D'Esterre fell, mortaUy wounded. There was the greatest self-possession displayed by both.\" Wanted, a Bellman. \u2014 At the Clare election, to the horror (says Phillips) of Vesey Fitzgerald, the rival candidate and a member of the then administration, Daniel, with the aid of his priests, poUed tenant against landlord. Vesey, a lord in embryo, could not stand it, and ho fled. Next day was a great day for Daniel. Priest, curate, coadjutor, bishop \u2014 he who, with no franchise, had voted notwithstanding ; aud ho who, having one, had voted very often \u2014 the whole available population, the pure children of nature as he caUed them, and some of them most justly, hailed their champion as he shouted from the hustings, \" Boys, where's Vasy Vigarald ? Och hone, Vasy, but it's me that's dial without ye. Righi, mavourneen ! righi,* and send the beU about for him. Here's the cry for you\u2014 \u2022 ' Stolen or strayed, Lost or mislaid, The President of the Board of Trade.' \" Scorning Advantage. \u2014 During a Dublin election, where Mr. West was a candidate, O'ConneU resorted to his nicknames, and \" sow West \" and \"ugly West\" were lavished UberaUy. \"Gentlemen,\" said West, good humouredly, \" Mr. O'ConneU takes advantage of me, for he wears a wig.\" \" I scorn aU advantage,\" exclaimed Daniel, casting off the orna ment, and exhibiting a scalp UteraUy without a hair between it and heaven \u2014 \" I scorn all advantage ; compare us now, boys ; is sow West the beauty? \" \u2014 Curran and his Contemporaries. An Unexpected Opponent. \u2014 Fagan, in his \" Life and Times of O'ConneU,\" relates an incident that occurred during the canvass of the constituency of tho county of Kerry, when the \"Liberator's\" nephew * \" Bun, darling ! ran ! ':"], [292, "272 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. was a candidate for the representation. Daniel spoke from the balcony of the Chamber of Commerce in Tralee one day, and opposite him were the committee rooms of the Knight of Kerry. In the midst of a very powerful speech a donkey suddenly began to bray. The effect was most ludicrous. Every man, woman, and chUd, tittered, whde the Conserva tive gentlemen roared aloud. Placid and coUected, however, O'ConneU looked around. A smile lighted up his face, and, raising his voice to its fullest pitch, he cried out, \" Hear him ! hear him, boys ! 'tis the chairman of the Knight of Kerry's committee.\" Parodies. \u2014 Some of O'Connell's parodies and poetical applications iu debate (remarks PhiUips) caught the humour of the House, and were con sidered felicitous. Amongst these was his sneer at the smallness of Lord Stanley's personal adherents after some general election : \u2014 \" Thus down thy hill, romantic Ashbourne, glides The Derby dilly, carrying six insides.\" His celebrated parody on three members of Parliament, Colonels Sibthorp, Perceval, and Verner, was extremely ready, and produced a roar : \u2014 \" Three colonels, in three distant counties born, Sligo, Armagh, and Lincoln did adorn. The first in matchless impudence surpassed, The next in bigotry \u2014 in both, the last. The force of Nature could no further go \u2014 To beard the third, she shaved the other two.\" Two of these gentlemen looked as if they never needed a razor, and the third (Sibthorp) as if he repudiated one. Jupiter Relenting. \u2014 The foUowing is related by PhUlips, as illus trative of the arbitrary disposition of the great Repealer : \" On a matter of parliamentary inquiry, on which I had quite as much experience as himself, our judgments differed, and I fared accordingly. No one could ever tell, however, when the storm might arise ; but he had it ready, and often nursed it in smiles. After walking down with me to the House of Commons one evening, arm-in-arm, as friendly as possible, he vehemently assaded me on the subject aUuded to. He refused to retract. No alter native was left but to right myself, which was done in a way by no means to his satisfaction. After my excellent friend Colonel Perceval, in his place in Parliament, read my letter of reply, Daniel feU into one of his paroxysms. ' The gallant member,' said he, ' may now congratulate him self on having severed a friendship of twenty-five years' standing.' Friendship indeed ! His translation of the idem velle et idem nolle must have been a curiosity. For six months and upwards, when we met, his look was a vrild glare. At last it pleased his Jupitership to relent. He walked up to me one day in the Reform Club, in high good humour : ' Charlee, shake hands ; I'm tired not speaking to you. I forgive you !'\" The Mob Orator. \u2014 The following allusion to O'ConneU is to be found in Lord Lytton's \" St. Stephen's \" : \u2014 \" Had that fierce railer sprung from English sires, His creed a Protestant's, his birth a squire's,"], [293, "DANIEL O'CONNELL. 273 No blander Pollio, whom our Bar affords , Had graced the woolsack and cajoled ' my Lords.' Pass by his faults, his art be here allow'd \u2014 Mighty as Chatham, give him but a crowd ; Hear him in senates, second-rate at best, Clear in a statement, happy in a jest ; Sought he to shine, then certain to displease ; Tawdry yet coarse-grain'd, tinsel upon frieze. His Titan strength must touch what gave it birth ; Hear him to mobs, and on his mother earth !\" And the poet thus records his own observation of the power of O'ConneU's voice over an immense crowd : \u2014 \" Methought no clarion could have sent its sound Even to the centre of the hosts around ; And, as I thought, rose the sonorous swell, As from some church-tower swings the silvery bell. Aloft and clear, from airy tide to tide, It glided, easy as a bird may glide ; To the last verge of that vast audience sent, It play'd with each wild passion as it went ; Now stirr'd the uproar, now the murmur still'd And sobs or laughter answer'd as it will'd. \" Then did I know what spells of infinite choice, To rouse or lull, has the sweet human voice ; Then did I seem to seize the sudden clue To the grand troublous Life Antique\u2014 to view, Under the rock-stand of Demosthenes, Mutable Athens heave her noisy seas.\" The Last Speech.\u2014 On the 3rd of April, 1846 (writes Mr. Disraeli in his \"Life of Bentinck\") Mr. O'ConneU had announced that ho should state his views at length on the condition of Ireland. Accor- dingly, when the order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate (on the Irish Coercion BiU) was read, he rose at once to propose an amend- ment to the motion. He sat in an unusual place, in that generaUy occupied by the leader of the Opposition, and spoke from the red box, convenient to him from the number of documents to which ho had to refer. His appearance was of great debility, and the tones of his voice were very stiU. His words, indeed, only reached those who were imme- diately around him, and the ministers sitting on the other side of the green table, and listening with that interest and respectful attention which became the occasion. It was a strange and touching spectacle to those who remembered the form of colossal energy, and the clear and thrilling tones that had once startled, disturbed, and controUed senates. Mr. O'ConneU was on his legs for nearly two hours, assisted occasionaUy iu the management of his documents by some devoted aide-de-camp. To the House generally it was a performance in dumb show, a feeble old man muttering before a table ; but respect for the great parUamentary personage kept aU as orderly as if the fortunes of a party hung upon his rhetoric ; and though not an accent roached the gallery, means were T"], [294, "274 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. taken that next morning the country should not lose the last and not the least interesting of the speeches of one who had so long occupied and agitated the minds of nations. RICHARD LALOR SHEIL. (1794\u20141851.) A Harsh Voice. \u2014 Sir Francis Doyle writes : \" Sheil never spoke without careful preparation, and every sentence was beautifully modelled. As a whole, perhaps there was too much glitter and gaudiness, but still his glowing fancy and great rhetorical skiU bore down all hostile criticism, and everybody listened to him as he went on with admiring expectatiou. Unluckily, both for himself and his hearers, his voice was detestable\u2014 something between the yeU of a peacock and the squeak of a slate pencil \u2014so that unmixed pleasure could not be enjoyed, and you were obliged to wait for the newspaper next morning to understand how great ho reaUy was.\" The Grave of a Government. \u2014 Professor Pryme says : \" Mr. Sheil was distinguished, like O'ConneU, by his advocacy of a repeal of the Union, and was one of the most eloquent and impressive speakers in the Parliament (1835). On a motion respecting Ireland, during Peel's short administration, he said that the grievances of that country had been fatal to several Governments, and ' even now,' pointing with bended form to that space of the floor which lies before the Treasury bench, ' have dug the grave that is yawning before the present one.' The sensation which his action and bis figure created was so intense that we were almost tempted to look if there were not a chasm in the place he pointed to. Ho spoke with prophetic lore.\" A Burst of Patriotism. \u2014 One of his most remarkable and beauti ful outbursts of nationality (writes Francis) was in 1837, in his celebrated attack on Lord Lyndhurst for his \" alien \" speech. AUucUng to the alleged charge that the Irish were aliens in blood and religion, he delivered this magnificent burst : \" Where was Arthur, Duke of WeUington, when these words were uttered ? Methiuks he should have started up to disclaim them. ' The battles, sieges, fortunes that he'd passed,' ought to have come back upon him. He ought to have remembered that, from the earliest achievement in which he displayed that military genius which has placed him foremost in the annals of modern warfare, down to that last and surpassing combat which 1ns made his name imperishable \u2014 from Assaye to Waterloo \u2014 the Irish soldiers, with whom your armies were fiUed, were the inseparable auxUiaries to the glory with which his unparal leled successes have been crowned. Whose were the athletic arms that drove your bayonets at Vimiera through the phalanxes that never reeled in the shock of war before ? What desperate valour climbed tho steeps and filled the moats of Badajos ?

And when, at length, the moment for the last decisive movement had arrived ; when the valour, so long wisely checked, was at last let loose ; when, with words familiar but immortal, the great captain exclaimed, ' Up, lads, and at them ! ' \u2014 tell me if Catholic Ireland with less heroic valour than the natives of your own glorious isle precipitated herself upon the foe ? The blood of England. Scotland, Ireland flowed in the same stream, on the same field ; when the chiU morning dawned, their dead lay cold and stark together ; in the same deep pit their bodies were deposited ; the green arm of spring is now breaking on their commingled dust ; the dew falls from heaveu upon their union in the grave. Partakers in every peril, in the glory shaU we not participate ? And shall we be told, as a requital, that we are estranged from the noble country for whose salvation our lifebloodwas poured out ?\" The effect produced by this passage wiU not be easily forgotten. Tho passionate vehemence of the speaker and the mournful music of his voice were a living echo to the deep emotions with which his soul seemed charged. An Appeal for the Jews. \u2014 In the second reading of the BiU for removing Jewish disabilities, introduced by Lord John RusseU's Govern ment in 1848, Mr. Sheil made the following appeal in its favour : \" There have been repeated references in this House to the author of the ' DecUnc and FaU of the Roman Empire,' but I think that a name stall more illustrious might have been cited. Was not Bolingbroke, the fataUy accomplished Bolingbroke, to whoso genius were offered tributes amount ing almost to idolatrous veneration\u2014 was not Bolingbroke, who united to external accomplishment high inteUectual endowments, and whose inter course in private life exercised a species of fascination on all who had the misfortune to approach him\u2014 was not Bolingbroke, the infidel BoUngbroke, a member of this House ? Was ho stopped by the test which arrested the Jew ? Did ho not, on the contrary, tread upon it, and mount to the height of power, and become a confidential adviser of the Sovereign ? Is it not preposterous that a man by whom revelation was rejected, who doubted the immortaUty of the soul, who doubted a future state of reward and punishment, who doubted eternity and providence, who believed nothing, who feared nothing, who hoped for nothing, who laid no restraint upon his depravity, who had no incentive to virtue beyond such natural prompt ings as God may have given him\u2014 is it not monstrous that such a fiend should find his way into the House of Commons, and cUmb to the pinnacle of power, and that you should slap the door with indignation in the face of an honourable aud conscientious man, who adheres to the religion in which t 2"], [296, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 276 ho was born and bred\u2014 of a man who believes in the facts which consti tute the foundation of Christianity, who believes in the existence of the noble part of our being, who believes in the mercies of God and who practises humanity to man, who believes in the ten great injunctions on which aU morality is based, whose ear is never deaf to the supplications of the suffering, whose hand is open as day to melting charity, and whose life perhaps presents a better exempUfication of the precepts of the Gospel than any of those men, for the sake of whose Christian reUgion the dishonouring disabilities are injuriously maintained ? \" LORD JOHN (EARL) RUSSELL. (1792\u20141878.) A Host in Himself. \u2014 Walking, says Samuel Rogers, some years ago (about 1838 or 1839) through the Park with the Duke of WeUington, I said to him, among other things, \" What an array there is in the House of Commons against Lord John RusseU\u2014 Peel, Stanley, Graham, &c. ! \" \" Lord John,\" replied the Duke, \" is a host in himself.\" Early Appearances.\u2014 Speech on the Habeas Corpus Act. \u2014 Lord John RusseU was elected for the famUy borough of Tavistock in July, 1813, a month before he came of age. He delivered his maiden speech in the following year. In 1817 the discontent among the people was so great, that Lord Castlereagh asked for a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. Lord John, who was in feeble health at the time, opposed the proposition, and, after observing that the state of his health had induced him to \" resolve ou quitting the fatiguing business of this House altogether,\" he went on to say : \" I am determined for my own part that no weakness of frame, no indisposition of body, shall prevent my protesting against the establishment of the mgst dangerous precedent which this House ever made.\" He also thus referred to the circumstances that led to the enactment of the law which it was proposed to suspend : \" The year before this law passed, a plot was discovered which, though it has since been mentioned only as an instance of credulity, wore at the time a most alarming appearance. No less than two hundred persons, many of them of the first rank, were accused of conspiring the death of the King. The heir presumptive to the throne was supposed to be implicated in the conspiracy, and foreign Powers were ready with money and troops to assist in the subversion of onr Constitution in Church and State. Yet at this time did the Lords and Commons present for the Royal assent this very BiU of Habeas Corpus, which for less dangers you are about to suspend. We talk much \u2014 I think a great deal too much \u2014 of the wisdom of our ancestors. I wish we would imitate the courage of our ancestors. They were not ready to lay their liberties at the foot of the Crown upon every vain or imagiuary alarm.\" \u2014 In later years the Habeas Corpus Act was more than once suspended under Administrations of which the speaker himself was the head. Perseverance as a Reformer. \u2014 Lord John Russell retired for a time from Parliament after the speech just quoted ; but in the f oUowiug"], [297, "EARL RUSSELL. 277 year he was again returned for Tavistock, and in 1819 made his first speech on ParUamentary reform, moving certain resolutions. These, however, were rejected ; but in February, 1820, he carried through the Commons a bill disfranchising Grampound and other rotten boroughs; but the proposal was not agreed to by the Lords. In March, 1820, new elections taking place, Lord John was returned for Huntingdonshire ; and in May of the following year he again came forward as a Parlia mentary reformer. He shortly after succeeded in carrying a proposal to disfranchise Grampound, and give its members to Leeds ; for which latter clause the Lords substituted the county of Yorkshire. This was the first successful step in that career of Parliamentary Reform in which Lord John was subsequently to become so distinguished. On the 26th of February, 1828, he also moved for a committee of the whole House to consider the Test and Corporation Acts, and carried it by 44 in a House of 430 members \u2014 \"to my great surprise,\" as he records in the introduction to his Speeches. The Acts were soon afterwards re pealed. His Introduction of the Reform Bill.\u2014 Earl RusseU gave, in the introduction to his \" Speeches,\" the following account of the effect produced in Parliament by the provisions of the first Reform BUI : \u2014 \" So Uttle were the opposite party prepared for the Bill, that a few days before the 1st of March, 1831, Sir Robert Peel, in a careful speech, derided what had been done on the subjects of peace and retrenchment, and predicted that when the plan of Reform should be developed, it would occasion dis- appointment by the meagreness of its proportions and the trifling nature of the changes recommended. The effect, therefore, of the revelations of the 1st of March was astounding. . . It was no wonder that this proposition, when placed boldly and baldly before the House of Commons, created feelings of astonishment, mingled with joy or with consternation, according to the temper of tho hearers. Mr. John Smith, himself a member for a nomination borough, said the proposal took away his breath. Some, perhaps many, thought that the measure was a prelude to civil war, which, in point of fact, it averted. But incredulity was the prevaiUng feeling, both among the moderate Whigs and the great mass of the Tories. The Radicals alone were deUghted and triumphant. Mr. Joseph Hume, when I met him in the streets a day or two afterwards, assured me of his hearty support to the Government. He said on another subject, in a public speech, that he was ready to vote black white iu order to carry the measure of Reform. Lord Durham, who was sitting under the gallery on the 1st of March, told me he was incUned to doubt the reality of what was passing before his eyes. A noble lord who sat \u25a0opposite to me, and who has long ago succeeded to a seat in the House of Lords, cheered me so vociferously that I myself was inclined to doubt his meaning. I found afterwards that his cheers were meant derisively, to ehow his thorough conviction of the absurdity and impracticability of my proposals.\" \u2014 Lord Broughton in his \" Recollections \" says : \" Never shaU I forget the astonishment of my neighbours as Lord John Russell developed his plan. Indeed, all the House seemed perfectly astounded ;"], [298, "278 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. and when he read the long Ust of the boroughs to be either whoUy or partially disfranchised, there was a sort of wdd ironical laughter. Lord John seemed rather to play with the fears of his audience ; and, after detaUing some clauses that seemed to complete the scheme, smUed and paused, and said, ' More yet.' When Lord John sat down, we of the Mountain cheered long and loud, although there was hardly one of us that believed such a scheme could, by any possibility, become the law of the land.\" \" Finality \" in Reform. \u2014 In June, 1837, Lord John RusseU observed of the Reform Act, in the House of Commons, \" Her Majesty's Ministers, while they consider it a final measure, do not intend that it should remain a barren Act upon the statute-book, but that it should be foUowed up in such a manner as would ennoble, invigorate, and enlargo the institutions of the country.\" The name \"Finality John\" was frequently applied to his lordship after this declaration ; but in 1849, in the courso of a debate on certain proposals connected with the Charter, Lord John denied having ever used the word \" finality \" in the senso imputed to him. Upsetting the Coach. \u2014 The satirist's portrait of Lord John RusseU, in the foUowing lines from Lytton's \" New Timon,\" becomes far from uncomplimentary at its close : \u2014 \" Next cool, and all unconscious of reproach, Comes the calm ' Johnny who upset the coach.'* How form'd to lead, if not too proud to please \u2014 His fame would fire you, but his manners freeze. Like or dislike, he doe3 not care a jot ; He wants your vote, but your affection not. Tet human hearts need sun, as well as oats, \u2014 So cold a climate plays the deuce with votes. And while his doctrines ripen day by day, His frost-nipp'd party pines itself away ; \u2014 From the starved wretch its own loved child we steal, And ' Free Trade ' chirrups on the lap of Peel ! But see our statesman when the steam is on, And languid Johnny glows to glorious John ! When Hampden's thought, by Falkland's muses dress'd, Lights the pale cheek, and swells the generous breast ; When the pent heat expands the quickening soul, And foremost in the race the wheels of genius roll ! \" * A note is added here : \" Lord Stanley's memorable exclamation on a certain occasion which now belongs to history \u2014 ' Johnny's upset the coach.' Never was coaeh upset with such perfect sang-froid on the part of the driver.\" The \" coach \" in question was the Ministry of Earl Grey in 1834. The exclamation was hastily scribbled on a piece of paper, and passed to Sir James Graham. The story went that Sir James slipped this paper into his pocket ; it was found there the same night by his valet, who carried it to the Times office, and in this way the ministerial crisis oozed out to the pubUc. This story, how ever, has been denied."], [299, "EARL RUSSELL. 279 Mind Triumphing over Matter. \u2014 Here is another picture of Lord John Russell, by an acute observer (Mr. Maddyn) : \u2014 \" His outward form was frail and weakly ; his countenance sicklied over with the effects of iU health and solitary self -communing ; his figure shrunken below the dimensions of ordinary manhood ; his general air that of a meditative invalid. But within that feeble body was a spirit that knew not how to cower, a brave heart that could pulsate vehemently with large and heroical emotions, a soul that aspired to live nobly iu a proud and right manly career. His voice was weak, his accent mincing with affectation, his elocution broken, stammering, and uncertain, save when in a few lucky moments his tongue seemed unloosed, and there came rushing from his lips a burst of epigrammatic sentences \u2014 logical, eloquent, and terse, and occasionally vivified by the fire of genius. Then would his right hand convulsively be clenched, his head proudly thrown back, the outline of his face become rigid and drawn, and the smaU form seem to dUate, while the cheek would blanchen with moral excitement, as the ecstacy of applauding partizans made the waUs of the Senate ring with echoing cheers.\" Occasional Sparks. \u2014 The speeches of Lord John Russell, as a ride, show few sparkles of the genius which the literary portraits just referred to, like aU contemporary impressions, recognise so freely. The wit aud brilliancy which Lord John Russell undoubtedly possessed appear to have been deUberately and entirely subordinated to a staid, methodical way of dealing with parliamentary business, and to a sense of ministerial respou sibUity. It was often a momentary flash which alone revealed the fuU light within. This latent power was shown at times in unexpected repartee ; and one of the most teUing retorts ever uttered in either House of Parliament was made by Lord John when Sir Francis Burdett, after turning from Radical to Tory, thought proper to sneer at the \" cant of patriotism.\" \" I quite agree,\" said Lord John, \" with the honourable baronet that the cant of patriotism is a bad thing. But I can tell him a worse \u2014 the recant of patriotism \u2014 which I will gladly go along with him in reprobating whenever he shows me an example of it.\" Equal Rights. \u2014 In a speech in the House of Commons in May, 1830, Lord John RusseU thus opposed the idea of universal suffrage : \" Considering our system \u2014 considering our monarchy and our House of Lords, and remembering the state of property in this country, I do not think that the exercise of universal suffrage could end otherwise than in a coUision that would produce either a Commonwealth on the one hand, or an absolute Monarchy on the other. Mr. Fox, however violent he might be in opposition to, or in pursuit of. a particular measure, yet pre served a high degree of moderation in the most stormy times. When Mr- Fox was speaking of the doctrine of equality, so much in fashion at the time of the French Revolution, he said, ' I too, Sir, am for equaUty. I think that men are entitled to equal rights, but to equal rights to unequal things.' To that observation, Sir, I adhere. I think that if universal suffrage were introduced, equal rights to unequal things could not in the long-run be maintained.\" \" Conservatives \" and \" Reformers.\"\u2014 During the election of a"], [300, "280 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. new Parliament which followed the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, Lord John RusseU, in addressing the electors of Stroud, thus referred to the suggested abolition of the terms Whig and Tory, and the adoption by the latter party of tbe then new term Conservative : * \"If they are really and truly conservatives as regards the general institutions of the country, no name is deserving of more adherents, or would meet with more general approval ; but with them it is a mere change of name, a mere alias to persons who do not like to be known under their former designation, and who under the name of Conservatives mean to be conservative only of every abuse \u2014 of everything that is rotten \u2014 of everything that is corrupt. If that, then, is the name that pleases them \u2014 if they say that the distinction of Whig and Tory should no longer be kept up \u2014 I am ready, in opposition to their name of Conservative, to take the name of Reformer, and to stand by that opposition. And in looking back to history, taking their sense of the denomination of Conservative, I think one may be as proud of the name of Reformer as they can be of the name of Conservative. What was Luther ? Luther was a Reformer. Leo the Tenth, who opposed the Reformation, was a Conservative. What was GaUIeo? GaUleo, who made great discoveries in science, was a Reformer. The Inquisition, who put him into prison, was Conservative. So, in the same way, with respect to every part of history, we find that in aU times and in aU countries there have been Reformers and Conservatives. The Christians who suffered martyrdom in Rome were Reformers. The Emperor who put these Christians to death, Nero, was a Conservative.\" The Ecclesiastical Titles Act. \u2014 \" No Popery.\" \u2014 Earl Russell thus commented in his \" Recollections \" upon this Act, which was passed in 1851 : \u2014 \" The object of that bill was merely to assert the supremacy of the Crown. It was never intended to prosecute any Roman Catholic bishops who did not act in glaring and ostentatious defiance of the Queen's title to the Crown. Accordingly, a very clever artist represented me in a caricature as a boy who had chalked up ' No Popery ' upon a wall and then rim away. This was a very fair joke. In fact, I wanted to place the assertion of the Queen's title to appoint bishops on the statute-book and there leave it. I kept in the hands of the Crown the discretion to pro secute or not any offensive denial of the Queen's rights. My purpose was fully auswered. Those who wished to give the Pope the right of appoint ing bishops in England opposed the bill. When my object had been gained, I had no objection to the repeal of the Act.\" \" Factious Combination.\" \u2014 After the defeat of Lord Derby's Government in 1852, and the formation of the \" Coalition Ministry \" by the Earl of Aberdeen, Lord John RusseU (Secretary for Foreign Affairs) thus defended himself and his coUeagues, before the electors of London, from the charge of factions combination : \" If an omnibus, with somo dozen passengers, were seen going down Ludgate-hUl at a furious pace, and breaking into the shop windows, and injuring everybody that was * This word came into use about the time of the first Eeform Bill, Mr. Croker having introduced it in 1831, in an article in the Quarterly Review."], [301, "EARL RUSSELL. 281 going by, why, every man would concur \u2014 the men that were going east ward and the men that were going westward \u2014 all would concur in stopping that omnibus, and telling the coachman to get off his box. And how much surprised would aU those passengers, with the policeman at their head, be if the coachman were to say, ' Why, this is a factious combination. You, gentlemen, are going some of you one way and some another, and yet you have aU combined to prevent me driving my omnibus into the shops.' Such, however, was the charge made against us \u2014 a charge, however, which I think you wdl say we need not be very much concerned at.\" \" Peace with Honour.\" \u2014 On receiving an address at Greenoek, in September, 1853, Lord John RusseU spoke of the duty that devolved on this country to endeavour to secure the rights of nations by peace, if possible, and added : \" But while we endeavour to maintain peace, I certainly should be the last to forget that if peace cannot be maintained with honour, it is no longer peace. It becomes then but a trace \u2014 a pre carious truce, to be denounced by others whenever they may think fit \u2014 whenever they may think that an opportunity has occurred to enforce by arms their unjust demands either upon us or upon our allies. I trust that so long as^I can bear any part in the public councils of this kingdom such will be my sentiments.\" Dangerous People. \u2014 Earl Russell writes : \" When we first heard of the seizure of the two Confederate commissioners on board the 'Trent' (in 1861), Lord Palmerston asked me privately what we should do. I answered shortly, quoting what Grattan said with reference to another power, and on another occasion, ' The United States' Government are very dangerous people to run away from.' \" Public Justice.\u2014 In May, 1854, Mr. Disraeli made a speech in tho House of Commons animadverting severely on the general management of affairs by the Aberdeen Ministry, and in the course of it taunted Lord John Russell with having joined that Ministry \"without a department,\" and \" condescending to accept subordinate office under an ancient and inveterate political opponent.\" Lord John, in reply, defended his present connection with the Earl of Aberdeen, and expressed his confidence in his coUeagues, adding : \" Should I be of opinion that the conduct of the war is not safe in the hands of the present Government \u2014 that the Govern ment is not carrying on the war with the vigour which makes war successful, and with a view to a peace which alone could be safe aud honourable \u2014 from that moment I should cease to be a member of it. But, Sir, considering that that is the great and pressing question of the country, no taunts of the right honourable gentleman would make me leave the Government with which I am connected \u2014 a position, God knows, of more labour and anxiety than of any pleasure, profit, or emolu ment. I repeat that, unless I were convinced that the present Govern ment was more likely than any government which could bo formed to carry on the war successfuUy, and to conclude it by an honourable peace. I should cease to bo one of its members ; but so long as I have that opinion, I shall trust to the House and to the country for putting a fair"], [302, "282 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. interpretation upon my conduct. I rely upon that justice which hardly ever fails to construe rightly the actions of pubUc men.\" \" Dropping \" his Colleagues. \u2014 Lord John RusseU's retirement from the Aberdeen Ministry in 1855, on the bringing forward of Mr. Roebuck's motion for a committee of inquiry into the condition of the army before Sebastopol, together with his frequent independence of action on similar occasions, and his custom of moving abstract resolutions, gave point to a saying of Sidney Herbert's which is quoted by Bishop Wilberforce : \" Lord John drops his Resolutions as if they were his colleagues.\" \"The Toung Man from Northampton.\" \u2014 At the general elec tion of 1857, a new candidate, of Northampton connections, was nominated by the Registration Association of the City of London to stand with other commercial men, to the exclusion of Lord John RusseU. His lordship, in addressing the electors, made the following observations ou this point : \" If a gentleman were disposed to part with his butler, his coachman, or his gamekeeper \u2014 or if a merchant were disposed to part with an old servant, a warehouseman, a clerk, or even a porter \u2014 he would say to him. 'John (laughter), I think your faculties are somewhat decayed; you are growing old ; you have made several mistakes ; and I think of putting a young man from Northampton in your place.' (Laughter and cheers.) I think a gentleman woidd behave in that way to his servant, and thereby give John an opportunity of answering that he thought his faculties were not so much decayed, and that he was able to go on at all events some five or six years louger. That opportunity was not given to me. The question was decided in my absence, without any intimation to me, and I come now to ask you and the citizens of London to reverse that decision.\" The electors did so, Lord John being again returned in company with his former colleagues. \" Rest and be Thankful.\" \u2014 Earl RusseU was entertained to dinner at Blairgowrie on the 26th of September, 1863, when, replying to the toast \" Her Majesty's Ministers,\" he said : \" With regard to domestic uolicy, I think we are all pretty much agreed, because the feeling of the country, aud of those who have conducted great reforms, is very much like that of the man who, baring made a road in ycur own highlands, put a stone on the top of the mountain with an inscription, ' Rest and be thank ful.' That seems to be very much like our feeling ; not that there arc not other roads to make and other mountains to climb. But it seems to be the feeling of the country, in which I cannot help joining, that our policy is rather to ' rest and be thankful ' than to make new roads.\" \" Conspicuous by Absence.\"\u2014 Mr. R. H. Hutton, in his \" Studies in Parliament \" (1866), quotes another of Lord John's apt sayings or ([notations : \" One of the most striking characteristics of Lord RusseU, which popularised him, if we may use that expression, so early in life, is a certain English ' baldness ' of mind which helps him to blurt out his convictions, however hasty, in a short, naked kind of way that at once makes them very visible to persons of all classes, though not always visible in their most ornamental form. Some of his phrases, remarkable"], [303, "EARL RUSSELL. 28o for their faulty directness, still linger amongst us\u2014 as, for instance, that happy term invented by him, we think, expressly for those qualities of the Tory Reform Bill of 1859, which were 'conspicuous by their absence.'\" * Talent in the Lords. \u2014 \" When a great question arises (says Earl Russell) which requires a display of more than ordinary knowledge of history, more accurate learning, more constitutional lore, and more practical wisdom than is to be found in the usual debates of Parliament, I know not where ' the general debate, The popular harangue, the tart reply, The logic and the wisdom and the wit,' are to be found in greater perfection than among the prelates on the episcopal bench, the peers of three centuries of nobility, and the recent occupants of the woolsack.\" Precious Possessions.\u2014 When the Reform Bill of the Aberdeen Ministry, of which Lord John Russell had charge in the House of Commons, was withdrawn in 1854, his lordship received one of the highest compliments ever offered by a political opponent. Mr. Disraeli said : \" Although it has been my fate to be always seated opposite to the noble lord, I can say, most sincerely, that no one in this House has a more heartfelt respect for the noble lord than I have. I think his character and career are precious possessions of the House of Commons, and I am sure that the members of this House will always cherish them. Wherever the noble lord sits, I am sure he will be accompanied by the respect of every member of this House ; and I think the manner in which to-night he has made what was evidently a painful communication is in every way worthy of the noble lord's character.\" Earl Russell's Judgment on Himself. \u2014 To speak of my own work, I can only rejoice that I have been allowed to have my share in the task accomplished in the half century which has elapsed from 1819 to 1869. My capacity, I always felt, was very inferior to that of the men who have attained in past times the foremost place in our Parliament, and in the councils of our Sovereign. I have committed many errors, some of them very gross blunders. But the generous people of England are always forbearing and forgiving to those statesmen who have the good of their country at heart. Like my betters, I have been misrepresented and slandered by those who know nothing of me ; but I have been more than compensated by the confidence and the friendship of the best men of my own political connection, and by the regard and favourable interpretation of my motives which I have heard expressed by my generous opponents, from the days of Lord Castlereagh to those of Mr. Disraeli. \u2014 Introduction to \" Speeches.\" * This figure comes from the Annals of Tacitus, iii. 76 : \" Sed pr\u00e6fulgebant Cassius atque Brutus eo ipso quod effigies eorum non visebantnr.\""], [304, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 284 LORD PALMERSTON. (1784\u20141865.) Entrance into Parliament.\u2014 The first constituency Lord Pahner ston aspired to represent in the House of Commons was that of the University of Cambridge, for which he was nominated in 1806, and again in 1807, but proved on both occasions unsuccessful. The earlier of these events is aUuded to by Byron, in \" Hours of Idleness,\" in the foUowing doggerel stanza : \u2014 Then would I view each rival wight, Petty and Palmerston survey, Who canvass there, with all their might, Against the next elective day.\" His lordship, however, was returned for the borough of Newport (I.W.) at the general election in 1807, but bis name does not occur in \" Hansard \" as a speaker till the foUowing year. In his \" Autobiography \" he wrote respecting his return : \" I came into ParUament for Newtown in the Isle of Wight, a borough of Sir Leonard Holmes'. One condition required was that I would never, even for the election, set foot in the place. So jealous was the patron lest any attempt should be made to get a new interest in tho borough.\" Early Promotion. \u2014 Lord Palmerston, soon after his return to ParUament, was made a Junior Lord of the Admiralty in the Duke of Portland's Administration. He had spoken only once in the House, and was but twenty-five years of age, when Mr. Perceval offered him tho ChanceUorship of the Exchequer in his Government. After consultation with friends, he declined on the ground of his inexperience, and was then offered the Secretaryship at War \u2014 an office distinct from the Secre taryship/or War, and concerned chiefly in the accounts of the department. He accepted this with reluctance, entering in his Journal: \" I have alwavs thought it unfortunate for any one, and particrdarly a young man, to be put above his proper level, as he only rises to faU the lower.\" This Secretaryship he continued to hold under various Administrations from 1809 till 1828. Attempt to Assassinate Him. \u2014 The attempt to assassinate Lord Palmerston is thus related in a letter from the Rev. A. Harris to Lord Fitzharris, given in the Malmesbury Correspondence : \u2014 \" April 8th, 1818. I have just seen Palmerston after this horrible attempt to assassinate him. He has received a contusion upon the backbone, but not a very severe \u2022one, and there is not the least reason for alarm. His escape was a very narrow one. The assassin, whose name is Davis, and who had been an officer in Spain, met him upon the staircase at the War Office, and was quite close to him when he fired ; the bad penetrated his coat and waist coat about the middle of his spine, and glanced off. Palmerston walked on to the room where his secretary was sitting, and told him that he had been shot at, but did not know what injury he had received. Asfley Cooper, and another surgeon of the name of Lynn, came imme-"], [305, "LORD PALMERSTON. 285 diately, and found the flesh upon the backbone contused, but that the baU had not penetrated the skin. The baU was found upon the staircase. The surgeons conveyed Palmerston home. Meanwhde the assassin was seized by two messengers and put into safe custody. Palmerston told me that he knew him to be mad, and for that reason had decUned seeing him, having received two letters lately asking him to do so.\" Lord Palmer ston thus jocularly referred to the occurrence in a letter to Lord Malmes bury a few days afterwards : \" After aU, I am not half so sore as either Don Quixote or Sancho, upon many occasions in their adventures. . . One comfort is that I shaU be recorded in iUustrious company, as having had the same escape as the Duke of WeUington and the Regent ; but I have so far the advantage of the latter that my bidlet has been found, though, luckily, not in me.\" Coming to the Front. \u2014 The foUowing occurs in the \" Journal \" of C. GreviUe, Clerk of the Council, under date June 11, 1829 : \" The event of last week was Palmerston's speech on the Portuguese question, which was deUvered at a late hour and to an empty house, but which they say was exceedingly able and eloquent. This is the second he has made this year of great merit. It was very violent against Government. He has been twenty years in office and never distinguished himself before \u2014 a proof how many incidental circumstances are requisite to bring out the talents which a man may possess. The office he held was one of dull and dry detail, and he never traveUed out of it. He probably stood in awe of Canning aud others, and was never in the Cabinet ; but having lately held higher situa tions and having acquired more confidence, and the great men having been removed from the House of Commons by death or promotion, ho has launched forth, and with astonishing success. Lord Granville told me he had always thought Palmerston was capable of more than he did, and had told Canning so, who did not believe it.\" A Three-Decker. \u2014 Canning, however, when Prime Minister, is re ported to have once spoken with regret of the loss he sustained through the sdence of his Secretary at War. \" What would I give \"\u2014he is said to have exclaimed, when wearied with assaults from the Opposition benches \" -what would I give to get that three-decker, Palmerston, to bear down upon them.\" A Prophecy. \u2014 Lord Palmerston foretold not only the free-trade policy of Sir Robert Peel, but also the period of its adoption. Speaking in September, 1841, he said : \" The right honourable baronet had said that he was not prepared to declare that he would never propose a change in the Com Laws, but he certainly should not do so unless at the head of an united Cabinet. Why, looking at the persons who form his administra tion, he must wait something near five years before he can do it.\" It is a remarkable coincidence (remarks Francis) that in four years and eight months from the date of this prediction, Sir Robert Peel introduced his measure for the repeal of the Corn Laws. \" Off-hand \" Debating. \u2014 In a speech against Sir Robert Peel's Government, in 1842, Lord Palmerston thus referred to Lord Stanley (after wards Earl of Derby) : \" The noble lord the member for North Lancashire"], [306, "286 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. is almost the only member of the present Government who, in the course of this session, has said much upon foreign affairs. The noble lord, on the occasion to which I aUude, made a very good off-hand speech, for no mau is a better off-hand debater than the noble lord. But off-hand debaters are sometimes apt to say whatever may come into their heads on the spur of the moment, without stopping to consider \u2014 as they would do if they had time \u2014 whether what they are going to say is strictly consistent with the facts to which it applies. I remember to have heard of a celebrated minister of a foreign country, living about the middle of the last century, who was giving instructions to one of his agents as to the language he should hold iu regard to the conduct of another government. The agent, having listened to the instructions, ventured, with great humUity and very submissively, to suggest that the language which he was ordered to hold was not strictly consistent with fact, and might indeed be thought to bo altogether at variance with fact. What was the minister's answer ? ' Never mind that ! What in the world does that signify p It is a good thing to say, and take care you say it.' That minister would, I think, have made not a bad off-hand debater in this House.\" A Defence of \" Restless Activity.\"\u2014 In March, 1843, Mr. Roe buck had moved for a committee to inquire into the causes of war with Afghanistan, and had attacked Lord Palmerston, in his capacity as the late Foreign Secretary. His lordship thus replied : \" The honourable and learned gentleman did not intend, I am sure, to have done that which I think he has clone, that is, to speak in a complimentary manner of myself as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He stated a fact, and he coupled that fact with an epithet. In doing this, he certainly did uut mean to be complimentary ; but I throw the epithet aside, and look only to the statement of fact, which I consider to be complimentary to anyone in the situation which I had the honour to hold. The honourable and learned gentleman accused me of a ' mischievous aud restless activity ' in the discharge of my official duties. Now, with regard to the term \u2022 mischievous,' I must take the liberty of saying that the honourable and learned gentleman appears to me to have peculiar notions of what is aud what is not mischievous ; and, therefore, he wUl pardon me for saying that his opinion that my official conduct was mischievous will not disturb the conviction of my mind that it was of a contrary tendency. That there was ' activity ' the honourable and learned gentleman declares ; and we have his unequivocal testimony to the fact. I thank him for that compliment. He says that my ' restless activity encircled the globe.' The sun never sets upon the interests of this country ; and the individual whose duty it is to watch over the foreign relations of this country would not be worthy of his position, if his activity was not commensurate with the extensive range of the great interests that require his attention. That was my position ; the honourable and learned gentleman admits my activity, and I thank him. . . I say, Sir, that our foreign policy was eminently successful ; that we engaged in many great and important transactions ; that those transactions were invariably brought to a conclu sion according to the views of the British Government ; that although at"], [307, "LORD PALMERSTON. 287 many periods there was great danger of disturbance to the peace of Europe, yet we \u2014 endowed, as the honourable and learned gentleman has sneeringly said, with miraculous power of running near the brink of danger, but never into it \u2014 succeeded in maintaining the peace of Europe.\" \" Old Women.\" \u2014 Lord Aberdeen in 1849, in the course of an attack on Lord Palmorston's foreign policy, said that Lord Minto, the British ambassador at Naples, had only been received by the King for the same reason that the old woman of Syracuse acquiesced in the tyranny of Dionysius \u2014 lest the devil should come next. Lord Palmerston replied to this a few evenings later : \" There are men who, having passed their whole lives in adoring the Government of Austria, because they deemed it the great symbol of the opinions which they entertained, at last became fickle in their attachment, and transferred their aUegiance to the Govern ment of France, because they thought that in that Government they saw an almost equal degree of leaning to the arbitrary principle, and because they, forsooth, suspected that Government of designs hostile to the interests of freedom. We have heard of persons of that sort making uso of the expression ' old women.' Public men ought not to deal in egotism, and I wUl not apply to them the expression that has faUen from their own mouth. I wUl only say that the conduct of such men is an example of antiquated imbecility.\" \" Civis Romanus Sum.\" \u2014 The celebrated application of this phrase by Lord Palmerston occurred in the House of Commons on the 25th of June, 1850. The occasion was the debate on a vote of confidence in the foreign policy of Lord John RusseU's Government, with especial refer ence to the affairs of Greece. Lord Palmerston, as the minister whose acts were immediately in question, entered into an elaborate defence of his entire foreign policy, and, after speaking for five hours, closed his peroration with a passage which is thus given in \" Hansard \" : \u2014 \" I con tend that we have not in our foreign policy done anything to forfeit the confidence of the country. We may not, perhaps, in this matter or in that, have acted precisely up to the opinions of one person or of another \u2014 and hard indeed it is, as we all kuow by our individual and private experi ence, to find any number of men agreeing entirely in any matter on which they may not be equally possessed of the detaUs of the facts, and circumstances, and reasons, and conditions which led to action. But. making allowances for those differences of opinion which may fairly and honourably arise among those who concur in general views, I maintain that the principles which can be traced through aU our foreign transac tions, as the guiding rule and directing spirit of our proceedings, are such as deserve approbation. I therefore fearlessly chaUenge the verdict which this House, as representing a poUtical, a commercial, a constitutional country, is to give on the question now brought before it \u2014 whether the principles on which the foreign policy of her Majesty's Government has been conducted, and the sense of duty which has led us to think ourselves bound to afford protection to our fellow-subjects abroad, are proper and fitting guides for those who are charged with the government of"], [308, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 288 England ; and whether, as the Roman, in days of old, held himself free from indignity when he could say Civis Romanus sum, so also a British subject, iu whatever land he may be, shaU feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him against injustice and wrong.\" \u2014 Sir Robert Peel, although speaking against the vote of confidence, remarked of Lord Palmerston's defence, amid the cheers of the House, \" His speech made us all proud of the man who delivered it.\" The Minister of England. \u2014 After the House of Lords, in 1850, had passed a vote of censure on the foreign policy of the Russell Adminis tration, the Premier remarked of his Foreign Secretary, in the debate which ensued in the Commons : \" So long as we continue the government of this country, I can answer for my noble friend that he wiU act, not as the minister of Austria, or as the minister of Russia, or of France, or of any other country, but as the minister of England.\" The observation was thought, by some, mere tautology ; but it was not so considered by Sir Robert Peel, who thus referred to it on a subsequent evening: \"The noble lord said that his noble friend the Secretary for Foreign Affairs would not be the minister of Austria, would not be the minister of Russia, and would not be the minister of France, but would be the minister of England. What was the meaning of that declaration ? The noble lord has too much prudence and discretion to point a sarcasm against three of the greatest powers of Europe ; but he could afford to be very liberal with such weapons when directed against his predecessors. My construction of that passage was, that the noble lord meant to contrast the conduct of the noble lord the member for Tiverton with the conduct of the Earl of Aberdeen.\" Shooting the Policeman.\u2014 In the defence of his foreign policy in June, 1850, Lord Palmerston thus referred to an attack which had been made upon him by Sir James Graham with regard to the affairs of Portugal: \"Portugal is now in the enjoyment of a constitution, and practicaUy it is working as weU as, under aU circumstances, and consider ing how recently it has been established, could perhaps have been expected. ' Oh, but,' said the right honourable baronet, ' you have Costa Cabral as minister, and your object was to get rid of him.' Now, the fault I find with those who are so fond of attacking me either here or elsewhere, in this country or in others, is that they try to bring down every question to a personal bearing. If they want to oppose the policy of England, they say, ' Let us get rid of the man who happens to be the organ of that policy.' Why, it is like shooting a policeman. As long as England is England, as long as the English people are animated by the feelings, and spirit, and opinions which they possess, you may knock down twenty foreign ministers one after another, but depend upon it no one wdl keep his place who does not act upon the same principles. When it falls to my duty, in pursuance of my functions, to oppose the poUcy of any Govern ment, the immediate cry is, ' Oh, it's aU spite against this man or that man, Connt this or Prince that, that makes you do this!'\" \"Judicious Bottle-holding.\"\u2014 On the 18th of November, 1851, Lord Palmerston, as Foreign Minister, received deputations from the"], [309, "LORD PALMERSTON. 289 borough of Finsbury and the parish of Islington, who presented addresses congratulating his lordship on the aid he had rendered the Sultan of Turkey in effecting the liberation of Kossuth. The Foreign Secretary declared himself highly gratified by such an expression of opinion on the part of so large a number of his feUow-countrymen ; and, in aUuding to the difficulties which were felt in the conduct of foreign affairs, he said (Times report), \" a great deal of good generalship and judgment was required, and during the pending struggle a good deal of judicious bottle -holding was obliged to be brought into play.\" The phrase formed the subject of a characteristic cartoon for Punch shortly after it was uttered. His Dismissal from the Foreign Secretaryship. \u2014 When Lord Palmerston was dismissed from Lord John Russell's Government, for having expressed to the French Ambassador his approval of Prince Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat, the ministerial explanations respecting the event were anxiously awaited by the country. They were given immediately on the assembling of Parliament, February 3rd, 1852, in the debate on the address in answer to the speech from the throne. Lord John made an elaborate statement to the House, in the course of which he thus explained his reasons for the course he had felt compelled to adopt : \" The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, putting himself in the place of the Crown, neglected and passed by the Crown, in order to give his own opinion with respect to the state of affairs in France. Now, it struck me that a Secre tary of State, constitutionally, has no such power. It appears to me that he can only act with tho sanction and the authority of the Crown in matters of very great importance. In matters of smaU importance I am ready to admit that the Secretary of State must be allowed to take a course which to him seems best, without a continual reference to the Crown ; but in this matter, which was of the utmost importance \u2014 namely, that of giving the moral influence and support of England to the act of the President of tho French Republic \u2014 it seems to me that it was an affair so great that the opinion, not only of the Primo Minister, but of the Cabinet, should have been taken, and that no such opinion should have been expressed without their concurrence, aud without the sanction of the Crown. . . When this took place, as I conceived the authority of the Crown had been set aside, and set aside for a purpose which the Government could not sanction, it appeared to me that I had no other course than to inform my noble friend that, while I held office, he could no longer hold the seals of the Foreign Office.\" Lord Palmerston's statement in his own justification was to the effect that the communica tion complained of had been made in a non-official conversation with the French ambassador. He held that \" if the doctrine of the noble lord were established, and if the Foreign Secretary were to be precluded from expressing on passing events any opinion to a Foreign Minister, except in the capacity of an organ of a previously consulted Cabinet, there would be an end to that freedom of intercourse between Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Ministers, which tends so much to good understanding and to the facility of public business.\" \u2014 Earl RusseU in his O\""], [310, "290 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. \" RecoUections,\" published in 1875, makes the following remarks upon this episode: \"Baron Stockmar, whose memoirs have been published, seems to have acquiesced in the opinion that my conduct on that occasion was dUatory and undecided. My own judgment upon it is that it was hasty and precipitate. I ought to have seen Lord Palmerston, and I think I could, without difficulty, have induced him to make a proper submission to her Majesty's wishes, and agree to act in conformity with conditions to which he had already given his assent. I felt it to be my duty to declare the political connection between Lord Palmerston and myself to be dis solved. But I felt at the same time that my Government was so much weakened that it was not likely to retain power for any long time.\" Overthrow of the Russell Administration. \u2014 Lord Palmer- stone speedily avenged himself upon the Government from which he had been dismissed. On the 20th of February \u2014 only a week or two after tho debate just mentioned \u2014 Lord John RusseU moved for leave \" to bring in a BUI to amend the laws respecting the Local MiUtia.\" Lord Palmerston proposed some amendments to the motion, the chief being to omit the word \" local.\" He made a powerful speech, one of his most telling points being as foUows : \" The whole of the objections of the Government to the formation of a regular militia are founded upon a radical distrust of the people of the United Kingdom. Sir, there is no foundation for this distrust ; there is no reason to beUeve that the people of England would not raUy round the national standard. It wiU not be for the first time that the people of Scotland wiU have risen up in arms and have fought the enemies of the United Kingdom ; and if it be that we cannot trust the people of Ireland to be faithful and true to their Queen and country, why, Sir, let us at once send for a Russian force to defend us, or let us have an Austrian garrison in London. Let us hide our heads in shame and con fusion ; let us confess that England is no longer England ; that her people are no longer endowed with that spirit and courage which sustained them in times gone by ; and that they will not take up arms in their own defence, in defence of their homes and their families, of their Sovereign and their country. Such seems to be the idea of the framers of this Bill.\" On a division as to the word \" local,\" the Government were defeated by 136 votes against 125, and Ministers immediately resigned. A Thing in a Wrong Place. \u2014 At a meeting of the Royal Agri cultural Society in 1852, Lord Palmerston made the following remarks : \" If ever there was a case in which it was true that knowledge is power, that maxim is peculiarly true in reference to the aids which chemistry affords to agriculture. AUusion has been made to the question of guano, and it has been'mentioned, what is perfectly true, that when I held an office which would have enabled me, if it had been possible, to assist the farmer with regard to guano, my endeavours proved fruitless. In fact, the Peruvians were not more disposed to let us put a price on their guano than the British farmer would be to have a price put upon his corn (laughter). But, gentlemen, I cannot but think that the progress of chemical science, and the appUeation of that science to practical agriculture, may lead you to something which wiU render you less anxious and solicitous about this"], [311, "LORD PALMERSTON. 291 same guano, and that, instead of sending to the other end of the world for more manure for our fields, we shaU find something nearly, if not quite as good within a few hundred yards of our dwellings. Now, gentlemen, I have heard a definition of dirt. I have heard it said that dirt is nothing but a thing in a wrong place. Now, the dirt of our towns precisely corresponds with that definition. It ought to be upon our fields, and if there could be such a reciprocal community of interests between the country and the towns, that the country should purify the towns and the towns should fertilise the country, I am much disposed to think that the British farmer would care less than he does, though he stiU might care something, about Peruvian guano.\" National Fasts and Everyday Duties. \u2014 In the autumn of 1853, Lord Palmerston, then Home Secretary, received an address from the Presbytery of Edinburgh requesting the appointment of a day of national fast, in view of the probable approach of cholera. To this his lordship replied : \" It does not appear to Lord Palmerston that a national fast would be suitable to the circumstances of the present moment. The Maker of the universe established certain laws of nature for the planet in which we live, and the weal or woe of mankind depends upon the observance or neglect of those laws. Lord Palmerston would suggest that the best course which the people of this country can pursue, to deserve that the further progress of the cholera should be stayed, will be to employ the interval that wiU elapse between the present time aud the beginning of next spring in planning and executing measures, by which those portions of their towns and cities which are inhabited by the poorer classes, and which, from the nature of things, must most need purification and improvement, may be freed from those causes and sources of con tagion which, if allowed to remain, wUl infallibly breed pestilence, and be fruitful in death, in spite of all the prayers and fastings of an united but inactive nation. When man has done his utmost for his own safety, then is the time to invoke the blessing of Heaven to give effect to his exertions.\" An Indefatigable. \u2014 Professor Pryine relates the following in Ulustration of Lord Palmerston's capacity for mental labour : \" One night, after a very late division, we were walking up Parliament -street together, when just opposite Downing-street he said to me, 'I must leave you here, for I have a dispatch to revise at the Foreign Office.' I expressed some surprise at his continuing his labours so far into the night, and he replied that he frequently did so.\" Lord Malmesbury, Foreign Minister in Lord Derby's Government, mentions in his \"Memoirs,\" \" I found what Lord Palmerston told me was correct, that the average work of the Foreign Office took him ten hours of the twenty four.\" Lord Granville in 18S0, in receiving, as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, a deputation on the subject of the slave traffic in the East, said, \" More than forty years ago I came to the Foreign Office as a young man, and the one thing which struck me more than anything else was the immense amount of endless labour which Lord Palmerston gave to every detail connected with tho slave trade.\" u 2"], [312, "292 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Palmerston's Debut in the Premiership.\u2014 When (says the- Edinburgh Review) he found himself at the head of the Cabinet, and leader of the House, he discovered that even his long experience of that body had not rendered him familiar with many of its usages. He set him self to learn the routine of his new position with the same patient industry with which more than forty years before he had mastered the details of the War Office. Early and late was the Premier in his place ; one of the first to come, one of the last to leave. Day after day saw him there before half -past four. Night after night did the summer morning find him still at his place. His first appearance as leader of the House of Commons was not entirely successful ; but by the end of the session of 1855 he had effectually grappled with and overcome the difficulty. He continued tho practice he thus commenced during the whole period of his Premiership. \"Won his Derby.\" \u2014 John Day, who trained Lord Palmerston's racehorses, often visited him iu London on turf matters, and the following story is related by the trainer's son in his \"Reminiscences\" (1886); \" My father, wishing to see his lordship, would have gone into the House and called him out, had he not been stopped by the policeman on duty. Not exactly understanding tho police regulations, he felt annoyed in being interfered with, and, on being asked for his card, replied : ' I don't carry cards. Give me a piece of paper, and I wiU write my name.* WhUst he was in the act of doing so, Sir William Codriugton came ont and spoke to him. ' What brings yon here, John,' he said ; ' and cau I do anything for you ? ' Yes, Sir WiUiam,' he replied ; ' I want to see Lord Palmerston, and this man won't let me pass.' Ou his being assured it was the regulation of the House, he was satisfied ; but was vexed when Sir William told him he did uot expect for a moment he would see his lordship, as the Irish debate was on, aud ho would bo too much engaged to leave. 'But,' he kindly added, 'I will go aud see.' To evtryone's surprise, the Premier got up and came straight out to my father. After shaking hands, my father heartily congratulated him on his being Premier, to which his lordship replied, ' Oh, thanks, John ; 1 have won my Derby ;' and then inquired how ho could servo him.\" Distrust at Court Overcome. \u2014 Mr. Henry Reeve, the editor of the Greville Memoirs, makes the following note to a passage in which the unpopularity of Lord Palmerston at Court was referred to : \" It is a remark able proof of the candid aud dispassionate spirit of the Queen that the three men who, at different times and for different reasons, were notoriously the objects of her distrust and aversion, subsequently obtained, as First Ministers of the Crown, her entire confidence. Sir Robert Peel was no favourite at the time of bis abortive attempt to succeed Lord Melbourne in 1839. Lord Palmerston was entirely at variance with the Court while he held the seals of the Foreign Office. And Mr. Disraeli was supposed to be especially disliked. Yet in the higher office of Prime Minister each of these statesmen enjoyed the confidence aud approval of the Sovereigu, and carried ou tho Government with success for several years.\" A \"Fortuitous Concourse of Atoms.\" \u2014 In announcing tho disso lution of Parliament consequent upun the division on the question of the"], [313, "LORD PALMERSTON. 293 \u2022Chinese War (March 5th, 1857), Lord Palmerston, referring to the combi nation of parties which had produced the majority adverse to his Govern ment, said : \" Combination implies a certain degree of similarity and identity of feeling. Now the right honourable gentleman opposite (Mr. Disraeli) in what he stated to the House spoke with a calmuess, a temper, and a statesman-like view of a great occasion, which did honour to himself and to the party of which he is the leader. The right honourable gentleman tho member for the University of Oxford (Mr. Gladstone), however, was carried away by au impetuosity and irritation of mind which certainly did not betoken any previous concert with the right honourable gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire, and which will, I think, be considered by him an unfortunate omen for that co-operation which is to follow the assumed combination between them. I said nothing to-night with regard to combiuatiou or conspiracy, or anything, I believe, which could give offence to anyone ; I did state that which is a fact. You may call it combination; you may call it the accidental and fortuitous concourse of atoms; you may call it the accidental meeting of different gentlemen in one lobby ; but I say that, when gentlemen are in the habit of finding themselves in the same lobby, it is not unnatural to suppose that they may, under certain circumstances, be ready to unite themselves together for forming an administration, and become responsible for the opiuions which they severally entertain.\" Sympathy with Italy. \u2014 Count Cavour. \u2014 In a speech in tho House of Commons on the death of Count Cavour (June 6, 1861) Lord Palmerston thus expressed himself : \" The tale with which Count Cavour's memory will be associated is one of the most extraordinary, I may say one of the most romantic, in the history of the world. Under his influence, we have seen a people who were supposed to have become torpid in the enjoyment of luxury, to have been enervated by the pursuit of pleasure, and to have had no knowledge or feeling in politics except what may have been derived from the traditions of their history and the jealousies of rival states \u2014 wo have seen that people, under his guidance and at his call, rising from the slumber of ages, breaking that spell with which they had so long been bound, aud displayiug on just occasions the courage of heroes, the sagacity of statesmen, the wisdom of philosophers, and obtaining for themselves that unity of political existence which for centuries has been denied them. I say, these are great events iu history, and that the man whose name will go down in connection with them to posterity, whatever may have been the period of his death, however premature it may have been for the hopes of his countrymen, cannot be said to have died too soon for his glory aud fame.\" Views on Irish Questions. \u2014 Lord Palmerston laid down the following principles in one of the last speeches he made in the House of Commons: \"You canuot expect that any artificial remedies which legislators can invent can reconstruct the laws of Nature, and keep in one country a population which finds it to its advantage to emigrate to another. Things will find their level, and until by some means or other there shall be provided in Ireland the same remuneration for labour, and"], [314, "294 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the same inducement to remain, which are afforded by other countries, you cannot, by any laws which you can devise, prevent the people from seeking elsewhere a better condition of things than exists in their own country. We are told that tenant-right and a great many other things will do it. None of these things wiU have the slightest effect. As to tenant-right, I may be aUowed to say that I think it is equivalent ter landlord's wrong. Tenant-right, as I understand it to be proposed, would be little short of confiscation; and, though it might cause the landlords to emigrate, it certainly would not keep the tenants at home. The real question is, how can you create in Ireland that demand and reward for labour which would render the people of Ireland willing to\" remain at home, instead of emigrating to England or Scotland on the one hand, or to the North American States on the other. Nothing can do that except the influence of capital.\" Good Humour. \u2014 Lord Palmerston (writes Mr. Hayward) had humour of the genial give-and-take kind, which, for a party leader, is often more serviceable than wit. He was told that Mr. Osborne, a popular speaker whose dash and sparkle are relieved by good feeling and sagacity, regretted a personal conflict which he had provoked. \" Tell him,\" said Lord Palmerston, \" that I am not in tho least offended, the more particularly because I think I had the best of it.\" Administering Reproof. \u2014 He had (says Lord DaUing) a good natured, gay way of giving reproofs when he did not mean them to be severe, of which every one who had much correspondence with him will recoUect some example. \" Put a little more starch into your neckcloth, my dear ,\" he said to a favourite diplomatist who he thought did not hold up his head high enough at the court where the minister represented us. . . To one gentleman who was perpetually pressing on him some claims of his father to a peerage, which claims had been frequently put aside by him, after remindiug his correspondent courteously of this fact and of tho reasons for it, he writes, as if relieving himself from a disagreeable thought, \" I confess I cannot see what advantage or satisfac tion can accrue to your father from drawing from me at repeated intervals a repetition of this statement.\" Answering a Troublesome Elector. \u2014 At the general election in 1852, Lord Palmerston's return for Tiverton was unopposed, but he had to submit to a crossfire of questions from some of the Radical electors, and especiaUy from a persistent individual named Rowcliff, a; butcher of the town. Lord Palmerston in the courso of his reply said : \" My good friend, Mr. Rowcliff, has reproached me for not coming often' Wiough among you. I must say that he does not appear disposed to make my visits here particularly agreeable to me (laughter). . . Mr. Row cliff says that I only told you of the good that Governments and Parlia ments have done, and that I have myself done, and that I have not told you of the bad. Why, God bless me ! it was quite unnecessary for me to do that when he was here (loud laughter). If there was a bad thing to be recorded, to be invented, or to be imagined, I am quite sure Mr. Row cUff would be the first man to tell you of it. (Laughter, which was in-"], [315, "LORD PALMERSTON. 295 creased when Mr. Rowcliff called out \" Question ! \") WeU, Mr. Rowcliff is impatient under this castigation. I wiU hit lower or higher, just as he pleases, but he must aUow me to hit somewhere. Mr. Rowcliff has asked me what government I mean to join. Now, that is a question which must depend upon the future ; but I will teU him what 'government I do not mean to join. I can assure you and him that I never wUl join a government called a Rowcliff Administration.\" The noble lord presently touched as follows upon another question that had been put to him : \" I am for septennial Parliaments. A septennial ParUament, practically, is not a Parliament that lasts for seven years, for we aU know that the average duration of the Parliament during the last thirty or forty years has not been more than three or four years. If you establish annual Parliaments you wdl have the country in a perpetual commotion. Your members of Parliament will not have time to learn their duties, and your business wiU be iU done. In the same way, if you have triennial ParUa ments, during the first year the members wiU be learning their business, in the second year they wiU just be beginning useful measures, and in the third year they will be thinking of the Rowcliffs of their respective con stituencies (laughter), and endeavouring to shape their course, not for the good of their country, but in order to conciliate the most noisy of their constituents.\"* A Speech by Request. \u2014 On one occasion, at a presentation of colours in his locality, Lord Palmerston attended and took a formal part in the proceedings, which were about to terminate, when he was approached by two reporters \u2014 whose faces, from their frequent presence in the gaUery of the House of Commons, were no doubt weU known to him \u2014 and a representation was made that they had journeyed expressly from London that morning, ou the possibility that his lordship would make some ' observations which might be reported for their respective newspapers. With the good nature that was as much one of his characteristics as ready tact, he replied, \" Oh, you want a speech, do you? Then you shaU have one;\" and, turning round to the assembly, commenced \" a few words before taking his de parture,\" which enabled the gratified journalists to return to town with notes of a speech a column in length for their papers the following morning. Pithy Sayings. \u2014 Sir S. Northcote, addressing a meeting at King's Lynn in July, 1884, related the following in the course of some remarks on Egyptian affairs : \" When Lord Palmerston was once asked about Egypt, he said, ' When I travel from London to Edinburgh I don't want to have all the public-houses on the way made my own ; but I do wish to have them kept clean and comfortable, and ready to receive me.' \" And another, with regard to domestic matters, was quoted about the same time by the Duke of ArgyU in the House of Lords. He said : \" Many of your lordships wiU remember a celebrated phrase of Lord Palmerston, who was himself opposed for many years to * Compare under \" Sir Richard Steele,\" p. 103,"], [316, "296 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. any great extension of the franchise. Somebody was arguing that it would have a very small result, and that the same class of men would be elected as before. ' Yes,' said he, ' the same men will get in as before, but they will play to the shilling gallery instead of to the boxes.'\" Thus do the striking sayings of Parliamentary genius linger in the memory and Ulustrate the arguments of contemporaries, even of opposite sides. Manner in Debate. \u2014 Speaking of one of Lord Palmerston's early displays in the House of Commons, Lord DaUing remarks that, while portions of his address were delivered with great ease and facility, \" in others there was that hesitation and superabundance of gesture with the hands, which were perceptible to the last when Lord Palmerston spoke unprepared, and was seeking for words ; for, though he always used the right word, it often cost him pains to find it.\" Long Service in Parliament. \u2014 Lord Palmerston's services in the House of Commons, extending from 1807 to his death in 1865, ranged over a total period of fifty-eight years. The fact was forcibly put by his Colonial Secretary, Mr. Cardwell, who pointed out that the late Prime Minister had \"sat in the House of Commons for one-tenth of tbe whole period of its existence.\" His Mixed Character. \u2014 Many of Lord Palmerston's charac teristics, which combined to make him one of the most popular English men of his time, were thus summed up in a notice written soon after his death by Mr. R. H. Hutton : \" His great attraction as a states man was the curious blending of social ease, kindliness, and humour with the temper of a strong, hard man of the world. He was essentiaUy a masculine politician. He stood to the other statesmen of his clay much in the same relative position in which public-school boys stand to home-bred boys. He denounced 'the puerile vanity of consistency,' and had no scom too great for political ' romance.' 'As to the romantic notion,' he said, ' that nations or governments are much or permanently influenced by friendships, and God knows what, why, I say that those who maintain those romantic notions, and apply the intercourse of individuals to the intercourse of nations, are indulging in a vain dream. The only thing which makes one government follow the advice of another is the hope of benefit to accrue from adopting it, or the fear of the consequences of opposiug it.' There you see the hardness at the bottom of Lord Palmerston's politics. . . He was not eloquent, but he could enjoy and give enjoyment. He was not witty, but he was playful and even humorous. This was a very fascinating quality in a \"man of that worldly sense which usually has a touch of cynicism. WThen a tire some Toiy catechist asked him if a Junior Lordship of the Treasury was vacant and was to be filled up, and Lord Palmerston with seeming hesitation replied that it was vacant, that he did mean to fill it up, and then in dumb show telegraphed that he should not mind bribing his tiresome questioner to desert his party for the office if he would accept it, not only the House, but all England, laughed at the humour of the retort on a bore. This pleasantry of an accom-"], [317, "LORD PALMERSTON. 297 plished man of the world turned a duU and painstaking assembly into a lively society, which taught the nation true vivacity as weU as practical wisdom.\" \" An Englishman.\" \u2014 Lord Malmesbury records : \" As a Minister, though I often differed from him, I looked upon him as one of our greatest, especially in his knowledge of foreigners and their character. He was clear-headed, always knew what he wanted, and was deter mined to carry it out, with great moral and physical courage. We shaU be long ere we see his like again. He was English to the backbone.\" Lord Palmerston and the Queen. \u2014 On the death of Lord Palmerston, the Queen wrote as follows to Earl RusseU : \" The melan choly news of Lord Palmerston's death reached the Queen last night. This is another link with the past which is broken ; and the Queen feels deeply, in her desolate and isolated condition, how one by one of those tried servants are taken from her. . . The Queen cau turn to no other than Lord RusseU, an old and tried friend of hers, to under take the arduous duties of Prime Minister, and to carry on the govern ment.\" Lord Palmerston and Mr. Gladstone. \u2014 After Lord Palmer- ston's death, the Earl of Shaftesbury (his intimate friend, through re lationship to Lady Palmerston) wrote as foUows : \" Palmerston had but two real enemies, Bright and Gladstone. Gladstone's language, and especially his acts, will show that the master mind which curbed him is gone, and his resentment will appear in the political associa tions he will form, and in the violence and relish with which he will overthrow every thought and deed of his great leader. Palmerston knew all this, but never mentioned it with asperity. Once he said to me, though he seldom dealt in predictions, ' Gladstone will soon have it all his own way ; and whenever he gets my place we shaU have strange doings.' . . He saw clearly, but without any strong sentiment, Gladstone's hostility. He remarked to me one day, when we were discussing some appointment, ' WeU, Gladstone has never behaved to me, as a colleague, in such a way as to demand from me any consideration.' And this he said with the air and tone of a man who perceived the enmity, but did not care for it. Yet he always endeavoured to keep him safe iu Oxford. When Lord Derby dissolved the Parliament, P. requested me to do all that lay in my power to secure Gladstone's seat for the University. When Parliament was dissolved, in July of this year, P. again applied to me; and every effort was made. But the Conservatives and their adherents committed the gross folly of ejecting him from Oxford, and thus sending him to Lancashire. ' He is a dangerous man,' 6aid P. ; ' keep him in Oxford, and he is partiaUy muzzled,* but send him elsewhere and he will run wUd.' \" \u00ab See under Gladstone, \" Unmuzzled.\""], [318, "298 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. THE EARL OF CLARENDON. (1800\u20141870.) Exciting Spanish Gratitude.\u2014 The Earl of Clarendon, who was Foreign Minister at the outbreak of the Crimean War, succeeded to the peerage on the death of his uncle in 1834, and never sat in the House of Commons. His earlier years were devoted to diplomacy, and he had for some time fiUed the post of British Minister at Madrid, when he was called to the House of Lords, and resigned his ambassadorial functions. He had not been long a member of the Upper House when a debate on Spanish affairs arose, in which Lord Clarendon ably defended the policy of the Government he had represented, and spoke warmly of the prospects of Liberal institutions in Spain. His speech so pleased the Spaniards that it was circulated through out the country, a gold medal was struck in his honour, and it was resolved to present the upholder of Spanish dignity with a handsome work of art. Thought of as Prime Minister. \u2014 Mr. GreviUe mentions a conversation with Lord Clarendon (then Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland) in 1848. \" He informed me that Wylde (to whom the Prince is in the habit of talking very openly) told him that the Prince had been discussing with him the possibility of some change of government being rendered necessary by Lord John's health breaking down, aud that they would like him (Clarendon) to succeed him ; and that if such an event occurred, the Queen would certainly send for him to consult him on the subject. Clarendon desired him to take an opportunity of telling the Prince that no power on earth should induce him to accept such a post, and, as it was much better the Queen should never make an overture which would not be accepted, he wished none such might ever be made to him.\" \"Drifting into War.\"\u2014 On the 14th of Februaiy, 1854, the Marquis of Clanricarde, in moving in the House of Lords for further information respecting the cessation of diplomatic relations with the Court of St. Petersburg, and the war which appeared imminent, inquired of the Government, \" If we are at peace, what is tho peace? and what is the peace that is the object of the war?\" In the course of his reply the Earl of Clarendon said : \" The question had been asked whether we were at peace or war, and was one very difficult to answer distinctly. We are not at war, because war is not declared ; we are not strictly at peace with Russia. (A laugh.) My noble friend may laugh; but ho must know perfectly weU that I am correct in saying that we are not at war with Russia, although diplomatic relations with that country are suspended. . . Therefore, I consider that we are in the intermediate state; that our desire for peace is just as sincere as ever ; but then, I must say that our hopes of maintaining it are gradually dwindling away, and that we are drifting towards war.\""], [319, "LORD MACAULAY. 299 \" Europe on a Mine.\"\u2014 The Earl of Clarendon used this expres sion with reference to the state of Europe before the Crimean War. In. a speech on the 25th of May, 1855, he said : \" We have learnt a great deal of the intentions of Russia, and the means she possessed of giving effect to those intentions. We now know what were the vast niilitary resources of Russia, how stealthily they had been accumulated, and how readily they could be made available. We now know something of the almost incredible amount of warlike stores which had been accumulated in Sebastopol, where Russia had no commerce to protect, and we are also aware of the gigantic fortifications which were contemplated at Bomar sund. Why, Europe was really standing upon a mine without being aware of it, while the influence of Russia was so skilfully exercised as to paralyse both Governments and people. The encroachments of Russia were unheeded, although her designs had been suspected and denounced;. but it was nobody's business to interfere effectually, and no one wished to, disturb the general peace, untU the mine which had been sUently and slowly prepared was exploded by the rashness of Prince Menchikoff.\" LORD MACAULAY. (1800\u20141859.) His Characteristics as a Speaker. \u2014 By aU accounts (writes Dean Milman) Macaulay's delivery was far too rapid to be impressive ; it wanted also variety and flexibility of intonation. Even the most practised reporters panted after him in vain ; how much more the slower inteUects of country gentlemen and the mass of the House ! This, however, only heightens our astonishment that speeches so full, so profoundly meditated, yet with so much freedom, with no appearance of being got by heart, with such prodigality of illustration and allusion, should be poured forth with such unhesitating flow, with such bewildering quickness of utterance. To read them with delight and profit, we read them rather slowly ; we can hardly conceive that they were spoken less deliberately. It may be ques tioned, and has been questioned, whether Macaulay was, or could have become, a masterly debater. This accomplishment, except in rare examples, is acquired only by long uso and practice. When Macaulay entered the House, the first places were filled by men of established influ ence and much parliamentary training. Even if he had felt called upon to make himself more prominent, it may bo doubted whether he could have sufficiently curbed his impetuous energy, or checked his torrent of words. He would have found it difficult to assume the stately, prudent, reserved, compressed reply; he might have torn his adversaries' arguments to shreds, but he woidd not have been content without a host of other arguments, and so would have destroyed tho effect of his own confutation. StiU, it is remarkable that on two occasions a speech of Macaulay's actually turned the vote of the House, and carried the question (a very rare event) in his own way \u2014 the debato on the Copyright Act, and the question of judges holding seats in the House of Commons. Though he took his seat, Lord Macaulay never spoke in the Hcuse of Peers ; he went down."], [320, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 300 we believe, more than once with the intention of speaking, but some unex pected turn in the debate deprived him of his opportunity; his friends, who knew the feeble state of his health at that time, were almost rejoiced at their disappointment in not hearing him in that which would have been so congenial a field for his studied and matured eloquence. \" Express Train \" Oratory. \u2014 The following graphic sketch of Macaulay's demeanour in the House and his manner in delivery is from Francis's \" Orators of the Age \" : \u2014 \" In the House of Commons, abstrac tion is his chief characteristic. He enters the House with a certain pole star to guide him \u2014 his seat ; how he reaches it seems as if it were a process unknown to him. Seated, he folds his arms and sits in silence, seldom speaking to his colleagues, or appearing to notice what is going forward. An opening is made in the discussion, and he rises, or rather darts up from his seat, plunging at once into the very heart of his subject, without \u2022exordium or apologetic preface. In fact, you have for a few seconds heard a voice, pitched in alto, monotonous, and rather shrill, pouring forth words with inconceivable velocity, ere you have become aware that a new speaker, and one of no common order, has broken in upon the debate. A few seconds more, and cheers \u2014 perhaps from all parts of the House \u2014 rouse you from your apathy, compelling you to follow that extremely voluble, and not very enticing voice, in its rapid course through the subject on which the speaker is entering, with a resolute determination, as it seems, never to pause. You think of an express train, which does not stop even at the chief stations. On, on he speeds, in fidl reliance on his own momen tum, never stopping for words, never stopping for thoughts, never halting for an instant, even to take breath \u2014 his intellect gathering new vigour as he proceeds, hauling the subject after him, and aU its possible attributes and iUustrations, with the strength of a giant, leaving a line of light on the pathway his mind has trod, tiU, unexhausted and apparently inex haustible, he brings this remarkable effort to a close by a peroration, so highly sustained in its declamatory power, so abounding in illustration, so admirably framed to crown and clench the whole oration, that surprise, if it has even begun to wear off, kindles anew, and the hearer is left utterly prostrate and powerless by the whirlwind of ideas and emotions that has swept over him.\" His Early Speeches. \u2014 Macaulay's first speech in Parliament was made on the Jewish Disabilities, in 1830, and was moderately successful ; but in the following year his masterly speeches on the Reform Bill brought him to the front rank as an orator. Jeffrey, his coUeague on the Edin- burgh, who was also in Parliament, thus wrote to Lord Coekbum respecting Macaulay's speech on the second reading of the bill : \" No division last night, as I predicted, and not a very striking debate. A curious series of prepared speeches by men who do not speak regularly, and far better expressed than nine-tenths of the good speeches, but languid and ineffi- cient, from the air of preparation, and the want of nature and authority, with which they are spoken. There was but one exception, and it was a hriUiant one. I mean Macaulay, who surpassed his former appearance in .closeness, fire, and vigour, and very much improved the effect of it, by a"], [321, "LORD MACAULAY. 301 more steady and graceful delivery. It was prodigiously cheered, as it deserved, and I think puts him clearly at the head of the great speakers, if not the debaters, of the House. I once meant to have said something, but I now think it impossible.\" A session or two later, Jeffrey again wrote : \" I breakfasted to-day at Rogers's with Macaulay and Sydney Smith ; both in great force and undaunted spirit. Mac. is a marvellous person. He made the very best speech that has been made this session, on India, a few nights ago, to a House of less than fifty. The Speaker, who is a severe judge, says he rather thinks it the best speech he ever heard.\" An Indiscretion. \u2014 In 1839, Lord Melbourne offered to Macaulay the office of Secretary at War with a seat in the Cabinet \u2014 the office, however, being then one of second rank, as the chief responsibility in army affairs then lay with the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. The office was willingly accepted, particularly as it was coupled with an honour which had been denied to men like Burke and Sheridan. The appointment of course necessitated the return of Macaulay to his constituents for re-election ; and he incurred much ridicule and ceusure by a want of taste and judgment \u2014 especially remarkable in the case of so keen a critic \u2014 in dating his address to the electors of Edinburgh from Windsor Castle, where he was staying as the Queen's gnest. Macaulay as Cabinet Minister. \u2014 With reference to Macaulay's elevation to the Secretaryship at War, with a seat in the Cabinet, Mr. Torrens wrote, in his memoirs of Melbourne : \" What Burke and Sheridan, Francis and Mackintosh, had sighed and laboured for in vain, was sponta neously accorded him as a man of letters, whom the great constituencies of Leeds and Edinburgh had chosen for their representative. No doubt the Minister desired to strengthen his resources in debate ; no doubt the personal friendship of Russell and Rice, still more of Lansdowne, contributed to Macaulay's elevation. But the credit is clue to Melbourne of being the first Premier, since the death of Stanhope, who opened the doors of the Cabinet to one who was simply and merely a man of letters.\" Sentiments respecting War. \u2014 Macaulay in 1840 wrote to his friend, Mr. Macvey Napier, with reference to the fecUng at the time existing between France and England : \" It is foolish and wicked to bellow for war merely for war's sake, like the rump of the Mountain at Paris. I would never make offensive war. I would never offer to any other Power a provocation which might be a fair ground of war. But I never would abstain from doing what I had a clear right to do, because a neighbour chooses to threaten me with an unjust war; first, because I believe that such a policy would in the end inevitably produce war ; and, secondly, because I think war, though a very great evU, by no means so great an evil as subjugation and national humiliation.\" Challenged to a Duel. \u2014 On one occasion the son of Zachary Macaulay narrowly escaped appearing as a duellist. In December, 1834j he sent from India to Mr. Macvey Napier, for the Edinburgh Review, an article on \" Mackintosh's History of the Revolution,\" in which some very strong remarks were made upon the editor of the work, a Mr. Wallace."], [322, "302 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. The publication of the paper was followed by a chaUenge to Mr. Napier from the person aggrieved ; and on Macaulay's return to England, in 1838, Mr. Wallace challenged him also. The essayist thus wrote to his friend on the subject : \" I put the matter into Lord Strafford's hands. I had, to tell you the truth, no notion that a meeting could be avoided. . . I could not make any apology, or express the least regret, for having used strong language in defence of Mackintosh. Lord Strafford quite approved of my resolution. But he proposed a course which had never occurred to me \u2014 which at once removed aU scruples on my side \u2014 and which, to my great surprise, Steele [WaUace's second] and WaUace adopted without a moment's hesitation. This was that Wallace should make a preliminary declaration that he meant, by his memoir, nothing disrespectful or unkind to Mackintosh, but the direct contrary ; and that then I should declare that, in consequence of Mr. Wallace's declaration, I was ready to express my regret if I had used any language that coidd be deemed personaUy offensive. . . In this way the matter was settled \u2014 much belter settled than by refusing to admit WaUace to the privileges of a gentleman.\" Giving the House a Story. \u2014 The foUowing may be taken as an example of Macaulay's power to illustrate and enUven a subject of debate, however abstruse its nature. In February, 1845, Sir Robert Peel brought forward his New Tariff, in which were proposed discriminating duties on sugar, a prohibitory duty being imposed on foreign sugar manufactured by slave labour, while raw sugar of similar production was to be admitted freely for manufacture here. \" I remember,\" said Mr. Macaulay, \" some thing very like the right honourable baronet's moraUty in a Spanish novel, which I read long ago. I beg pardon of the House for detaining them with such a trifle, but the story is much to the purpose. A wan dering lad, a sort of GU Bias, is taken into the service of a rich old silversmith, a most pious man, who is always teUing his beads, who hears mass daUy, and observes the feasts and fasts of the Church with the utmost scrupulosity. The silversmith is always preaching honesty and piety. ' Never,' he constantly repeats to his young assistant, ' never touch what is not your own ; never take Uberties with sacred things.' Sacrilege, as uniting theft with profaneness, is the sin of which he has the deepest horror. One day, whUe he is lecturing after his usual fashion, au Ul looking feUow comes into the shop with a sack tinder his arm. ' WiU yon buy these ? ' says the visitor, and produces from the sack some church plate and a rich sUver crucifix. ' Buy them ! ' cries the pious man. ' No, nor touch them; not for the world. I know where you got them. Wretch that you are, have you no care for your soid ? ' ' WeU, then,' says the thief, ' if you will not buy them, wiU you melt them down for me ? ' ' Melt them down ! ' answers the silversmith, ' that is quite another matter.' He takes the chalices and the crucifix with a pair of tongs ; the silver, thus in bond, is dropped into the crucible, melted, and delivered to the thief, who lays down five pistoles, and decamps with his booty. The young servant stares at this strange scene. But the master very gravely resumes his lecture. ' My son,' he says, ' take warning by that sacri legious knave, and take example by me. Think what a load of guUt lies on"], [323, "LORD MACAULAY. 303 his conscience. You wUl see him hanged before long. But as to me, you saw that I would not touch the stolen property. I keep these tongs for such occasions ; and thus I thrive in the fear of God, and manage to turn an honest penny. ' \" Subscriptions to Race Meetings, &c. \u2014 During Macaulay's earlier connection with Edinburgh as one of its representatives, he was applied to for a subscription to the annual race meeting of the city, the sum of fifty guineas having usually been given under such circumstances. He declined to continue the practice, and thus expressed his views to his friend Mr. Adam Black : \" In the first place, I am not clear that the object is a good one. In the next place, I am clear that by giving money for such an object, in obedience to such a summons, I should com pletely change the whole character of my connection with Edinburgh. It has been usual enough for rich families to keep a hold on corrupt \"boroughs by defraying the expense of public amusements. Sometimes it is a ball ; sometimes a regatta. The Derby family used to support the Preston races. The members for Beverley, I believe, find a buU for tho constituents to bait. But these were not the conditions upon which I undertook to represent Edinburgh. In return for your generous con fidence, I offer faithful parliamentary service, and nothing else. The caU that is now made is one so objectionable that I must plainly say, I would rather take the Chiltem Hundreds than comply with it. If our friends want a member who wiU find them in public diversions, they can be at no loss. I know twenty people who, if you elect them to Parlia ment, will gladly treat you to a race and a race-baU once a month. But I shall not be very easily induced to believe that Edinburgh is disposed to select her representatives on such a principle.\" Irish Claims. \u2014 The following remarks were made by Macaulay in a speech in the House of Commons on April 23, 1845, the immediate subject being the Church in Ireland, and tho Maynooth grant : \" You may trust us when we teU you that there is a point where we will stop. Our language to the Irish is this. You asked for Emancipation ; it was agreeable to our principles that you should have it, and we assisted you to obtain it. You wished for a municipal system as popular as that which exists in England ; we thought your wish reasonable, and did all in our power to gratify it. The grant to Maynooth is, in our opinion, proper ; and we wiU do our best to obtain it for you, though it shoidd cost us our popularity and our seats in Parliament. The Established Church in your island, as now constituted, is a grievance of which you justly complain; we wiU strive to redress that grievance. The repeal of the Union we regard as fatal to the Empire ; and we never will consent to it ;\u2014 never, though the country should be surrounded by dangers as great as those which threatened her when her American colonies, and France, and Spain, and Holland were leagued against her, and when the armed neutrality of the Baltic disputed her maritime rights ; \u2014 never, though another Bouaparte should pitch his camp in sight of Dover Castle ;\u2014 never, till aU has been staked and lost ; \u2014 never, till the four quarters of the world have been convulsed by the last struggle of the great English people for their place among the nations.\""], [324, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 304 The \" Bray \" of Exeter Hall. \u2014 This celebrated expression, which lost Macaulay his seat for Edinburgh, occurred in his speech on the second reading of the Maynooth College Bill. The passage con taining it is thus given in his Speeches : \" What substitute does the honourable baronet (Sir Robert Peel) give his foUowers to console them for the loss of their favourite Registration Bill ? Even this Bill for the Endowment of Maynooth College. Was such a feat of legislation ever seen ? And can we wonder that the eager, honest, hot-headed Protes tants, who raised you to power in the confident hope that you would curtail the privileges of the Roman Catholics, should stare and grumble when you propose to give public money to the Roman Catholics ? Can we wonder that, from one end of the country to the other, everything should be ferment and uproar ; that petitions should, night after night, whiten all our benches like a snowstorm ? Can we wonder that the people out of doors should be exasperated by seeing the very men who, when we were in office, voted against the old grant to Maynooth, now pushed and ptiUed into the House by your whippers-in to vote for an increased grant ? The natural consequences foUow. AU those fierce spirits, whom you hallooed on to harass us, now turn round and begin to worry you. The Orangeman raises his war-whoop : Exeter HaU sets up its bray : Mr. Macneile shudders to see more costly cheer than ever provided for the priests of Baal at the table of the Queen ; and the Protestant Operatives of Dublin call for impeachments in exceedingly bad English. But what did you expect ? Did you think, when, to servo your turn, you called the DevU up, that it was as easy to lay him as to raise him ? \" The House of Commons \"The Beast.\" \u2014 In a letter written to Mr. T. F. EUis in 1834, when Macaulay was in India, he tells his friend : \" The Rajah was by no means the greatest fool whom I found at Mysore. I aUghted at a bungalow appertaining to the British Residency. There I found an Englishman who, without any preface, accosted me thus : ' Pray, Mr. Macaulay, do you not think that Buonaparte was the Beast P ' ' No, sir, I cannot say that I do.' ' Sir, he was the Beast. I can prove it. I have found the number 666 in his name. Why, sir, if he was not the Beast, who was?' This was a puzzling question, and I am not a little vain of my answer. ' Sir,' said I, ' the House of Commons is the Beast. There are 658 members of the House ; and these, with their chief officers \u2014 the three clerks, the Serjeant and his deputy, the chaplain, the doorkeeper, and the librarian \u2014 make 666.\" The Taste of the House of Commons.\u2014 In February, 1831, Macaulay thus wrote to Whewell: \"I am impatient for Praed's debut. The House of Commons is a place in which I would not promise success to any man. It is the most peculiar audience in the world. I should say that a man's being a good writer, a good orator at the bar, a good mob-orator, or a good orator in debating clubs, was rather a reason for expecting him to fail than for expecting him to succeed in the House of Commons. A place where Walpole succeeded aud Addison faded ; where Dundas succeeded and Burke failed; where Peel now succeeds and"], [325, "LORD LYTTON. 305 Mackintosh failed j where Erskine and Scarlett were dinner-bells ; where Lawrence and Jekyll, the two wittiest men, or nearly so, of their time, were thought bores, is surely a very strange place. And yet I feel the whole character of the place growing upon me. I begin to like what others about me like, and to disapprove what they disapprove. Canning used to say that the House, as a body, had better taste than the man of best taste in it, and I am very much inclined to think that Canning was right.\" Parliamentary Government. \u2014 Lord Macaulay's remarks on this subject, in his review of Pitt's career, are as foUows : \" Pariiamentary government, like every other contrivance of man, has its advantages and its disadvantages. On the advantages there is no need to dilate. The history of England during the 170 years which have elapsed since the House of Commons became the most powerful body in the State, her immense and still growing prosperity, her freedom, her tranquillity, her greatness in arts, in sciences, and in arms ; her maritime ascendancy, the marvels of her public credit, her American, her African, her Australian, her Asiatic empires, sufficiently prove the exceUence of her institutions. But those institutions, though excellent, are assuredly not perfect. Parlia mentary government is government by speaking. In such a government, the power of speaking is the most highly prized of all the qualities which a politician can possess ; and that power may exist in the highest degree without judgment, without fortitude, without skiU in reading the characters of men or the signs of the times, without any knowledge of the principles of legislation or of political economy, and without any skill in diplomacy or in the administration of war. Nay, it may well happen that those very intellectual qualities which give a peculiar charm to the speeches of a public man may be incompatible with the qualities which would fit him to meet a pressing emergency with promptitude and firm ness. It was thus with Charles Townshend. It was thus with Wiudliam. It was a privilege to listen to those accomplished and ingenious orators. But in a perilous crisis they would be found far inferior in aU the quali ties of rulers to such a man as Oliver CromweU, who talked nonsense, or as WiUiam the Silent, who did not talk at aU.\" EDWARD BULWER, LORD LYTTON. (1805\u20141873.) Early Appearance as a Reformer. \u2014 Mr. E. Bulwer (afterwards Lord Lytton) first sat in Parliament as the representative of St. Ives, for which constituency he was returned in 1831 ; and he addressed the House on tho 5th of July, on the second reading of the Reform BUI. Ou that occasion he thus expressed himself on behalf of a popular representation : \" At a time when authority can no longer support itself by the solemn plausibilities and the ceremonial hypocrisies of old, it was well that a government should be placed upon a solid and sure foundation. In no age of tho world, but least of aU in the present, could any system of government long exist which was menaced both by the moral intelligence and the physical force of a country.\" v"], [326, "306 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Democracy. \u2014 Speaking on the Reform BiU introduced by Lord Palmerston's Government in 1860, Sir E. Bulwer Lytton said: \"Pure democracy, in the classic sense of the word, has conferred on the civilised world too many benefits, as well as warnings, not to have its full share of enthusiastic admirers among men of cultivated minds and generous hearts. But for pure democracy you must have the elements that pre serve its honesty and ensure its duration. Those elements are not to be found in old societies, with vast disparities of wealth, of influence, of education j they belong to the youth of nations, such as colonies ; and when any gentleman cites to us the example of a colony for some demo cratic change that he would recommend to the ancient monarchy of England, I can only say that he has not studied the horn-book of legis lation. The acute democrats of that sublime repubUc by which we are all unconsciously instructed whenever we discuss the problems of govern ment \u2014 the acute democrats of Athens \u2014 were weU aware of the truth I endeavour, before it is yet too late, to impress upon you ; they were well aware that democracy cannot long co-exist with great inequalities of wealth and power ; they therefore began by ostracising the powerful, to end by persecuting the wealthy.\" Another remark by the same speaker will be remembered: \" Democracy is like the grave \u2014 it perpetually criej ' Give, give,' and, like the grave, it never gives back what it receives.\" A Defence of the Crimean War. \u2014 In a speech in favour of the continued prosecution of war with Russia, in June, 1855, Sir E. B. Lytton said : \" Let me suppose that when the future philanthropist shall ask what service on the human race did we in our generation signally confer, some one trained perhaps in the schools of Oxford or the Institute of Man chester shall answer : ' A Power that commanded myriads \u2014 as many as those that under Xerxes exhausted rivers iu their march \u2014 embodied all the forces of barbarism on the outskirts of civilisation. Left there to develop its own natural resources, no State molested, though all appre hended, its growth. But, long pent by merciful Nature in its own legitimate domains, this Power schemed for the outlet to its instinctive ambition ; to that outlet it crept by dissimulating guile \u2014 by successive treaties that, promising peace, graduated spoliation to the opportunities of fraud. At length, under pretexts too gross to deceive the common sense of mankind, it proposed to seize that outlet \u2014 to storm the feeble gates between itself and the world beyond.' Then the historian shaU say that we in our generation \u2014 the united families of England and France \u2014 made ourselves the vanguard of alarmed and shrinking Europe, and did not sheathe the sword until we had redeemed the pledge to humanity, made on the faith of two Christian sovereigns, and ratified at those distant graves which liberty and justice shaU revere for ever.\" Ministerial Coalitions. \u2014 In a speech on Mr. Roebuck's celebrated motion in January, 1855, for a select committee to inquire into the conduct of the Crimean War, Sir E. B. Lytton made a very effective remark on this subject. He said : \" Looking through our modem history, I find that most of our powerful, even popular Administrations, have been coalitions. Both the Administrations of Mr. Pitt were coalitions ; and the"], [327, "EDWARD GEOFFREY, EARL OF DERBY. 307 last was very remarkable, for he first turned out the Addington Govern ment, and then coalesced with six of its members. Nay, he was not contented tiU he had netted the expelled Prime Minister himself, and made him Lord President of the Councd. But then there is one indis putable element of a coalition, and that is, that its members should coalesce. Now, sir, it is that element which seems to me wanting in the present Cabinet (Lord Aberdeen's). It has been a union of party interests, but not a coalition of party sentiment and feeling.\" EDWARD GEOFFREY, EARL OF DERBY. (1799\u20141869.) His Manner. \u2014 \"Gladstone's manner,\" says Professor Pryme, \"I never saw exceUed except by Lord Derby's, when he was in the House of Commons. The speaking of these two was like a stream pouring forth ; or it might be described as if they were reading from a book. I have heard Pitt, Fox, and other great speakers, but never any to equal Lord Derby, when Mr. Stanley, for elegance and sweetness of expression.\" His First Speech. \u2014 Mr. Stanley was three years in the House of Commons before he took part in its debates. His first speech was made in 1824, upon a bill for lighting Manchester with gas. Sir James Mackin tosh, who spoke after him, very highly complimented the young member on his performance, and said, \" No man could have witnessed with greater satisfaction than himself an accession to the talents of the House which was calculated to give lustre to its character and strengthen its influence ; and this was more particularly a subject of satisfaction to him when he reflected that these talents were likely to be employed in supporting prin ciples which he conscientiously believed to be most beneficial to the country.\" Mr. Stanley in the earlier portion of his career was identified with the Whig party. Parliamentary Instinct. \u2014 Macaulay, in his essay on Chatham, thus alludes to the readiness in debate which Mr. Stanley manifested from the first : \" Scarcely any person his ever become a great debater without long practice and many failures. It was by slow degrees, as Burke said, that Charles Fox became the most brilliant and powerful debater that ever lived. Charles Fox himself attributed his own success to the resolution which he formed when very young, of speaking, well or ill, at least once every night. ' During five whole sessions,' he used to say, ' I spoke every night but one, and I regret only that I did not speak on that night too.' Indeed, with the exception of Mr. Stanley, whose knowledge of tho science of parliamentary defence resembles an instinct, it would bo difficult to name any eminent debater who has not made himself a master of his art at the expense of his audience.\" Raising a Storm. \u2014 The Coercion Bill, introduced when Mr. Stanley was Secretary for Ireland, gave occasion for one of the most effective displays of his eloquence. The incident is thus narrated by Earl RusseU : \" It was thought right that Lord Althorp, as the leader of the Govern ment in the House of Commons, should bring in the biU. He did so in a manner tame and ineffective. His detail of tho outrages committed in x2"], [328, "308 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Ireland was like reading a few of the blackest pages of the ' Newgate- Calendar.' The Liberal majority were disappointed, sullen, and re.idy to break out into mutiny against their chief. Mr. Stanley, who was sitting next to me, greatly annoyed at the aspect of the House, said to me, ' I meant not to have spoken tiU to-morrow night, but I find I must speak to-night.' He took Lord Althorp's box of official papers, and went upstairs to a room where he could look over them quietly. After the debate had proceeded for two or three hours longer, with no change of temper in the House, Mr. Stanley rose. He explained, with admirable clearness, the insecure and alarming state of Ireland. He then went over, case by case, the more dreadful of the outrages which had been committed. He detailed, with striking effect, the circumstances attending the murder of a clergyman and the agony of his widow, who, after seeing her husband murdered, had to bear in terror running knocks at the door, kept on aU night by the miscreants who had committed the crime. Tho House became appaUed and agitated at the dreadful picture which he placed before their eyes ; they felt for the sorrows of the innocent ; they were shocked at the dominion of assassins and robbers. When he had produced a thriUing effect by these descriptions, he turned upon O'ConneU, who led the opposition to the measure, and who seemed a short time before about to achieve a triumph in favour of sedition and anarchy. Ho recaUed to the recollection of the House of Commons that, at a recent public meeting', O'ConneU had spoken of the House of Commons as 658 scoundrels. In a tempest of scorn and indignation, he excited the anger of the men thus designated against the author of the calumny. The House, which two hours before seemed about to yield to the great agitator, was now almost ready to tear him to pieces. In the midst of the storm which his eloquence had raised, Stanley sat down, having achieved one of the greatest triumphs of eloquence ever won in a popular assembly by the powers of oratory.\" An Effective Quotation. \u2014 The powers of elocution which Mr. Stanley exercised in the Commons, before he was transplanted to tho Lords as Lord Stanley (his father's second title), are shown by an inci dent which occurred in connection with O'ConneU, a few years later than the scene just mentioned. For any speaker to give the House of Commons twenty lines of Shakespeare, not only without exciting its murmurs or contempt, but with great effect, was an achievement possible only to such a speaker as Stanley himself. The circumstances under which the inci dent occurred are thus described by Mr. Lecky : \" When Lord Melbourne came into power, O'ConneU gave his Ministry the whole weight of his support. His opponents Lord Grey and Mr. Stanley were no longer in the Ministry. . . The Melbourne Ministry exhibited the rare spectacle of a government opposed by the majority of the English members in the House of Commons, and by the great majority of the House of Lords, and at the same time unpopular with the country, but kept in power by the votes of tho Irish members. O'ConneU supported it very loyaUy, and, although in his position there was perhaps no great merit in not being a place-hunter, it is worthy of notice how cheerfuUy he acquiesced in his exclusion from"], [329, "EDWARD GEOFFREY, EARL OF DERBY. 309 Ministry of which he was for some time the mainstay. On questions of persons and offices the Ministers found him uniformly moderate and con cUiatory, and in this respect his attitude formed a marked contrast to that of Lord Brougham. In 1838 he refused one of the highest legal positions in Ireland \u2014 that of Chief Baron. The Repeal cry at this time was suffered to sink, and in Ireland as in England O'ConneU steadily and powerfully supported the Ministry. There can, however, be no question that his support was ultimately a source of weakness. . . It would have been impossible to give O'ConneU a place in it without shattering it, and there was no taunt against Ministers more applauded than their aUeged subserviency to the agitator. The House of Commons seldom rang with more enthusiastic plaudits than when Mr. Stanley, in one of his attacks npon the Government, quoted these lines from Shakespeare : \u2014 ' But Bhall it be that yon, that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man, And for his sake wear the detested blot Of murderous subornation \u2014 shall it be That you a world of curses undergo, Being the agents, or base second means, The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather ? 0, pardon me that I descend so low To show the line and the predicament Wherein you range under this subtle king. Shall it for shame be spoken in these days, Or 611 up chronicles in time to come, That men of your nobility and power Did 'gage them both in an unjust behalf, As both of you \u2014 God pardon it ! \u2014 have done ? . And shall it be, in more shame, further spoken, That you are fooled, discarded, and shook off By him for whom these shames ye underwent '(' \" A Slip. \u2014 We remember (says the writer of a biographical notice of Lord Derby) to have heard Lord Macaulay say that no one ever attempted to catch Lord Stanley tripping, and to interrupt him in his speech, without coming by the worst in the encounter. He might weU say so, for he was himself an example of the truth of his words. On one occasion, in the full rush and torrent of his eloquence, Lord Stanley used the expression \" mutually suicidal.\" It was, perhaps, not strictly defensible, and the slip was too much for the \" book in breeches,\" who was then sitting on the front bench in opposition, to pass over. Half rising from his seat, and removing his hat with weU-affected courtesy, he repeated the words in an inquiring tone, \" Mutually suicidal ? \" Lord Stanley checked himself for an instant, looked his antagonist full in the face, and, without attempting to justify the expression, contemptuously replied, *' The right honourable gentleman is a great verbal critic.\" The cheers of the House showed the retort had told. \" The Rupert of Debate.\" \u2014 This well-known epithet was appUed"], [330, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 310 to Lord Stanley by Sir E. B. Lytton in his poem, \" The New Timon.\" The> following is the passage in which it occurs : \u2014 \" The brilliant chief, irregularly great, Frank, haughty, rash, the Rupert of Debate. Nor gout nor toil his freshness can destroy, And time still leaves all Eton in the boy. First in the class, and keenest in the ring, He saps like Gladstone, and he fights like Spring. Ev'n at the feast his pluck pervades the board, And dauntless game-cocks symbolise their lord. Lo where atilt at friend \u2014 if barr'd from foe \u2014 He scours the ground and volunteers the blow, And, tired with conquest over Dan and Snob, Plants a sbght bruiser on the nose of Bob. Decorous Bob, too friendly to reprove, Suggests fresh fighting in the next remove, And prompts his chum, in hopes the vein to cool, To the prim benches of the Upper School. \" Yet who not listens with delighted smile To the pure Saxon of that silver style ? In the clear style a heart as clear is seen, Prompt to the rash \u2014 revolting from the mean.\" Mr. Disraeli, however, appears to have originated the expression. \" The New Timon\" was first published in 1846; but in April, 1844, Mr. Disraeli thus alluded to Lord Stanley in a discussion on some charges brought by Mr. Ferrand against Sir James Graham : \" The noble lord in this case, as in so many others, first destroys his opponent, and then destroys his own position afterwards. The noble lord is the Prince Rupert of Par liamentary discussion ; his charge is resistless ; but when he returns from the pursuit he always finds his camp in the possession of the enemy.\" Notwithstanding this reputation for dash and vigour, Lord Malmesbury mentions that the great debater was \" very nervous before making a prepared speech.\" Jokes on a Critical Occasion. \u2014 The resignation of Peel's Ministry early in December, 1845, in consequence of Cabinet disagree ments as to what should be done concerning the Corn Laws, was kept entirely secret ; and the most contradictory reports as to ministerial intentions in the forthcoming session were afloat in the press \u2014 reports equally well authorised, according as information had been received from one or other of the two sections into which the existing Cabinet was divided. Mr. GreviUe, clerk to the Conned, writes in his \" Journal,\" under date Thursday, Dec. 11 : \" Yesterday morning we went down to the CouncU at Osborne. . . I never saw the Cabinet in such a state of hdarity. Peel was full of jokes and stories, and they all were as merry (apparently and probably reaUy) as men could be. . . When we returned from Osborne, I had no idea the Ministers had already resigned some days before, for they none of them took leave, and Peel and Aberdeen only had audiences. Not one of them hinted to me what was"], [331, "EDWARD GEOFFREY, EARL OF DERBY. 311 going on, and the only thing said about it was a joke of Stanley's, who said to a bishop, who was of the party, that the right reverend prelate had probably often seen as much patience, but never could have seen so much resignation.\" The Statesman at Newmarket. \u2014 Mr. GrevUle wrote, April 10, 1851 : \" At Newmarket on Sunday, and returned yesterday. It was worth while to be there to see Stanley. A few weeks ago he was on the point of being Prime Minister, which only depended on himself. Then he stood up in the House of Lords, and delivered an oration full of gravity and dignity, such as became the man who had just undertaken to form an Administration. A few days ago he was feasted in Merchant Taylors' Hall, amidst a vast assembly of lords and commoners, who aU acknow ledged him as their chief. He was complimented amidst thunders of applause upon his great and statesmaulike qualities, and he again delivered an oration, serious as befitted the lofty capacity in which he there appeared. If any of his vociferous disciples and admirers, if some grave members of either House of Parliament, or any distinguished foreigner who knew nothing of Lord Stanley but what he saw, heard, or read of him, could have suddenly found themselves in the betting room at Newmarket on Tuesday evening and seen Stanley there, I think they would have been in a pretty state of astonishment. There he was in the midst of a crowd of blacklegs, betting men, and loose characters of every description, chaffing, rowing, and shouting with laughter and joking. His amusement was to lay Lord Glasgow a wager that he did not sneeze in a given time, for which purpose he took pinch after pinch of snuff. whUe Stanley jeered him aud quizzed him with such noise, that he drew the whole mob around him to partake of the coarse merriment he excited. It really was a sight and a wonder to see any man playing such different parts ; and I don't suppose there is any other man who would act so naturally, and obey all bis impulses in such a way, utterly regardless of appearances, and not caring what anybody might think of the Minister and the statesman so long as he could have his fun.\" A New Crop of Statesmen.\u2014 Shortly after the formation of his first Ministry, in 1852, Lord Derby and the rest of the members of the Government were entertained by the Goldsmiths' Company. Alluding in his speech to tho efforts he had made to foim a Cabinet, he illus trated them by a reference to the recent gold discoveries, and said : \" It was supposed that the crop of statesmen was one of very limited amount, for which, if you were disposed to search, you must dig in certain favoured localities, and confine yourself to searching for them there. I am happy to think, gentlemen, that to some extent I have been instrumental in dispelling that illusion. A fortunate adven turer, I have boldly opened a new mine, and I am happy to say that in the opinion of competent judges, so far as it has been yet worked, the ore that has been raised contains among it as large a proportion of sterling metal, with as little admixture of dross, as any that was ever drawn from the old and exclusive mines to which we were formerly confiued.\""], [332, "312 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. A Fresh \"Team.\"\u2014 Lord Malmesbury, Foreign Secretary in Lord Derby's first Ministry, made the foUowing entry in his diary : \" March 6th (1852). \u2014 Dined at Northumberland House ; met a large party, including almost all the Cabinet. Lord Derby said to my wife, 'I have been driving a team of young horses this morning ; not one had ever been in harness before, and they went beautifully; not one kicked amongst them.' \" A Candid Confession. \u2014 Writing to Lord Derby (then Prime Minister) in 1858, the Prince Consort informed him incidentally that Prince Alfred had just passed his examination as a naval cadet and received his appointment, and said : \" I send you Prince Alfred's exami nation papers, which may, perhaps, interest you. He solved the mathe matical problems almost all without fault, and did the translations without a dictionary.\" In his reply, after thanking the Prince for sending him the papers, Lord Derby wrote : \" As I looked over them, I could not but feel very grateful that no such examination was necessary to qualify her Majesty's Ministers for their offices, as it would very seriously increase the difficulty of framing an administration.\" A Real Man. \u2014 Mr. Kebbel relates, as regards Lord Derby's newly formed Ministry of untried men, that he would allow no one to chaff them but himself ; and once, when a well-known marchioness, a very clever and very bitter politician, tried it on with him, she received an answer which silenced her curiosity pretty promptly. \" Come now, Lord Derby,\" she said, \"who are aU these people you have got round you? Who are so and-so, and so-and-so ? What is so-and-so ? Is he a real man, or only a puppet ? \" \" As to whether he is a real man or not,\" said Lord Derby, \"I can only assure your ladyship that he has had three wives, and \" Her ladyship did not wait to hear the rest. Uncomplimentary Epithets.\u2014 The conjunction of Lord Derby with Mr. Disraeli in carrying on a Ministry was frequently aUuded to in very uncomplimentary terms. Lord Aberdeen mentioned to Bishop Wilberforce that Lord John Russell \" said of the present Government (1858) about Reform, 'What can we look for from the Jockey and the Jew ? ' \" (aUuding to Lord Derby's racing proclivities, and to Mr. Disraeli's descent). Mr. Disraeli, when he succeeded to the conduct of affairs, was no less the object of depreciatory allusion. Bishop Wilber force records the sarcastic remark of Lord Chehnsford, who had been removed from the Lord Chancellorship by the new premier : \" The old Government, the Derby ; this, the Hoax.\" The Democratic Tide. \u2014 It was often imputed to the Earl of Derby that he had said he considered it his mission to \" stem the tide of democracy.\" The exact phrase did not proceed from his own mouth, but was founded on a passage in a speech he delivered on the 15th of March, 1852. Replying to a question from Lord Beaumont as to the intentions of the new Government with respect to duties on corn, Earl Derby said : \" We are threatened with far more serious consequences than could result from the imposition of a 4s., 5s., or 7s. duty on foreign corn. The question before us is, whether the Government of this country can"], [333, "EDWARD GEOFFREY, EARL OF DERBY. 313 he carried on, and as to the principles on which it is to be carried on. And when I appeal to the country it will be on these grounds : WUl you, Protectionists and Free Traders, aU you who desire the advan tage of all the interests of the country, place your confidence in, and give your support to, a Government which, in the hour of perU, did not hesitate to take the post of danger when the helmsman had left the helm ? Will you support a Government which is exerting itself to protect the country against any hostile attack, to maintain the peace of the world, to maintain and uphold the Protestant institutions of the country, to give, to the utmost of its power, religious and moral education throughout the land, and which wiU exert itself moreover, I don't hesitate to say, to stem with some opposition, to supply some barrier against the current of that continuaUy increasing and encroaching democratic influence in this nation, which is bent on throwing the whole power and authority of the Govern ment nominally into the hands of the masses, but practically and reaUy into those of demagogues and republicans, who exercise an influence over those unthinking masses \u2014 will you, I say, support a Government which is determined to resist that noxious and dangerous influence, and to preserve inviolate the prerogatives of the Crown, the rights of your lordships' House, and tbe liberties of a freely-elected and freely-represented House of Commons p These, my lords, are the questions on which, when I go to the country, I make my appeal, on behalf of myself and my colleagues; and, in the words which are placed in the mouths of the meanest felons that stand in the prisoners' dock, but which are not unworthy of the mouth of the first minister of the first country in the world, I say, ' I elect that we shall be tried by God and onr country.'\" \u2014 (Hansard's Report.) It appears, however, that in a letter to Mr. Croker dated March, 1851, Lord Stanley (as he was at that rime) had used the expression referred to. He thus wrote in allusion to the possibility of his forming a Government, and its chances of success: \" With temper and moderation I believe wo may succeed in stemming the Democratic tide which has been flowing of late with formidable rapidity.\" \" One Thing at a Time.\" \u2014 Lord Malmesbury writes, under date April 27, 1855 : \" Lord Derby returned to-day from Newmarket, so fuU of his racing that he could think and talk of nothing else, and knew nothing of last week's events ; and when I alluded to onr propositions at the Vienna Conference having been rejected by Russia, asked, ' What propositions ? ' \u2014 evidently not having looked at a newspaper for the whole week. Such is the character of this remarkable man, who has the habit and power of concentrating his whole mind upon the subject which occupies him at the moment, and dismissing it totally, with equal facility. He is very fond of using the expression, ' One thing at a time.' \" Rival Ministers and \" Bad Company.\"\u2014 Here is another entry from Lord Malmesbury's diary : \" June 28, 1861.\u2014 Concert at Buckingham Palace. Whilst we were waiting for our carriage, to go away, Lord Derby joined us, and immediately after Lord John RusseU came up. Lord Derby exclaimed, ' How do you do, Lord John ? You have got into very bad company.' He looked round at us all with a grim smile, and said, ' I see"], [334, "314 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. I have ; ' when Lord Derby, looking at him attentively, observed that he was incorrectly dressed, having his levee uniform instead of the fuU dress which he ought to have worn. Lord John said, ' I know I am wrong, and the porter wanted to turn me out.' ' Oh, did he P ' exclaimed Lord Derby. ' Thou canst not say /did it.' Of course aU those round laughed at this apt quotation from Shakespeare, and no one more than Lord John himself.\" \"Meddle and Muddle.\" \u2014 Lord Derby made use of this expression in February, 1864, to characterise the policy then being pursued by Earl RusseU as Foreign Minister : \" The foreign policy of the noble earl (said he), as far as the principle of non-intervention is concerned, may be summed up in two truly expressive words \u2014 ' meddle ' and ' muddle.' During the whole course of his diplomatic correspondence, wherever he has interfered \u2014 and he has interfered everywhere \u2014 he has been lecturing, scolding, blustering, and \u2014 retreating.\" A Shot at Palmerston. \u2014 A shot at another (and greater) Foreign Minister also deserves mention. Lord Malmesbury notes in his \"Memoirs,\" under date Feb. 4, 1851: \"Parliament opened, and Lord Effingham moved the address in the House of Lords. Lord Stanley spoke well, as usual, and raised a great laugh by saying, in aUusion to the restoration of tranquillity in Europe, that the increased tranquillity in Europe was to be attributed to the increased inactivity of the Foreign Secretary \" (Lord Palmerston). The \"Leap in the Dark.\" \u2014 On the third reading of the Reform BiU in the House of Lords, August 6th, 1867, the Earl of Derby said, with reference to a remark made by Lord Cranbome in the Commons : \" No doubt we are making a great experiment and ' taking a leap in the dark,' but I have the greatest confidence in the sound sense of my feUow countrymen, and I entertain a strong hope that the extended franchise which we are now conferring upon them wiU be the means of placing the institutions of this country on a firmer basis, and that the passing of the measure will tend to increase the loyalty and contentment of a great portion of her Majesty's subjects.\" \" Dishing the Whigs.\" \u2014 Lord Derby's style was always dignified in debate, but in conversation with his coUeagues he was often extremely colloquial and idiomatic. An example has been given in his brief remark to Sir James Graham on the downfaU of the Grey Ministry, \" Johnny's upset the coach.\" Another famous saying must be instanced. Replying to an old associate who thought the Reform Bill of the Derby-Disraeli Cabinet had gone too far in a popular direction, the Earl of Derby is said to have contented himself with the remark, \" We have dished the Whigs !\" as a complete justification of his poUcy. BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSF1ELD. (1804\u20141881.) His Early Candidatures.\u2014 The future leader of the Conservative party first became a candidate for Parliament under Radical auspices,"], [335, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 315 presenting himself at High Wycombe in 1832, with recommendations from Hume and O'ConneU. Being repeatedly unsuccessful here, in 1835 he offered himself for Taunton, and on this occasion spoke against O'ConneU. The latter shortly after made a characteristic reply, in which he declared of his opponent that \" he possesses just the qualities of the impenitent thief who died upon the cross, whose name, I verily beUeve, must have been Disraeli.\" Smarting under this onslaught, Mr. Disraeli challenged the son of the Irish demagogue to perform \" the vicarious duty of yielding satisfaction for the insults which your father has too long lavished with impunity on his political opponents ; \" for O'ConneU, after his fatal combat with D'Esterre (p. 270), had vowed not to fight a duel again. Mr. Morgan O'ConneU on a similar occasion had offered to meet Lord Alvanley, but he now declined : and Mr. Disraeli thereupon wrote to the father a letter in which he said, \" With regard to your taunts as to my want of success in election contests, permit me to remind you that I had nothing to appeal to but the good sense of the people. No threaten ing skeletons canvassed for me ; \" with more to the same effect, concluding with the words, \" We shall meet at Philippi.\" Self Confidence. \u2014 Disraeli wrote to his sister, Feb. 7, 1833 : \" Was at the Hou.se of Commons yesterday during the whole debate \u2014 one of the finest we have had for years. . . Macaulay admirable; but, between ourselves, I could floor them aU. This entre nous : I was never more confident of anything than that I could carry everything before me in that House. The time will come.\" Melbourne and Disraeli.\u2014 Mr. Hayward, in reviewing Mr. Torrens' life of Lord Melbourne, gave the following as his recollection of a conversation which was much exaggerated by the biographer : \" Many years since, a right honourable gentleman, who now holds a conspicuous position before the world, had recently returned from the East, when he was asked to dinner to meet Lord Melbourne, who good-naturedly turned the conversation on the manners and customs of tho countries recently visited by this gentleman. ' Your lordship,' he remarked, ' appears to have derived all your notions of Oriental manners from the \"Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\" ' ' And a devilish good place to get them from,' rejoined Lord Melbourne, rubbing his hands and laughing. . As the conversation proceeded, the gentleman, in a semi-serious tone, or in the proud consciousness of latent power which he afterwards expressed on a memorable occasion in the House of Commons, said that what he looked forward to was the Premiership. ' And I wish you may get it,' quietly observed Lord Melbourne. This is the sole foundation of the dialogue which Mr. Torrens reports in such detail.\" His First Appearance in Parliament.\u2014 Mr. Disraeli was first returned in 1837, as representative of Maidstone, and delivered his maiden speech on the 7th of December in that year, on Irish election petitions. He was heard with continual interruptions, but concluded with a prophecy which has become famous. The foUowing was his peroration, as given in \" Hansard \" : \" Nothing was so easy as to laugh. He wished before he sat down to show the House clearly their position. When they"], [336, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 316 remembered that, in spite of the support of the honourable and learned member for Dublin (Mr. O'ConneU) and his weU-disciplined band of patriots, there was a little shyness exhibited by former supporters of her Majesty's Government\u2014 when they recollected the ' new loves ' and the ' old loves ' in which so much of passion and recrimination was mixed up between the noble Tityrus of the Treasury bench and the learned Daphne of Liskeard (loud laughter) \u2014 notwithstanding the amantium ir\u00e6 had resulted, as he had always expected, in the amoris integratio (renewed laughter)\u2014 notwithstanding that a poUtical duel had been fought, in which more than one shot was interchanged, but in which recourse was had to the secure arbitrament of blank cartridges (laughter) \u2014 notwith standing emancipated Ireland and enslaved England, the noble lord might wave in one hand the keys of St. Peter, and in the other \u2014 (the shouts that foUowed drowned the conclusion of the sentence). ' Let them see the philosophical prejudice of man.' He would certainly gladly hear a cheer, even though it came from the Ups of a poUtical opponent. He was not at aU surprised at the reception which he had experienced. He had begun several times many things, and he had often succeeded at last. He would sit down now, but the time would come when they would hear him.\" \u2014 Respecting this apparent failure he wrote to his sister : \" Tho Attorney-General [Sir John CampbeU], to whom I never spoke in my Use, came up to me in the lobby anst spoke to me with great cordiality. He said, ' Now, Mr. Disraeli, could you just tell me how you finished one sentence in your speech ? \u2014 we are anxious to know. \" In one hand the keys of St. Peter, and in the other '\"?' 'In the other the cap of liberty, Sir John.' He smiled, and said, ' A good picture.' I replied, ' But your friends wiU not allow me to finish my pictures.' ' I assure you,' he said, ' there was the liveliest desire to hear you from us. It was a party at the bar, over whom we had no control. But you have nothing to be afraid of.' \" A week after, he spoke a few sentences on the Copy right BiU, and he addressed the House several times in the foUowing session. An Early Passage with Palmerston. \u2014 Mr. Disraeli stood for Shrewsbury in 1841 as an ardent supporter of Sir Robert Peel, and on his election wrote to inform the Conservative leader that \" the electors of Shrewsbury had done their duty.\" Shortly after Sir Robert acceded to power, and the fact that the honourable gentleman received no appoint ment in his Government was aUuded to in the foUowing session by Lord Palmerston. Mr. Disraeli had brought forward a motion (March 8, 1842) in favour of blending the consular with the diplomatic body, and on cer tain portions of bis speech Lord Palmerston made the foUowing remarks : \" Tho honourable gentleman had indeed affirmed the general principle that political adherents ought to be rewarded by appointments, and he regretted to observe an exception to that rule in the person of the honourable gentle man himself. After the proof, however, of talent and ability which the honourable gentleman afforded, although not perhaps of great industry in getting up the details of his case, he trusted that before the end of the .session the Government would overlook tbe slight want of industry for"], [337, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 317 the sake of the talent, and that the House would see the maxim of the honourable member practicaUy applied to his own case.\" To this Mr. Disraeli rejoined: \"He must offer his acknowledgments to the noble viscount for his courteous aspirations for his political promotion. Such aspirations from such a quarter must be looked upon as suspicious. The noble viscount was a consummate master of the subject, and if the noble viscount woidd only impart to him the secret by which he had himself contrived to retain office during seven successive Administrations, the present debate would certainly not be without a result.\" The \"Young England\" Party.\u2014 About the year 184.3, this name became applied to a knot of young politicians in the House of Commons, of whom Mr. DisraeU was the most conspicuous. In his \" Coningsby \" the ideas of the party were supposed to be unfolded ; and another of its prominent members, Lord John Manners, published a volume of poems, (\" England's Trust,\" &c), one couplet in which has become famous : \" Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die, But leave us still our old nobility ! \" The talented George Smythe, afterwards Lord Strangford, was also a member of this school of advanced, or, as many thought, retrograde politicians. Its members affected a spice of dandyism, of which the wearing of white waistcoats in the House was one of the peculiar signs. Mr. Henry Drummond once aUuded to the group as \" the members with sparkling eyes and white waistcoats.\" The Thong of the Whip. \u2014 The House of Commons having beeu caUed upon by Sir Robert Peel to rescind a recent vote on the sugar duties, after a similar demand had been made upon it during the same session, Mr. Disraeli thus reflected upon the treatment by Sir Robert Peel of the majority at his back : \" I remember in 1841 the right honourable baronet said, ' I have never joined in the anti-slavery cry, and now I will not join in the cry of cheap sugar.' Two years have elapsed, and the right honourable gentleman has joined in the anti-slavery cry, and has adopted the cry of cheap sugar. But it seems that the right honourable baronet's horror of slavery extends to every place except the benches behind him. There the gang is still assembled, and there the thong of the whip still sounds. Whatever maybe the anti-slavery repugnance of the right honourable gentleman, his distaste would seem not to extend to this House. If the whip were more sparing here, his conduct would be more consistent with his professions.\" The Whigs caught Bathing. \u2014 It was in a debate on the opening of letters at the Post Office, in 1845, that Mr. Disraeli used this celebrated illustration of the tactics of Sir Robert Peel. He said, \"I know there are some who think that he is looking out for new allies. I never believed anything of the kind. The position of the right honourable gentleman is clear and precise. I do not believe he is looking to any coalition, although many of my constituents do. The right honourable gentleman has only exactly to remain where he is. The rigid honourable gentleman caught the Whigs bathing, and walked away with their clothes."], [338, "318 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. He has left them in the full enjoyment of their liberal position, and he is himself a strict conservative of their garments.\" The \" Organised Hypocrisy.\"\u2014 In a debate on \" the agricultural interest, March 17, 1846, Mr. Disraeli thus closed a powerful speech : \" Protection appears to be in about the same condition that Protestantism was in 1828. For my part, if we are to have free trade, I, who honour genius, prefer that such measures should be proposed by the honourable member for Stockport (Mr. Cobden), than by one who, through skilful parliamentary man\u0153uvres, has tampered with the generous confidence of a great people and of a great party. For myself, I care not what may be the result. Dissolve, if you please, the Parliament you have betrayed, and appeal to the people, who, I believe, mistrust you. For me there remains this at least \u2014 the opportunity of expressing thus publicly my belief that a Conservative Government is an Organised Hypocrisy.\" \u2014 The last two words are printed with capital letters in \" Hansard's Debates,\" which are professedly revised by the speakers themselves. \" Tea-Kettle Precedents.\" \u2014 When Sir Robert Peel introduced the bdl for the increased grant to Maynooth, he rested his arguments (says Francis) less upon any broad scheme of policy which might have compromised him directly with powerful parties, than upon the fact that the principle had been sanctioned, though obscurely, by parliamentary authority. This gave occasion to Mr. Disraeli to make a hit at the Premier, which was at once humorous and true. He said that with him great measures were always rested on small precedents ; that he always traced the steam-engine back to the tea-kettle ; that, in fact, all his precedents were \" tea-kettle precedents.\" A Parliamentary Middleman. \u2014 \" The Dunciad of Politics.\" \u2014 In a debate on the Maynooth grant, Mr. Disraeli applied the first-named epithet to Sir R. Peel. He said : \" Something has risen up in this country as fatal in the poUtical world as it has been in the landed world of Ireland \u2014 we have a great Parliamentary middleman. It is well known what a middleman is ; he is a man who bamboozles one party and plunders the other, till, having obtained a position to which he is not entitled, he cries out, ' Let us have no party questions, but fixity of tenure.' . . I hope I shall not be answered by ' Hansard.' I am not surprised that the right honourable gentleman should be so fond of recurring to that great authority; he has great advantages ; he can look over a record of thirty, aud more than thirty, years of an eminent career. But that is not the lot of every one ; and I may say as a general rule I am rather surprised that your experienced statesmen should be so fond of recurring to that eminent publication. What, after all, do they see on looking over a quarter of a century, or more even, of their speeches in 'Hansard?' What dreary pages of interminable talk, what predictions falsified, what pledges broken, what calculations that have gone wrong, what budgets that have blown up ! And aU this, too, not reUeved by a single original thought, or a single generous impidse, or a single happy expression ! Why, ' Hansard,'. instead of being the Delphi of Downing-street, is but the Dunciad of Politics.\""], [339, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 319 Leading up to his Point. \u2014 Mr. Disraeli's art in this is Ulustrated in the following, from Maddyn's \" Chiefs of Parties \" : On one occasion, while Mr. Disraeli was playing the part of Junius on his legs, he convulsed the House of Commons while Sir Robert Peel winced under the torturing sarcasm. \"Honourable gentlemen think that the conduct of the right honourable baronet is not guided by principle, and that it is extremely difficult to interpret his speeches or to understand his policy. I differ from that view. To me it seems that nothing can be more plain, or less unreserved, or more entirely straightforward than the right honourable baronet in his public course.\" (Looks of surprise from aU sides.) \" I say that he has a perfectly frank mode of treating questions.\" (Increased surprise.) \" I will give an infallible mode of deciphering him, when he is in his most tortuous mood of mind. If you want to know how the right honourable gentleman wiU ultimately act upon any distorted question in poUtics, aU you have to do is \" \u2014 (a long pause, and, amid a hushed expecta tion of the point, the accomplished political archer, with serene irony of couutenance, launched his shaft) \u2014 \" to look to the last state of the poll.\" \" Candid Friends.\" \u2014 One of the sharpest of the passages between Mr. Disraeli and Sir Robert Peel was the following. Mr. Disraeli had made an attack on the Minister in the debate on opening letters in the Post Office, Feb. 20, 1845, and to this Sir Robert, on the foUowing night, thus replied : \" Notwithstanding the provocation of the honourable gentle man, I will not deal so harshly with him as he has dealt with me. He undertakes to assure the House that my vehemence was all pretended, and warmth aU simulated. I, on the contrary, wiU do him entire justice ; I do believe that his bitterness was not simidated, but that it was entirely sincere. . . The honourable gentleman is at perfect liberty to give a direct support to a hostile motion ; but all I ask is, that when he gives that support to the motion, let him not say that he does it in a friendly spirit. ' Give me the avowed, erect, and manly foe ; Firm I can meet, perhaps can turn the blow ; But of all plagues, good Heaven, thy wrath can send, Save me, O save me, from a candid friend.' Here we meet in debate with our opponents opposite. We enter into conflict with them, mutually attacking and repeUing attack adverso f route. When engaged in that conflict, it is certainly not very convenient, though it may be unavoidable, to have a blow aimed at your right flank which you did not expect.\" Mr. Disraeli, a few nights afterwards, thus retorted: \"11 the right honourable gentleman may find it sometimes convenient to reprove a supporter on his right flank, perhaps we deserve it \u2014 I, for one, am quite prepared to bow to the rod ; but reaUy, if the right honourable gentleman, instead of having recourse to obloquy, would only stick to quotation, he may rely on it, it would be a safer weapon. It is one he always wields with the hand of a master : and when he does appeal to any authority, in prose or verse, he is sure to be successful, partly because he seldom quotes a passage that has not previously received the meed of parliamentary approbation, and partly and principaUy because his quotations are so happy."], [340, "320 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. The right honourable gentleman knows what the introduction of a great name does in debate \u2014 how important is its effect, and occasionally how electrical. He never refers to any author who is not great, and sometimes who is not loved \u2014 Canning for example. That is a name never to be mentioned, I am sure, in the House of Commons without emotion. We aU admire his genius ; we aU, at least most of us, deplore his untimely end ; and we aU sympathise with him in his fierce struggle with supreme prejudice and sublime mediocrity \u2014 with inveterate foes and with 'candid friends.' The right honourable gentleman may be sure that a quotation from such an authority wiU always tell. Some lines, for example, upon friendship, written by Mr. Canning, and quoted by the right honourable gentleman ! The theme \u2014 the poet \u2014 the speaker \u2014 what a felicitous com bination ! Its effect in debate must be overwhelming ; and I am sure, were it addressed to me, all that would remain for me would be thus publicly to congratulate the right honourable gentleman, not only on his ready memory, but on his courageous conscience.\" The recoUection of the political relations between Canning and Peel made these sarcasms at the time peculiarly teUing. A Turning Point. \u2014 When Sir Robert Peel indicated his adoption of Free Trade policy, in a debate on the Address on the first night of the session of 1846, the House, although intensely iuterested, did not seem eager to enter then upon a discussion of the subject. \" Suddenly, bow ever \" (writes Mr. Justin M'Carthy), \" a new and striking figure intervened in the languishing debate, and filled the House of Commons with a fresh life. There is not often to be found in our parliamentary history au example like this of a sudden turn given to a whole career by a timely speech. The member who rose to comment on the explanation of Sir Robert Peel had been for many years in the House of Commons. This was his tenth session. He had spoken often in each session. He had made many bold attempts to win a name in Parliament, and hitherto his political career had been simply a failure. From the hour when he spoke this speech, it was one long, unbroken, brilliant success. . . That moment when Disraeli rose was the very turning point of the fortunes of his party. There was genius, there was positive statesmanship in seizing so boldly and so adroitly on the moment. It would have been a great thing gained for Peel if he could have got through that first night without any alarm note of opposition from his own side. The habits of parlia mentary discipline are very clinging. They are hard to tear away. Every impulse of association and training protests against the very effort to rend them asunder. A once powerful minister exercises a control over his long obedient followers somewhat like that of the heart of the Bruce in tho fine old Scottish story. Those who once followed, wUl stUl obey the name and the symbol, even when the actual power to lead is gone for ever. H one other night's habitude had been added to the long discipline that bound his party to Peel; if they had allowed themselves to listen to that declaration of the session's first night without a murmur, perhaps they might never have rebelled. Mr. Disraeli drew together into one focus aU the rays of their gathering anger against Peel, and made them"], [341, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 321 light into a flame. He showed the genius of the born leader by stepping forth at the critical moment and giving the word of command.\" Finding a Parallel. \u2014 A most effective passage in Mr. Disraeli's attack on Sir Robert Peel, in the speech on the Address in 1846, was the foUowing: \" Sir, there is a difficulty in finding a paraUel to the position of the right honourable gentleman in any part of history. The only parallel which I can find is an incident in the late war in the Levant, which was terminated by the policy of the noble lord opposite (Palmer ston). I remember when that great struggle was taking place, when the existence of the Turkish Empire was at stake, the late Sultan, a man of great energy and fertile in resources, was determined to fit out an immense fleet to maintain his empire. Accordingly a vast armament was coUected. It consisted of some of the finest ships that were ever budt. The crews were picked men, tbe officers were the ablest that could be found, and both officers and men were rewarded before they fought. There never was an armament which left the Dardanelles simUarly appointed since the days of Solyman the Great. The Sultan personaUy witnessed the departure of the fleet ; all the muftis prayed for the success of the expedition, as all the muftis here prayed for the success of the last general election. Away went the fleet, but what was the Sultan's con sternation when the Lord High Admiral steered at once into the enemy's port ! Now, Sir, the Lord High Admiral on that occasion was very much misrepresented. He, too, was caUed a traitor, and he, too, vindicated himself. ' True it is,' said he, ' I did place myself at the head of this valiant armada ; true it is that my Sovereign embraced me ; true it is that all the muftis in the empire offered up prayers for my success; but I have an objection to war. I see no use in prolonging the struggle, and the only reason I had for accepting the command was that I might terminate the contest by betraying my master.' And, Sir, these reasons, offered by a man of great plausibility, of vast adroitness, have had their effect, for \u2014 you may be surprised at it, but I assure you it is a fact \u2014 which, by the way, the gallant officer opposite (Commodore Napier) can testify, that he is at this moment the First Lord of the Admiralty at Constantinople, under the new reigu. The gaUant commodore says that he is dead. At any rate, he was not shot for treason.\" \" Political Pedlars.\" \u2014 On the third reading of the Corn Importa tion BiU, May 15, 1846, Mr. Disraeli made a powerful speech against the biU and the Minister who had introduced it, and towards the close declared: \" Even now, in this last scene of the drama, when the party whom he unintentionally betrayed is to be unintentionally annihilated \u2014 even now in this the last scene, the right honourable gentleman, faithful to the law of his being, is going to pass a project which I believe it is matter of notoriety is not of his own invention. It is one which may have been modified, but which I believe has been offered to another Government, and by that Government has been wisely rejected. Why, Sir, these are matters of general notoriety. After the day that the right honourable gentleman made his first exposition of his schemes, a gentleman well known to the House, and learned in all the political secrets behind the Y"], [342, "322 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. scenes, met me and said, ' WeU, what do you think of your chief's plan ? ' Not knowing exactly what to say, but taking up a phrase which has been much used in the House, I observed, ' Well, I suppose it is a great and comprehensive plan.' ' Oh ! ' he replied, ' we know aU about it ; it was offered to us. It is not his plan ; it's Popkins's plan.' And is England to be governed by Popkins's plan ? Will he go to the country with it ? WiU he go with it to that ancient and famous England that once was governed by statesmen \u2014 by Burleighs and by Walsinghams ; by Boling- brokes and by Walpoles ; by a Chatham and a Canning \u2014 wiU he go to it with this fantastic scheming of some presumptuous pedant P I won't believe it; I have that confidence in the common sense, I wiU say the common spirit, of our countrymen, and I believe they wiU not long endure this huckstering tyranny of the Treasury Bench \u2014 those political pedlars that bought their party in the cheapest market and sold us in the dearest.\" What is a Statesman ? \u2014 \" My conception,\" said Mr. Disraeli at this time, \" of a great statesman is of one who represents a great idea \u2014 an idea which may lead him to power \u2014 an idea with which he may identify himself \u2014 an idea which he may develop \u2014 an idea which he may and can impress on the mind and conscience of a nation.\" \u2014 Speech on the Address, Jan. 22, 1846. A Man of the People. \u2014 Mr. Roebuck, in a debate on the Corn Importation BiU in May, 1846, attacked Mr. Disraeli for changing his former political opinions, and the honourable gentleman thus replied : \" It is easy for the honourable and learned gentleman to get up and say, aUuding to the honourable member for Montrose (Mr. Hume) \u2014 for whom I entertain, and I believe we all entertain, great respect \u2014 that I was at one time ready to follow him. Why, suppose it were so, that would be no very serious imputation against me, for the Prime Minister of England has recently given in his adhesion to that honourable member. But I don't wish to avad myself of any special pleading, nor even to say that, when a very young man, I entertained different opinions from those which I now entertain. I can't say that. I am not in a condition to have had here ditary opinions carved out for me, and all my opinions, therefore, have been the result of reading and of thought. I never was a foUower of either of the two great aristocratic parties in this country. My sympathies and feelings have always been with the people, from whom I spring ; and when obliged, as a member of this House, to join a party, I joined that party with which I believed the people sympathise.\" A Gentleman of the Press.\u2014 In February, 1853, Mr. Disraeli addressed the House of Commons on our relations with France, and censured the language recently used by two of the Ministry (Sir J. Graham and Sir C. Wood), in speeches to their constituents, with regard to the despotism of the French Emperor, especially in gagging the press. In the course of his observations, he said : \" There is no doubt that there is a considerable prejudice in this country against the present ruler of France, because he has terminated what we esteem parliamentary consti tution, and has abrogated the liberty of the press. It is unnecessary for me to say that it is not probable I shaU ever say or do anything which"], [343, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 323 \u25a0should tend to depreciate the influence or diminish the power of Parliament or the press. My greatest honour is to be a member of this House, in which all my thoughts and feelings are concentred ; and as for the press, I am myself a ' gentleman of the press,' and have no other scutcheon.\" A Friend's Forecast. \u2014 Lord George Bentinck thus wrote to Mr. Croker in March, 1848 : \" You ask me of Disraeli's manner of speaking and effectiveness in debate. I wiU answer you by giving you my brother Henry's observations on the various speeches in the House. Henry is rather a cynical critic. He expressed himself greatly disappointed with Sir Robert Peel and Lord John RusseU, and concluded by saying that Disraeli was the only man he had heard who at aU came up to his ideas of an orator. His speeches this session have been first rate. . . He cuts Cobden to ribbons ; and Cobden writhes and quaUs under him just as Peel did in 1846. And mark my words : spite of Lord Stanley, Major Beresford, and Mr. PhiUips and the Herald, it wiU cud before two sessions are out in DisraeU being the chosen leader of the party.\" Party Government. \u2014 In a review of the conduct of public business, at the close of the session of 1848, Mr. Disraeli commented severely upon the failure of the Government of Lord John Russell to pass numerous promised measures, notwithstanding a session of un exampled duration (nearly ten months), and in concluding said : \" Sir, I trace aU this evU to the disorganisation of party. I know that there are gentlemen in this Honse who affect to deprecate party government. I am not now going to enter into a discussion respecting party government ; but this I wiU teU you \u2014 as I have told you before, in a manner which has not yet been met by any of the gentlemen who oppose my views on this subject \u2014 that you cannot choose between party government and Parlia mentary government. I say you can have no Parliamentary govern ment if you have no party government ; and therefore, when gentlemen denounce party government, they strike at that scheme of government which, in my opinion, has made this country great, and which, I hope, will keep it great. I can foresee, though I dare not contemplate, the consequences of the system that now prevails. They are weak words that would describe them as prejudicial to the realm, perilous to Parliament, fatal to that high tone of public life that is the best security for national grandeur and public liberty. It is more than this : it is the finis fatorum of the great Dardanian house.\" Union of the Territorial and the Commercial Principles. \u2014The following remarks were made by Mr. Disraeli in moving for a select committee to inquire into the burdens on land (1849): \"Believe me, I speak not as your enemy when I say that it will be an exception to the principles which seem hitherto to have ruled society, if you can succeed in maintaining the success at which you aim, without tho possession of that permanence and stabUity which the territorial principle alone can afford. Although you may for a moment flourish after their destruction\u2014 although your ports may be filled with shipping, your factories smoke on every plain, and your forges flame in every city\u2014 I see no reason why you should form an exception to that which the page of y 2"], [344, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 324 history has mournfully recorded ; that you, too, should not fade like the Tyrian dye, and moulder like the Venetian palaces. But, united with the land, you wiU obtain the best and surest foundation upon which to build your enduring welfare. You wiU find in that interest a counsellor in all your troubles, in danger your undaunted champion, and in adversity your steady customer. It is to assist in producing this result, Sir, that I am about to place these resolutions in your bauds. I wish to see the agri culture, the commerce, and the manufactures of England, not adversaries but co-mates and partners, and rivals only in the ardour of their patriotism, aud in the activity of their public spirit.\" Getting a \" Status.\" \u2014 Lord Stanley's attempt to form a Govern ment in 1851 failed mainly by reason of the reluctance of Mr Henley and Mr. Herries to accept office, their timidity exciting the indignation of Mr. Disraeli, who was eager for the experiment to be made In the foUowing year a Derby-Disraeli Ministry was formed, and Lord Malmesbury noted in his diary: \"Feb. 21, 1852. \u2014 Went to Disraeli's after breakfast, and found him in a state of delight at the idea of coining into office. He said he 'felt just like a young girl going to her first ball,' constantly repeating, ' Now we have got a status.' With aU his apparent apathy when attacked in the House of Commons, he is always, when out of it, iu the highest state of elation or lowest depth of despair, according to the fortune of the day.\" The Ministry of Untried Men. \u2014 In his novel \"Endymion,\" published at the close of the year 1880, after his last retirement from office, Lord Beacousfield gave to the world a curious compound of fact and fiction, in which he introduced the foUowing allusion to the circum stances actually attending the first formation of a Ministry by Lord Derby in 1852, and his own elevation to office : \" The Protectionists were called upon to form an administration. As they had no one in their ranks who had ever been in office except their chief, who was in the House of Lords, the affair seemed impossible. The attempt, however, could not be avoided. A dozen men, without the slightest experience of official life, had to be sworn in as privy councillors, before even they could receive the seals and insignia of their intended offices. On their knees, according to the constitutional custom, a dozen men, all in the act of genuflexion at the same moment, and headed, too, by one of the most powerful peers in the country, the lord of Alnwick Castle himself, humbled themselves before a female Sovereign, who looked serene and imperturbable before a spectacle never seen before, aud which, in all probability, wiU never bo seen again. One of the band, a gentleman without any official experience whatever, was not only placed in the Cabinet, but was absolutely required to become the leader of the House of Commons, which had never occurred before, except in the instance of Mr. Pitt in 1782. It has been said that it was unwise in the Protectionists assuming office when, on this occasion and on subsequent ones, they were far from being certain of a majority in the House of Commons. It should, however, be remembered that unless they had dared these ventures, they never could have formed a body of men competent, from their official experience and their practice in debate,"], [345, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 325 to form a Ministry. The result has rather proved that they were right. Had they continued to refrain from incurring responsibUity, they must have broken up and merged in different connections, which, for a party numericaUy so strong as the Protectionists, would have been a sorry business, and probably have led to disastrous results.\" \" Looming in the Future.\"\u2014 Mr. Disraeli, then ChanceUor of the Exchequer, issued an address to his constituents, the electors of Buck inghamshire, in June, 1852, in which he announced the approaching dissolution of Parliament. Referring to a revision of our taxation, he said : \" The times are favourable to such an undertaking ; juster notions of taxation are more prevalent than heretofore ; powerful agencies are stirring, which have introduced new phenomena into finance, and altered the complexion of the fiscal world ; and the possibility of greatly relieving the burdens of the community, both by adjustment and reduction, seems to loom in the future.\" Ministry upon Sufferance. \u2014 In a speech against the Government of Lord Aberdeen in 1854, Mr. Disraeli charged its members, Lord John RusseU especially, with having offered a factious opposition to the measures of Lord Derby, whde they were now engaged in carrying them out. \" Look,\" said he, \" at the distinguished and gifted beings before me ; what have they done at aU equal to the establishment of the militia on the voluntary principle, or the reform of the Court of Chancery ? Then there was another enlightened and liberal proposition, which laid down the principle since adopted by Lord John Russell in his Reform Bill, that the forfeited seats should be given to great counties, aud they proposed to give them to the West Riding and to Lancashire. How was that opposed ? By the sanctimonious eloquence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gladstone), who said that a Government upon sufferance could not be permitted to bring forward a measure of Parliamentary Reform. I suppose the vision of a perfect Reform Government passed before the prescient and prophetic glance of the right honourable gentle man. Yet what have you got in the way of parliamentary reform from the Government of All the Talents P When we brought forward financial measures and failed, we did that which it was our part to do \u2014 at least when I have the misfortune to propose measures aud fail ; for I will never be a Minister upon sufferance.\" Obstruction and the British Constitution. \u2014 Iu committee of supply in June, 1857, Mr. Disraeli made the following remarks, which have received illustration in more recent times : \" With regard to the estimates, a very great change has taken place within the last two or three years in the form of drawing them up. . . In old days a vote was asked, say the 100,0002. for palaces ; the Minister who prepared that vote was supposed to be master of the subject ; he explaiued it if necessary, and tho house if satisfied granted that sum on his responsi bility. . . Now tho fault of the present system was that they had in one vote too many items. It was perfectly absurd to fill up the vote with details of every miserable item, as if the Minister could not, for example, be charged, without the interference of the House, with the responsibUity"], [346, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 326 of a water-closet. Bnt under the present system the matter might become serious as regarded the public business. Any four men might by the forms of the House bring its business to a close. Any four men could by the forms of the House make a dissolution of ParUament absolutely necessary. And, if there was not sufficient good sense in the country to insure that these four men would never be returned again, they might destroy the British Constitution at any time.\" Anarchy in the Opposing Camp. \u2014 In May, 1858, a motion was brought forward in both Houses, censuring the Indian policy of the Derby-Disraeli Government, whose Minister for India (Lord EUen borough) had recently reproved the Governor- General for the annexation of Onde. What followed was thus commented upon by Mr. Disraeli a few days after, in a speech to his constituents at Slough : \" They fixed upon an Indian subject, from which they stole their tactics, and which revealed their views. They were, in fact, resolved to loot the Treasury. A gentleman in the House of Commons brought forward the motion, and he was a man of unimpeachable character. The cabal, which had itself rather a tainted character, chose its instruments with pharisaical accuracy. I can assure you that when the right honourable gentleman* who brought forward the motion in the House of Commons rose to impeach me, I was terrified at my own shortcomings, and I Ustened attentively to a nisi-prius uarrative, endiug with a resolution which I think must have been drawn up by a conveyancer. In the other House of Parliament a stUl greater reputation condescended to appear upon tbe human stage \u2014 Gamaliel himself, f with the broad phylacteries of faction upon his forehead; he called upon God to witness, in the voice and accents of majestic adoration, that he was not as other men were \u2014 for that he was never influenced by party motives. Well, gentlemen, what happened under these circumstances ? Why, something which I am quite sure is un precedented in the Parliamentary history of England. . . There is nothing like that last Friday evening in the history of the House of Commons. We came clown to the House expecting to divide at four o'clock in the morning \u2014 I myself, with my armour buckled on, prepared to deliver an address two hours after midnight \u2014 and I beUeve that, even with the consciousness of a good cause, that is no mean effort. WeU, gentlemen, we were all assembled, our benches with their serried ranks seemed to rival those of our proud opponents, when suddenly there came a wad of distress \u2014 but not from us. I can only liken the scene to the mutiny of the Bengal army. Regiment after regiment, corps after corps, general after general, all acknowledged that they could not march through Coventry with her Majesty's Opposition. It was like a convulsion of nature rather than any ordinary transaction of human life. I was reminded by it of one of those earthquakes which take place in Calabria or Peru. There was a rumbling murmur \u2014 a groan \u2014 a shriek \u2014 a sound of distant thunder. No one knew whether it came from the top or the bottom of the house. There was a rent, a fissure in the ground, and then a viUage disappeared, * Mr. Cardwell. t The Earl of Shaftesbury."], [347, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 327 then a tall tower toppled down, and the whole of the Opposition benches became one great dissolving view of anarchy. Are these the people whom you want to govern the country \u2014 people in whose camp there is anarchy \u2014 between whom there is discord on every point, and who are not even united by the common bond of wishing to seize upon the spoils of office ? \" A Forecast of the Royal Titles Bill.\u2014 It is shown in Sir Theodore Martin's \"Life of the Prince Consort\" that it was the custom for the Minister who led in the House of Commons to forward to the Queen brief abstracts or outlines of its proceedings. On the discussion, in 1858, of the biU transferring the government of India from the East India Company to the Crown, Mr. Disraeli (then ChanceUor of the Exchequer) wrote to her Majesty that such satisfactory progress had been made with it in the House that it might be regarded as safe, and he added : \" It is, the Chancellor of the Exchequer really thinks, a wise and weU-digested measure, ripe with the experience of the last five years ; but it is only the ante-chamber of au imperial palace, and your Majesty would do weU to deign to consider the steps which are now necessary to influence the opinions aud effect the imaginations of the Indian populations. The name of your Majesty ought to be impressed upon their native life.\" This remark clearly foreshadows the measure which was introduced several years later, when the writer became Prime Minister, to enable the Queen to assume the title of Empress of Hindostau. That Act was passed, after much opposition, in 1876; but it afterwards appeared that in 1869 the Duke of Argyll, as Minister for India in Mr. Gladstone's Government, had sent to the Ameer of Afghanistan a telegram, in which her Majesty was styled \" Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and Empress of India \" \u2014the latter words having been added to the draft telegram by the duke himself. The matter was the subject of question in both Houses in February, 1880. The Age of Faith. \u2014 A meeting of the Oxford Diocesan Society for the augmentation of small benefices gave occasion, in 1864, for one of the most celebrated of Mr. Disraeli's orations. Addressing himself to combat the assertion that the age of faith has passed, the speaker said : \" When I observe what is passing around me, what is taking place in this country, and not only in this country but on the Continent, in other countries and in other hemispheres, instead of believing that the age of faith has passed, I hold that the characteristic of the present age is a craving credulity. Why, man is a being bom to betieve ; and if you do not come forward, if no Church comes forward with its title-deeds of truth, sustained by the tradition of sacred ages and by the conviction of count less generations to guide him, he will found altars and idols in his own heart and in his own imagination. But observe what must be the relations of a powerful Church, without distinctive creeds, with a being of that nature. Rest assured that the great principle of political economy wiU be observed. Where there is a great demand, there wiU be a proportionate supply ; and commencing, as the new school may, by rejecting the principle of inspiration, it wiU end by every priest being a prophet ; and beginning"], [348, "328 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. as they do by repudiating the practice of mircles, before long we shaU be living in a flitting scene of spiritual phantasmagoria. There are no tenets however extravagant, no practices however objectionable, which wiU not in time develop under such a state of affairs ; opinions the most absurd, and ceremonies the most revolting, are perhaps to be followed by the incantations of Canidia and the Corybantian howl. But consider the country in which all this may take place. Look at the Europe of the present day and the Europe of a hundred years ago. It is not the same Europe ; its very form is changed. Whole nations and great nations which then flourished are no longer found. There is not a political constitution in Europe existing at the present time which then existed. The leading community of the continent of Europe has changed aU its landmarks, altered its boundaries, erased its local names. The whole jurisprudence of Europe has been subverted ; even the tenure of land, which of all human institutions most affects the character of man, has been altered. Tbe feudal system has been abolished. Not merely laws have been changed. not merely manners have been changed, but customs have been changed. And what happened p When the turbulence was over \u2014 when the shout of triumph and the wail of agony were alike stilled \u2014 when, as it were, the waters had disappeared,* the sacred heights of Sinai and Calvary were again revealed, and, amid the wreck of thrones and tribunals, of extinct natious and abolished laws, mankind, tried by so many sorrows, purified by so much suffering, and wise with such unprecedented expe rience, bowed again before the divine truths that Omnipotence, in His ineffable wisdom, had entrusted to the custody and the promulgation of a chosen people.\" \" On the Side of the Angels.\"\u2014 It was in the same address at Oxford that Mr. Disraeli made this declaration, so much commented upon at the time \u2014 not always in a complimentary fashion. He said : \" I hold that the highest function of science is the interpretation of nature, and the interpretation of the highest nature is the highest science. What is the highest nature ? Man is the highest nature. But I must say that when I compare the interpretations of the highest nature by the most advanced, the most fashionable and modish school of modern science when I compare that with some other teachings with which we are familiar \u2014 I am not prepared to say that the lecture-room is more scientific than the Church. What is the question which is now placed before society with a glib assurance which to me is most astounding ? That question is this \u2014 is man an ape or an angel ? I am on the side of the angels. I repudiate with indignation and abhorrence the contrary view which is, I believe, foreign to the conscience of humanity.\" A Peculiar People. \u2014 The following observations were made in the course of a speech on the Borough Franchise, in May, 1865 : \" I doubt very much whether a democracy is a government which would suit this country ; and it is just as weU that the House, when coming to a vote on this question, should really consider if that be the issue, and it Compare with Canning, \" Subsidence of the Deluge,\" p. 219."], [349, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 329 is the real issue, between retaining the present Constitution \u2014 not the present constituent body, but between the present Constitution and a democracy \u2014 it is just as weU for the House to recoUect that the stake is not mean ; that what is at issue is of some price. You must remember, not to use the epithet profanely, that we are dealing reaUy with a peculiar people. There is no country at the present moment that exists under the circumstances and under the same conditions as the people of this realm. You have, for example, an ancient, powerful, richly endowed Church, and perfect religious liberty. You have unbroken order and complete freedom. You have landed estates as large as the Romans, combined with commercial enterprise such as Carthage and Venice united never equalled. And you must remember that this pecidiar country, with these strong contrasts, is not governed by force ; it is not governed by standing armies ; it is governed by a most singular series of traditionary influences which generation after generation cherishes and preserves, because it knows that they embalm custom and represent law. And, with this, what have you done ? You have created the greatest empire of modern time. You have amassed a capital of fabidous amount, you have devised and sustained a system of credit stiU more marvellous, aud, above aU, you have established and maintained a scheme of labour and industry sa vast and complicated that the history of the world has no parallel to it. And all these mighty creations are out of aU proportion to the essential and indigenous elements and resources of the country. If you destroy that state of society, remember this \u2014 England cannot begin again.\" Asian Mystery and Batavian Grace. \u2014 During the discussions in committee on the Reform BiU in 1867, Mr. Beresford Hope, opposing it, made some remarks reflecting upon Mr. Disraeli's conduct of tho measure, and declared that he for one, whether he lost his seat or not, would vote with his whole heart and conscience \" against the Asian mystery.\" Mr. Disraeli replied : \" I can assure the honourable gentleman that I listened with great pleasure to the invectives he delivered against me. I admire his style ; it is a very great ornament to discussion, but it requires practice. I Usten with the greatest satisfaction to aU his exhibitions in this House (oh, oh !) \u2014 and when he talks about an Asian mystery, I wiU tell him that there are Batavian graces in all that he says which charm me.\" (Mr. Beresford Hope's action while speaking, and his Dutch descent, gave a double edge to this sarcasm. ) A Conversation with Mr. Bright.\u2014 In a speech at Manchester in July, 1884, concerning the Franchise BUI of that year, Mr. Bright related the foUowing as a little bit of private history : \" In the year 1S67, just before the biU of Mr. Disraeli came into the House\u2014 he was then the leader of the Tory party in the House of Commons ; he was not in a majority, but he was Minister\u2014 he met me one evening in the lobby, and we had rather a long and an interesting conversation upon the question of Reform, aud as to what it would be proper or possible for the Government to do And I recollect an observation which he made to me. He said, ' I suppose, whatever I do you wiU oppose it ?' I said, ' No; not only wiU"], [350, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 330 I not oppose it, if it be possible to accept it, but if any man on our side treats yon as you have treated us, I wiU get up in my place and denounce him.' Well, at that time he told me how most anxious he was to pass a bUl that would be acceptable and be accepted by the country; and he said, moreover, that when it was passed \u2014 in this he did not foreteU exactly what happened\u2014 he said that, having led the Conservative party for so many years, he was weary of the position, and of the labour and the responsibility, and he felt as if he should like to retire from the eminent position which he then held. WeU, after this I sat down and wrote to Mr. Disraeli rather a long letter or memorandum,\" the particulars of which the speaker proceeded to relate. \" Educating his Party.\" \u2014 While ChanceUor of the Exchequer, Mr. Disraeli was entertained at a banquet by the Conservatives of Edinburgh, October 29th, 1867, when he went into an elaborate review of the subject of Reform, and defended the biU which had been passed, under his management, by the Government of Lord Derby. Speaking of the interval between 1860 and the period when the Conservative measure was introduced, he said : \" During that period of seven years, with the advice, I may say under the instructions of my coUeagues, I expressed the prin ciples upon which any measure of parliamentary reform ought to be estabUshed. Now, mark this, because these are things which you may not have heard in any speech which has been made in the city of Edin burgh. I had to prepare the mind of the country, and to educate \u2014 if it be not arrogant to use such a phrase \u2014 to educate our party. It is a large party, and requires its attention to be caUed to questions of this kind with some pressure. I had to prepare the mind of Parliament and of the country on this question of Reform. This was not only with the concur rence of Lord Derby, but of my colleagues.\" A British Minister's Difficulties. \u2014 In his speech at the Edin burgh banquet, Mr. Disraeli thus depicted the cares and anxieties which attach to the position of Minister in this country : \" I am the last man who would attempt to depreciate the difficulties which a British Minister has to meet, or would attempt to exaggerate the quaUties which my col leagues possess. Indeed, when I remember the interests of these British Isles, so vast, so various, and so complicated \u2014 when I even recaU to re collection the differences of race, which, however blended, leave a very significant characteristic \u2014 when I recoUect that the great majority of the population of the United Kingdom rise every day and depend for their daUy sustenance on their daily labour \u2014 when I recollect the delicate nature of our credit, more wonderful in my opinion than aU our accumu lated capital \u2014 when I remember that it is on the common sense, the pru dence, and the courage of a community thus circumstanced that depends the fate of uncounted millions in ancient provinces, and that around the globe there is a circle of domestic settlements that watch us for example and inspiration \u2014 when I know that not a sun arises upon a British Minister that does not bring him care, and even inexpressible anxiety\u2014 an unexpected war, a disturbed and discontented colony, a pestilence, a famine, a mutiny, a declining trade, a decaying revenue, a coUapse of"], [351, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 331 credit, perhaps some insane and fantastic conspiracy \u2014 I declare I feel very often, I wonder where there is the strength of heart to deal with such colossal circumstances. But when I withdraw from the pressure of individual interest, and take a larger and deeper view of human affairs, I recognise that in this country, whatever may have been the tumult and the turmoU of our now almost countless generations, there have been three master influences that have at aU times controUed and commanded our powers and passions, and they are industry, liberty, and religion. So long as this sacred combination influences the destiny of this country, it wiU not die ; history will recognise its life, not record its decUne and fall.\" His Elevation to the Premiership. \u2014 On the resignation of the Earl of Derby, from failing health, in February, 1868, Mr. DisraeU, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, received a summons from the Queen to reconstruct the Cabinet. The autograph letter from Osborne thus caUing him to assume the Premiership was carried by General Grey, who in 1832 had defeated Mr. Disraeli in his early candidature for a seat at High Wycombe. Heedless Rhetoric. \u2014 During a debate on the Irish Church in 1868, Mr. Disraeli was often taunted with arguments he had used in a speech on the state of Ireland in 1844. He said, in one of his replies : \" I have been reminded in the course of this debate of expressions which I used five-and-twenty years ago. I could remind other gentlemen of ex pressions they used on the same subject five-and-twenty years ago ; but I do not much caro for that sort of thing. With reference, however, to that passage which has been quoted from a speech made by me, I may remark that it appeared to me, at the time I made it, that nobody listened to it. It seemed to me that I was pouring water upon sand, but it seems now that the water came from a golden goblet. With regard to the passage from that speech, there are many remarks which, if I wanted to vindicate or defend myself, I might legitimately make. . . All this I might say ; but I do not care to say it, and I do not wish to say it, because in my conscience the sentiment of that speech was right. It may have been expressed with the heedless rhetoric which I suppose is the appanage of aU who sit below the gangway; but in my historical con science the sentiment of that speech was right.\" An Appeal to the Jury.\u2014 In the debate on Mr. Gladstone's Irish Church resolutions, in April, 1868, Mr. Disraeli said: \"The only objection which I have to the attacks of the noble lord (Cranbome, after wards Marquis of SaUsbury) is that they invariably produce an echo from the other side. When the bark is heard from this side, the right honour able member for Calne (Mr. Lowe) emerges, I will not say from his cave* but perhaps from a more cynical habitation. He joins immediately in the chorus of reciprocal malignity \u2014 ' And hails with horrid melody the moon.' The right honourable gentleman was extremely exuberant in his comments- * The cave of Adullain \u2014 see under \" Bright.\""], [352, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 332 upon my character and career. I will not trouble the House with a defence of that character and career. I have lived in this House more than thirty years, and can truly say that during that time comments upon my character and career have been tolerably free and plain. But the House has been the jury of my life, and it allows me now here to address it, and therefore here is not the place in which I think it necessary to vindicate myself.\" The Country Governed by Rhetoric. \u2014 In May, 1871, a motion of Mr. Miall's, that it was expedient to apply the policy initiated by the disestablishment of the Irish Church to the other churches of the kingdom, was defeated by 374 to 89. Mr. Disraeli, in speaking against it, admitted that the principle was logical, but said : \" Fortunately the country was not governed by logic. It was governed by rhetoric, and not by logic, or otherwise it would have been erased long ago from the Ust of leading communities. No form of religion represented more fully the national sentiment than the Established Church. For his own part, he had always \"believed that, organically, the English were a religious people. We had partially educated them, and we were now going to educate them com pletely ; and when they were educated they would not fly to the conven ticle ; they would appreciate a learned clergy, a refined ritual, and the consolation of the beautiful offices of the Church.\" Views of Toryism. \u2014 In June. 1872, Mr. Disraeli addressed, at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, \" the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations.\" In the course of his speech he laid down the following principles with regard to the Tory party : \" It was a great mistake that those who succeeded statesmen like Mr. Pitt and Lord Grenville should have so conducted affairs that they built up their policy on the most contracted basis. The Tory party, unless it is a national party, is nothing. It is not a confederacy of nobles, it is not a demo cratic multitude ; it is a party formed from all the numerous classes of the realm \u2014 classes aUke and equal before the law, but whose different conditions and different aims give vigour and variety to our national life. . . I have always been of opinion that the Tory party has three great objects. The first is to maintain the institutions of the country \u2014 not from any sentiment of political superstition, but because we beUeve that the principles upon which a community like England can alone safely rest \u2014 the principles of liberty, of order, of law, and reUgion \u2014 ought not to be intrusted to individual opinion or to the caprice and passion of multitudes, but should be embodied in a form of permanence and power. We associate with the Monarchy the ideas which it represents \u2014 the majesty of law, the administration of justice, the fountain of mercy and of honour. We know that the Estates of the Realm, by the privileges they enjoy, are the best security for public liberty and good government. We believe that a national profession of faith can only be attained by maintaining an EstabUshed Church ; and that no society is safe unless there is a public recognition of the Providential government of the world, and of the future responsibility of man.\" \" Thank God, there is the House of Lords ! \" \u2014 In an address"], [353, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 333 to a meeting of Lancashire Conservatives, in the Free Trade Hall at Manchester, in AprU, 1872, Mr. Disraeli quoted this saying. He remarked : \" There is some advantage in political experience. I remem ber the time when there was a similar outcry against the House of Lords, but much more intense and powerful; and, gentlemen, it arose from the same cause. A Liberal Government had been instaUed in office, with an immense Liberal majority. They proposed some violent measures. The House of Lords modified some, delayed others, and some they threw out. Instantly there was a cry to abolish or to reform the House of Lords, and the greatest popular orator* that probably ever existed was sent on a pilgrimage over England to excite the people in favour of this opinion. What happened? That happened, gentlemen, which may happen to morrow. There was a dissolution of Parliament. The great Liberal majority vanished. The balance of parties was restored. It was dis covered that the House of Lords had behind them at least half of the English people. We heard no more cries for their abolition or their reform, and before two years more passed England was really governed by the House of Lords, under the wise influence of the Duke of WeUington and the commanding eloquence of Lyndhurst ; and such was the enthusiasm of the nation in favour of the Second Chamber, that at every public meeting its health was drunk, with the additional sentiment, for which we are indebted to one of the most distinguished members that ever represented the House of Commons, 'Thank God, there is tho House of Lords ! ' \" \" Sanitas Sanitatum, omnia Sanitas.\" \u2014 It was in the Man chester speech that Mr. Disraeli made this remark, in illustration of tho proper domestic policy of a Government. In the course of a very effective oration, the right honourable gentleman (then leader of the Opposition) said: \"In attempting to legislate upon social matters, the great object is to be practical. I think public attention as regards these matters ought to be concentrated upon sanitary legislation. That is a wide subject, and, if properly treated, comprises almost every considera tion which has a just claim upon legislative interference. Pure air, pure water, the inspection of unhealthy habitations, the adulteration of food, these and many kindred matters may be legitimately dealt with by the Legislature. . . Gentlemen, I cannot impress upon you too strongly my conviction of the importance of the Legislature and society uniting together in favour of these important results. A great scholar and a great wit 300 years ago said that, in his opinion, there was a great mistake in the Vulgate (which, as you all know, is the Latin translation of the Holy Scriptures), aud that, instead of saying 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity' \u2014 Vanitas vanitatum, omnia vanitas \u2014 the wise and witty King really said, Sanitas sanitatum, omnia sanitas. Gentlemen, it is impossible to overrate the importance of the subject. After all, the first consideration of a Minister should be tho health of the people. A land may be covered with historic trophies, with museums of science and * Daniel O'ConneU."], [354, "334 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. galleries of art, with universities and with libraries ; the people may be civilised and ingenious ; the country may be even famous in the annals and action of the world; but, gentlemen, if the population every ten years decreases, and the stature of the race every ten years diminishes, the history of that country will soon be the history of the past.\" \u2014 A few weeks afterwards, in a political banquet at the Crystal Palace, Mr. Disraeli thus defended his remarks against some adverse criticism which had followed : \" The views which I expressed in the great capital of the county of Lancaster have been held up to derision by the Liberal Press. A very rising member among the new Liberal members denounced them the other day as the ' policy of sewage,' WeU, it may be the ' policy of sewage ' to a Liberal member of Parliament. But to one of the labouring multitude of England, who has found fever always to be one of the inmates of his household \u2014 who has, year after year, seen stricken down the children of his loins, on whose sympathy and material support he has looked with hope and confidence, it is not a 'policy of sewage,' but a question of life and death.\" The \" Exhausted Volcanoes.\" \u2014 In his speech to the Lancashire Conservatives, in 1872, Mr. Disraeli also used this simile, while criticising the recent course of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry : \" As time advanced, it was not difficult to perceive that extravagance was being substituted for energy by the Government. The unnatural stimulus was subsiding. Their paroxysms ended in prostration. Some took refuge in melancholy, and their eminent chief alternated between a menace and a sigh. As I sat opposite the Treasury bench, the Ministers reminded me of one of those marine landscapes not very unusual on the Coast of South America. You behold a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers on a single paUid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There are occa sional earthquakes, and ever and anon the dark rumbling of the sea.\" A Blaze of Apology. \u2014 In the debate on the Address on the opening of the session of 1872, Mr. Disraeli thus referred to numerous speeches which had been made by Ministers during the recess \u2014 a period when the loss of the ship Meg\u00e6ra, the Alabama negotiations, and what was termed the \"Collier scandal,\" had been among the prominent topics: \"Although a considerable interval has elapsed since we all had the honour of seein\u00b0 you (the Speaker) in your chair, yet the time appears to have passed over us so rapidly as not to have exercised that softening influence, or to have drawn that comparative oblivion over our controversies, which, in my opinion, is so highly salutary and beneficial. I attribute this in a great degree to the new system adopted by her Majesty's Ministers of vindicating their cha racters and their policy during the recess. We really have had no time to forget anything. Her Majesty's Ministers may be said during the last six months to have lived in a blaze of apology. (Cheers and lauo-hter.) I must protest against this new system, which does not permit us to return to our labours with renovated physical powers and energies, or with our mental qualities and faculties refreshed, as we used to do in the old clays. I think that for a Ministerial vindication there is no place more fit than the floor of this House ; and as for Ministerial explanations, they are"], [355, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD- 335 of so marvellous a nature that even here they are difficult always to appre hend, but as they were given in the recess, I confess I found them incomprehensible.\" Defeat of the Gladstone Ministry on the Irish University BiU. \u2014 On the 11th of March, 1873, the second reading of the Irish University BiU of the Gladstone Government was before the House of Commons, and Mr. Disraeli made a telling speech against it. In one passage he said : \" If her Majesty's Government have not the confidence of the House of Commons, I want to know what have they the confi dence of ? It is a House returned under their auspices. (\"' No, no.\") Well, elected under the exciting eloquence of the right honourable gentleman. When I remember that campaign of rhetoric, I must say I think this House was formally as well as spirituaUy its creation. . . This is essentiaUy a material age. The opinions which are now afloat, which have often been afloat before, and which have died away as I have no doubt these wiU die in due time, are opposed, in my opinion, to aU those sound convictions which the proper study of moral and mental philo sophy has long established. But that such a proposition should be made in the land of the university which has produced Berkeley and Hutcheson makes it stiU more surprising. We live in an age when young men prattle about protoplasm, and when young ladies in gilded saloons unconsciously talk atheism. And this is the moment when a Minister, called upon to fulfil one of the noblest duties which can fall upon the most ambitious statesman \u2014 namely, the formation of a great university \u2014 formally comes forward and proposes the omission from public study of that philosophy which vindicates the spiritual nature of man ! \" The speaker went on to say that in their recent policy the Government had mistaken the clamour of Nonconformists for the voice of the nation, and he denounced the Ministry in terms resembling those used in his celebrated \" Bath letter \" a few months later : \" You have now,\" said he, \" had four years of it. You have despoiled churches. You have threatened every corporation and endowment in the country. You have examined into everybody's affairs. You have criticised every profession and vexed every trade. No one is certain of his property, and nobody knows what duties he may have to perform to-morrow. I believe that the people of this country have had enough of the policy of confiscation. From what I can see, the House of Commons elected to carry out that policy are beginning to experience some of the inconveniences of satiety, and, if I am not mistaken, they will give some intimation to the Government to-night that that is their opinion also.\" In the division the Ministers were beaten by 287 to 284, and consequently tondered their resignations to the Queen. \" Plundering and Blundering.\" \u2014 In October, 1873, Mr. Disraeli addressed a letter to Lord Grey de Wilton, respecting an election then pending at Bath, and in the course of it said : \"For nearly five years the present Ministers have harassed every trade, worried every profession, and assailed or menaced every class, institution, and species of property in the country.\" It closed by saying that \" the country has, I think, made Up its mind to close this career of plundering and blundering.\" The"], [356, "336 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. writer had used the same phrase many years before, in his political novel \" Coningsby,\" where he introduces one of his characters thus : \" Light as air, and proud as a young peacock, tripped on his toes a young Tory, who had contrived to keep his seat in a parliament where he had done nothing, but who thought the under Secretaryship was now secure, particularly as he was the son of a noble lord, who had also, in a public capacity, plundered and blundered in the good old time.\" Mr. Gladstone appears to have parodied this phrase, in a speech at Greenwich in defence of his Government in January, 1874. Among other topics alluded to, was the accusation by Mr. Disraeli that British interests had been neglected in the Straits of Malacca. Mr. Gladstone retorted that if any neglect had taken place it was under the foreign administration of Lord Derby, in Mr. Disraeli's own Cabinet ; and he concluded this part of the subject by declaring, \" I wiU leave the leader of the Opposition for the present floundering and foundering in the Straits of Malacca.\" Humiliations of a Weak Government. \u2014 In giving the House his reasons for declining the Queen's summons to form an Administration, on the 20th of March, 1873, Mr. Disraeli made the following remarks : \" I know weU, and those who are around me know weU, what wdl occur when a Ministry takes office and attempts to carry on the government with a minority during the session, with the view of ultimately appealing to the people. We should have what is called ' fair play.' That is to say, no vote of want of confidence would be proposed, and chiefly because it would be of no use. There would be no wholesale censure, but retail humUiation. A right honourable gentleman will come down here, he wiU arrange his thumb-screws and other instruments of torture on this table, we shaU never ask for a vote without a lecture, we shaU never perform the most ordinary routine office of government without there being annexed to it some pedantic and ignominious condition. (\"No, no,\" and cheers.) I wish to express nothing but what I know from painful personal experi ence. No expression of the kind I have just encountered could divest me of the painful memory ; I wish it could. I wish it was not my duty to take this view of the case. In a certain time we should enter into the paradise of abstract resolutions. One day honourable gentlemen cannot withstand the golden opportunity of asking the House to affirm that the income tax should no longer form one of the features of our Ways and Means. Of course a proposition of that kind would be scouted by the right honourable gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) and aU his coUeagues; but then they might dine out that day (laughter), and the resolution might be carried, as resolutions of that kind have been. Then another gentle man, distinguished for his knowledge of men and things, would move that the Diplomatic Service be abolished. While honourable gentlemen opposite were laughing in their sleeves at the mover, they would vote for the motion in order to put the Government into a minority. For this reason : ' Why should men,' they would say, ' govern the country who are in a minority ? ' totally forgetting that we acceded to office in the spirit of the Constitution, quite oblivious of the fountain and origin of the position we occupied. And it would go very hard if on some sultry"], [357, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 337 afternoon some member should not ' rush in where angels fear to tread,' and successfully assimilate the borough and the county franchise. (Loud cheers.) And so things would go on until the bitter end \u2014 until at last even the Appropriation BiU is passed, Parliament is dissolved, and we appeal to those millions who perhaps six months before might have looked upon us as the vindicators of intolerable grievances, but who now receive us as a defeated, discredited, and degraded Ministry, whose services can be neither of value to the Crown nor of credit to the nation.\" A Passing Allusion. \u2014 Mr. Disraeli's faculty of bringing in an unexpected humorous illustration was perhaps never better displayed than in a speech to the Conservatives of Glasgow (November, 1873). In allusion to the Abyssinian war he said : \" I shoidd myself, from my own individual experience, be most careful not to follow the example which one of the most distinguished members of the present Administration, pursued with respect to us, when we had to encounter the Abyssinian difficulty. When I introduced the necessity of interference, in order to escape from difficulties which we had inherited and not made, Mr. Lowe rose in Parliament and violently attacked the Government of the day for the absurdity, the foUy, the extreme imprudence of attempting any inter ference in the affairs of Abyssinia. . . He described the horrors of the country and the terrors of the clime. He said there was no possibility by which any success could be obtained, and the people of England must prepare themselves for the most horrible catastrophe. He described not only the fatal influence of the climate, but I remember he described one pink fly alone which he said would eat up the whole British Army. He was as vituperative of the insects of Abyssinia as if they had been British workmen.\" Dexterity in a Difficulty. \u2014 In his speech on the second reading of the Peace Preservation (Ireland) Bill in 1875, Mr. Disraeli was for a time disconcerted by one of the Irish members interposing, in the loudest tones, ejaculations of \" No \" and \" Hear, hear.\" At the outset the Prime Minister had remarked of the bill, \" This is a measure of necessity, framed in a spirit of conciliation ;\" a statement which was followed by a stentorian \" No ! \" from his adversary. \" If that,\" said Mr. Disraeli, \" is to be taken as a reply, I must observe that, according to the rules of the House, the honourable gentleman is precluded from taking any further part in this debate.\" This rejoinder, however, excited his opponent the more, and he followed his first interruption by a series of ironical cheers, which scarcely allowed the speaker to proceed. The House seemed somewhat amused at the incident (which occurred after the dinner hour), and Mr. Disraeli for a time failed to regain its ordinary attention ; but he presently created a diversion which temporarily restored his usual command over his audience. Replying to a lengthy speech from Mr. Butt on the other side, he remarked : \" The honourable gentleman has quoted a passage from a speech of mine [at the Guildhall] not made in this House, which at the time attracted some public notice. I said then, as I say now, that the working classes of England inherit popular and personal privileges which the nobility of other nations do not. That is my opinion, which I am z"], [358, "338 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. prepared to stand by. WeU, a story got out that in consequence of using those words a representation was made to her Majesty's Government, and that I made an apology to the Minister [Prince Bismarck] who beUeved he was alluded to. Now, I never would have gone out of myiway to explain, but as the honourable gentleman the other night talked of her Majesty's Government truckling to Prince Bismarck, I think, after the quotation of this passage, that the House wiU aUow me to make one other remark. There is not the slightest truth of any k'nd in the statement that has been made, that any aUusion or remonstrance, direct or indirect, public or private, by male or by female \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 was ever made to me or to any member of her Majesty's Government upon that statement. When the erroneous charge was made that I had alluded to the conduct of Prince Bismarck, of whom I thought as much at the time as I am now thinking of Rory O'More, I thought it was idle to answer the remarks in the newspapers.\" After this, the speaker was again interrupted as before ; but he completely recovered possession of the House by introducing an apparently trivial anecdote. \" I am surprised,\" he said, \" to find county members for Ireland rising up in their places, and doubting the existence of the Ribbon conspiracy. I say. Sir, that such incredulity is simply astounding. I remember there was once a member of Parliament, one of the greatest ornaments of this House, who sat upon this bench, and who filled the office which I now so unworthily occupy. That member was Mr. Canning, and at the time, besides the discovery of a new world, dry champagne was invented. Mr. Canning, hearing everyone talk of the new wine, wished to taste it. Mr. Ellice got up a little party in order to gratify Mr. Canning's desire, and tbe dry champagne was introduced ; and Mr. Canning, after drinking his wine and thinking for a moment, said, ' The man who says that he likes dry champagne will say anything.' I don't want to enter into any rude controversy with any of my friends who doubt the existence of Ribbonism in Ireland, but I will say that a man who doubts the existence of Ribbonism is the man who ought to drink dry champagne.\" Last Appearance in the Commons. \u2014 The announcement of Mr. DisraeU's elevation to the House of Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield was made on the 12th of August, 1876, and took the country by surprise. On the previous evening he had addressed the Commons for the last time, none of his hearers suspecting on the occasion that one who had taken such a conspicuous and important part in its affairs during a long period, was now about to quit that stirring arena for the more sedate and quiet scenes of the Upper House. The subject before the House of Commons on the evening was the state of affairs in the East, and among the last remarks made by the Prime Minister were the foUowing: \"What our duty is at this critical moment is to maintain the Empire of Eno-land. Nor wUl we ever agree to any step, though it may obtain for a moment comparative quiet and false prosperity, that hazards the existence of that Empire.\" The Future of Greece. \u2014 In the course of his speech to the House of Lords after his return from Berlin (July 18, 1878), Lord Beaconsfield"], [359, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 339 -observed : \" I think, under all the circumstances, it will be acknowledged that Greece has not been neglected. Greece is a country so interesting, that it enlists the sympathies of all educated men. Greece has a future ; and I would say, if I might be permitted, to Greece, what I would say to an individual who has a future \u2014 Leam to be patient.\" \" Peace at Any Price.\" \u2014 In his speech in the House of Lords on the Afghan war, Dec. 10, 1878, Lord Beaconsfield made the foUowing remarks respecting an amendment moved by Lord Halifax in opposition to the policy of the Government : \" What I see in the amendment is not an assertion of great principles, which no man honours more than myself. What is at the bottom of it is rather that principle, of peace at any price, which a certain party in this country upholds. It is that dangerous dogma which I believe animates the ranks before me at this moment, although many of them may be unconscious of it. That deleterious doctrine haunts the people of this country in every form. Sometimes it is a committee ; sometimes it is a letter ; sometimes it is an amendment to the Address ; sometimes it is a proposition to stop the supplies. That doctrine has done more mischief than any I can well recaU that have been afloat in this century. It has occasioned more wars than the most ruth less conquerors. It has disturbed, and nearly destroyed, that political -equilibrium so necessary to the liberties of nations aud the welfare of the world. It has dimmed occasionally for a moment even the majesty of England. And, my lords, to-ni^ht you have an opportunity, which I trust you will not lose, of branding these opinions, these deleterious \u2022 dogmas, with the reprobation of the Peers of England.'' The amend ment was defeated by 201 to 65. \u2014 In connection with the use of this phrase, an interesting fact was mentioned by Sir Charles Dilke, iu addressing his constituents at Chelsea in February, 1882. He said : \" For expressing an opinion favourable to Continental disarmament, he would perhaps be styled by the Conservatives a partisan of ' peace at any price.' He would, however, comfort himself with the recollection that, so far as he knew, that phrase was first used in a memorandum by F. Von Gentz, written in 1815, in which the words were contemptuously applied to the opinions of Lord Castlereagh and the great Duke of Wellington, a ie-w months before Waterloo ! \" Banter. \u2014 In the debate in the House of Lords on the policy of the Government respecting Afghanistan, Dec. 10, 1878, the Earl of Beacons- field replied as follows to Lord Derby, who, earlier in the year, had resigned his position as Foreign Secretary, when the Ministry contemplated measures of which he did not approve : \" The noble earl who spoke last nio-ht from the cross benches made a most ingenious speech, marked by all his characteristics. I never was more pleased. I listened for a long time to what seemed a complete vindication of the Government, and, remembering it came from an old comrade in arms with whom I had worked for a \u2022 quarter of a century with entire concert, who had left me unfortunately froni circumstances over which he had no control \u2014 (a laughl \u2014 I thought he was making the amende by taking an early opportunity of vindicating ithe policy of the Government. But before sitting down, all that romantic z 2"], [360, "340 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. flutter of the heart which I had experienced entirely ceased, when I found that, notwithstanding his approbation of the Government policy, he was going to vote for the amendment. What surprised me more than any thing was the reason he gave for it, and that was because we did not go to war with Russia. The noble lord said, ' If you acted logically and properly you ought to have gone to war with Russia, and therefore I must vote for the amendment.' \" (Much laughter.) A Useful Piece of Furniture. \u2014 On one occasion in the House of Commons (while defending the Reform Bill of the Derby-Disraeli Ministry in 1867, on the second reading), Mr. Disraeli caused much amusement by a remark which he thus introduced : \" The right honour able gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) said last night, in a very solemn tone, that if this were a motion for the third reading of the bill, we should aU agree that it would be impossible to pass it. As if that were not the fate of every biU ! As if you were, on the second reading of any biU, to treat it as though it then stood for a third reading ; and as if any Reform Bill, of all bills in the world, could be proposed to be read the second time, and anyone could expect it to pass the second reading, in the exact shape in which it was then presented to the House ! Sir, that is not a fair criticism. And then the right honourable gentleman gets up and addresses me in a tone which, I must say, is very unusual in this House, Not that I at all care for the heat he displays, although really his mannei is sometimes so very excited and so alarming, that one might almost feel thankful that gentlemen in this House, who sit on opposite sides of this table, are divided by a good broad piece of furniture.\" An After-Dinner Sketch of Mr. Gladstone. \u2014 On the return of Lords Beaconsfield and Salisbury from Berlin, in 1878, a dinner in their honour was given at Knightsbridge by members of the Conservative party, more than 500 being present. In the course of his speech on this occasion, Lord Beaconsfield thus referred to some criticisms by Mr. Gladstone : \" I was astonished to learn that the Convention of Constantinople has been described as ' an insane convention.' That is a strong epithet, but I do not pretend to be as competent a judge of insanity as the right honourable gentleman who used it. I will not say to the right honourable gentlemau what I had occasion to say in the House of Lords this year, Naviget Anticyram ; but I would put this issue to an intelligent English jury \u2014 \u25a0 Which do you believe most likely to enter into an insane convention, a body of English gentlemen, honoured by tho favour of their Sovereign and the confidence of their fellow subjects, managing your affairs for five years, I hope with prudence and not altogether without success, or a sophistical rhetorician, inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity, and gifted with an egotistical imagination, that can at all times command an interminable aud inconsistent series of arguments to malign his opponents and to glorify himself ? \" Lord Mayor's Day Speeches.\u2014 The Earl of Beaconsfield mado more use than some of his predecessors of the opportunity afforded during the recess by the Guildhall banquets, to communicate the mind of the Government on public affairs. He remarked on one of these occasions :"], [361, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 341 \u25a0\" I have often observed that the month of October is very rife with high secrets of State. In the month of November they are not so numerous. I ascribe that result to the beneficial influence, in some degree, of Lord Mayor's Day. On Lord Mayor's Day there is a chance of hearing the voice of sense and truth.\" On his first appearance as Prime Minister at the Guildhall (in 1868) the Lord Mayor was Alderman J. C. Lawrence, who, as member for a metropolitan constituency, had identified himself with the Liberal party. Mr. Disraeli created much laughter, in the course of his reply to the toast of \" Her Majesty's Ministers,\" by coupling his complimentary remarks to the Lord Mayor with a hint that he did not desire the alderman's return to the House in the general election then impending. He said : \" You have shown, my lord, by your conduct of the business of this evening, how competent you are for the great office which you fill ; and I am sure that you will give me credit for hearty sincerity when I assure you it is my earnest wish that, during the next year, you will be able to devote to this great corporation, of which you are the head, your undivided attention.\" A saying of Lord Beaconsfield at the Guildhall ten years later, after the Treaty of Berlin had been signed in the summer, is well remembered. He remarked : \" I will give credit to the signatories of that treaty for an honourable fulfilment of their engage ments. I admit that there are paragraphs in the newspapers of a different import ; I admit that there is gossip, which may not even be authentic, reported of the subalterns of different States who may have expressed a different opinion. But the government of the world is carried on by sovereigns and statesmen, not by anonymous paragraphists, \u25a0or the hare-brained chatter of irresponsible frivolity.\" \" Imperium et Iiibertas.\" \u2014 The Earl of Beaconsfield used this phrase in replying for the Ministry at the Guildhall banquet in 1879. He said : \" When one of the greatest of the Romans was asked what his policy was, he replied, ' Imperium et libertas.' That is a short programme, but It would not disgrace a British Ministry, and it is one on which the existing Ministry will always act.\" \u2014 The phrase, although not found to the letter, has been traced to a passage in Cicero's fourth Philippic, as well as to one in the \" Agricola \" of Tacitus, and other sources. The Mountains of Rasselas.\u2014 The following is a celebrated example of Lord Beaconsfield's occasional tendency to high-flown lan guage. In proposing a vote of thanks to the forces engaged in the Abyssinian expedition (July 2, 1S68), the speaker thus introduced the subject : \" The commander of this expedition had to commence his operations by forming his base on a desolate shore, and by creating a road to the land he invaded through a wall of mountains. AvaUing himself for this purpose of the beds of exhausted torrents, he gradually reached a lofty table-land\u2014 wild, and for the most part barren\u2014 frequently intersected with mountain ranges of great elevation, occasionally breaking into ravines and gorges that were apparently unfathomable. Yet over this country, for more than three hundred miles, the commander-in-chief guided and sustained a numerous host, composed of many thousands of fighting men, as many camp followers, and vast caravans of animals,"], [362, "342 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. bearing supplies, more numerous than both. Over this land he guided cavalry and infantry, and \u2014 what is perhaps the most remarkable part of tho expedition\u2014 he led the elephants of Asia, bearing the artillery of Europe, over African passes which might have startled the trapper and appalled the hunter of the Alps. When he arrived at the base of this critical rendezvous, he encountered no inglorious foe ; and if the manly qualities of the Abyssinians sank before the resources of our warlike science, our troops, even after that combat, had to scale a mountain fortress, of which the intrinsic strength was such that it may be fairly said, it would have been impregnable to the whole world had it been defended by the man by whom it was assailed. But all these obstacles and all these difficulties and dangers were overcome by Sir Robert Napier, and that came to pass which ten years ago not one of us could have imagined even in his dreams, and which must, under aU circumstances, be an event of peculiar interest to an Englishman \u2014 the standard of St. George was hoisted on the mountains of Rasselas.\" \" Home Rule.\" \u2014 In the debate on the Address in the House of Lords, at the opening of Parliament in February, 1880, Lord Beacons field made the following declaration on this subject : \" It is very easy to talk of the House of Commons and of Parliament generally being over laden with business \u2014 to a great degree with Irish business \u2014 and that it would be very desirable that a great portion of Irish business should be transacted in Ireland. Well, I should like to know what this business is that is to be transacted in Ireland. It is so easy to raise this question ;. but there is no business which refers to Ireland which would not equally be an excuse in England. Why should not the people of York transact their business iu York ? So you would go on until you bad no Parliament at all. We should find the noble lord (Granville) in a short time coming to this point. Well, what is the result ? The next thing is, you are to have a Parliament in St. Stephen's Green. The noble earl must know very well that the party called the Home Rule party\u2014 that is, the Repeal of the Union party \u2014 have behind their policy an Irish Parliament. The noble lord will allow me, as he has quoted a colleague of mine, to quote a colleague of his ; one who, although he displayed great sympathy with the new school, and although he was not prepared to be a member of the Parliament in St. Stephen's Green \u2014 not yet prepared \u2014 stiU he did not care how many friends he had who sat upon those benches. I wish to say, whatever may be the result of the election, I do trust that England will understand what is the issue at the present moment on this subject.. I wish the country to understand that it means nothing else but the dismemberment of the United Kingdom. I do not care where a man sits in this House, whether opposite mo or on my own side : \u2014 those who favour such a policy are false to their Sovereign and to their country, and will live, I feel confident, soon to regret the responsibility which by their conduct they are incurring.\" The \" Conquered Race.\" \u2014 In the course of a debate in 1874, on a. motion in favour of Home Rule brought forward by Mr. Butt, Mr. Disraeli (then Prime Minister) made some very happy aUusions to the-"], [363, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 343 argument sometimes advanced, that the Irish people, without Home Rule, were a conquered race. He said : \"There is to me nothing more extra ordinary than the determination of the Irish people to proclaim to the world that they are a subjugated people. I have been always surprised that a people gifted with so much genius, so much sentiment, such winning qualities, should be \u2014 I am sure they will pardon my saying it ; my remark is an abstract, not a personal one \u2014 should be so deficient in self-respect. I deny that the Irish people are conquered : they are proud of it \u2014 I deny that they have any ground for that pride. England has been subjugated quite as much, but never boasted of it. The Normans conquered Ireland, but it was after they had conquered England. CromweU conquered Ireland, but it was after he had conquered England.\" These remarks were received with much applause from all sides of the House. The speaker went on to condemn the motion, declaring, \"If we sanction this policy, if we do not cleanse the Parliamentary bosom of this perilous stuff, we shall bring about the disintegration of the kingdom and the destruction of the empire.\" The motion was rejected by 458 to 61. The Keys of India. \u2014 In the debate in the House of Lords on tho subject of the retention of Candahar (March 4, 1881), a motion in favour of which was carried by 165 to 76, Lord Beaconsfield said : \" I myself believe that, even if we abandon Candahar, we shall still be able to retain our Indian Empire. There are several important places which are called the keys of India. There is Herat and Merv ; . . . there is Ghuzni ; there is Balkh ; there is Candahar \u2014 they are all said to be the keys of India. My opinion is that these are no keys of India, though they are places in which I should regret to see any great military Power. I should see it with regret, and with some degree of apprehension ; but if a great military Power were there, I trust we might stiU be able to maintain our Indian Empire. But, my lords, the key of India is not Herat or Candahar; the key of India is London \u2014 (loud cheers)\u2014 in the majesty of sovereignty, in the spirit and vigour of your Parliament, in the inex haustible resources of a free, an ingenious, and a determined people. These are the keys of India. But a wise statesman would be chary of appealing too frequently to these, and of drawing upon what I may call the arterial sources of a nation's power. He would use selection, and seek to sustain the empire by prompt recourse to local resources which would meet his needs. You have always acted on that system in this country for the last hundred years. Yon have skilfully appropriated many strong places in the world; you have erected and retained fortifications, and, when you have had to deal with a foe, by the valour of your soldiers and by the sagacity and skill of your engineers you have generaUy managed to obtain a precise and scientific frontier* I hope, my lords, we shall pursue the same policy.\" On the Death of the Princess Alice.\u2014 Lord Beaconsfield's speech in the House of Lords, in moving an Address of condolence on * This term had been originally used by Lord Beaconsdeld at the GuildhaU ban juet, Nov. 9, 1878."], [364, "344 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the death of the Princess Alice (Dec. 17, 1878), has been considered one of the best efforts of his high oratorical powers. It is sufficiently brief to be included among these examples of ParUamentary genius. He said : \"The subject to which I have to refer is one on which there wiU be unanimity ; but, alas ! it is the unanimity of sorrow. A princess, who loved us though she left us, and who always revisited her fatherland with delight \u2014 one of those women the brightness of whose being adorns society and inspires the circle in which she lives \u2014 has been removed from this world, to the anguish of her family, her friends, and her subjects. The Princess Alice \u2014 for I wiU venture to caU her by that name, though she wore a crown \u2014 afforded one of the most striking instances that I can remember of richness of culture and rare inteUigence combined with the most pure and refined domestic sentiments. You, my lords, who knew her life well, can recall those agonising hours when she attended the dying bed of her iUustrious father, who had directed her studies and formed her tastes. You can recall, too, the moment at which she attended her royal brother, at a time when the hopes of England seemed to depend on his life ,- and now you can remember too well how, when the whole of her family were stricken by a malignant disease, she had been to them the angel in the house ; but at last, her own vital power perhaps exhausted, she has herself faUen. My lords, there is something wonderfully piteous in the immediate cause of her death. The physicians who permitted her to watch over the suffering family enjoined her under no circumstances whatever to be tempted into an embrace. Her admirable self-constraint guarded her through the crisis of this terrible complaint in safety. She remembered and observed the injunctions of her physicians. But it became her lot to break to her son \u2014 quite a youth \u2014 the death of his youngest sister, to whom he was devotedly attached. The boy was so overcome with misery that the agitated mother, to console him, clasped him in her arms \u2014 and thus received the kiss of death. My lords, I hardly know an incident more pathetic. It is one by which poets might be inspired, and which the artist in every class, whether in picture, in statue, or in gem, might find a fitting subject of commemoration. My lords, we will not dwell at this moment on the sufferings of the husband whom she has left behind, and of the children who were so devoted to her ; but our immediate duty is to offer our condolence to one whose happiness and whose sorrow always excite and command the loyalty and affectionate respect of this House. Upon her Majesty a great grief has fallen, which none but the Queen can so completely and acutely feel. Seventeen years ago her Majesty experienced the crushing sorrow of her life, and then she was particularly sustained by the daughter whom she has now lost, who assisted her by her labours, and aided her by her presence and counsel. Her Majesty now feels that the cup of sorrow was not then exhausted. No language can express the consolation we wish to extend to our Sovereign in her sorrow \u2014 such suffering is too fresh to allow of solace : but, however exalted, there are none but must be sustained by the consciousness that they possess the sympathy of a nation.\""], [365, "BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD. 345 A Tribute from an Opponent. \u2014 In the House of Lords in February, 1877, in a discussion on the Eastern Question, the Duke of Argyll \u2014 one of the most uncompromising of Lord Beaconsfield's political \u25a0opponents \u2014 made the following complimentary remarks : \" My lords, before I sit down I trust that the noble earl opposite will allow me to make a personal appeal to him. He is at the head of one of the most powerful Governments which this country has ever seen, he enjoys the confidence and affection of his party, and he has their entire and devoted allegiance in a manner and to an extent which few ministers have ever enjoyed. My lords, at one time in the course of this year the noble earl gave public intimation \u2014 otherwise I should not feel myself at liberty to notice it \u2014 that it was his desire, at no distant day, to retire from the fatigues and cares of his great office. That, my lords, was an intimation which could not but arouse the sympathy aud interest of all who know him. In the generous contests of our public life we have no private grudges and no personal enmities. The noble earl enjoys the affection of many around him \u2014 of the young men whom he has encouraged on their entering into public life, and the old men whom he has led against all hope to victory and success. But, my lords, the noble earl will not retire, if ever he does retire, with any better wish from any man than the wish to which I now give utterance, and it is this \u2014 that when he looks back to this Government, of which he is the distinguished head, ho will be able to say that he has wielded the great power of England for the purpose, and with the effect of procuring some measure of tolerable Uberty for the Christian subjects of Turkey, and that, in procuring that measure of tolerable liberty, he has secured it on such conditions as wUl guarantee them for tho future against tho odious barbarism of the Turks, and against the crashing autocracy of the Russian Czars ; for neither do wo wish to see them govern the Christian people of Turkey.\" Retrospection. \u2014 Lord Ronald Gower, in his \"Reminiscences,\" relates some observations made by Lord Beaconsfield in the last year of his life, to his guest while on a visit at Hugheuden : \" That evening Lord Beaconsfield was in great talk. ' I am,' he said, ' the unluckiest of mortals ; six bad harvests in succession, one worse than the former \u2014 this has been the cause of my overthrow. Like Napoleon, I have been beaten by the elements. Bismarck and I were perfectly d'accord. Had the late Government lasted, we would have kept the democrats of Europe iu check ; but now all is over ! ' Bismarck he much admires, and personally likes. ' He is one of the few men,' said Lord Beaconsfield, ' that at my a\u201ee I have been able to feel real attachment for ; but aU that is now over, and, were he to come to England, I should not ask to see him ; there is no such thing as sympathy or sentiment between statesmen. I have failed, and he would not care now to see me, nor I him,' he added, rather bitterly.\" Buckinghamshire Premiers.\u2014 The following is another of Lord Ronald Gower's recollections of conversation with the statesman in his retirement at Hughenden : \"The next morning was a very wet one, and after breakfast we marched up and down the smoking-room together,"], [366, "346 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. instead of going out of doors. This is a long passage-like room on the first floor, hung round with prints of Premiers and some of Lord Beaconsfield's political friends. Lord George Bentinck occupies the place of honour above the fireplace. ' Look,' said Lord Beaconsfield, as he stopped suddenly in his walk before a row of prints that hung over the writing table in that long, low-ceUinged room ; ' Look at those five engravings ; they are interesting. There have only been thirty Prime Ministers of England ; and, of those thirty, five were Buckinghamshire men. That man in powdered hair is GrenvUle (father of Lord GrenvUle), who lost us the Colonies. That is the first Lord Shelburne ; that, the Duke of Portland ; there is Lord GrenvUle, and there,' pointing to the print of Grant's portrait of himself, 'is your humble servant.' I left Hughenden at noon ; it rained in torrents, and my kind host insisted on having out his brougham to take me to Wycombe station. As we stood in the porch, amidst marble vases and busts, ferns and flowers, the post arrived, and with it the Times, which contained Mr. Gladstone's letter thanking the public for their sympathy for him during his illness. ' Did you ever hear anything like that ? It reminds one of the Pope blessing all the world from the balcony of St. Peter's,' said my host ; and then we parted.\" Proofs of Determination. \u2014 Earl GranviUe said, in the course of a speech in the House of Lords, in moving an address to the Crown on the subject of a memorial to Lord Beaconsfield (May 9, 1881) : \" My lords, I myself, assisted by some of those social advantages which Lord Beacons field was without, came into the House of Commons at a very early age, and some six months before Mr. Disraeli took his seat in that assembly. I had thus the opportunity of hearing that speech famous for its failure,* although I am convinced that, if that speech had been made in a House of Commons which knew him better, it would have been received with cheers and sympathetic, instead of derisive, laughter \u2014 a speech which, owing to the feeling of his audience, he was obUged to conclude with a sentence somewhat resembling an ejaculation of Mr. Sheridan.f which showed the unconquerable confidence which strong men have in their own power. My lords, the last time that Lord Beaconsfield spoke in this House a speech of an argumentative character was a few weeks ago. J I think it was about ten o'clock, on the second day of the debate on Afghanistan, that Lord Beaconsfield sent me a message saying that he purposed speakin\u00b0 directly. I sent him a strong remonstrance, saying that two peers who had been in office, and a third peer, one of the most remarkable speakers in the House, desired to take part in the debate ; but Lord Beaconsfield persisted, and I thought I was justified in making a rather strong complaint of his having done so. I have since learned with regret that Lord Beacons field had, just before he received that message from me, swaUowed one drug and inhaled another, in quantities nicely adapted, so as to enable * P. 315. -j- p. 170. t The speech previously quoted, in which reference was made to the \" Keys of India.\""], [367, "LORD GEORGE BENTINCK. 347 him to speak free from the depression of his complaint, during the time that that speech required for delivery. I cannot help thinking that such incidents as these, although not very great in themselves \u2014 one at the beginning and the other at the end of a Parliamentary career lasting forty-four years \u2014 were proofs of that determination which he possessed, and that contempt for obstacles which might have alarmed more weak men.\" Earl GranviUe concluded : \" The aristocracy of this country, sometimes in praise, sometimes in blame, has been described as proud, powerful, and wealthy. The democratic element, combined with this aristocratic institution, has added to its wealth, to its strength, and possibly to its pride ; and I can conceive no brighter, no more briUiant example of the way in which the portals of this assembly smoothly roU back to admit eminent and distinguished men, and welcome them to the very first ranks in the Assembly that they so enter, than the example of ' the late Lord Beaconsfield.\" (Cheers.) LORD GEORGE BENTINCK. (1802\u20141848.) His Early Devotion to the Turf. \u2014 Lord George Bentinck (wrote Mr. Disraeli) \" had sat for eighteen years in ParUament, and before he entered it had been for three years the private secretary of Mr. Canning, who had married the sister of the Duchess of Portland. Such a post would seem a happy commencement of a public career ; but whether it were the untimely death of his distinguished relative, or a natural indis position, Lord George\u2014 though he retained the seat for King's Lynn, in which he had succeeded his uncle, the late Governor-General of India \u2014 directed his energies to other than Parliamentary pursuits. For some time he had followed his profession, which was that of arms, but of late years he had become absorbed in the pastimes and fortunes of the turf, in which his whole being seemed engrossed, and which he pursued on a scale that perhaps has never been equalled. Accompanying Lord Stanley, he became in due time a member of the great Conservative opposition, and, as he- never did anything by halves, became one of the most earnest, as he certainly was one of the most enUghtened, supporters of Sir Robert Peel. His trust in that minister was indeed absolute, and he subse quently stated in conversation that when, towards the end of the session of '45, a member of the Tory party ventured to predict and pronounce the impending defection of the Minister, there was no member of tho Conservative party who more violently condemned the unfounded attack, or more readily impugned the motives of the assailant.\" A Proud Aristocracy. \u2014 In his speech on the opening of Parlia ment in 1846, Sir Robert Peel had made the remark, \"It is no easy task to insure the harmonious and united action of an ancient monarchy, a proud aristocracy, and a reformed House of Commons.\" Lord George thus com mented upon the Minister's observation a few weeks later, in the peroration of an elaborate harangue (full, as usual with the speaker's addresses, of statistics). Such as it is, it is the best example that can be cited of the"], [368, "343 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. oratorical powers of one who at the time promised to be the future leader of his party : \" We have heard, in the course of these discussions, a good deal about an ancient monarchy, a reformed House of Commons, and a proud aristocracy. Sir, with regard to our ancient monarchy I have no observation to make ; but, if so humble an individual as myself might be permitted to whisper a word in the ear of that illustrious and royal personage who, as he stands nearest, so is he justly dearest to her who sits upon the throne, I would take leave to say that I cannot but think he listened to Ul advice when, on the first night of this great discussion,* he allowed himself to be seduced by the First Minister of the Crown to come down to this House to usher in, to give eclat, and, as it were, by reflection from the Queen to give the semblance of the personal sanction of her Majesty to a measure which, be it for good or for evU, a great majority, at least of the landed aristocracy of England, of Scotland, and of Ireland, imagine fraught with deep injury, if not ruin, to them. . . I come now to the reformed House of Commons ; and, as one who was a party to that great measure, I cannot but feel a deep interest in its success, and more especiaUy in that portion of it which extended the franchise to the largest and the most respectable body in the kingdom \u2014 I mean the landed tenantry of England ; and deeply should I regret did any large proportion of those members who have been sent to Parliament to represent them in this House prove to be the men to bring lasting dishonour upon themselves, their constituencies, and this House by any act of tergiversation so gross .as to be altogether unprecedented in the annals of any reformed or unre formed House of Commons. Lastly, I come to the ' proud aristocracy.' We are a proud aristocracy, but if we are proud it is that we are proud in the chastity of our honour. H we assisted in '41 in turning the Whigs out of office because we did not consider a fixed duty of 8s. a quarter on foreign corn a sufficient protection, it was with honesty of purpose and in -singlemindedness we did so ; and, as we were not before the fact, we will not be accomplices after the fact, in the fraud by which the Whig Ministers were expeUed from power. If we are a proud aristocracy, we are proud of our honour, inasmuch as we have never been guilty, and never can be guilty, of double dealing with the farmers of England, of swindling our opponents, deceiving our friends, and betraying our con stituents.\" \" Sold \" by the Leader. \u2014 Mr. Bright, at a constituents' meeting at Birmingham in 1884, related the following of Lord George Ben tinck : \" I went up from the House of Commons one night with him. I had become acquainted with him during the inquiry into the Game Laws under the committee I moved for, and he sat upon that inquiry. WaUring up with him from the House of Commons, he spoke most strongly against Sir Robert Peel, and against the manner in which he was be traying his party. He said he did not care about the Corn Laws ; but he had horses in, I think, three counties, and he said his friends told him * Prince Albert was in the House when the Minister introduced his Corn Xaw Repeal Bill."], [369, "LORD GEORGE BENTINCK. 349 that he would save 15001. a year if the Corn Laws were repealed, and the food of horses would be so much cheaper. But, he said, what he resented was that his party should be betrayed and sold by their leader. And he told me this story. He said that when it was rumoured that Sir Robert Peel was about to capitulate, he wrote a letter to Mr. Sidney Herbert, who was then a member of Sir Robert Peel's Cabinet, and told him that, if that rumour were true, he would f oUow Sir Robert Peel with the most relentless animosity, and he and his friends, if they could, would destroy Sir Robert Peel's Government. WeU, I need not teU you that that promise was most faithfully kept.\" \u2014 The story is thus related in Morley's \" Life of Cobden : \" \" One day he (Lord G. Bentinck) walked away from the House in company with a conspicuous member of the League. With that amicable freedom of remark which Parliamentary habits permit and nourish, even between the stoutest adversaries, the Leaguer expressed his wonder that Lord George Bentinck should fear any evU from the removal of the duty. ' WeU,' Lord George answered, ' I keep horses in three counties, and they teU me that I shall save fifteen hundred a year by free trade. I do not care for that. What I cannot bear is being sold.' \" A Sacrifice. \u2014 On the day after the Derby, 1848 (says Mr. Disraeli), the writer met Lord George Bentinck in the library of the House of Commons. He was standing before the book-shelves, with a volume in his hand, and his countenance was greatly disturbed. His resolutions in favour of tho colonial interest, after aU his labours, had been negatived by the committee on the 22nd, and on the 24th his horse Surplice, whom he had parted with among the rest of his stud, solely that he might pursue without distraction his labours on behalf of the great interests of the country, had won that paramount and Olympian stake to gain which had been the object of bis life. He had nothing to console him, and nothing to sustain him except his pride. Even that deserted him before a heart which he knew at least could yield him sympathy. He gave a sort of superb groan : \" AU my life I have been trying for this, and for what have I sacrificed it ? \" he murmured. It was in vain to offer solace. \" You do not know what the Derby is,\" he moaned out. \" Yes, I do ; it is the blue ribbon of the turf.\" \" It is the blue ribbon of the turf,\" he slowly repeated to himself, and, sitting down at the table, he buried himself in a foUo of statistics. Bolting from the Course. \u2014 The writer of a \" Memoir of the fifth Duke of Richmond\" relates the foUowing of Lord George Bentinck: When canvassing at King's Lynn in company with his coUeague Lord WiUiam Lennox, at a moment when Lord George had offended some of the extreme Radical party by voting for Lord Chandos's motion during the progress of the Reform BiU, ne was shown into the lion's den of a somewhat gruff elector, who had only recently enjoyed his privilege as a voter. Lord George was aU politeness, and, presenting his elec tioneering card, asked him for the honour of his support. The indepen dent Liberal put on a smde, and, in the pleasantest manner imaginable, said, \" Good morning, my lord ; has your lordship been at Newmarket lately ? \" The candidate smiled. \" You 're very fond of a race,\" continued"], [370, "350 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the other. \" Very,\" responded the scion of the House of Portland. \" I \u25a0wish to ask you a question, my lord \u2014 a racing question.\" The noble turfite gave one of his most willing looks, and replied that he should be very happy to give aU the information he could on the subject. \" Now, my lord,\" proceeded the inquirer in a rather dry and solemn tone, \" if a horse, however thoroughbred and good he may be in other respects, is giving to swerving or bolting from the course, what should you think of him P \" \" Perfectly useless \u2014 not worth training.\" \" You've said it,\" responded the other with a demoniac laugh. \" I quite agree with your lordship. As Nathan said to David, ' Thou art the man.' How came you not to run straight on the Reform BiU ? \" His Death. \u2014 Lord George Bentinck died suddenly, while walking near the famUy seat of his father, the Duke of Portland, at Welbeck, on the 21st of September, 1848. Although he had been less than three years before the public as a parliamentary figure, his industry and mastery of commercial detail, as shown in his speeches, had impressed the nation, and, as Mr. Disraeli mentions, on the day of his interment aU the British shipping in port had their flags half-mast high. Lord Lytton, in one of Ids admirable sketches, depicts both Bentinck's career and the national -feeling at its close : \u2014 \" The lounging member seldom in his place, And then with thoughts remote upon a race, Stung into sympathy with others, blends His life with theirs, and ease for ever ends. . . Thus, victim of his own remorseless zeal, Life, overwound, snapt sudden at the wheel, And the same grief which England gives the brave Slain at their post, did homage to his grave.\" WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. (1809.) Argumentative Training. \u2014 Sir Francis Doyle relates that, when he was a young man, he spent some time with Mr. Gladstone at his father's house in Kincardineshire. \" Whilst there, I was very much struck -with the remarkable acuteness and great natural powers of Mr. Gladstone, the father (afterwards Sir John). Under his influence, appa rently, nothing was ever taken for granted between him and his sons. A succession of arguments on great topics and small topics aUke \u2014 arou ments conducted with perfect good humour, but also with the most implacable logic \u2014 formed the staple of the family conversation. Hence it is easy to see from what foundation Mr. Gladstone's skiU as a debater has been buUt up.\" \u2014 Bishop Wordsworth of St. Andrews, in his \" Annals of my Early Life,\" says: \"Towards the end of 1832, the year after Gladstone had taken his degree at Oxford, his father was dinino- at a house where my uncle, the poet, was one of the company. After dinner my uncle took occasion to congratulate Mr. John Gladstone on the re-"], [371, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 351 markable success of his son WiUiam at Oxford, and added an expression of hope and anticipation that he would be equaUy successful in the House of Commons. To which the father replied : ' Yes, sir, I thank you ; my son has certainly distinguished himself greatly at the University, and I trust he will continue to do so when he enters public life ; for there is no doubt he is a man of great ability, but,' he added, 'he has no stability.'\" Liberal Indications. \u2014 The Rev. T. Mozley, author of the \" Remi niscences of Oriel and the Oxford Movement,\" relates : \" It was very seldom that I walked into the Oxford Union. Coming into the common room one evening, Denison [George Anthony, afterwards Archdeacon] said, in my hearing, ' I have just heard the best speech I ever heard in my life, by Gladstone, against the Reform BiU [about 1831], But mark my words. That man wiU one day be a Liberal, for he argued against the bUl on Liberal grounds.\" His First Return. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone was first returned to Parliament in the Tory interest in 1832, for the borough of Newark-on-Trent, then under the influence of the Duke of Newcastle. This nobleman is cele brated as having asked the question, in response to a remonstrance against his eviction of more than a hundred persons who had voted against his wishes, \" May I not do what I Uke with my own ? \" The duke's eldest son, Lord Lincoln (the future duke, and Minister for War and the Colonies, during the Crimean hostilities), was a schoolfeUow of Mr. Gladstone's at Eton, and fellow student with him at Christ Church, Oxford; and upon Lord Lincoln's recommendation, it is presumed, the duke made his acquaintance. Mr. Gladstone had not quite completed his twenty-third year when he stood for the borough. In answer to a question put to him on the hustings, he is reported in a newspaper of the day to have said : \"I found my way to Newark because I was invited by a numerous body of men, than whom none are more respectable or intelligent. The Red Club had written to the Duke of Newcastle to know if he could recommend any gentleman as a fit and proper person, and in consequence of that application I was invited by the Red Club. I was unknown to the Red Club as much as though I had been a person of New Zealand or Kamschatka ; but my recommendation was such that the Red Club determined to invite me.\" What followed on Mr. Gladstone's part is somewhat characteristic. An elector: \"Are we to understand you, then, as the nominee of the Duke of Newcastle? \" Mr. Gladstone : \" I wiU answer that question if you teU me what yon mean by nominee.\" The elector : \" I consider the man as the nominee of the duke when he is sent by his grace to be crammed down the throats of the electors, whether they wiU or not.\" Mr. Gladstone: \"Then, according to that definition, I am not the nominee of the Duke of Newcastle.\" The elector : \" What is your definition of a nominee ? \" Mr. Gladstone : \" I am not here to give the definition. I ask what you mean by the word nominee, and according to your own explanation of it I give the answer.\" Mr. Gladstone was returned at the head of the poU. He continued to represent Newark until 1S46."], [372, "352 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. First Appearances in Parliament. \u2014 The ParUamei-t in which Mr. Gladstone first sat was the first after the passing of the Reform Act, and met in January, 1833. The young member did not address the House tiU the foUowing May, when he rose to repel some accusations respecting the treatment of slaves on his father's estates in Demerara. The abolition of slavery was then under discussion in the House, and was carried during this session. Lord Althorp's bill for the reduction of the Irish Church Establishment also passed in the same year, Mr. Gladstone speaking and voting against it. Macaulay on Gladstone. \u2014 Macaulay's sketch of Mr. Gladstone as a young man shows the impression the future Premier made upon some of his early contemporaries in ParUament. In his review of Mr. Gladstone's work on \" The State in its Relations with the Church \" [Edinburgh Review, April, 1839) the essayist wrote : \" The author of this volume is a young man of unblemished character, and of distinguished pariiamentary talents, the rising hope of those stern and unbending- Tories who f oUow, reluctantly and mutinously, a leader [ Sir Robert Peel} whose experience and eloquence are indispensable to them, but whose cautious temper and moderate opinions they abhor. It would not be at aU strange if Mr. Gladstone were one of the most unpopular men in England. But we believe that we do him no more than justice when we say that his abUities and his demeanour have obtained for him the respect and good wiU of aU parties. . . Mr. Gladstone seems to us to be, in many respects, exceedingly weU quaUfied for philosophical investiga tion. His mind is of large grasp; nor is he deficient in dialectical skill. But he does not give his intellect fair play. There is no want of light, but a great want of what Bacon would have called dry Ught. Whatever Mr. Gladstone sees is refracted and distorted by a false medium of passion and prejudices. His style bears a remarkable analogy to his mode of thinking, and indeed exercises great influence on his mode of thinking. His rhetoric, though often good of its kind, darkens and perplexes the logic which it should iUustrate. Half his acuteness and diligence, with a barren imagination and scanty vocabulary, would have saved him from almost half his mistakes. He has one gift most dangerous to a speculator \u2014 a vast command of a kind of language, grave and majestic, but of vague and uncertain import.\" Mr. Gladstone and the \" Sliding Scale.\" \u2014 Mr. Gladstone had occupied subordinate offices in the brief Administration of Sir Robert Peel in 1835, and, on the return of that statesman to power in 1841, he was made Master of the Mint as weU as Vice-President of the Board of Trade. Miss Williams Wynn, writing at the time from London to Baron Varnhagen von Ense, observed, \" They say Mr Gladstone has been given two offices in order, if possible, to keep him quiet, and, by giving him too much to do, to prevent him from troubling his head about the Church.\" In presenting himself for re-election at Newark on accepting Ids new offices, it is interesting to note the future promoter of the Commercial Treaty with France and simUar measures declaring protectionist prin ciples. \"There are,\" said he, \" two points on which the British farmer"], [373, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 353 may rely; the first of which is that adequate protection wiU be given to him ; and the second is that protection wiU be given to him through the means of the sliding scale \" (regulating the duties on corn accord ing to the market price per quarter). In the preparation of this \"sliding scale,\" which was introduced in 1842, it was understood that Mr. Gladstone had rendered active assistance to the head of the Govern ment. A Reply to Lord Palmerston.\u2014 In the adjourned debate on the foroign policy of the Government, in June, 1850, Mr. Gladstone made tho foUowing remarks in reference to Lord Palmerston's famous declaration, \" Civis Romanus sum : \" \u2014 \" He vaunted, amid the cheers of his supporters, that under his administration an Englishman should be, throughout the world, what the citizen of Rome had been. But I ask, what then was a Roman citizen P He was the member of a privUeged caste ; he belonged to a conquering race, to a nation that held aU nations bound down by the hand of Imperial power. For him there was to be an exceptional system of law ; for him principles were to be asserted, and by him rights were to be enjoyed, that were denied to the rest of the world. Is such, then, the view of the noble lord as to the relation that is to subsist between England and other countries ? Does he make the claim for us that we are to be uplifted on a platform high above the standing-ground of all other nations ? It is, indeed, too clear that too much of this notion is lurking in his mind ; that he adopts, in part, that vain conception that we, forsooth, have a mission to be the censors of abuses aud imperfections among the other countries of the world ; that we are to be the universal schoolmasters, and that all who hesitate to recognise our office should have the war of diplo macy, at least, forthwith declared against them. And certainly, if the business of a Foreign Secretary is merely to carry on diplomatic war, all must admit the perfection of the noble lord in the discharge of his func tions. But it is not the duty of a Foreign Minister to be like a knight errant, ever pricking forth, armed at all points, to challenge aU comers, and lay as many adversaries as possible sprawling, or the noble lord would be a master of his art ; but to maintain that sound code of international principles which is a monument of human wisdom, and a precious inheri tance bequeathed by our fathers for the preservation of the future brother hood of nations.\" An Impulsive Speech. \u2014 In tho debate on the Budget of the Derby Ministry in December, 1853, Mr. Disraeli (Chancellor of the Exchequer) closed his defence of the measure in a warm and bitter speech, in which he retorted on his antagonists the charge of incompetence which they had made against himself. Sir Charles Wood (a former Chancellor) especially was the object of his animadversion, and was told, \" If he has learned his business, he has still to learn that petulance is not sarcasm, and that insolence is not invective.\" Sir James Graham also, Mr. Disraeli remarked, he looked upon with regard, but not with respect ; and ho concluded by denouncing the coalition among his adversaries, and declaring, \" England does not love coalitions.\" It had been understood that his speech would close the debate; but the moment he sat down, A A"], [374, "354 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. amid much cheering and counter-cheering, Mr. Gladstone sprang to his feet. \" This speech,\" said he, \" is one which must be answered, and answered at the moment. The character of England, involved in that of her public men, the character of England is at stake. . . The right honourable' gentleman must permit me to tell him that he is not entitled to charge with insolence men of as high position and of as high character in this House as himself. And I must tell him that whatever else he may have learnt, he has not learned to keep within those limits, in dis cussion, of moderation and of forbearance that ought to restrain the conduct and language of every member of this House ; the disregard of which, while it is an offence in the meanest amongst us, is an offence of tenfold weight when committed by the leader of the House of Commons.\" Mr. Gladstone, who had scarcely been heard for the storm of interrup tion raised by the opposite party, then went on to review the Budget in detail, and denounced it as unsound and delusive. In the division which followed, the Government were defeated by 305 to 286. Commissioner Extraordinary to the Ionian Islands. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone lent a general support to the second administration of the Earl of Derby, in 1858. Towards the close of that year he undertook, at the request of the Prime Minister, a special mission to the Ionian Islands, then under British protectorate. He declared the object of his mission to the Senate on the 3rd of December, saying he had been sent to \" examine in what way Great Britain may most honourably and amply discharge the obligations which, for purposes European and Ionian rather than British, she has contracted.\" The Legislative Assembly of the Islands passed, in January, 1859, a resolution declaring for union with Greece, and Mr. Gladstone \u2014 whose knowledge of the Greek language was of important service in this mission \u2014 induced the body to appoint a com mittee to draw up suitable representations to the protecting Powers. The petition was not then granted, but the Islands were offered a constitution similar to that of the British colonies. After the expulsion of King Otho from the throne of Greece, and the election of Prince George of Denmark to the crown, the Ionian Islands were formaUy ceded to Greece by the protecting Powers. A School for Statesmen. \u2014 In a speech on Lord Derby's Reform Bill iu 1859, Mr. Gladstone asked : \" Is it not, under Providence, to be attributed to a succession of distinguished statesmen, introduced at an early age into this House, and once made known in this House securing to themselves the general favour of their countrymen, that we enjoy our present extension of popular liberty, and, above aU, the durable form which that liberty has assumed ? \" Small Boroughs and Great Men. \u2014 In the same debate Mr. Gladstone thus defended the existence of small boroughs : \" Allow me to state the case of six men \u2014 Mr. Pelham, Lord Chatham, Mr. Fox, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Canning, and Sir Robert Peel. Mr. Pelham entered this house for the borough of Seaford in 1719, at the ago of twenty-two ; Lord Chatham entered it in 1735, for Old Sarum, at the age of twenty-six ; Mr. Fox in 1764, for Midhurst, at the age, I think, of twenty ; Mr. Pitt in 1781, for"], [375, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 355 Appleby, at the age of twenty-one ; Mr. Canning in 1793, for Newport, at the age of twenty-two ; and Sir Robert Peel in 1809, for the city of Cashel, at the age of twenty-one. Now here are six men, every one of whom was a leader in this House. I take them because the youngest is older than the youngest of those who now sit here, and because the mention of their names can give rise to no personal feeling. Here are six men whom you cannot match out of the history of the British House of Commons for the hundred years which precede our own day. Every one of them was a leader in this House ; almost everyone of them was a Prime Minister. AU of them entered ParUament for one of those boroughs -where influence of different kinds prevaUed. Every one of them might, if he had chosen, after giving proof of his powers in this House, have sat for any of the open constituencies of the country, and many of them did so. Mr. Pelham, after sitting for Seas ord in one Parliament, represented Sussex for all the rest of his life. Lord Chatham never, I think, represented an open constituency. Mr. Fox, after sitting for Midhurst, became the chosen for Westminster. Mr. Pitt went from Appleby at a veiy early age to the University of Cambridge. Mr. Canning went from Newport to Liverpool, and Sir Robert Peel from Cashel to the University of Oxford. Now, what was the case of Sir Robert Peel ? The University, on account of a conscientious difference of opinion, refused the continuance of his services. They might have been lost to the British ParUament, at that moment at aU events. But in Westbury he found an immediate refuge \u2014 for so it must be called ; and he continued to sit for a small borough for the remainder of his life. Mr. Canning in the same way, not losiug but resigning the representation of Liverpool, found it more conducive to the public business that he should become the representative of a smaU borough for the rest of his days. What does this show ? It shows that small boroughs were the nursery-ground in which these men were educated \u2014 men who not only were destined to lead this House, to govern the country, to be the strength of England at home and its ornament abroad, but who likewise, when once they had an opportunity of proving their powers in this House, became the chosen of large constituencies, and the favourites of the nation.\" A \" Gigantic Innovation.\" \u2014 In the debate that took place July 5th, 1860, on the action of tho House of Lords * in rejecting the bill for tho abolition of the Paper Duties which had been sent up from the Lower House, Mr. Gladstone (then ChanceUor of the Exchequer) said : \" It appears to mo to be the determination of one moiety of this House that there shall bo no debate upon tho constitutional principles which are involved in this question ; and I must say that, considering that gentle- men opposite are upon this occasion the partisans of a gigantic innovation \u2014 the most gigantic and the most dangerous that has been attempted in our times \u2014 I may compliment them upon the prudence that they show in resolving to be its silent partisans. Now, Sir, I should like to know with what language and in what tones those gentlemen who assume the name * See p. 245. A a 2"], [376, "356 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. of Conservative politicians would argue in support of a great encroachment by one house of the legislature upon the other.\" Mr. Gladstone in Mid-Career. \u2014 Tho following lines were written in 1860, by one who was an acute observer of political character. They appear in Mr. Bagehot's \" Biographical Studies \" : \u2014 \" Mr. Gladstone is the greatest orator in the House of Commons ; he never aUows a single important topic to pass by without teUing us what he thinks of it ; and yet we are all of us in doubt about him. What he wiU do, and what he wiU think \u2014 still more, why he will do it, and why he will think it \u2014 are qu\u0153stiones vexai\u00e6 at every political conjuncture. At tho very last ministerial crisis, when every voice on Lord John RusseU's resolution* was of critical importance, no one knew tiU nearly the last hour how Mr. Gladstone would vote, and in the end he voted against his present colleagues. The House of Commons gossips are generally wrong about him. Nor is the uncertainty confined to parliamentary divisions ; it extends to his whole career. Who can calculate his future course P Who can teU whether he wiU be the greatest orator of a great Administration ; whether he wiU rule the House of Commons ; whether he wiU be, as his gifts at first sight mark him out to be, our greatest statesman ? or whether, below the gangway,f he wiU utter uninteUigible discourses ; wiU aid in destroying many Ministries and share in none ; wUl pour forth during many hopeless years a bitter, a splendid, and a vituperative eloquence P \" The \" Danger Signal.\" \u2014 The foUowing passage occurred in a speech of Mr. Gladstone's in 1864, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Government of Lord Palmerston : \" We are told that the working classes do not agitate for an extension of the franchise ; but is it desirable that we should wait until they do agitate ? In my opinion, agitation by the working classes, upon any political subject whatever, is a thing not to be waited for, not to be made a condition previous to any parliamentary movement, but, on the contrary, it is a thing to be depre cated, and, if possible, anticipated and prevented by wise and provident measures. An agitation by the working classes is not like an agitation by the classes above them, the classes possessed of leisure. The agitation of the classes having leisure is easily conducted. It is not -with them that every hour of time has a money value ; their wives and children are not dependent on the strictly reckoned results of those hours of labour. When a working man finds himself in such a condition that ho must abandon that daily labour on which he is strictly dependent for his daily bread, when he gives up the profitable application of his time, it is then that, in railway language, the danger signal is turned on; for he does it only because he feels a strong necessity for action, and a distrust of the rulers who, as he thinks, have driven him to that necessity.\" * Against the Reform Bill of the Derby-Disraeli Ministry in 1859. f Mr. Gladstone, during some of his \" independent \" years, occupied a promi nent seat in that part of the House."], [377, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 357 \" Unmuzzled \" by Oxford University. \u2014 At the general election in July, 1865, Mr. Gladstone lost his seat for Oxford University, the numbers on the 18th, after six days' poUing, standing thus: Sir W. Heathcote, 3236; Mr. Gathorne Hardy, 1904; Mr. Gladstone, 1724\u2014 minority 180. It having become evident, during the two or three days before the close of the poll, that his seat was in danger, Mr. Gladstone was nominated on the 17th for South Lancashire ; and when the result at Oxford was known, he made his appearance at the Free Trade Hall iu Manchester to address the electors. \" At last, my friends,\" said he, \" I have come amongst you ; and I have come, to use an expression which has become very famous, and is not likely to be forgotten \u2014 I am come among you 'unmuzzled.'* After an anxious struggle of eighteen years, during which the unbounded devotion and indulgence of my friends maintained me in the arduous position of representative of the University of Oxford, I have been driven from my seat. . . I have loved the University of Oxford with a deep and passionate love, and as long as I breathe that attachment will continue. If my affection is of the smallest advantage to that great, that ancient, that noble institution, that advantage, such as it is \u2014 and it is most insignificant \u2014 Oxford wiU possess as long as I live. . . I am aware of no cause for the votes which have given a majority .against me in the University of Oxford, except the fact that the strongest \u2022conviction the human mind can receive, that an overpowering sense of the public interests, that the practical teachings of experience, to which from my youth Oxford herself taught me to lay open my mind \u2014 aU these had shown me the folly, and, I wiU say, the madness of refusing to join in the generous sympathies of my countrymen, by adopting what I must call an obstructive policy.\" Transmigrations. \u2014 After his defeat at Oxford in 1865, Mr. Glad stone wrote as follows to Bishop Wilberforce, in reply to a letter of sympathy : \" Do not join with others in praising me because I am not angry, only sorry, and that deeply. For my revenge \u2014 which I do not desire, but would baffle if I could \u2014 all lies in that little word future ' in my address, which I wrote with a consciousness that it is deeply charged with meaning, and that that which shall come will come. There have been two great deaths, or transmigrations of spirit, in my political existence \u2014 one, very slow, the breaking of ties with my original party ; the other, very short and sharp, the breaking of the tie with Oxford. There wiU probably be a third, and no more.\" The bishop intimated that he did not understand the latter sentence; to which Mr. Gladstone replied, \"The oracular sentence has little bearing on present affairs or prospects, and may stand in its proper darkness.\" A Guess ? \u2014 Bishop WUberforce also wrote, in a letter to Sir C. Anderson (March, 1868) respecting his friend's course in the Irish Church disestablishment : \" It is altogether a bad business, and I am afraid \u25a0Gladstone has been drawn into it from the unconscious influence of his restlessness at being out of office.\" * Seo p. 297, \" Lord Palmerston and Mr. Gladstone.\""], [378, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 358 His Connection with the Liberal Party.\u2014 In the course of a debate on Parliamentary Reform in AprU, 1866, Mr. Gladstone was taunted by Mr. Lowe with promoting Reform measures in his later years, while he had strongly opposed the first Reform BiU, in the Oxford Union Debating Society in 1831. In his reply, addressing the members of the- Liberal party, he thus alluded to the change from his earUer convictions which had brought him amongst them : \" I came amongst you an outcast from those with whom I associated, driven from their ranks, I admit, by no arbitrary act, but by the slow and resistless force of conviction. I came among you, to make use of the legal phraseology, in forma pauperis. I had nothing to offer you but faithful and honourable service; you. received me as Dido received the shipwrecked \u00c6neas : 'Excepi ejectum littore, egentem.' And I only trust you may not hereafter, at any time, have to complete the sentence in regard to me : ' Et regni, demens ! in parte locavi.' You received me with kindness, indulgence, generosity, and I may even say with some measure of your confidence. And the relation between us has assumed such a form that you can never be my debtors, but that I must be for ever in your debt.\" \" Resurgam.\" \u2014 A Full House. \u2014 The close of the same debate was marked by one of the most forcible passages of Mr. Gladstone's oratory. AUuding to the division then about to be taken on the second reading of the Reform BiU of Lord RusseU's Government, he said : \" This BiU is in a state of crisis and of peril, and the Government along with it. We stand or fall with it, as has been declared by my noble friend Lord Russell. We stand with it now ; we may faU with it a short time hence. If we do so faU, we, or others in our places, shaU rise with it hereafter. I shaU not attempt to measure with precision the forces that are to be arranged against us in the coining issue. Perhaps the great division of to-night is not to be the last, but only the first of a series of divisions. At some point of the contest you may possibly succeed. You may drive us from our seats. You may slay, you may bury the measure that we have introduced. But we wUl write upon its gravestone for an epitaph this Une, with certain confidence in its fulfilment : \"Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor.\" You cannot fight against the future. Time is on our side. The great social forces which move onwards in their might and majesty, and which the tumult of these debates does not for a moment impede or disturb, those great social forces are against you ; they work with us ; they are marshalled in our support.

Irish Church Disestablishment. \u2014 The first clear intimation of Mr. Gladstone's policy with respect to the Irish Church took ParUament and the country by surprise. It occurred in a debate on the state of Ireland, introduced by an independent member (Mr. Maguire), March 16th, 1868 ; Mr. DisraeU's Government then being in office.* After speaking at some length on the various grievances of which Ireland complained, and of the Church Establishment among them, Mr. Gladstone referred to his former speeches on the subject, and said : \" I did not use one word, to my knowledge, which was contrary to the opinion I held then and hold now \u2014 namely, that in order to the settlement of the question of the Irish Church, that Church, as a State Church, must cease to exist. . . Without the slightest reproach to any of those who bear office in the Irish Church, I am convinced, from a long observation, that that institution is, and by the law of its existence must be, the home and last refuge of the spirit of ascendancy ; and as that which, beyond all particular and special measures, we need, is the expulsion of tho spirit of ascendancy from Ireland, I take leave to say that, in order to that expulsion, we must now proceed to deal decisively with that question of the Irish Church.\" He further remarked : \" My opinion is that religious equality is a phrase that requires further development, and I wiU develop it further by saying that, iu this reUgious equality in Ireland, I, for my part, include in its fullest extent the word \u2014 a very grave word, I do not deny, and I think we cannot be too careful to estimate its gravity before we come to a final conclusion \u2014 the very grave word disestablishment. If we are to do any good at all by meddling with the Church in Ireland, it must, in my judgment, be by putting an end to its existence as a State Church.\" \u2014 With reference to the unexpected character of this announcement, Mr. Disraeli remarked, in the debate upon going into committee upon Mr. Gladstone's resolutions (April 3rd, 1868), that the right honourable gentleman had come forward \" all of a sudden, like a thief in the night.\" Use of Quotation. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone's frequent and skilful use of quotation in debate is weU known ; but quotation probably never took a wider range in so brief a compass, or was more effective, than in the foUow ing passage of his speech on moving his Irish Church resolutions, March 30th, 1868 : \" There are many who think that to lay hands upon the National Church Establishment of a country is a profane and unhaUowed act. I respect that feeling. I sympathise with it. I sympathise with it while I think it my duty to overcome and repress it. But if it bo an error, it is an error entitled to respect, There is something in the idea of a National Establishment of religion, of a solemn appropriation of a part of the commonwealth, for conferring upon aU who are ready to receive it * In a speech in the House of Commons in March, 1865, Mr. Gladstone (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) had so far endorsed a resolution antagonistic to the Irish Church, as to admit that the state of that Establishment was \" un satisfactory.\""], [380, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 360 what wo know to be an inestimable benefit ; of saving that portion of the inheritance from private selfishness, in order to extract from it, if we can, pure and unmixed advantages of the highest order for the population at large \u2014 there is something in this so attractive, that it is an image that must always command the homage of the many. It is somewhat like the kingly ghost iu Hamlet, of which one of the characters of Shakespeare says\u2014 ' We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence ; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.' But, Sir, this is to view a religious Establishment upon one side only, upon what I may call the ethereal side. It has likewise a side of earth ; and here I cannot do better than quote some lines written by the present Archbishop of Dublin [Dr. Trench] at a time when his genius was devoted to the Muses. He said, in speaking of mankind \u2014 ' We, who did our lineage high Draw from beyond the starry sky, Are yet upon the other side To earth and to its dust allied.* And so the Church Establishment, regarded in its theory and in its aim, is beautiful and attractive. Yet what is it but an appropriation of public property, an appropriation of the fruits of labour and of skiU to certain purposes ? and unless those purposes be fulfilled, that appropriation cannot be justified. Therefore, Sir, I cannot but feel that we must set aside fears which thrust themselves upon the imagination, and act upon the sober dictates of our judgment. I think it has been shown that the cause for action is strong \u2014 not for precipitate action, not for action beyond our powers, but for such action as the opportunities of the times and the condition of Parliament, if there be but a ready wiU, wiU amply and easily admit of. If I am asked as to my expectations of the issue of this struggle, I begin by frankly avowing that I, for one, would not have entered into it unless I believed that the final hour was about to sound : ' Venit summa dies et ineluctahile fatum.' \" Elasticity. \u2014 Bishop WUberforce and Mr. Gladstone were the guests of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield in December, 1868, and the bishop noted in his diary, \" Gladstone struck with Salisbury : ' Never saw a more perfect host.' \" At the same time the bishop wrote to a son : \" I have very much enjoyed meeting Gladstone. He is so delightfully true and the same ; just as fuU of interest in every good thing of every kind, and so exactly the opposite of the mystery man.* . . When people talk of Gladstone going mad, they do not take into account the wonderful elasticity of his mind, and the variety of his interests. Now, this morning (I am writing in the train on the way to London), after breakfast, he and Salisbury and I and CardweU had a walk round this beautiful park, and * One of the names at that time bestowed on Mr. Disraeli."], [381, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 361 he was just as much interested in the size of the oaks, their probable age, &c., as if no care of state ever pressed upon him.

He is now writing opposite to me in the railway carriage, on his way to Windsor.\" \u2014 Lord Malmesbury wrote in his diary in 1859 : \" Gladstone, who was always fond of music, is now quite enthusiastic about negro melodies, singing them with the greatest spirit and enjoyment, never leaving out a verse, and evidently preferring such as ' Camp Town Races.' \" The Orator and his Audience. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone, iu his \" Studies of Homer and the Homeric Age,\" used the following happy Ulustration of oratorical power: \"The orator's work, from its very inception, is in extricably mixed up with practice. It is cast in the mould offered to him by the mind of his hearers. It is an influence principally received from his audience (so to speak) in vapour, which he pours back upon them in a flood.\" His Popularity. \u2014 Mr. Walter Bagehot, in his \"Essays on Parlia mentary Reform,\" mentioned the case of a Liberal candidate in 1868, who remarked, \" When I do not know what to say, I say ' Gladstone,' and then they are sure to cheer, and I have time to think.\" This reUance on Mr. Gladstone's popularity as a resource was no uncommon thing under such circumstances, both then and for many years after ; and often seemed to render argument unnecessary The Lords \" in a Balloon.\" \u2014 This saying was applied freely to the Upper House in 1869, in consequence of an expression made use of by Mr. Gladstone in the discussion of the Lords' amendments to the Irish Church Bill. The following is the passage: \"The right honourable gentleman says truly that we ought to approach in a spirit of respect the amendments made by the House of Lords. As I come to discuss them I shall endeavour, and my colleagues will do the same, to couform to that rule. We can hardly expect of the House of Lords that they should appre ciate the humble considerations which govern the special relations between each member of Parliament and the portion of the British people that he represents. From the great eminence on which they sit, they can no more discuss the minute particulars of our transactions than could a man in a balloon. Had the House of Lords gone through the experience of such an election as the last, it would bo absolutely impossible for them, as honourable politicians, to have consented to the clause [in favour of \" concurrent endowment\"] which they have put into this bill.\" The Upas Tree. \u2014 This illustration was used by Mr. Gladstone on the occasion of his last address in canvassing the electors of South-West Lancashire, at Wigan, Oct, 23, 1868. He said : \" It is clear the Church of Ireland offers to us indeed a great question, but even that question is but one of a group of questions. There is the Church of Ireland, there is the land of Ireland, there is the education of Ireland ; there are many sub jects, all of which depend upon one greater than them all ; they are all so many branches from one trunk, and that truuk is the tree of what is caUed Protestant ascendancy. Gentlemen, I look, for one. to this Protestant people to put down Protestant ascendancy, which pretends to seek its"], [382, "362 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. objects by doing homage to religious truth, and instead of consecrating politics desecrates religion. It is upon that system that we are banded together to make war. . . We aim at the destruction of that system of ascendancy which, though it has been crippled and curtailed by former measures, yet still is allowed to exist. It is still there, like a tall tree of noxious growth, lifting its head to heaven and darkening and poisoning the land, so far as its shadow can extend; it is still there, gentlemen, and now at length the day has come when, as we hope, the axe has been laid to the root of that tree, and it nods and quivers from its top to its base. It wants, gentlemen, one stroke more, the stroke of these elections. It will then, once for all, totter to its fall, and on the day when it falls the heart of Ireland wiU leap for joy.\" Rashness Rebuhed. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone's comparison of the Irish Church to the upas tree afforded an opportunity to a youthful opponent (Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice) to twit him in the House of Com mons in the foUowing way : \" No doubt, if one looked long enough at a star he might persuade himself it was a comet ; if he looked long enough at a bush, he might persuade himself it was an upas tree ; and if ho ruminated on a very smaU grievance long enough, ho might per suade himself it was a very large one.\" To this the Prime Minister replied : \" My noble friend the member for Calne seconded this vote of censure with a modest apology for his own youth and inexperience ; but I would say that perhaps that apology was scarcely necessary. We are aware that in other and darker ages it was the custom of the older members of the human famUy to censure and even to chastise the youth. We live in more enlightened times, and it may be quite proper that that custom should be now reversed ; if a new experiment is to be made, I know of no one who will try it with greater satisfaction and confidence in his own mind than my noble friend.\" (Laughter.) Imperial Interests First. \u2014 In committee on the Edneation Bill in 1871, the views of Mr. Gladstone's Government were opposed by a large section of his supporters from the Nonconformist body, among them chiefly Mr. Miall. On the thhd reading of the measure, that gentleman, complaining of the want of consideration which he thought had been exhibited towards his friends, declared that \" they could not stand this sort of thing much longer.\" Whereupon Mr. Gladstone rose and said : \" I hope that my honourable friend will not continue his support of the Government one moment longer than he deems it con sistent with his sense of duty and right. For God's sake, Sir, let him withdraw it the moment he thinks it better for the cause he has at heart that he shoidd do so. So long as my honourable friend thinks fit to give us his support, we wiU co-operate with my honourable friend for everv purpose we have in canimou; but when we think his opinions and demands exacting, when we think he looks too much to the section of the community he adorns, and too little to the interests of the people at large, we must then recollect that wo are the Government of the Queen, and that those who have assumed the high responsibility of administering the affairs of this Empire must endeavour to forget tho parts in the whole,"], [383, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 363 and must, in the great measures they introduce into the House, propose to themselves no meaner or narrower object than the welfaro of the Empire at large.\" An Impertinent Question. \u2014 Mr. Whalley, long member for Peterborough, and noted in Parliament for his opposition to the annual grant to Maynooth, addressed a letter to Mr. Gladstone in 1871, caUing upon him, on behalf of the constituents of Peterborough, to answer the question whether he was a member of the Church of Rome. To this Mr. Gladstone, then staying at Balmoral, replied (quoting the terms of the question addressed to him) : \" I quite agree with those of your con stituents, on whose behalf you address me, in thinking that the question,. ' Whether the Prime Minister of this country is a member of the Church of Rome,' and being such not only declines to avow it, but gives through a long life aU the external signs of belonging to a different communion, is a ' question of great political importance,' and this not only ' in the present,' but in any possible ' condition of the Liberal,' or any other ' party.' For it involves the question whether he is the basest creature in the kingdom which he has a share in ruling ; and instant ejectment from his office would be the smallest of the punishments he would deserve. If I have said this much upon the present subject, it has been out of personal respect to you. For I am entirely convinced that, while the question you have put to me is in truth an insulting one, you have put it only from having failed to notice its true character ; since I have observed, during an experience of many years, that even when you undertake the most startling duties, you perform them in the gentlest and most considerate manner.\" The Abolition of Purchase in the Army. \u2014 The Army Regu- lation Bill of Mr. Gladstone's Government, which abolished the purchase system, passed by only a narrow majority in the House of Commons on the third reading, on the 3rd of July, 1871 ; an adverse motion by Mr. Graves being defeated by 239 to 231. In the House of Lords, on the 17th of July, the second reading was refused by 155 to 130. On the 20th, Mr. Gladstone, in reply to a question by Sir George Grey, said that legally there was no purchase except under the Queen's Regulations on the subject ; and the Government had resolved to recommend the Queen to cancel the Royal warrant under which purchase was allowed. That advice had been accepted by her Majesty, a now warrant had been framed, and from the 1st of November purchase in the army would be abolished. He said the Government had no other object in view but simplicity, despatch, and the observance of constitutional usage \u2014 a statement which was met with loud cries of \" Oh ! \" and counter-cheers. On the 31st of July, on the second reading of the Army Compensation Bill, the following resolu^ tion passed the House of Lords by 162 to 82 : \" That this House, in assenting to the second reading of this bill, desires to express its opinion that the interposition of the Executive, during the progress of a measure submitted to Parliament by her Majesty's Government, in order to attain, by the exercise of the prerogative, and without the aid of Parliament, the principal object included in that measure, is calculated to depreciate and"], [384, "364 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. neutralise the uidependent action of the Legislature, and is strongly to bo condemned ; and this House assents to the second reading of this biU only in order to securo the officers of her Majesty's army the compensation to which they are entitled consequent on the abolition of purchase in the army.\" A Scene with his Constituents. \u2014 One of the most striking scenes in Mr. Gladstone's career occurred when he met an enormous mass of his constituents and others at Blackheath, in October, 1871. His Ministry had been waning in popularity, and many of the people of Greenwich had been especiaUy angered against him, by reductions made in the dockyard establishments of Woolwich and elsewhere. After a few words from one of his supporters, which were inaudible, Mr. Gladstone came forward bareheaded to address the crowd, amid what a writer in the Daily News described as \" a fearful tempest of din. From aU around the skirts of the crowd rose a something between a groan and a howl. So fierce was it that for a little space it might laugh to scorn the burst of cheering that strove to overmaster it. The battle raged between the two sounds, and looking straight upon the excited crowd stood Mr. Gladstone, calm, resolute, patient. He presently gained a hearing, and long before he had finished he had so enthraUed his audience, that impatient disgust was expressed at the handful who stiU continued their abortive efforts at interruption.\" Mr. Gladstone concluded his speech by a passage which is among the most characteristic of his style : \" Gentlemen, I shall go from this meeting, having given you the best account of my position in my feeble power, within the time and under the circumstances of the day \u2014 I shall go from this meeting strengthened by the comfort of your kindness and your indulgence to resume my humble share in public labours. No motive will more operate upon me in stimulating me to the discharge of duty than the gratitude with which I look back upon the, I believe, unexampled circumstances under which you made me your representative. But I shall endeavour \u2014 I shall make it my hope \u2014 to show that gratitude less by words of idle compliment or hoUow flattery than by a manful endeavour, according to the measure of my gifts, humble as they may be, to render service to a Queen who lives in the hearts of tho people, and to a nation, with respect to which I will say that through aU posterity, whether it be praised or whether it be blamed, whether it be acquitted or whether it be condemned, it wiU be acquitted or condemned upon this issue, of having made a good or a bad use of the most splendid opportunities; of having turned to proper account, or failed to turn to account, the powers, tho energies, the faculties which rank the people of this little island among the few great nations that have stamped their name and secured their fame amongst the greatest nations of the world.\" Political Quacks. \u2014 It was in his address to the Greenwich electors at Blackheath, in 1871, that Mr. Gladstone observed : \" Let the Government labour to its utmost ; let the Legislature labour days and nights in your service ; but, after the very best has been attained and achieved, the question whether the English father is to be the father of a happy family and the centre of a united home is a question which must"], [385, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 3(55 depend mainly upon himself. And those who propose to you, whoever they may be, schemes like those seven points of which I have spoken ; those who promise to the dweUers in towns that every one of them shaU have a house and garden in free air with ample space ; those who tell you that there shall be markets for selling at wholesale prices retail quantities \u2014 I won't say they are impostors, because no doubt they are sincere ; but I will say they are quacks.\" A Minister's Duty. \u2014 \"It is the duty of a Minister to stand like a \u00abrall of adamant between the people and the Sovereign.\" \u2014 Speech at Garston, Nov. 14, 1868. Tyranny of Minorities. \u2014 In a debate on the second reading of the Irish Land Bill, in 1870, Mr. Gladstone (then Prime Minister) dropped a remark in reference to the conduct of some of his opponents, which was destined to receive forcible illustration in the House a few years later \" The oppression of a majority,\" said he, \" is detestable and odious. The oppression of a minority is only by one degree less detestable and odious.\" A Touching Speech. \u2014 On the rejection of Mr. Gladstone's Irish University scheme in 1873, Mr. Forster wrote as follows in his diary : \" March 13. \u2014 Cabinet again at twelve. Decided to resign. Gladstone made us quite a touching little speech. He began playfully. This was the last of some 150 Cabinets or so, and he wished to say to his coUeagues with what ' profound gratitude ' And here he completely broke down, and coidd say nothing, except that he would not enter on the details. Tears came to my eyes, and we were aU touched.\" Home Rule and Disintegration. \u2014 On the occasion of Mr. Gladstone's visit to Aberdeen, during his premiership in 1871, to have the freedom of the city conferred upon him, ho made some remarks on the subject of Home Rule, and said that, if it were established in Ireland, people would be equally entitled to it in Scotland. He added : \" More over, I protest on behalf of Wales, in which I have lived a good deal, and where there are 800,000 people, who to this day, such is their sentiment of nationaUty, speak hardly anything but their own Celtic tongue \u2014 a larger number than speak the Celtic tongue, I apprehend, in Scotland, and a larger number than speak it, I apprehend, in Ireland \u2014 I protest on behalf of Wales that they are entitled to Home Rule there. Can any sensible man, can any rational man, suppose that at this time of day, in this condition of the world, we are going to disintegrate the great capital institutions of this country, for the purpose of making ourselves ridiculous in the sight of all mankind, and crippling any power we possess for bestowing benefits through legislation upon the inhabitants of Ireland P \" Local Government in Ireland.\u2014 A \" Telescopic \" Speech.\u2014 In tho debate on the Address, Feb. 7, 1882, in speaking to an amendment moved by Mr. P. J. Smyth (Tipperary), Mr. Gladstono made some remarks which created a great impression among members of aU parties. He said: \"We (tho Government) attach the greatest value to the extension \u2014 perhaps I ought almost to say to the establishment\u2014 of the principle of"], [386, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 366 local government in Ireland. We agree that one of the great evils under which that country labours is the want, of local administration and centralisation of authority. We believe that the state of Ireland never *an be satisfactory until its people have learned, by tradition and practice, to exercise those powers of local government which are so beneficial in other portions of the country. . . The honourable gentleman the member for King's County (Mr. Molloy) and the honourable gentleman the member for County Limerick (Mr. O'Snllivan) have recommended that arrangements should be made to enable an Irish legislative authority to deal with Irish affairs. They have declared their adhesion to the integrity of the Empire, and their desire that Imperial questions should continue to be treated in an Imperial Parliament, in which Ireland should be represented. Sir, so far as these declarations go, I do not think there is anything to which exception can justly be taken. But those gentlemen have, at the same time, shown how differently they construe the words which they themselves have used. I will not undertake to say at what decision this House might arrive, provided a plan were before it under which the local affairs of Ireland could be, by some clear and definite line, separated from the Imperial affairs of Ireland. But neither these gentlemen, nor, so far as I know, Mr. Butt before them, or Mr. O'ConneU \u25a0before him, ever distinctly explained, in an intelligible and practical form, the manner in which the real knot of this question was to be untied. The principle upon which they profess to proceed is, that purely Irish matters are to be dealt with by a purely Irish authority \u2014 Imperial matters to be left to an Imperial authority, in which, as I have said, Ireland should be represented. But they have not told us by what authority it is to be determined which matters, taken one by one, are Irish, and which matters are Imperial. Until, Sir, they lay before the House a plan in which they go to the very bottom of the subject, and give us to understand in what manner that division of jurisdiction is to be accomplished, a practical consideration of this subject cannot reaUy be arrived at ; and, for my own part, I know not how any effective judgment upon it can be pronounced. But of one thing I am well convinced \u2014 that neither this House of Commons, nor any House which may succeed it, will at any time assent to any measure by which the one paramount central authority, necessary for holding together in perfect union and compactness this great Empire, <;an possibly be in the slightest degree impaired.\" (Cheers.) \u2014 These observations were thus commented upon, the following evening, by Mr. Gibson (member for Dublin University): \"It had been said that the Prime Minister was misunderstood. That was the fate of many people ; but he must say that to him the speech of the right honourable gentleman meant anything or nothing. It was a speech of a very telescopic -character, capable of being pulled out or shut up at wiU, as it was intended it should be read. The Prime Minister was really on velvet iu the matter. He could say, on the one hand, ' I never said a word in favour of Home Rule ; ' and, on the other, could point to words which seemed to convey that he would consider, in a broad and catholic spirit, any proposition in that direction which might be made. As there were"], [387, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 367 rumours of dissolution in the air, it was, perhaps, intended that the speech should be read in various ways.\" Minority Representation. \u2014 Agamemnon's Tomb. \u2014 In a speech to the Nottingham Liberal Union, in September, 1877, Mr. Glad stone said : \" There has been a great deal said in late years in Parliament by gentlemen who think it is very desirable that there should be a repre sentation of minorities, and various methods have been proposed for securing that representation j but there is one method which appears to me by far the best, and that was the one adopted for the last election for Nottingham. You had got two places to fiU, and you tried to put four men into them. I do not know if any of you wiU be surprised at my introducing the subject, but you will soon see the purpose of it : A friend of mine named Dr. Schliemann has been in Greece, and has dng up some extraordinary tombs, and has found skeletons and remains of human bodies in those tombs. He says the tombs are those of Agamemnon and his companions, and he found amongst others the bones of an extra ordinarily taU man ; but how long do you think the tomb is ? \u2014 five feet two. So Dr. Schliemann says it is a most extraordinary thing that, baring this enormously tall man to bury, they should have put him in a tomb only five feet two inches in length. That conveys to my mind something like the proposition adopted at Nottingham. You have got five feet two inches of parliamentary space aUotted to you, and you attempt to put in that which requires ten feet space. Well, gentlemen, when you have to deal with political affairs, recollect, I beseech you, Dr. Schliemann and his tombs, and do not endeavour to put into places made for two men the bodies of four men, for if you do, you will never get them into it, and whUe you are debating and bothering about how to do it, somebody else will come up with two men and pnt them in. . . I entreat you to think of these matters, and, if I may use the expression, to throw your opinions as Liberals into one common stock. Do not let us dweU exclu sively or over much upon a particular thing that we ourselves may deem to be the most important. Remember the wise saying of Mr. Bright. Mr. Bright has said a great many wise things, and one of them was that the policy of Liberalism, as a whole, ought to have regard, and must have regard, to the average opinion of the party. If you think that the average opinion does not go far enough, why then it is your individual duty to poke it from behind and make it go forward. But do not meantime quarrel about it, for if you do, you will repeat what I call the story of Dr. Schliemann and the tomb of Agamemnon.\" The House of Commons a School of Discipline. \u2014 At a dinner of the Institution of Civil Engineers, in 1878, Mr. Gladstone responded to the toast of the House of Commons, and in the course of his remarks said : \" I may speak of tho House as a school of discipline for those who enter it, In my opinion it is a school of extraordinary power and efficacy, and I am qualified to say so from having sat there, I believe, longer, as a man actively engaged in a political career and in official life, than any one who has ever sat within those walls, with the single exception of Lord Palmerston. It is a great and noble school for the creation of all the"], [388, "368 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. qualities of force, suppleness, and versatUity of intellect. And it is also, permit me to say, a great moral school. It is a school of temper ; for if in Parliament anyone unhappily goes astray in point of temper, rely upon it he wiU not be five minutes older before he has found out his mistake. (Laughter.) If any of you are so unfortunate as to know a member of the House of Commons who has taken a leading part in its business whose temper is not good, depend upon it, if he had not been in the House of Commons it would have been a great deal worse. (Laughter.) It is also a school of patience. A man who is disposed to leam patience there will find plenty of opportunities when, having been smitten on one cheek, he may turn the other cheek to the smiter if he is so disposed. It is a school of honour ; for it is a place in which many smaU, mean, shabby advantages may betaken from the circumstances of the moment, though, perhaps, to be afterwards regretted. And it is a school of justice; for no one can be engaged in the constant exercise of political controversy without being exposed to the constant temptation to abate somewhat of the sanctifying integrity and homage which is due from us all to truth, and, with more or less wilfulness, more or less unconsciousness, to deviate from justice in stating his own argument and in dealing with that of his opponent.\" An Agitator. \u2014 On the occasion of the formation of a Liberal Palmerston Club by some of the undergraduates at Oxford, in 1878, Mr. Gladstone declared that it was then Lord Beaconsfield's wiU that took effect in the policy of the Government, and from time to time succeeded in bringing the country into danger. He added that, \" to his own great pain, and with infinite reluctance, but under the full and strong conviction, he might say, of political old age, for the past eighteen months he might be said to have played the part of an agitator. His purpose had been to the best of his power, day and night, week by week, month by month, to counterwork what he believed to be the purposes of Lord Beaconsfield.\" \"On the Stump.\" \u2014 Lord Shaftesbury wrote in February, 1874, during the general election : \" It is a new thing, and a very serious thing, to see the Prime Minister ' on the stump.' Surely there is some little due to dignity of position. But to see him running from Greenwich to Blackheath, to Woolwich, to New Cross, to every place where a barrel can be set up, is more like Punch than the Premier.\" The Responsibilities of British Rule. \u2014 In his first address to the electors of Midlothian, at Edinburgh in November, 1879, Mr. Glad stone thus spoke of the responsibilities resting upon the Government and the people of Great Britain : \" This empire is an empire the daily caUs of whose immense responsibUities task and overtask the energies of the ablest of her statesmen. There is not a country in the history of the world that has undertaken what we have undertaken ; and when I say what we have undertaken, I do not mean what the present Government have under taken\u2014that I wiU come to by-and-by \u2014 but what England in its tradi tional established policy and position has undertaken. There is no precedent in human history for a formation like the British Government, A smaU island at one extremity of the globe peoples the whole earth with"], [389, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. QQQ its colonies ; but it is not satisfied with that. It goes among the ancient races of Asia, and it subjects 240,000,000 to its rule there. Along with aU this, it disseminates over the world a commerce such as no imagination ever conceived in former times, and such as no poet ever painted. And aU this it has to do with a strength that lies within the narrow limits of these shores ; not a strength that I disparage ; on the contrary, I wish to dissipate, if I can, the idle dreams of those who are always teUing you that the strength of England depends \u2014 sometimes they say, upon its prestige ; sometimes they say, upon its extending its empire, and upon what it pos sesses beyond these shores. Rely upon it, the strength of Great Britain and Ireland is within the United Kingdom. Whatever is to be done h. defending and governing those vast colonies with their teeming millions, in protecting that unmeasured commerce, in relation to the enormous responsibilities of India \u2014 whatever is to be done must be done by the force derived from you and from your chUdren; derived from you and your feUow-electors in the land ; from you and the citizens and people of this country. And what are they P They are some three-and-thirty milUons of persons ; they are a population less than the population of France, less than the population of Austria, less than the population of Germany, less than the population of Russia. But the populations of France, Austria, Germany, and Russia find it quite hard enough to settle their own matters within their own limits. We have undertaken to settle the affairs of a fourth, or nearly a fourth, of the entire human race scattered over the world. . . Why does not this satisfy the ambition of the members of the present Government ? I affirm, strive and labour as you wiU \u2014 I speak after the experience of a lifetime, of which a fair portion has been spent in office \u2014 strive and labour as you wiU, in Parlia ment and in office, human strength and human thought are not equal to the discharge of the duties appertaining to Government in this great, wonderful, and world-wide empire.\" Some Views as to the Union. \u2014 At Liverpool during his canvass for South-West Lancashire (Oct. 14, 1868), Mr. Gladstone, referring to the Fenian movement, quoted with approval some remarks made by Mr. D'Arcy M'Ghee at Montreal a few months before. They were as follows : \" Everyone sees and feels that, while England lifts her white cliffs above the waves, she can never suffer a rival Government, a hostile Government, to be set up on the other side of her. Whatever the aspirations of Irish autonomy, the Union is an inexorable political necessity, as inexorable for England as for Ireland.\" (Mr. M'Ghee was assassinated soon after the expression of these opinions.) And in the speech deUvered at Aberdeen in 1871 (p. 365), Mr. Gladstone, touching on the same subject, had enforced his arguments by the remark that \" You would expect, when it is said that the Imperial ParUament is to be broken up, that at the very least a case should be made out showing there were great subjects of policy, and great demands necessary for the welfare of Ireland, which representatives of Ireland had united to ask, and which the representatives of England, Scotland, and Wales had united to refuse. There is no such grievance. There is nothing that Ireland has asked and B B"], [390, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 370 which this country and this Parliament have refused. What are the inequalities of England and Ireland ? I declare that I know none, except that there are certain taxes stiU remaining which are levied over Englishmen and Scotchmen and which are not levied over Irishmen; and, likewise, there are certain purposes for which public money is freely given in Ireland, and for which it is not given in England and Scotland.\" \" Practical Politics.\" \u2014 In one of his Midlothian speeches (at Dalkeith, Nov. 26, 1879) Mr. Gladstone used the foUowing words : \" Down to the year 1865, and the dissolution of that year, the whole question of the Irish Church was dead ; nobody cared for it, nobody paid attention to it. In England chcumstances occurred which drew the attention of the people to the Irish Church. I had myself, in 1865, said I beUeved it was out of the range of practical poUtics ; that is to say, the poUtics of the coming election. When it came to this \u2014 that a gaol in the heart of the metropolis was broken open, under circumstances which drew the attention of the English people to the state of Ireland ; and when in Manchester a policeman was murdered in the execution of his duty, at once the whole country became aUve to Irish questions, and the question of the Irish Church revived. It came within the range of practical politics.\" \" Reasonable Distance.\" \u2014 Mr. Gladstone's words in July, 1880, with respect to the condition of Ireland as approximating to that of civd war, were differently reported, \" measurable distance \" being given as his expression by some of the journals. The foUowing, however, is the phrase as recorded in \" Hansard,\" with its context. On the third reading of the Compensation for Disturbance BUI, Mr. Gladstone said : \" It has never been simply the amount of distress on which we have founded the justification of the biU. It has been the amount of distress as connected with the government of Ireland, and as creating difficulties in the govern ment of Ireland, which have brought us, I wUl not say to the verge of civil war, but T wiU say within a reasonable distance of that catastrophe.\" Mr. Gladstone and the Irish Leaders. \u2014 In a speech at Liver pool, Oct. 27, 1881, Mr. Gladstone said, with reference to the Irish leaders : \" The immediate object which is proposed is rapine \u2014 I don't caU it by any other name. . . It is a great issue ; it is a conflict for the very first and elementary principles upon which civil society is con stituted. It is idle to talk of either law or order, or liberty or religion or civUisation, if these gentlemen are to carry through tbe reckless and chaotic schemes that they have devised. Rapine is their first, but rapine is not their only object. It is perfectly true that these gentlemen wish to march through rapine to the disintegration and dismemberment of the empire, and, I am sorry to say, even to the placing of different parts of the empire in direct hostility one with the other. That is the issue in which we are engaged.\" Earlier in the same month, in a speech at Leeds (Oct. 7), Mr. Gladstone had also remarked : \" For nearly the first time in the history of Christendom, a body or smaU body of men have arisen who are not ashamed to preach in Ireland the doctrine of pubUc plunder.

I will frankly take the case of Mr. ParneU as exhibiting to yon what I mean when I say, that the state \u2022of things in Ireland is coming to be a question between the law on the \u2022one hand and sheer lawlessness on the other.\" \u2014 In little more than four years afterwards, the speaker was in alliance with Mr. ParneU and his foUowers in his measures for \" Home Rule \" in Ireland. \" Resignation.\" \u2014 Mr. Gladstone's Midlothian \" campaign,\" as he himself termed it, and his subsequent recaU to power as Premier in 1880, lent additional interest to the terms in which, some years before, he had expressed his own inclination for retirement. In March, 1874, after the election of a new Parliament and the unexpected return of a Conservative majority, entailing the resignation of Mr. Gladstone's Government, he thus wrote to Earl GranviUe, who had filled the office of Foreign Secretary in his Administration : \" For a variety of reasons personal to myself, I could not contemplate any unlimited extension of active political service ; and I am anxious that it should be clearly under stood, by those friends with whom I have acted in the direction of affairs, \u2022that at my age I must reserve my entire freedom to divest myself of aU the responsibilities of leadership at no distant time. The need of rest wiU prevent me from giving more than occasional attendance in the House of Commons during the. present session. I should be desirous, shortly before the commencement of the session of 1875, to consider whether there would be advantage in my placing my services for a time at the disposal of the Liberal party, or whether I should then claim exemption from the duties I have hitherto discharged. If, however, there should be reasonable grounds for believing that, instead of the course which I have sketched, it would be preferable, in the view of the party generally, for me to assume at once the place of an independent member, I should wUlingly adopt the latter alternative.\" Again in January, 1875, he wrote (also to Earl GranviUe) : \" I see no public advantage in my continuing to act as the leader of the Liberal party; and at the age of sixty-five, and after forty-two years of a laborious public life, I think myself entitled to retire on the present opportunity. This retirement is dictated to me by my personal views as to the best method of spending the closing years of my Use.\" In consequence of Mr. Gladstone's wish, thus strongly expressed, the members of the Liberal party, after several conferences, determined to invite the Marquis of Hartington to assume the leadership of the Opposition in the House of Commons. \" Hands Off.\" \u2014 In April, 1880, the special correspondent of a German newspaper gave an account of an interview with Mr. Glad stone during that gentleman's contest in Midlothian, and represented him as having made the following, among other remarks : \" I detest every thing that reminds us of interference with nationalities that have to be freed from thraldom.

Whosoever understands the meaning of the EngUsh phrase ' Hands off ' wiU be able to understand my line of policy. What I stated in respect to the Eastern Question, and the policy foUowed by Austria [alluding to a speech strongly condemning that poUcy], I was in duty bound to state. I am the watchful dog that barks. A good watch dog is bound to do his duty.* I do not permit dust to be thrown up\u2014 matters may take another turn, that is possible \u2014 but I repeat, I am the watchful dog that barks ! I greatly admire the patriotism of the Austrian people, and esteem the progress-loving Government of Austria ; but, I say again, hands off from other people's territory. Reply to an Offensive Speech. \u2014 In February, 1882, Mr. Glad stone was very much provoked by some remarks made by one of the Irish members. Mr, Biggar said, it seemed that the Prime Mimister had lately desired his son, the junior member for Leeds (Mr. Herbert Glad stone), to gain some experience, and the young hopeful (cries of \" Shame \") thereupon went to Ireland to superintend the eviction of unfortunate tenants who were unable to pay their rent. As they had it on the authority of the head of the Government that a sentence of eviction was equivalent to a sentence of death,-)- he recommended the youthful gentleman to endeavour to secure the reversion of Marwood's (the hang man's) position. Mr. Gladstone replied, with warmth : \" Perhaps the remarks which the honourable member for Cavan has just uttered are hardly worthy of notice. (Cheers.) 1\u00a3 my son, the honourable member for Leeds, had been in his place, I should have left it to him to tell the honourable gentleman whether he was a 'young hopeful' or not. However, I wiU observe to the honourable member, for his information, that the ordinary \u2014 indeed, the uniform \u2014 practice of older men in the House has been to afford a kindly welcome to young men. More over, in the reception of young men, I have never been able to trace any difference between one side of the House and the other. I leave it to the honourable member \u2014 and perhaps it will be the principal dis tinction that his Parliamentary career will confer \u2014 that he has broken that tradition, and chosen to speak of a young member, in the absence of that young member, as a ' young hopeful.' With regard to the other allusion of the honourable gentleman, which was brutal in its character, I wiU take no notice whatever of it, except to say that I do not believe there is one man among the members who sit around the honourable member, and generaUy vote and speak with him, that will rise in his place either to sustain or apologise for that reference. I leave it to the honourable gentleman himself to judge whether, after what has occurred, he will express regret for the words which fell from him. It is matter, perhaps, more for himself than for anybody else. He also said that tho honour able member for Leeds went to Ireland to superintend evictions. With reference to that, I need only say that it is a statement entirely devoid of foundation, as the honourable member for Leeds went to * Compare under Eoebuck, \" Tear 'em.\" f See next page."], [393, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 373 Ireland in no official capacity whatever,\" \u2014 Mr. Richardson (member for Armagh county) said he would not attempt to apologise for the honourable member for Cavan, but he would remark that just before leaving Ireland he saw the old schoolmaster of the honourable gentle man, who expressed a hope that the House would not be too hard on him, for he had always been a very naughty and troublesome boy. (Laughter.) Irish Evictions.\u2014 Mr. Gladstone's allusion to evictions in Ireland having been frequently quoted, he took an opportunity, in the House of Commons (June 12, 1882) to make the following explanation : \" I wish to say that it is entirely under a misapprehension that the opinion is said to have been expressed by me that a sentence of eviction was a sentence of death. What I said was that in my own judgment, rightly or wrongly as it may be, taking into account all the circumstances of the time, and the condition of all but famine in which a number of people were, it could be no great matter of surprise if from their point of view a sentence of eviction appeared to be a sentence of death. It was not my opinion, but I said it would be no great wonder if that was their opinion.\" \u2014Mr. T. P. O'Connor presently asked whether, on the second reading of the Compensation BiU in 1880, the Prime Minister did not use these words (reading from \"Hansard's Debates\"): \"It is no exaggeration to say, in a country where the agricultural pursuit is the only pursuit, and where the means of the payment of rent are entirely destroyed for the time by the visitation of Providence, that the poor occupier may in these circumstances regard the sentence of eviction as coming, for him, very near to a sentence of starvation. . . In the failure of the crops, crowned by the year 1879, the act of God had replaced the Irish occupier in the condition in which he stood before the Land Act. Because, what had he to contemplate ? He had to contemplate eviction for non-payment of rent, and, as a conse quence of eviction, starvation.\" He wished to know whether the Primo Minister did not declare that a sentence of eviction was equivalent to a sentence of starvation. To this Mr. Gladstone replied: \"I was speaking from memory, and I am sorry to say that my memory is not so good as it once was. As to the first quotation, I may say that my speech was reported and printed without my concurrence, but it is substantially accurate. As to the second passage, I have no hesitation in saying that it expresses my opinion with great exactitude. What is stated also in the first passage entirely corresponds with what I have said just now.\" Debates on the Address. \u2014 In the course of the debate on the Address in January, 1881, which was continued during eleven nights, Mr. Gladstone protested against its prolongation, and said : \" The good sense of Parliament, and the practical turn which has governed, aud I hope will always govern, the political mind of this country, have esta blished it as a rule, almost without exception, that the address to the throne in answer to the speech with which the session is opened shaU be brought to a conclusion as rapidly as possible. And I venture to say, if that practice is to bo broken down \u2014 if the speech from the throne itself,"], [394, "374 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. instead of being a convenient, decorous, and dignified method of meeting between the Sovereign and the people, and of initiating the business of the session, in every intimation it conveys \u2014 if that speech itself is to be made the subject of lengthened and renewed debate and of diversified amendments in this House, it will become no better than a public nuisance, and it wiU be for the advantage of the country that it should be whoUy discontinued.* . . I must express a hope that this debate is approaching, and rapidly approaching, to its close. This is not a mere debating assembly ; it is a deliberative assembly. It is an assembly which reasons in order to conclude and to act ; and the House has a right to expect from its members that, instead of preventing it from fulfiUing this function, they shall assist those who are charged with the conduct of the business of the House in endeavouring to dispose of that grave and complicated task with aU the despatch which the difficulty and gravity of the matter may admit.\" \" Urgency \" and Liberty of Speech. \u2014 On the 3rd of February, 1881, Mr. Gladstone brought forward a resolution intended to check obstruction and to facilitate the progress of business in the House, by allowing \" urgency \" f to be moved by the Government ; and, on that motion being carried by a majority of not less than three to one in a House of 300 members, the question before the House to be put without debate. In the course of his remarks he said : \" Has the House ever considered what are the days and hours at our command ? First, let it be said that it is not a charge of indolence that could ever be brought against the British House of Commons. It is confessed on all hands \u2014 I do not speak of this Parliament, but of aU \u2014 that there is no legislative assembly in the world that works itself so pitilessly, so relentlessly, as the British House of Commons. If that be so, it foUows that the measure of what is done by the House is somewhere about the utmost measure of humani strength and capacity. But let us go into the regions of possibility. Let us, with an enormous licence, imagine for a moment that it were possible for us to devote every day in the year to the work to which we now usually devote six or seven months, and to give twelve hours out of every twenty-four to the discharge of our Parliamentary duties. Deducting the seventh day, there are about 3750 hours which might thu* be used for the purposes of Parliament ; and if the 650 members of this- House were each to claim the very moderate right of addressing the- House for six hours in the course of every session \u2014 a not very lono period of time \u2014 that would give us 3900 hours, or considerably more than the year upon any supposition could be made to give.

But speech must be* * The debate on the Address in 1883 also lasted e'even nights. In the last period of Lord Beaconsfield's Government, in 1880, it occupied four. See also Mr. W. H. Smith's remarks on the subject later on. + For the Urgency Eesolution, see under \"Varieties.\""], [395, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 375 regulated, not by the fancies of men, but by the necessities of the case, and in accordance with the discharge of the duties which we are sent here to discharge. Our position is wholly unexampled, and I do not think I exaggerate when I say that the question of the adoption of new rules to increase the power of the House, and to increase it effectually, is now for us a question of honour or dishonour \u2014 that is, a question of Use and death.\" The speaker concluded thus : \" PersonaUy, my prospective concern in these arrangements is but small. My lease is aU but run out. But there are those who for years, and even for generations, wiU live to render, I hope, honourable and splendid service to their country. The House of Commons has never had to struggle with a more serious crisis. Character and honour are the essence of the House of Commons. As you value the duties that have been committed to you, as you value the traditions that you have received, as you estimate highly the interests of the vast Empire for which you work, I appeal to you not too nicely and microscopically to discuss this and that secondary improvement, upon which we might differ for ever, but without hesitation, without delay, after the chaUenges that have been addressed to you, after what you have suffered to night,* to raUy to the performance of a great pubUc duty, and to determine that you wiU continue to be, as you have been, the mainstay of the power and glory of your country, and that you wiU not degenerate into the laughing-stock of the world.\" Obstruction and Parliamentary Paralysis. \u2014 Replying to a deputation on the subject of the franchise in January, 1884, Mr. Gladstone remarked that that was not a case in which much need be feared from direct methods of opposition; but \"of aU the arts, fine or otherwise, and of aU the sciences, natural or moral, there is no art and there is no science which has made such advance in the time in which we live as the art and science \u2014 for it may be caUed both \u2014 of Parliamentary obstruction.\" \u2014 Prior to this, when bringing forward his Closure resolutions (Feb. 20, 1882), Mr. Gladstone dwelt upon the same subject, and observed: \"It is not an easy matter to define obstruction, but to me it appears to mean the disposition either of a minority or of individuals to resist the wdl of the House otherwise than by argument.\" The following were among his con cluding remarks : \" Perhaps I may say one word in regard to my own personal position in relation to this subject. There is hardly a man of those who hear me whose Parliamentary tenure, to use a phrase with which we have recently become familiar, can be frailer than my own. My life is in the past and not in the future. But I should be very sorry that it should close at a time when I see the House of Commons in great part paralysed from the discharge of its noble duties \u2014 in the condition of some noble animal upon whom artificial restraints have been woven, so that it is unable freely to move its limbs. Sir, I feel that it is upon me a great obUgatiou to offer what service I can \u2014 though I have but little share in the interests with which it will operate upon the future of the House \u2014 towards * See \" Varieties,\" \" Suspension of Irish Members.\" f See under \" Usages.\""], [396, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 376 relieving the House from its dilemma. . . I trust, Sir, this House wiU always continue to appreciate, I would almost say to worship, liberty of speech\u2014 that it wUl continue to tolerate, for the sake of liberty, the licence of speech which mocks and counterfeits Uberty of speech ; but that it wiU not carry, however large the fund of patience, that toleration to such a point that it shaU itself reach the grossest of aU vices of a legislative body \u2014 tbe point at which it shaU inflict upon the House of Commons incapacity to do its duty.\" Conservative Support to Liberal Measures. \u2014 In a speech in the debate on leave to introduce the Irish Protection BUI, Jan. 28, 1881, Mr. Gladstone, replying to some taunts as to the reliance of the Liberal party on Conservative support for the passage of the measure, said: \"H the Conservative party support us on this occasion, it is no fault of ours, and it is no fault of theirs. (A laugh.) As far as I know, there always has been, and I hope there always will be, in the midst of the healthy and sometimes wide divisions of opinion amongst parties in this country, some common stock of common regard for our common country \u2014 for law on the one side and British Uberty on the other ; and sad indeed wiU be the day when the mere reproach of receiving Conservative support can for one moment shake a Liberal Government in giving effect to its deliberate convictions.\" His Tribute to Lord Beaconsfield.\u2014 On the 9th of May, 1881, the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Gladstone, went into committee on the subject of a monument in Westminster Abbey to the Earl of Beaconsfield. In proposing an address to the Crown respecting it, Mr. Gladstone said : \" The career of Lord Beaconsfield is, in many respects, the most remarkable one in Parliamentary history. For my own part, I know but one that can fairly be compared to it in regard to the emotion of surprise, and, when viewed as a whole, an emotion, I might almost say, of wonder ; and that is the career, and especially the earlier career, of Mr. Pitt. I feel myself in the position, not, necessarily, of a friend and admirer, who looks with sympathy at the character and action of Lord Beaconsfield ; but I look at the magnitude of the part which he played on behalf of his country, and I say that one who was his poUtical friend might fairly have said of him when he came back from Berlin \u2014 ' Aspice, ut insignis spoliis Marcellus opimis Ingreditur, victorque viros supereminet omnes.' (Cheers.) My duty is to look at these things in the magnitude of their national and historical character, and it is in so looking at them that I have no doubt that the man who for seven years sustained the office of Prime Minister, the man who for nearly thirty years led, either in one House or in both, a great party of this country, and the man who had so intertwined himself in the interest of the general heart, as was shown upon the occasion of his iUness, is a man in whom those features meet which justify me in asking for this vote. . . I wiU not attempt to give anything like a historical portrait. It would not be fair or frank, even if it were appropriate in point of time, that I, who have been"], [397, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. Z77 separated from Lord Beaconsfield by longer and larger differences than perhaps ever separated any two persons brought into constant contact in the transaction of public business \u2014 it would not be fair to him, it would not be fair to his friends, that I should endeavour to draw a picture of him which must be more faintly coloured, and I must add which must be differently coloured, if executed by my hand, than that which they could fairly claim. But yet, Sir, I wiU aUow myself some satisfaction in dwelling on matters upon which I feel it is pleasurable to myself, and on which I also think it is useful for us aU, to dwell. There were certain great qualities of the deceased statesman on which I think it scarcely right to touch. His extraordinary inteUectual powers are as well understood by others as by me, and they are not proper subjects for our present commendation. But there were other great qualities \u2014 qualities not merely inteUectual in the sense of being dis sociated from conduct, but qualities immediately connected with conduct \u2014 with regard to which I should say, were I a younger man, that I should Uke to stamp the recollection of them on myself for my own future guidance, and with regard to which I will confidently say, to those who are younger than myself, that I would strongly recommend them for notice and imitation. (Cheers.) I speak, for example, of his strength of wUl; his long-sighted persistency of purpose, reaching from his first entrance on the avenue of life to its very close ; his remarkable powers of self-government ; and, last but not least of aU, his great Parliamentary courage \u2014 a quality in which I, who have been associated in the course of my life with some scores of Ministers, have never known but two whom I conld pronounce to be his equal.\" Mr. Gladstone, towards the close of his remarks, added : \" There is much error and misapprehension abroad as to the personal sentiments that prevail between men who are divided in politics. Their words must necessarily from time to time be sharp ; their judgments may occasionaUy, may warrantably, may necessarily be severe ; but the general idea of persons less informed than those within the Parliamentary circle is that they are actuated towards one another by sentiments of intense antipathy or hatred. I wish to take this occasion, with the permission of the House, I wish to record in this place and at this hour my firm conviction, that in aU the judgments ever delivered by the late Lord Beaconsfield on myself, he was never actuated by sentiments of personal antipathy.\" (Cheers.) \u2014 Sir Stafford Northcote, foUowing immediately after Mr. Gladstone to support his motion, said, amid the applause of the House: \"A monument of a higher character than any that could be carved in stone and marble has been already erected to Lord Beaconsfield in the speech to which we have just listened.\" The \" Quarrel \" on the Franchise BiU.* \u2014 In his speech on moving the third reading of this Bill, in 1884, Mr. Gladstone said : \"The House is aware that many ominous declarations have been made, or indications given, as to the future fate of this bill, both in the House and outside the House, and sometimes by persons of great importance. I have * For an account of this, see pp. 63 to 66."], [398, "378 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. refrained, and so have my colleagues, I believe without exception, from referring to those declarations and indications. Our opinion is that in regard to difficulties and collisions, if they are to arise, the proper rules appUcable to the case are contained in the few and weU-known words of Shakespeare: 'Beware ' Beware Of entiaDce to a quarrel ; but, being in, Bear 't, that the opposed may beware of thee.' (Cheers and counter-cheers.) I should have wished, Sir, to preserve that silence to the end ; but some of the declarations made in this House have been so explicit, that I do not feel authorised so to preserve it. One of those was by an honourable member on the opposite side, who declared that he would not affect to deny the great danger that overhung this biU; and he evidently spoke on the basis of something more than a mere private opinion, as, indeed, he was entitled to speak. Another right honourable member said, within the last few days, that no practical man beUeved that this bUl had the ghost of a chance. Those are declarations which it is not possible for me whoUy to pass by. I do not accept them as declarations founded upon a sound estimate of the facts. I believe that they impute to the wisdom of another branch of the legislature probable conduct such as it is not, in my opinion, honourable to that House to impute. . . I think we have given sufficient evidence of our desire to avoid a quarrel. I am bound to say that I hold the question of this evidence to be a matter of the greatest possible importance, because even the remote probability of a conflict between the two Houses upon such a question as this, I deem to be the most serious prospect that has been opened, during my recollection, since the crisis of the Corn Laws opened to the view of Parliament. I wUl not undertake to put a Umit to the mischiefs and difficulties which might result. Most grave I am confident \u2014 too painfuUy confident \u2014 they wiU be. What the ultimate issue of it would be, I have not a doubt. That to prevent it by every reasonable means is the most sacred duty incumbent upon us on this occasion, next to the great business of enfranchising a vast mass of the population, I do not doubt. And that second duty, as weU as the first of our obligations, we have carefully and strenuously endeavoured to fulfil.\" \u2014Sir S. Northcote, in reply, said, \" the extraordinary speech they had just heard was not one upon the merits or demerits of the Franchise BiU. It was a speech on the question whether the House of Lords was any longer to form part of the Constitution, and be permitted to examine and take any part in legislation which affected the Constitution, or whether that House was bound, at the wiU of a majority of the House of Commons he would say, even at the wiU of an imperious Minister \u2014 to listen to threats, and, daunted by those threats, to refuse to do the duty which Ues upon them.\" \u2014 Several other members commented on the tenor of the Prime Minister's remarks. Mr. A. J. Balfour, for instance, considered the speech of the Premier was the most threatening that had ever been deUvered by a Minister of the Crown in the House of Commons ; while the Attorney-General (Sir H. James) protested against its being said that the words used constituted a threat ; they were simply words of advice."], [399, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 379 \" Drawing \" Mr. Gladstone. \u2014 In a speech at Glasgow in December, 1882, shortly after a Liberal had been unexpectedly returned for Liverpool, Mr. Forster said: \"We see in the House young men of some talent, who show it mainly in what they call ' drawing ' Mr. Glad stone. We see the country is tired of it. But, while they suppose that they make Mr. Gladstone angry, it is not anger ; it is the simplicity and earnestness of the man. These young feUows are trying to get a momen tary cheer by their \u2014 I was going to use an un-Parliamentary phrase \u2014 I want to translate ' impudence ' into something that is not rude. (Laughter.) These young men think that they are really getting a name in the country. Well, they are getting a name, and it is a name which before very long they will be glad to get rid of. Why does he care for what they say ? Because he reaUy, in the simplicity of his heart, thinks they are honestly trying to solve some great question, as he is ; and so, when they interrupt him, he supposes that they do it out of the fervour and enthusiasm of their convictions; and he pays attention to them, and they say, ' Oh ! here we have got up a scene.' Well, the country is tired of that, and the Liverpool election shows it.\" His Demeanour as Leader. \u2014 A contrast between Mr. Gladstone as leader of the House of Commons, and Mr. Disraeli in the same capacity, has been drawn in \" A Diary of Two Parliaments,\" by Henry W. Lucy. He remarks of Mr. Disraeli that \" his far-away look was amongst not the least useful personal qualifications he displayed as a leafier of the House.\" And, when being made the subject of attack by a clumsy adversary, \" the point of interest was the immobile figure on the Treasury bench, with arms folded, knees crossed, lips slightly parted, and eyes steadily fixed on the infinities of space. There was no ostentatious affectation of being busied with other matters ; no writing letters, with one ear open to what was going on ; no engaging in animated conversation with a col league. There was not even an appearance, real or affected, of indifference to the honourable member's remarks. Mr. Disraeli simply didn't hear him didn't see him, was not aware of his existence. . . Some one onco said of Mr. Gladstone, ' He would be a great man if he could only occasionaUy sit still.' This remark applies with peculiar force in his character of leader in the House of Commons. For the successful progress of business, the thing most earnestly to be deprecated is friction. Yet friction is a quality which Mr. Gladstone is positively certain to contribute to any debate at which he may chance to be present. He does it in least measure when he formaUy takes part in a debate. He very rarely loses possession of his presence of mind and sense of responsibility when he stands at the table of the House. He may a moment ago have been sitting on the Treasury bench, fuming and fretting in a white heat of passion, and may have been throwing oil on the flames by interjecting remarks, or making undignified gestures. His very springing up may have been on the impulse of apparently uncontroUable passion. But the moment he is on his feet he resumes command over himself, and, though he may say bitter things, they are at least uttered in well-balanced sentences, and with fuU proof that the speaker is under his own control. It is when ha"], [400, "380 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. is reclining on the Treasury bench, an eager listener to debato, that Mr Gladstone excites the marvel of those who caU to mind his long expe rience and transcendent capacity. In such circumstances the most ignorant and least important member of the House can attract his attention, and bring about his interposition. Mr. CaUan can do this, and, having learnt his power, frequently exercises it. What Mr. CaUan says is, of course, no matter ; but the Ughtest word spoken by the Premier is listened for by the world. His utterance cannot be disregarded, and his contribution of an observation, however trifling, often gives a new turn to debate, or brings in fresh contributors who continue it for hours after it might have died away, but for the fateful and whoUy unnecessary interposition of the Premier.\" A Friend's Judgment. \u2014 Mr. George Russell, in his memoir of Mr. Gladstone, makes the following remarks : \" The love of power and the courage which supports it are allied in Mr. Gladstone with a marked iinperiousness. Of this quality there is no trace in his manner, which is courteous, conciliatory, and even deferential ; nor in his speech, which breathes an almost exaggerated humUity. But the imperiousness shows itself in the more effectual form of action; in his sudden resolves, his invincible insistence, his recklessness of consequences to himself and his friends, his habitual assumption that the civilised world and all its units must agree with him, his indignant astonishment at the bare thought of dissent or resistance, his incapacity to believe that an overruling Provi dence will permit him to be frustrated or defeated. It is this last peculiarity of Mr. Gladstone's temper which has exposed him to the severest shocks of adverse fate. His friends and relations, his colleagues and supporters, and official guides, know so well this imperious optimism, and shrink so naturaUy from the consequences of disturbing it, that they insensibly fall into the habit of assuring him that everything is going as he wishes, and that human daring and political perversity will not, in the long rim, venture to withstand his wise and righteous will. It is the inconvenient property of those who systematically speak smooth things sometimes to prophesy deceits; and again and again, as in 1874 and 1886, Mr. Gladstone's complaisant counseUors have prepared for him a rude awakening from sweet dreams of majorities and office, to the grim reaUty of defeat and Opposition.\" \" An Old Parliamentary Hand.\" \u2014 In the debate on the Address at the opening of Parliament, Jan. 22, 1886, Mr. Gladstone spoke as follows with regard to the affairs of Ireland: \"My duty was to await the plans of the Government; and having awaited those plans I am bound to say that, though I shaU listen with great attention to aU they propose, I intend to reserve my own freedom of action. And I do not intend, so far as lies within my power, to have it determined for me by others at what time and in what manner I shall make any addition to the declaration I laid before the country in the month of September. I stand here as a member of the House, where there are many who have taken their seats for the first time upon these benches, aud where there may be some to whom possibly I may avail myself of the privilege of"], [401, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 351 old age to offer a recommendation. I would teU them of my own in tention to keep my counsel and reserve my own freedom, untU I see the occasion when there may be a prospect of public benefit in endeavouring to make a movement forward ; and I wiU venture to recommend them, as an old Parliamentary hand, to do the same.\" \"Fundamental Law.\" \u2014 In the same connection Mr. Gladstone shortly after went on to say : \" We have before us (in the Queen's speech) two paragraphs relating to Ireland. The first is that which refers to the Legislative Union as a fundamental law, and in which her Majesty's Government have expressed, undoubtedly very strongly, the new they take of that important Act of Parliament. . . The Queen's speech is a very formal document, and I do not hold that the phrase ' fundamental law ' is. known to the British Constitution. I understand that law is of the greatest moment aud importance. I am not disparaging that law, but the importation of the phrase, I think for the first time, is a matter upon which there might be either a legal or another argument ; and it is also, of course, open to remark that it is stated there can be no change of that law ; whereas the fact of the case reaUy is that her Majesty's Government mean to make this a strong declaration of their determination to maintain our unity, rather than that they wish to be judged by a minute criticism. Of course, it is obvious that fundamental law is not infrequently altered in minor points, and has been altered, mainly in 1869, in the case then of the Established Protestant Church in Ireland.\" \u2014 These remarks by Mr. Gladstone were recalled as highly significant, when shortly after he was again in power, and brought forward his Irish measures. The Classes and the Masses. \u2014 The following observations were made by Mr. Gladstone in a speech at Liverpool, June 28, 1886 : \" You (the Liberal party) are opposed throughout the country by a compact army, and that army is a case of the classes against the masses. I am thankful to say that there are among the classes many happy exceptions. I am thankful to say that there are men wearing coronets on their heads who are as good, as sound, and as genuine Liberals as auy working man who hears me at this moment. But stiU, as a general rule, it cannot be pretended that we are supported by the dukes, or by the squires, or by the estabUshed clergy, or by the officers of the army, or by other bodies of very respectable persons. . . On this question, I am sorry to say, there is class against the mass, or the classes against the nation. The question for us is, wiU the nation show enough unity and determination to over- bear constitutionaUy, at the poUs, that resistance of the classes P It is very material that we should consider which is likely to be right. Are the classes ever right when they differ from the nation P I am not about to assert that the mass of the people who do not and cannot give their leisure to politics are necessarUy and on all subjects better judges than the leisured men, and the instructed men, who have great advantages for forming political judgments that the others have not. But then I wUl venture to 6ay that upon the one great class of subjects, the largest and the most weighty of aU, where the determining considerations that ought to lead to a conclusion are truth, justice, and humanity \u2014 upon these,"], [402, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 382 gentlemen, aU the world over, I wiU back the masses against the classes.\" A Subject \"under Investigation.\"\u2014 In July, 1888, a dinner was given by Sir Wilfrid Lawson, at his house in Grosvenor Crescent, to the Liberal members of Parliament from Northumberland and Cumber land, Mr. Gladstone being present. On the foUowing morning a long speech delivered by the right honourable gentleman after this dinner appeared in the newspapers (the Daily Telegraph report occupied nearly three columns). In the course of this speech, referring to some recent proceedings in Ireland, Mr. Gladstone was represented by his reporters to have said, \" Gentlemen, we have had in the papers of to-day, in the case of Mr. M , as far as it has gone, one of the most shocking, one of the most revolting, of aU the cases presented to us. I won't dweU upon it, as it is stiU the subject of judicial investigation, farther than to observe \" \u2014 and so on. \" Not a Gladstonian.\" \u2014 Mr. Gladstone made this avowal at a meeting in Birmingham, Nov. 5, 1888. Speaking of the election of 1886, he said : \" The Tory and Dissentient vote was 1,429,000 ; the Liberal vote \u2014 for I take the liberty to caU it by that name ; none of your Gladstonian votes for me ; I am not a Gladstonian ; I avow that I am a Liberal, and nothing else \u2014 the Liberal vote was 1,353,000. We were beaten by 76,000 votes ; and, if you wiU work the sum for yourselves, you wiU find that it is a little less than 3 per cent, upon the total.\" An Old Servant. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone thus concluded a speech in the debate on the Royal grants (July 25, 1889), in which he supported the proposal of the Government, to the vexation of some of his own adherents : \" I thought it my duty to enter at once into this debate. Undoubtedly I admit that, on every occasion, our highest obligation as the Commons of England is to the constituencies which we represent. But I am not ready to adopt the exclusive doctrine of the seconder of the amendment (Mr. Storey), that we are the servants of the people and the servants of the people alone. \u2014 Mr. Storey : I said, servants of the people first. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone : I am very glad that I misunderstood my honourable friend. We are servants of tho Crown as weU as servants of the people. (Ministerial cheers.) Having, as I hope, done my duty to the people, I have been endeavouring, so far as I could, to contribute towards casting this delicate question into a form which in a very short time is, I beUeve, likely to be perfectly satisfactory. Having done that, I am not ashamed to say that in my old age I rejoice in any opportunity which enables me to testify that, whatever may be thought of my opinions, whatever may be thought of my proposals in general politics, I do not forget the service which I have borne for so many years to the illustrious representative of the British monarchy.\" Mr. Gladstone as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.\u2014 The foUowing was Mr. Cobden's criticism, delivered in the last speech he made, at Rochdale in 1864: \"Mr. Gladstone is the best ChanceUor of the Exchequer England ever had\u2014 and I say that, knowing that he has had among his predecessors WiUiam Pitt. But I am going to say that Mr. Gladstone has been the most extravagant ChanceUor of the Exchequer"], [403, "WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE. 383 we have ever had. He has been a master in the adjustment of the burdens of the country ; that is, he found the weight placed upon the animal in such a way as rendered it the most difficult to carry his burden. It was tied round his knees, it was fastened to his taU, it was hung over his eyes, it blinded him, and impeded him, and lamed him at every step. Now, Mr. Gladstone took the burdens off these limbs, and he placed them most ingeniously over the softest possible pad upon the animal's shoulders. But the beast is carrying the burden stiU, and carrying a great deal more than it did before all this beautiful process was commenced.\" Free Trade and Protection. \u2014 In a speech on receiving the freedom of Dundee, Oct. 29, 1890, referring to what was called the McKinley tariff lately introduced in America, Mr. Gladstone said : '\" Though the national opinion of this country is in favour of Free Trade, yet we have among us a certain number of people who believe that the injurious effects of Protection are chiefly felt by the countries that deal with the protected country. Now, that I believe to be f undamentaUy a mistake. I do not mean to say there are not injurious effects, or that there is not a great deal of displacement aud disturbance, and what I may caU demoralisation of trade, and inconveniences felt by individuals and even by classes ; but, taking a larger view, it is not true that at any time the tariff of any country on earth can interfere seriously with the pro sperity of Great Britain or the United Kingdom. And why ? 11 you wiU simply follow me, in a few words I shaU show, I think, how it is that this operates. Let us suppose that there are twenty great markets in the world, and that these, for the sake of argument, are all the markets in the world ; and that in one of these markets a stringent Protection law, such as the McKinley tariff, is passed. No doubt the first effect is to injure us in that market, and to restrict our dealings. But then, what is the larger and wider effect ? The larger and wider effect is to raise the standard of prices in the United States of America. Raising the standard of prices in the home market means a diminished power of exporta tion; and a diminished power of exportation means that, whUe we are damnified in one of our twenty markets, we derive benefit in the other nineteen from the diminished power of the United States to compete with us in any of them \u2014 a diminished power due to the augmentation of prices, and to the imposition of restraints under which she has to work. So, even if you go all round the world, it still remains that each country ihat gives greater stringency to Protection within its own borders is thereby, though damaging us in its own market, giving us a freer and a \"broader' field, and a more commanding power, in every one of the other nineteen markets of the world. The result is that it is not possible for us to receive vital or profound injury from any of these operations abroad. You see the alarm that prevails in France, aud the alarm that prevails in Germany. They threaten retaliation against the McKinley tariff. Don't let us be led for one moment, upon any consideration, into the suicidal folly of talking or dreaming of retaliation. Our trade has been hit again and airain as far as it has been in the power of anyone to hit it, by the reaction towards Protection which has marked the legislation of some"], [404, "384 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. countries during the last ten or fifteen years. We don't deal with this country or that country, we deal with mankind \u2014 nothing more, nothing less than mankind.\" RICHARD COBDEN. (1804\u20141865.) \"Unadorned Eloquence.\" \u2014 The compliment which was paid to Mr. Cobden by Sir Robert Peel, on the passing of the bills repealing the Coin Laws, is thus recorded by \" Hansard :\" \u2014 \" The name which ought to be, and will be, associated with the success of those measures, is the name of one who, acting, I believe, from pure and disinterested motives, has, with untiring energy, made appeals to our reason, and has enforced those appeals with an eloquence the more to be admired because it was unaffected and unadorned : the name which ought to be chiefly associated with the success of those measures is the name of Richard Cobden.\" The Minister's Responsibility. \u2014 During a discussion on the Corn Laws in 1843, Mr. Cobden, after having urged that the agricultural population suffered as much from these laws as the manufacturing classes, and that the new law (maintaining but regulating the duties on corn by a \" sliding scale \") was as baneful as the old one, thus directly addressed Sir Robert Peel: \" What is the remedy you propose? What are the proceedings by which you propose to give relief to the country ? You have acted on your own judgment, and you are responsible for the con sequences of your act. You passed your law; you refused to listen to the manufacturers, and I throw upon you all the responsibility of your own measure. . . The right honourable baronet says it is his duty to judge independently, and act without reference to any pressure; and I must tell the right honourable baronet that it is the duty of every honest and independent member to hold him individually responsible for the present position of the country. I tell him that the whole responsibility of the lamentable and dangerous state of the country rests with him.\"\u2014 M. Guizot writes in his \" Memoirs of Peel \" that on hearing this charge of responsibility, and personal responsibility, so often and\"so vehemently repeated, Sir Robert rose with visible emotion. \" The honourable gentle man,\" he said, \"has stated here, very emphatically, what he has more than once stated at the conferences of the Anti-Corn-Law League, that he holds me individually \u2014 individually \u2014 responsible for the distress and suffering of the country ; that he holds me personally responsible. But, bo the consequences of these insinuations what they may, never will I be influenced by menaces, either in this House or out of this House, to adopt a course which I consider \" He was unable to complete his sentence. Whether friends or opponents, many members asked themselves what he meant, and why he was so much affected. It was perceived that the shade of Mr. Drummond [Sir Robert's secretary, who was assassinated January 21st, 1843] haunted his mind, and that the responsibility for the public distress, charged upon him with so much vehemence, struck him as a provocation to assassination. Mr. Cobden at once explained, protesting"], [405, "RICHARD COBDEN. 385 earnestly against so unjust a suspicion. Sir Robert accepted his explana tion, but coldly, and stiU maintained an air of reserved distrust. Abstraction. \u2014 At an election meeting in London in 1843, Mr. Cobden spoke in support of the Free Trade candidate, and against his Protectionist rival, Mr. Thomas Baring. In the course of his address he remarked : \" Our chairman has said that Mr. Baring admits our principles to be true in the abstract \u2014 that is, that his own principles are untrue in the abstract. Did you ever hear of a father teaching his chUdren to obey the Ten Commandments \u2014 in the abstract ? Did you ever know the plea to go down at the Old Bailey, after a verdict of guilty had been returned, of ' Oh, I did steal the pocket-handkerchief \u2014 but only in the abstract ? ' Is monopoly an abstraction p If it be, I have done with Mr. Baring and this election : but tho abstraction presents itself in bodily form under the shape of certain monopolists, who diminish by one half your supply of sugar, and cut off large sUces from your loaves.\" The \"Three Ways.\"\u2014 Mr. Cobden opened an argument on the subject of Free Trade, in June, 1845, in the foUowing fashion : \" As Sir Robert Peel would say, ' there are three ways of dealing with this question.' Firstly, you may acknowledge the justice of the principles of total repeal, and you may defer it untU it suits your party, or untU cir cumstances compel you to abolish the Corn Laws totally and immediately. Secondly, you may abolish them graduaUy by a vanishing duty, putting an 8s. tax, and sliding off Is. a year tiU it comes to nothing ; that may be done by an Act of Parliament, and would involve the principle of a total repeal. Or, thirdly, you may adopt our principle of total and immediate repeal.\" He then went on to discuss each of these courses seriatim. The \" People who will Govern this Country.\" \u2014 In a debate on the state of Ireland, April 24, 1846, Mr. Smith O'Brien had asked Lord George Bentinck whether his party would consent to a temporary suspension of the Corn Laws. Mr. Cobden thus commented on the question : \" I beg to teU the honourable member for Limerick (Mr. O'Brien) and the noble lord the member for Lynn, and the 240 members who sit behind him, and who cheered the speech he has made to-night, that there are other parties to be consulted with regard to such a proposition \u2014 that there are the people of England \u2014 I don't mean the country party, but the people living in the towns, and who wiU govern this country. I teU him that the EngUsh people and the Scotch, and tho Welsh, and I believe the Irish too, are, from what I have heard, determined not to be content with a suspension, but to have a total abolition of the Corn Laws. I think, therefore, the matter is taken out of the hands of this House altogether; and I must say I rejoice that this question of the Corn Laws can no longer be made matter for man\u0153uvring and compacts within the waUs of this House. It is disposed of, settled, out of doors ; and, although your artifices here may delay this measure, and cause anxiety out of doors, stiU they can only delay it.\" Sir Robert Peel was accused by Mr. Disraeli of having cheered Mr. Cobden's expression, but this Sir Robert denied, saying, \" I don't recognise, on the part of the people of towns, any sort of right to dictate to the people of this country.\" Mr. Cobden then ex- C c"], [406, "386 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. plained himself as follows : \" Tho honourable member for Shrewsbury states, and the right honourable baronet repeats, that I said the inhabitants of towns would dictate to the country. Now, that was not my expression. I said that the majority of the people would always do so ; and I think I am correct in saying that the majority of the people of this country live in towns. I do not wish or desire that one section should dictate to another ; but the majority will govern in all constitutional States, and the majority now will be found in towns.\" \" Crumbling \" Russia. \u2014 At a meeting in London in 1849, called to express sympathy with the people of Hungary, after the Russian inter- vention on behalf of Austria, Mr. Cobden thus spoke : \" The peace party throughout the world wiU raise a crusade against the credit of every government that attempts to carry on an unholy war. Henceforth let no one talk of Russian resources and Russian money. . . People talk sometimes as though England and Englishmen were afraid of Russia. I wish to disabuse all minds as to my views on that subject. I do not oppose Russia's advances into Hungary in the belief that, in any possible combination of events, or any accession of territory, Russia can be in the least degree dangerous to England. Should Russia make an attack upon this country, or another great maritime power, like the United States, it would faU upon her like a thunderbolt, and crumble that empire into its own dreary fastnesses in six months, by the aid of its shipping.\" \u2014 Speeches in 1849, revised by himself. Mr. Henry Drummond added something to the \" crumbling \" phrase of Mr. Cobden's, in the debate, in 1855, on the condition of the army before Sebastopol : \" Whatever the honourable member for the West Riding may say, his talk about ' crumpling up ' Russia like a sheet of paper ran through the country, and people thought that Russia was a little, foolish, second-rate power, which you had the means of crumpling up whenever you liked.\" Non-interference. \u2014 The doctrine of non-interference in the affairs of other nations was one which Mr. Cobden repeatedly urged. The fol lowing passage from a speech at Manchester in 1849 may be taken as an \u25a0example of his method of dealing with this subject : \" Another position ivhich has an important bearing on the reduction of our armaments is, we must let other people manage their own affairs. The Spaniards, who have very wise maxims, say, ' A fool knows more of what is going on in his own house than a wise man does in that of his neighbour.' Now, if we wiU apply that to nations, mind our own business, and give foreigners the credit of being able to manage their own concerns better than we can do for them, or they with our interference, it wiU save us a great deal of money, and they wiU have their affairs settled better and sooner than if we intermeddled with them. But what are we doing p There cannot bo a petty squabble in any country in Europe or the globe, but we must have a great fleet of line-of -battle ships sent from England to take part in it. We have just interfered between Naples and Sicily \u2014 what is the conse quence ? We are detested by both parties. In all Italy it is the same. They speak of Englishmen with contempt and execration ; not because they undervalue our qualities as men \u2014 no, they pay as high a tribute to"], [407, "RICHARD COBDEN. 337 the qualities of Englishmen as we could desire \u2014 but, as a nation, as a \u2022Government, interfering with their politics, from one end of the Peninsula to the other, the Italians cordially hate and detest us. So with regard to Spain \u2014 we have spent hundreds of millions on Spain, and what is the present state of feeling there ? I traveUed from one end of Spain to the other, and I never heard the name of the Duke of WeUington mentioned, although he fought their battles, as we persuade ourselves \u2014 I never saw his portrait or bust through all my travels, but I saw Napoleon's and his marshals' everywhere. At this very moment, Napoleon and France are more popular in Spain than England and Englishmen. It is the same in 'Greece \u2014 the same in Portugal. The English people are hated, because we interfere with their politics. Is not that a very undignified attitude for a great nation like this to occupy ? \" Influence of the Treasury Bench. \u2014 \"Black and Curly.\"\u2014 In a speech on the Russian war, in the House of Commons in 1855, Mr. \u2022Cobden replied to some remarks made by his former associate Sir WiUiam Molesworth, then a Cabinet Minister. He said : \" Never in this world was there a speech delivered by any honourable gentleman so utterly at variance with all previous declarations of opinion, as that delivered by the right honourable gentleman last night. Does the right honourable gentleman remember a jeu-d'esprit of the poet Moore, when dealing, in 1833, with the Whig occupants of those benches, shortly after they had emerged from a long penance in the dreary wilderness of Opposition, and when the Whigs showed themselves to be Tories when in office ? Does he remember the jeu-d'esprit ? \u2014 why, I think he and I have laughed \u2022over it, when we have been talking over the sudden conversions of right honourable gentlemen. The poet illustrated the matter by a story of an Irishman who went over to the West Indies, and, before landing, heard :Some of the blacks speaking tolerably bad English, whereupon, mistaking them for his own countrymen, he exclaimed, ' What ! black and curly already P ' Now, we have all seen metamorphoses upon those benches \u2014 how colours have changed, and features become deformed, when men \u25a0came under the influence of the Treasury atmosphere ; but I must say that never, to my knowledge, have I seen a change in which there has been so deep a black and so stiff a curl.\" Proffered Office by Lord Palmerston. \u2014 The letter in which Lord Palmerston offered Mr. Cobden a seat in the Cabinet, in 1859, was \u25a0equally creditable to the writer and the recipient, and ran chiefly in the foUowing terms : \" I have been commissioned by the Queen to form an administration, and I have endeavoured so to form it that it should contain representatives of all sections of the Liberal party, convinced as I -am that no Government constructed upon any other basis could have sufficient prospect of duration, or would be sufficiently satisfactory to the country. Mr. Milner Gibson has most handsomely consented to waive aU former differences, and to become a member of the new Cabinet. I am most exceedingly anxious that you should consent to adopt the same line ; and I have kept open for you the office of President of the Board of Trade, which appeared to mo to be the one best suited to your views, and c c 2"], [408, "388 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to the distinguished part which you have taken in public Use.\" Mr. Cobden gave his reasons for declining the offer, in a speech at Rochdale after his return from America, in August, 1859. He said .- \" I wiU not affect any modesty in this matter : I wiU say that if I was fit for any office in the Cabinet, I should be fit for the office of President of the Board of Trade. I think, probably, if other circumstances had not intervened, my being in that place would have been reaUy putting a square peg in a square hole. . . The honour I did not consider a matter of indifference ; it was probably peculiarly inviting to me, if I had been one of an ambitious character, because, taking it for aU in all, it would have been the first instance of a man springing immediately from amongst you\u2014 LiteraUy a man of business \u2014 being offered a seat in the Cabinet at aU.\" He then went on to say that, on being made acquainted with the offer on his landing at Liverpool, ho had gone as soon as possible to Lord Palmerston, and stated his case thus : \"I have been for ten or fifteen years the systematic assailant of what I believe to be your foreign policy ; . . it is quite possible that I may have been mistaken in aU this ; but I put it to Lord Palmerston, and now I put it to you, whether, having regard to those opinions, it was fit and becoming in me to step from an American steamer into his Cabinet, and there and then, for the first time, after having received at his hands a post of high honour aud great emolument, to discover that I had undergone a change in my opinions ; and whether I should not be open to great misconstruction by the public at large if I took such a course ; and I candidly confess that it was inconsistent with my own self-respect. . . I had no personal feeling whatever in the course I took with regard to Lord Palmerston's offer. If I had had any feeling of personal hostiUty, which I never had, towards him \u2014 for he is of that happy nature which cannot create a personal enemy \u2014 his kind and manly offer would have instantly disarmed me.\" Parliamentary Candidates and Election Petitions. \u2014 In a speech at Rochdale in 1859, Mr. Cobden thus commented on this subject. Petitions were at the time inquired into and adjudicated upon by com mittees of the House of Commons : \" What is the meaning of an election petition ? Why, in the first place, when the petitioner has been unduly deprived of his seat by the improper and corrupt proceedings of his opponent, he has to appeal to a tribunal for justice \u2014 to a tribunal which is the most inaccessible and the most costly in the civilised world. For I will venture to say that a man who presents an election petition to the House of Commons, goes before a tribunal the expense of which makes the equity which is administered at the Court of Chancery dirt cheap indeed. In fact, the principal obstacle to a petition at all is that the party paying for the redress of this grievance \u2014 I mean the grievance of having been deprived of a fair chance of being elected by the free and unbought suffrages of his feUow-countrymen \u2014 that the petition is so costly that no man can teU him beforehand how much it may cost. Tho election petition may cost a man 500?., or it may cost him 5000L ; and no parliamentary lawyer who had one shred of conscience would ever venture to say that he could guarantee him against the larger amount. The con-"], [409, "RICHARD COBDEN. 389 \u25a0sequence is, that very few men have the courage to present a petition, and to undergo the risk and expense of following it out before a Committee of the House of Commons. But supposing he does so \u2014 and this is my great grievance and charge against the proceedings of the House of Commons \u2014what does it end in ? He proves corrupt proceedings on the part of his opponent, he proves corruption on the part of the constituency, and the result may be that his opponent is declared unseated. But that does not give him the seat ; it merely says that there shaU be another election in the same borough, that he may go again, and, if he likes, incur the same expense with the same prospect of an election petition, and that those very men who have been shown to have sold their votes before, may have the privilege of selling them again ; another election in such a case being nothing more nor less than a fresh harvest to those corrupt voters who make merchandise of their privileges as free citizens. Such being the case, what wonder is it that not one-half of those who lose their elections venture to petition for a redress of grievances ? A friend of mine lost his \u2022contest for a very large borough in one of the Eastern counties, and he told me that he had a clear case against his opponent for bribery, but he did not intend to petition, and for this reason \u2014 he petitioned once before, and his expenses cost him 5001. a day, and if he went into a Committee -again, he had no guarantee that it would not cost him as much, and there fore he abstained from prosecuting his petition at all.\" Voices of the Dead. \u2014 On the death of Mr. Cobden, in April, 1865, Mr. Disraeli passed a high enlogium on his character as a politician, and in the course of it remarked: \"There is something mournful in the history of this Parliament, when we remember how many of our most eminent and valued public men have passed from among us. I cannot refer to the history of any other Parliament which will bear to posterity so fatal a record. But there is this consolation when we remember these unequaUed and irreparable visitations \u2014 that these great men are not altogether lost to us; that their opinions wUl be often quoted in this House, their authority appealed to, their judgments attested ; even their very words will form part of our discussions and debates. There are some members of Parliament who, though not present in the body, are stiU members of this House, independent of dissolutions, of the caprice of constituencies, even of the course of time. I think, sir, Mr. Cobden was -one of these men.\" Power of \" Cobden and Bright.\" \u2014 Mr. Kinglake thus sums up the power exercised by these two men, whose names for a long period were invariably associated in the politics of the day: \"These two orators had shown with what a strength, with what a masterly skdl, with what patience, with what a high courage they could carry a scientific truth through the storms of poUtics. They had shown that they could arouse and govern the assenting thousands who Ustened to them with deUght \u2014 that they could bend the House of Commons\u2014 that they could 'press their creed upon a Prime Minister, and put upon his mind so hard a stress, that after a while he felt it to be a torture and a violence to his reason to have to make a stand against them. Nay. more. Each of these"], [410, "390 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. gifted men had proved that he could go bravely into the midst of angry opponents, could show them their fallacies one by one, destroy their favourite theories before their very faces, and triumphantly argue them down.\" JOHN BRIGHT. (1811\u20141889.) The Cave of Adullam. \u2014 On the meeting of Parliament in 1866, a Reform BiU was introduced by Earl RusseU's Administration. Several members usually found in the ranks of the Liberal party either opposed or withheld their support from the measure. Among them Mr. Lowe and Mr. Horsnian were most conspicuous. In a debate on the biU, on the 13th of March, the following observations by Mr. Bright excited great merri- ment, and gave the name of \" AduUamites \" to this section of politicians : \" The right honourable gentleman below me (Mr. Horsnian) said a little against the Government and a little against the bill, but had last night a field-night for an attack upon so humble an individual as I am. The right honourable gentleman is the first of the new party who has expressed his great grief, who has retired into what may be called his political cave of AduUam, and he has caUed about him every one that was in distress and every one that was discontented.* The right honourable gentleman has been anxious to form a party in this House. There is scarcely any one on this side of the House who is able to address the House with effect, or to take much part in our debates, whom he has not tried to bring over to his party or cabal ; and at last the right honourable gentleman has succeeded in hooking the right honourable gentleman the member for Calne (Mr. Lowe). I know there was an opinion expressed many years ago by a member of the Treasury bench and of the Cabinet, that two men would make a party. When a party is formed of two men so amiable, so discreet as the two right honourable gentlemen, we may hope to see for the first time in Parliament a party perfectly harmonious, and distinguished by mutual and unbroken trust. But there is one difficulty which it is impos- sible to remove. This party of two reminds me of the Scotch terrier, which was so covered with hair that you could not tell which was the head and which was the tail of it.\" An Appeal against War. \u2014 Mr. Blight's speech against the con tinuance of the Crimean war (Feb. 23, 1855) was perhaps the best example of the honourable gentleman's higher flights of oratory. It contained the following passage : \" I do not suppose that your troops are to be beaten in actual conflict with the foe, or that they wiU be driven into the sea ; but I am certain that many homes in England in which there now exists a fond hope that the distant one may return \u2014 many such homes may be rendered desolate when the next maU shall arrive. The Angel of Death has been abroad throughout the land ; you may almost hear the beating of his wings.

He takes his victims from the castle of the noble, the mansion of the wealthy, and the cottage of the poor and the lowly; and it is on behalf of aU these classes that I make this solemn appeal. . . I would ask, I would entreat the noble lord (Palmerston) to take a course which, when he looks back upon his whole poUtical career \u2014 whatever he may therein find to be pleased with, whatever to regret \u2014 cannot but be a source of gratification to him. By adopting that course he would have the satisfaction of reflecting that, having obtained the object of his laudable ambition \u2014 having become the foremost subject of the Crown, the director of, it may be, the destinies of his country, and the presiding genius of her councils \u2014 he had achieved a stiU higher and nobler ambition : that he had returned the sword to its scabbard \u2014 that at his words torrents of blood had ceased to flow \u2014 that he had restored tranquUlity to Europe, and saved this country from the indescribable calamities of war.\"* A Modern Sindbad. \u2014 In the debate on the Queen's Message an nouncing the declaration of war with Russia, March, 1854, Mr. Bright condemned the policy of a war on behalf of Turkey, and in the course of his remarks said, \" The property-tax is the lever, or the weapon, with which the proprietors of land and houses in this kingdom wiU have to support the ' integrity and independence ' of the Ottoman Empire. Gentlemen, I congratulate you that every man of you has a Turk upon his shoulders.\" The Ass between Two Burdens. \u2014 In a speech at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, in 1866, Mr. Bright used this iUustration. He said : \" When I look at the great middle class of this country, and see aU that it has done, and see the poUtical position in which it has been to some extent content to rest, I cannot help saying that it reminds me very much of the language which the ancient Hebrew patriarch addressed to one of his sons. He said, ' Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens.' On the one side there is the burden of seven and a half millions per annum, raised by way of tax, to keep from starvation more than 1,200,000 paupers within the United Kingdom \u2014 and on the other hand, and higher up in the scale, there is mismanagement tho most gross, there is extravagance the most reckless, and there is waste the most appalling and disgraceful which has ever been seen in the govern ment of any country. And this is the grand result of a system wliich systematically shuts out the millions, and which cajoles the middle class by the hocus-pocus of a Parliamentary Government.\" The \" Intense Glare at the Doors of Parliament.\"\u2014 Mr. Bright used this expression in a speech at Birmingham in 1865. AUuding to the fear which the Tories and many of the Whigs entertained of a \u00ab Tho critical sense of the House of Commons is always keenly alive. Ihis peroration was listened to in a silence which was itself impressive, and the \" beating of the wings \" might have been audible, eould it have occurred ; but a member who was present remarked, \" If he had said flapping we should have laughed at once.\""], [412, "392 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Reform BUI, he said, \" What is this apparition which alarms them ? They are afraid of the five or six miUions of Englishmen, grown-up men, who are allowed to marry, to keep house, to rear children, who are expected to earn their living, who pay taxes, who must obey the law, who must be citizens in aU honourable conduct; \u2014 they are afraid of the five or six miUions who by the present system of representation are shut out, and insultingly shut out, from the commonest rights of citizenship. It may happen, as it happened thirty years ago, that the eyes of the five millions aU through the United Kingdom may be fixed with an intense glare upon the doors of Parliament ; it was so in the years 1831-32. . . If the five millions should once unitedly fix their eyes with an intense look upon the doors of that House where my honourable friend and I expect so soon to enter, I would ask, Who shaU say them nay ? Not the mace upon the table of the House ; not the four hundred easy gentlemen of the House of Lords, who lounge in and out of that decorated chamber ; not the dozen gentlemen who call themselves statesmen, and who meet in Downing- street ; perhaps not even those more appalling and more menacing person ages who have their lodgment higher up Whitehall. I say there is no power in the country, as opinion now stands, and as combination is now possible \u2014 there is no power in this country that can say ' Nay ' for one single week to the five millions, if they are intent upon making their way within the doors of Parliament.\" Parliamentary Corruption preventing a Dissolution. \u2014 In a speech at Glasgow in October, 1866, Mr. Bright said : \" With regard to a general election, some of you have read, and many of you know some- thing of the cost and corruption of a general election. I wiU give you one instance and one proof of it. It has been my opinion all along that it was the duty of the Government of Lord Russell, after the defeat of their Reform BUI during the last session, to have dissolved the Parliament. I have no reason to disbelieve what is asserted, that Lord Russell himself was of that opinion. But a general election was a burden which the members of Parliament did not wish to bear. I was speaking to a member of the Government on this question, about the time when the resignation of the late Government was just about to be submitted to the Queen, and I was teUing him that I thought the true policy, the constitutional policy, of the Government was to dissolve the Parliament. A portion of his answer was this : A member who sits on our side of the House had spoken to him about it. He said, ' My election has already cost me 9000J. ; ' and he added, ' I have, besides, 3000L more to pay.' He said further, what was very reasonable, that this was a heavy burden, that it was grievous to be borne, that it put him to exceeding inconvenience, and, if the Parliament were dissolved, he could not afford to fight his county or Ids borough, as the case might be, but woidd be obliged to retire from the field, and leave the contest, if there should be a contest, to some one else. You wUl beUeve, then, that the Government were greatly pressed by this consideration ; and this consideration, added, it may be, to others, induced them to resign office rather than to dissolve Parliament. Thus you have a proof that whereas general corruption and putridity are the destruction"], [413, "JOHN BRIGHT. 393 of most bodies which they affect, the corruption of the present Parliament was, and is, the cause of its present existence.\" A Parliament from Temple Bar. \u2014 In a speech at Glasgow, in 1866, Mr. Bright made this supposition : \" If the Clerk of the House of Commons were placed at Temple Bar, and if he had orders to tap upon the shoulder every well-dressed and apparently cleanly-washed man who passed through that ancient bar, until he had numbered 658 ; and if the Crown summoned these 658 to be the Parliament of the United Kingdom, my honest conviction is that you would have a better Parliament than now exists. This assertion will stagger some timid and some good men ; but let me explain myself to you. It would be a Parliament every member of which would have no direct constituency, but it would be a Parliament that would act as a jury, that would take some heed of the facts and arguments laid before it. It would be free, at any rate, from the class prejudices which weigh upon the present House of Commons. It would be free from the overshadowing presence of what are caUed noble families. It would owe no aUegiance to great landowners, and I hope it would have fewer men amongst it seeking their own gains by entering Parliament.\" The Derby Minstrels. \u2014 Speaking on Reform at Birmingham in 1866, Mr. Bright made the foUowing aUusion : \" The Government of Lord Derby in the House of Commons, sitting aU in a row, reminds me very much of a number of amusing aud ingenious gentlemen whom I dare say some of you have seen and listened to ; I mean the Christy Minstrels. The Christy Minstrels, if I am not misinformed, are, when they are clean washed, white men ; but they come before the audience as black as the blackest negroes, and by this transformation it is expected that their jokes and songs will be more amusing. The Derby Minstrels pretendto be Liberal and white ; but the fact is, if you come nearer and examine them closely, you wiU find them to be just as black and curly as the Tories have ever been. I do not know, and I do not pretend to say, which of them it is that plays the banjo and which the boues.\" Inadequate Remedies. \u2014 In March, 1868, the Earl of Mayo, as Chief Secretary for Ireland in Mr. Disraeli's Administration, brought before the House of Commons the measures intended to deal with Irish questions, and among them a scheme for a new Roman Catholic University. In the course of the discussion Mr. Bright ridiculed these measures as inade quate to the requirements of the occasion, and said : \" I recoUect that Addison, a good while ago, writing about the curious things that happened in his time, said there was a man in his county \u2014 I do not know whether it was in Buckinghamshire or not \u2014 he was not a Cabinet Minister, he was only a mountebank \u2014 but this man set up a stall, and to the country people he offered to seU pills that were very good against the earthquake.\" ((Great laughter.) A \"Free Breakfast Table.\"\u2014 In addressing the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, of which he had been made an honorary member, in 1868, Mr. Bright urged his hearers to agitate for this object. By the term he included the repeal of all remaining duties on tea, coffee, and sugar."], [414, "394 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. A Defence of the Queen. \u2014 During the Reform agitation in 1866, a meeting of the London trades was held in St. James's Hall, Mr. Bright and Mr. Ayrton delivering addresses. The latter, alluding to a popular demonstration at St. James's Park on the previous day, censured the Queen for not making an appearance and recognising the people. Mr. Bright thereupon disclaimed any participation in such a feeling. \" I am not,\" he said, \" accustomed to stand up in defence of those who are possessors of crowns. But I could not sit and hear that observation without a sensation of wonder and pain. I think there has been, by many persons, a great injustice done to the Queen in reference to her desolate and widowed position. And I venture to say this, that a woman, be she Queen of a great realm or be she the wife of one of your labouring men, who can keep alive in her heart a great sorrow for the lost object of her Use and affection, is not at aU likely to be wanting in a great and generous sympathy with you.\" The Shunammite Woman. \u2014 On the formation of Mr. Gladstone's Government in December, 1868, Mr. Bright was offered and accepted the post of President of the Board of Trade, with a seat in the Cabinet. Addressing his constituents at Birmingham on his re-election, he said that when the Prime Minister asked him to take office, \" I have reason to know that he made that proposition with the cordial and gracious. acquiescence of her Majesty the Queen. . . I should have preferred much to have remained in the common rank of the simple citizenship in which heretofore I have lived. There is a charming story contained in a single verse of the Old Testament, which has often struck me as one of great beauty. Many of you will recoUect that the prophet, in journeying to and fro, was very hospitably entertained by what is termed in the Bible a Shunammite woman. In return for the hospitality of his entertainment he wished to make her some amends, and he called her and asked her what there was that he should do for her. ' ShaU I speak for thee to the King or to the Captain of the Host ? ' \u2014 and it has always appeared to me to be a great answer that the Shunammite woman returned. She said, ' I dwell among mine own people.' When tbe question was put to me whether I would step into the position in which I now find myself, the answer from my heart was the same \u2014 I wish to dwell among mine own people. Happily, the time may have come \u2014 I trust it has come \u2014 when in this country au honest man may enter the service of the Crown, and at the same time not feel it in any degree necessary to dissociate himself from his own people.\" The \" Residuum.\" \u2014 Mr. Bright having, in 1873, been made the subject of some very free remarks by a provincial clergyman, for apply. ing the term \" residuum \" to the working classes, he wrote a letter warmly repudiating the construction put upon his words, and remarked : \" If I had appUed the word ' residuum ' to the ' working men of England ' if I had deemed or caUed them ' the dregs of the population ' \u2014 should I have given much time and labour, and many years of my life, to procure for them the right to live by the free exchange of their industry, and the right to vote that they might share in the government of their country ?"], [415, "JOHN BRIGHT. 395 I do not remember the time when, or the speech in which, I used the word ' residuum,' or I would refer you to the passage. You would at once see how utterly unjust and false is the construction put upon it.\" The speech in which the term was employed is not to be found in the authorised editions of the honourable gentleman's speeches, but it was delivered on the 26th of March, 1867, during the debate on Lord Derby's Reform BiU. Mr. Bright, in arguing that household suffrage should have its restrictions, was then reported by the Times to have said : \" At this moment, in aU, or nearly all, our boroughs, as many of us know, sometimes to our sorrow, there is a small class which it would be much better for themselves if they were not enfranchised, because they have no independence whatsoever, and it would be much better for the Constitution also that they should be excluded ; and there is no class so much interested in having that small class excluded as the inteUigent and honest working men. I call this. class the residuum, which there is in every constituency of almost hopeless. poverty and dependence.\" In addressing his constituency at Birmingham in 1876 Mr. Bright thus returned to the subject : \" You recollect that I have been sometimes criticised for using a Latin word to describe an unpleasant fact \u2014 the ' residuum.' During tbe 101. franchise there was a residuum in every borough very hard to manage. It was ignorant, un principled, sometimes drunken, often corrupt. Now, with the wide suffrage of household, there is also a residuum, and the wider the suffrage the wider the class to which I refer; and in the counties, if you give the franchise to the labourers, there wiU also be a residuum. That is a fact we cannot get rid of. Why, there is a residuum in the House of Lords. There are lords who are out of elbows, bankrupt in purse, and bankrupt in character ; but it does not f oUow from that that the House of Lords as a body does not consist of men of great wealth and of very high character too. And there is a residuum amongst the Church. No. one would more admit than I should the high character, and the great services, and the devotion, and the disinterestedness of the great body of the clergy of the Church of England, for example ; but there are some very odd specimens amongst them. So that there would be a residuum if you extend the franchise to age population, but it wiU every day be growing less, we hope.\" Always a \" Weak Brother \" in the House. \u2014 During the debate on tho Lords' amendments to the Reform BiU in 1867, Mr. Bright spoke against the representation of minorities, and remarked : \" I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer [Mr. Disraeli] said it was a scheme to intro duce into the House all sorts of crotchety people. I have no objection to crotchety people. I believe there must be all sorts of people in this House. I have never been in any Parliament in which there has not been at least one member generally believed by the rest of the members to be not quite strong, and excuses were made for his eccentric conduct because he was not as responsible as others. That, probably, wiU always be the case in the House of Commons.\" Women and the Franchise. \u2014 On the 26th of April, 1876, the Women's Disabilities Removal Bill, introduced by Mr. Forsyth, was."], [416, "396 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. brought up for second reading, and Mr. Bright addressed the House against it. He alluded to his having, in 1867, supported a motion by Mr. Stuart MU1 in favour of giving the franchise to women, and explained his reasons for now adopting a contrary course, stating that, although he had then voted with Mr. MiU, he had done so with extreme doubt, and his doubts had been confirmed by further consideration. In the course of his speech he made the foUowing remarks : \" We in this House have one peculiar knowledge, that is of the penalties which we pay for our constitu tional freedom. There are many men in this House who cannot look back upon their electioneering experience without feelings of regret, and I am afraid there are some who must look back with feelings of humUiation. Now, I should Uke to ask the House whether it is desirable to introduce our mothers, aud wives, and sisters, and daughters into the excitement, and the turmoU, and it may be into the very humUiation which seems in every country so far to attend a system of Parliamentary representation \u2014 whether it be in the United States, where so many systems are tried, or in this country ; and in France, of which we recently had an example, we see how much there is that candidates can scarcely avoid, yet must greatly deplore ; and we are asked to introduce the women of England into a system like this, from which we can hardly extract ourselves without taint of poUution, which we look back upon even with shame and disgust. I won't say that women would be more likely to be more tainted in this manner than we are, but I believe there have been some experiences even since the Municipal Act gave them votes. I know one place in my own neighbourhood where scenes of the most shocking character took place ; and in another borough not far from where I live, whose member or members vote for this Bill, at a recent municipal contest women were served with what certainly was not wholesome or good for them, during the morning and forenoon, until they had been polled. I know at another borough in Lancashire at the last general election there were women by hundreds, I am told, but at any rate in great numbers, drunk and disgraced under the temptations that were offered in the fierceness and unscrupu lousness of a political contest. . . My sympathies have always been in favour of a wide suffrage. They are so at this moment, and I grieve very much that a measure should be submitted in favour of the extension of the suffrage to which I cannot give my support. But I confess I am unwiUing for the sake of women themselves to introduce them into the contest of our Parliamentary system, to bring them under the necessity of -canvassing themselves or being canvassed by others. I think they would lose much of that, or some of that, which is best that they now possess, and that they would gain nothing from being mingled or mixed with the contest and the poUing -booth. I should vote for this measure if I were voting solely in the interests of the men. I shaU vote against it, I beUeve with perfect honesty, beUeving in doing so that I am serving the interests of women themselves.\" The second reading of the biU was negatived by 239 votes against 152. Force no Remedy. \u2014 On the introduction of the Prevention of Crime in Ireland BiU, May 11, 1882, Mr. Chaplin put a question to"], [417, "JOHN BRIGHT. 397 two members of the Government (Messrs. Bright and Chamberlain) who were sitting side by side opposite. \" He remembered the state ment made by the right honourable gentleman the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and supported by the President of the Board of Trade, that ' force was no remedy.' It was the belief of many that that statement had contributed, probably, more than any other statement made by any public man in England, to the horrible state of things that existed at that moment. Did they now adhere to that opinion or recant it ? \" In reply Mr. Bright said : \" The honourable member for Lincolnshire has made a quotation from a speech at Birmingham which was not spoken by my right honourable friend, but by me. When an honourable member undertakes to criticise a speech, it is desirable that he should have read it and understood it. If the honourable gentleman would turn to speeches which I have made upon this question, he would discover, if he read and understood them, that I have always said what I said then \u2014 force is not a remedy for the discontent existing in a country from causes which are sure to produce discontent.\" \u2014 Mr. ChapUn: \" The quotation I made was, ' Force is no remedy.' \" \u2014 Mr. Bright : \" I spoke with regard to grievances of which I believed the Irish people had just right to complain, and I said that force was not a just remedy.\" \u2014 Mr. Chaplin : \" No remedy.\" \u2014 Mr. Bright : \" Force was no remedy for the grievances of which I was speaking. Very soon after that speech, the Administration of which I was a member proposed a very strong measure of repression for Ireland. It is clear, I think, not only from what I said, but from my subsequent conduct, that I made no reference to the question of violence in Ireland when I said that force was no remedy.\" Mr. Bright and the House of Lords. \u2014 In a speech at Bir- mingham Town Hall in November, 1880, Mr. Bright said : \" I recoUect some years ago making an observation, I believe on this very platform, about the House of Lords. I said, in my opinion an hereditary house of legislation could not be a permanent institution in a free country. Some time after that, when Lord Palmerston was forming a Government [in 1859], he was urged by Lord John Russell to offer offices in his Cabinet to Mr. Cobden and to myself. You recoUect that Mr. Cobden was then in America, and the office which Mr. Chamberlain now holds was reserved to him when he should return to this country. He returned, but did not feel at liberty to accept it. Lord John Russell wrote to me, and explained to me the reason why Lord Palmerston found that he could not ask me to join in his Government, and it was this \u2014 that I had expressed opinions or an opinion about an institution in this country which the country thought important and essential, and that there were persons whose support was necessary to his Government who told him that that support would be withheld if I became a member of his administration.\" Withdrawal from Mr. Gladstone's Government.\u2014 On the formation of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry in 1880, Mr. Bright again became his colleague, accepting the office of ChanceUor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with a seat in the Cabinet. He resigned, however, in July, 18S2, a few days after the bombardment of Alexandria. He made the foUowing remarks"], [418, "398 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. \u25a0on the subject in the House of Commons on the 17th of July, in response to calls upon him for personal explanation : \" The simple fact is that I could not concur with my late coUeagues in the Government in their policy with regard to the Egyptian Question. Some pubUc writers have said, and others have said in conversation, ' Why did I not sooner leave the Government \u2014 why postpone it to this time, from last Tuesday or Wednesday ? ' * I might answer that by saying, that my profound regard for my right honourable friend at the head of the Government, and my regard also for those who now sit with him, have induced me to remain with them untU the very last moment, when I found it no longer possible to retain my office in the Cabiuet. The fact is that the disagreement of opinion was to a large extent fundamental. And now I may say that if I had remained in office it must have been under these circumstances \u2014 either that I must have submitted silently to many measures which I myself altogether condemned, or I must have remained in office in a state of constant conflict with my coUeagues. Therefore, it was better for them and was better for me \u2014 the House, I am sure, wiU unanimously agree with me \u2014 that I should have asked my right honourable friend to permit me to retire, and place my resignation in the hands of the Queen. The House knows \u2014 many members at any rate, who have had the oppor tunity of observing the facts of my political life, know \u2014 that for forty years at least I have endeavoured from time to time to teach my country men the opinion and the doctrine which I hold, namely, that the moral law is not intended only for individual life, but is intended also for the life and practice of States, in their dealings with one another. I think that in the present case there has been a manifest violation both of inter national law and of the moral law, and therefore it is impossible for me to give my support to it. . . I asked my calm judgment and my conscience what was the part I ought to take. They pointed it out to me, as I think, with an unerring finger, and I am humbly endeavouring to foUow it.\" \u2014 Mr. Gladstone, rising shortly after, observed : \" This is not an occasion for arguing the question of difference that has unhappily arisen between my right honourable friend and those who were, and who rejoiced to be his coUeagues. But I will venture to assure him that we agree with him in thinking that the moral law is as applicable to the conduct of States as it is to the conduct of individuals, and that the difference between us \u2014 most painful to him, and most painful to us all \u2014 is a differ ence upon a particular case and a particular application of that law. Agreeing with him in the principle, we disagree with him upon the appli cation of it. It is to us, as it is to him, an occasion of the prof oundest pain ; but he carries with him the unbroken esteem, and upon every other question the unbroken confidence, of his colleagues, and their best and warmest wishes that his happiness and fame wUl follow him into the independent position to which he has found it necessary to retire.\" (Cheers.) Ideas Concerning War.\u2014 Mr. Bright expressed himself as foUows in a speech at Birmingham, on the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniver- * The days immediately succeeding the bombardment."], [419, "JOHN BRIGHT. 399 sary of his connection with the borough : \" Unless you can come to the time when men, in obedience, as they believe, to the wUl of God, will submit to every sacrifice, I do not see myself, and have never said, how war can be always escaped. I know that, when I preach the doctrine of peace, you are told I do not think war can be justified, or ought ever to be carried on. I think it was Lord Palmerston, in his, I would say, rather ignorant manner, who said that what people of my opinion would do, in the case of an invasion, would be to bargain with the invader for a round sum if possible to get him to go home again. But what I say with regard to war, speaking of it practically, is this \u2014 that the case for it should be clear ; not a case supported only when men are half crazy, but when they are cool ; that the object of it should be sufficient ; that the end sought for should be peaceable and should be just ; and that there should be some compensation for, and justification of, the slaughter of 100,000 men.\" Harassing Legislation. \u2014 One of Mr. Bright's happy hits was made in 1874, in response to tbe charge urged by Mr. Disraeli against the Liberal Ministry of the day, that they had \"harassed every trade and worried every profession.\" He remarked: \"They say that we \u2014 that is, the Liberal party \u2014 have disturbed classes and interests unnecessarily ; that we have harassed almost aU sorts of people, and have made ourselves very unpopular thereby. Without doubt, if they had been in the Wildernessi they would have condemned the Ten Commandments as a harassing piece of legislation ; though it does happen that we have the evidence of more than thirty centuries to the wisdom and usefulness of these command ments.\" A Sanguine Anticipation. \u2014 In the course of a speech on re ceiving the freedom of the city of Glasgow, March 23, 1883, Mr. Bright said : \" I sometimes think that by and bye our party politics will almost die out, for there do not seem very many questions now on which great conflicts can arise. Every Parliament they are diminishing, and perhaps we shaU come to be a happy company, in which we have hardly anything to disagree about. But, whether that be so or not, I exhort aU men who see what has been done in the past to have faith in it, and to believe that the legislation founded on the highest, and noblest, and the most moral principles is the legislation which the people have a right to claim, aud from which they may hope to gain the greatest advantages.\" Electoral \"Fads.\" \u2014 Mr. Charles Seely, M.P. for Nottingham, in 1883 suggested the election of a new class of representatives in the fol lowing manner. Out of a House of 660 members, 600 woidd be chosen by the constituencies in the usual way, and the odd sixty by those who had been already elected. This, it was thought, would secure admission to the House of Commons of able men, who, through weakness of voice or other personal cause, were unable to make the usual appeal to a constituency. The opinion of Mr. Bright being asked on the subject, he made the following reply: \" I can give you no favourable opinion of the plan you refer to. It is wholly opposed to the spirit and principles of our Consti tution, aud offers no advantage to compensate for this. As to admitting men into Parliament whom electors wUl not elect, or whose condition of"], [420, "400 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. health or voice wiU not allow them to undertake an appeal to a con stituency, the proposition seems to me not a little ludicrous. Men feeble in health, and men not able or wiUing to go through the ordeal of an appeal to a constituency, may take other means of serving the pubUc ; the ParUamentary path is not their path ; and to open a new gate for those incapable of making use of the ancient and constitutional road is a propo sition not seriously to be regarded. Parliament has already an abundant supply of clever men, men who can both think and talk. We need no new plan of admitting feeble folk, feeble in body and in voice, and in the power and quaUties which recommend men to the notice and confidence of electors. I advise you to keep to the old ways ; the new fads, minority chances, and new modes of making a ParUament, aU tend to mischief > they show mistrust of the people, and they are mainly intended to weaken the popidar voice. I am for none of these things.\" Annual Parliaments. \u2014 The foUowing observations were made by Mr. Bright at Birmingham in 1885 : \" What did the Chartists actuaUy ask for P Six things, four of which many of them had Uved to see con ceded by the Legislature. Annual ParUaments they had not got, nor were they Ukely to get them. What a miserable idea that was ! He should emigrate if they were to have an election every year. It would be unendurable.\" Mr. Bright on the Right of Veto. \u2014 At a meeting of Liberal members of Parliament in the conference room of the Foreign Office, a few days after the resolution of the House of Lords in 1884 on the Franchise BiU (p. 64), Mr. Bright foUowed shortly after Mr. Gladstone in addressing the assembly, and said : \" I hold that it is not consistent with the character and freedom of a great nation Uke this country that an irresponsible House \u2014 a House that is not representative \u2014 should have the power every few years of bringing about a great and grave crisis like this. I said this many years ago, and I do not object to repeat it. Lord Palmerston gave in former years, as a reason for not asking me to be a member of his Government, that he could not offer me office because I had expressed, in regard to one institution that the country beUeved to be essential, views which, were I one of his colleagues, would drive from him the support necessary for his Government. My reply was that an here ditary House of Peers is not, and cannot be, a perpetual institution in a free country. I consider, however, that questions like this might be solved without having recourse to violence, insurrection, or revolution. The Crown, so popular throughout the country, and so important in our system, has long ago given up its absolute right of veto ; and in the United States the President has in many things much more power than the Prime Minister. He has a veto, but the veto can be overruled under certain conditions. A certain majority of the House, or Houses, can overbear his veto. It would be a great advantage, in my opinion, if some limitation were put to the veto of the House of Lords.\" (See also p. 397.) An Unenviable Position. \u2014 \"The Use of a Cabinet Minister,\" said Mr. Bright at Birmingham in 1885, \"is one needing very strong health, a very exceUent stomach, and a conscience which does not"], [421, "JOHN BRIGHT. 401 trouble him. It is a position which no sensible man would for a moment envy.\" Party Leadership and Political Independence. \u2014 Mr. Bright wrote as follows to Mr. Caine in June, 1886 : \" It is not pleasant to see how unforgiving some of our heretofore Liberal friends are, if their repre sentatives refuse to surrender judgment and conscience to the demands or the sudden changes of their political leader. The action of our clubs and associations is rapidly engaged in making delegates of their members,* and in insisting on their forgetting aU principles if the interests of a party, or the leader of a party, are supposed to be at stake. What will be the value of a party, when its whole power is laid at the disposal of a leader from whose authority no appeal is allowed P At this moment it is notorious that scores of members of the House of Commons have voted with the Government who, in private, have condemned the Irish Bills. Is it wise for a Liberal elector or constituency to prefer such a member, abject at the feet of a Minister, to one who takes the course dictated by his con science and his sense of honour ?\" A few months later Mr. Bright wrote to another correspondent : \" I have not been able to march with the clubs and associations which shout for measures which little more than a year ago they would have condemned. We have not yet had an infallible leader, and, till he appears upon the scene, I must preserve my own liberty of judgment.\" \" Personally Conducted \" Members. \u2014 The following remarks were made by Mr. Bright in an address to his constituents at Birmingham, July 1, 1886, when he was returned unopposed : \" We have a question before us (that of Home Rule) not smaller, perhaps greater for the time, than any one of those that have occupied our attention in past years. But we can, at auy rate, agree in this \u2014 that if the question itself be one of great magnitude, the temper of the people should be great ; that there should be a generous movement in all our minds ; that, if we can, we should \u2022tive credit for sincerity to those who differ from us, as we may ask them to give credit to us, who are obliged to differ from them. During more than twenty years I have been acting in Parliamentary life alongside the action of the still eminent leader of the Liberal party (Mr. Gladstone). I have not been a follower of the leader of the Liberal party. I have been one of those happy, to a large extent, to work alongside of him, and to give what little strength I could to everything in which he was engaged that tended, in my opinion, to advance the true interests of tho country. Now if I were to speak, porhaps it might be rather out of place, but I might say that, on the whole, the leaders of the Liberal party, during the time that I have been in Parliament, have generaUy followed the course I have argued for and insisted upon, even before their convince ment that it was right. (Cheers.) There are men in the House of Commons \u2014 I know a good many, and some very pleasant and intimate friends of mine \u2014 who have no notion of anything but foUowing.

They remind me very much of those gentle men who go out as tourists with Mr. Cook. They enjoy great security, because they are personally conducted.\" Rapid Changes of Ministry. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone's Course on Home Rule. \u2014 Mr. Bright made the following remarks at a Liberal Unionist banquet to Lord Harrington, Aug. 5, 1887: \"Looking back over the last two years, a very remarkable case has occurred. I think we hardly know in our constitutional history a time when we have had no less than three Administrations within a twelvemonth \u2014 that is, three Administrations were destroyed by ParUamentary votes during that period. Ou June 8, 1885, Mr. Gladstone's Government was defeated by a small majority, and Mr. Gladstone resigned. On January 30, 1886, Lord Salisbury's Government, which had come in meanwhile, was defeated by a vote specially directed and led by the right honourable member for Mid lothian, and he was driven out of office, being succeeded, as he was pre ceded, by Mr. Gladstone ; and that vote against Lord Salisbury was carried mainly by gentlemen who had opposed him at the elections, and supported Mr. Gladstone. On the 7th of June, 18S6 \u2014 the first of these transactions baring taken place on the 8th of June, 1885, and, therefore, one day less than twelve months \u2014 Mr. Gladstone was defeated by a majority of thirty, and his Government broken up. Therefore there were within twelve months three Administrations destroyed, and two general elections took place within little more than six months.\" After referring to the later course of events, and to Mr. Gladstone's recent action, the speaker went on to remark : \" When I consider aU this, I must say that I am filled with amazement and sorrow. I have been silent for a year, and have abstained from speaking on these questions, because I did not like to have to find fault with a man with whom I have acted for so many years, and for whom I have had so much reverence and so much sympathy. But when I consider that Mr. Gladstone has been thirty years a Cabinet Minister, and that for ten years he has been the first Minister and confidential adviser of the Sovereign, and that he is at this moment rejecting and condemning the decisions of the constituencies \u2014 that he has been during this session aiding in disturbing Parliamentary business, that he has been urging electors to join his ranks by arguments, and suggestions, and offers which no statesman, in my opinion, ought to make \u2014 I think I have reason for the amazement I have expressed and the sorrow I have felt. Bowever Liberal, and however reforming, a great Minister should be Conservative in the true and the highest sense. That is his duty to the Sovereign and to the people. But I observe in Mr. Gladstone's recent course a wide deviation from this principle, and my confidence has been correspondingly shaken. If we are in the House of Commons mainly and generaUy on vital questions, if such occur, almost compelled to support a Conservative Government, it is not because we have changed our opinions as to ancient Conservatism and ancient Liberalism. We feel that we cannot follow in a path of darkness and danger. We have left the old ranks, it is true, but it would be more correct to say that the old ranks have left us.

I have met men who have heard Pitt and Fox, and in whose judgment their eloquence at its best was inferior to the finest efforts of John Bright. At a time when much speaking has depressed and almost exterminated eloquence, he maintained that robust, powerful, and vigorous style of English which gave fitting expression to the burning and noble thoughts he desired to utter.\" Preparation. \u2014 Bishop Wilberforce recorded in his diary : \" May 29 (1867). \u2014 Dined Gladstone's.

(1811.) \"The White-headed Boy.\" \u2014 In Sir Francis Doyle's \"Remi- niscences \" the writer gives the following, respecting an incident at one of the meetings of the Oxford Union Debating Society : \" The g-reat oratorical event of my time was Mr. Gladstone's speech against the first Reform Bill. The debate as a whole, being the outgrowth of genuine passion, and an excitement shared by all, was better than the average. Most of the speakers rose more or less above their ordinary level, but when Mr. Gladstone sat down, we all of us felt that an epoch in our lives had occurred. It certainly was the finest speech of his that I ever heard.\" The writer's attention had been attracted during the debates to one whom he took to bo merely a listener, 4'an old gentleman with snow-white hair,\" and he was presently surprised to find him taking part in the proceedings. \" Whilst the debate was going on, some earnest young Tory had denounced Lord Grey and his coUeagues as a vile crew of traitors. He had hardly finished, when up jumped my patriarch (it was the summer term, with the boat races in full force), and in a bold and vigorous tone of voice took him to task thus : ' The honourable gentleman has called her Majesty's Ministers a crew. We accept the omen \u2014 a crew they are ; and, with Lord Grey for stroke, Lord Brougham for steerer, and the whole people of England hallooing on the banks, I can tell the honourable gentleman they are pretty sure of winning their race.'

D D 2"], [424, "404 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. \"Tampering\" with the House of Commons.\u2014 Mr. Lowe attained first rank as a debater by his speeches against Reform in Parlia ment between 1805 and 1867. The following characteristic passage occurred in a speech delivered in March, 1866 : \" In the course of a long and iUustrious career, this House of Commons has gathered into its hands a very large proportion of the political power of the country. It has out lived the influence of the Crown ; it has shaken off the dictation of tho aristocracy ; in finance and taxation it is supreme ; it has a very large share in legislation ; it can control and unmake, and sometimes nearly make, the executive Government. Probably, when the time shall arrive that the history of this nation shall be written as the history of that which has passed away, it may be thought that too much power and too much influ ence were concentrated and condensed in this great assembly, and that Englaud put too much to hazard on the personal qualifications of those who sit within these waUs. But, Sir, in proportion as the powers of the House of Commons are great and paramount, so does the exploit of endeavouring to amend its constitution become one of the highest and noblest efforts of statesmanship. To tamper with it lightly, to deal with it with unskilled hands, is one of the most signal acts of presumption or foUy.\" It was in the same speech that, alluding to the influence of the constituencies on the House, Mr. Lowe remarked, \" As the polypus takes its colour from the rock to which it affixes itself, so do the members of this House take their character from the constituencies. 11 you lower the character of the constituencies, you lower that of the representatives, and you lower the character of this House.\" Forebodings. \u2014 Iu the course of the same debates in 1866, Mr. Lowe also expressed himself as follows : \" I am not afraid of the people of this country. What I do fear, what fills me with the gloomiest misgivings, is that I see a number of gentlemen of rank, property, and intelligence carried away without even being convinced, or aven over-persuaded, to support a policy which many of them iu their hearts dit^st and abhor. Monarchies exist by loyalty, aristocracies by honour, popular assemblies by political virtue. When these things begin to fail, it is in their loss. and not in comets, eclipses, and earthquakes, that we are to look for the portents that herald the fall of States.\" And again : \" We are about to exchange certain good for more than doubtful change ; we are about to barter maxims and traditions that have never failed, for theories and doctrines that have never succeeded. Democracy you may have at any time. Night and clay the gate is open that leads to that bare and level plain, where every ants'-nest is a mountain and every thistle a forest-tree. But a Government such as that of England is the work of no human hand. It has grown up by the imperceptible aggregation of centuries. It is a thing' which we only can enjoy, which we cannot impart to others, and which, once lost, we cannot recover for ourselves.\" The \" Shuttlecock \" of Reform.\u2014 Political Bedfellows.\u2014 Mr. Lowe was at times severely facetious on the abortive attempts made by successive Governments to settle the question of Parliamentary Reform. On one occasion he remarked : \" The way in which the two"], [425, "ROBERT LOWE (LORD SHERBROOKE). 4Q5 parties have tossed this question from one to the other, reminds me of nothing so much as a young lady and young gentleman playing at battle dore and shuttlecock. After tossing the shuttlecock from one to the other a few times, they let it drop and begin to flirt.\" In a speech in May, 1866, on the Refomi BiU of Earl RusseU's Administration, he thus noticed the objection raised by the Government to a postponement of the measure, that their honour would not permit them to take that course : \" I think we have heard too much about the honour of the Government. The honour of the Government obliged them to bring in a Reform Bill in 1860. It was withdrawn under circumstances which I need not allude to, and, as soon as it was withdrawn, the honour of the Government went to sleep. It slept for five years. Session after session it never so much as winked. So long as Lord Palmerston lived, honour slept soundly; but when Lord Palmerston died, and Lord RusseU succeeded by seniority to his place, the 'sleeping beauty' woke up. . . I think there was no great accession of honour gained last Monday in the division, when the House really by their vote took the management of the committee out of the hands of the Executive. All these things do not matter much to ordinary mortals, but to people of a Castilian turn of mind they are very serious. Sir, I have come to the conclusion that there must be two kinds of honour, and the only consola tion I can administer to the Government is in the words of Hudibras \u2014 ' If he that's in the battle slain Be on the bed of honour lain, Then he that's beaten may be said To lie on honour's truckle-bed.' \" To this Mr. Gladstone retorted, \"AU that portion of the right honourable gentleman's speech was one gross and continued error both of taste and judgment. Because, Sir, in these matters we must look, not only at the merits of the sermon, but at the individuality of the preacher; and I want to know what charge is to be made against the Government on this score, which cannot be made at the very least as easily against my right honourable friend ? In that ' truckle-bed ' there may be a bedfellow.\" Household Suffrage and Education. \u2014 \" Our Future Masters.\" \u2014 On the third reading of the Reform Bill in 1867, Mr. Lowe again denounced the extension that had been made in the franchise, and thus reforred to Mr. Bright : \" The honourable member for Birming- ham had been agitating the country for household suffrage \u2014 not meaning-. as we see by his conduct this session, to get household suffrage. He has got it now, and I ask, is he of opinion that it is easy to stop when you like in the path of concession ? The honourable member is something like Don Giovanni \u2014 which, by the way, is Italian for John. The Don asked the Commendatore to supper because he thought he could not come ; but the Commendatore did come. He said, ' Don Giovanni, you have invited me, and I am here ! ' That is very much the position of the honourable member for Birmingham. He invited household suffrage and it has come ; you can never stop when once you set the baU rolling.\" Mr. Lowe went on to say : \" I believe it wiU be absolutely necessary to compel"], [426, "406 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. our future masters to learn their letters. It wUl not be unworthy of a Conservative Government, at any rate, to do what can be done in that direction. I was opposed to centralisation \u2014 I am ready to accept centra- Usation. I was opposed to an education rate\u2014 I am now ready to accept it. The question is no longer a religious question ; it is a poUtical one. From the moment that you entrust the masses with power, their education becomes an absolute necessity ; and I believe that the existing system is one which is much superior to the much-vaunted continental system. But we shall have to destroy it ; it is not quality but quantity we shaU require.\" The Supreme Power in the State.\u2014 \" Tremendous Sim plicity.\" \u2014 In March, 1879, a motion in favour of the extension of the principle of household suffrage to counties was made in the House of Commons, and opposed by Mr. Lowe. In the course of his remarks he said : \" Most of us have been brought up in the doctrines of De Lolme and Blackstone. We have been told that the English Constitution is ono above all that have existed, that it is nicely and carefully balanced, that it is made up of different bodies, each of which has proper functions assigned to it, to which it confines itself, and that by the proper discharge of its duty it controls and prevents excess in any of the others. We have Blackstone's theory that the King represents power, the Lords represent wisdom, and the House of Commons represent good intentions (laughter), and that each of them discharges its functions without in the slightest degree trenching upon the functions of the other. We have indulged in these dreams long enough ; let us awake from them and see what is the reality. No doubt the time was when the King had predominant power in England ; but who can say that is the ease now p Without going into details, it is sufficient to say that the regal power is of such a nature now that it reaUy affords no strong or sufficient check or balance at aU in our Constitution. I am old enough to remember when the House of Lords measured itself with the House of Commons and chaUenged or overthrew its decisions. Who can say it is so now P That check also has departed. The fact is the whole power of executive administration is vested in the- Government of the day, and that depends for its existence upon the House of Commons ; and the whole power of this country \u2014 all that we have read of as divided among the different estates of the realm \u2014 has reaUy now entirely centred itself in the House of Commons, and everything turns upon its will. . . Our Constitution has been reduced to a state of what I can only call tremendous simplicity. We have simply an elective Assembly, and in that elective Assembly aU the powers of the State are really gathered up, and in it they are centred. If that be so, and if that elective Assembly misconduct itself, the only remedy is to go back to the con stituencies from which it is elected and to refer the matter to them, and from their decision there is no appeal, however momentous it may be. Having a body to which we have given the whole power over the- State in this country, which really has the single supreme power, which everything bows before, we should take care that it is fit for the discharge of that duty. That is the point of view from which I would suggest that honourable gentlemen should look at this question, and they should con-"], [427, "ROBERT LOWE (LORD SHERBROOKE). 407 sider whether, in the circumstances which must necessarUy arise, if we enter upon this downward course we are invited to follow, we can answer for the safety of our institutions.\" \"A Practical Man.\"\u2014 In 1880 Mr. Lowe abandoned his former position with regard to the extension of the franchise, and thus gave his reasons, in a speech on his re-election for London University : \" You took me as your representative at a time when you knew that I differed from the mass of the Liberal party on the subject of the franchise. That was a kindness I shall never forget. What has happened with regard to that question of the franchise ? Why, this. One half of the subject has been settled by those with whom I acted at that time, the Tories themselves. You see that Sir Stafford Northcote has been complaining of the masses of people who have sprung up everywhere, as if they were the dragon's teeth. But who sowed the dragon's teeth ? This has to be said, to the credit or discredit of the Tory Government \u2014 that this greater number of people have the franchise because the Tory Government, out-trumping the Whigs, gave it to them. Well, gentlemen, now conies the question of the county franchise. I am a practical man. You know that I fought as long as there was a possibility of success ; but I am now in this dilemma \u2014 if I go on any further I must unite with the Tories, who have already deceived and betrayed me (laughter and cheers), or else I must confess myself, as I humbly do, utterly beaten in this matter. I must confess that public opinion is entirely against me, and give up aU opposition whatever. Gentlemen, I prefer the latter course. (Cheers.) Politics are a practical science, and, as I have said from the first, what I desired was that tho subject should be fairly brought before the country, and that we should have its decision upon the question. WeU, it has been brought before the country in this election, and the decision of the Liberal party has been, so far as I know, absolutely unanimous. I, therefore, have nothing to do but to bow to that decision, and to hope that it may turn out better than I, for some time certainly, was in tho habit of apprehending.\" \"Ex Luce LuceUum.\" \u2014 Presenting Public Petitions. \u2014 On the 24th of April, 1871, a large procession of match-makers resident in the East-end of London was dispersed by the police while on its way to Westminster HaU. The object of the assemblage was to present a petition to the House of Commons against the tax of one halfpenny upon each box of lucifer matches, proposed by Mr. Lowe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in submitting his budget for the year. Several questions were, in consequence, put to the Home Secretary (Mr. Bruce) by various members on the 28th, relative to the grounds on which tho purpose of the petitioners had been interfered with and prevented by the poUce authorities. The Home Secretary, in reply, stated \" that such a procession was contrary to law \u2014 the law being that no large bodies of persons should go either to the Sovereign or to ParUament for the purpose of presenting a petition. The number permitted by law does not exceed ten persons. The Act of George III., known as the One MUe Act, appUcs to meetings, and provides that such meetings as that of Monday last shaU not be held within one mUe of Westminster.\" The tax referred to was to"], [428, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 408 have been collected by means of a stamp affixed to each box of matches. Ex luce lucellum\u2014\" out of light a little profit \"\u2014was the motto devised by Mr. Lowe for the labels connected with this new impost. The Com mittee, however, refused its sanction to that mode of increasing the revenue. The Chancellor bad imported the idea from the United States, where a similar tax produces a considerable amount annually. Introduction of the Sovereign's Name in Debate.\u2014 An Apology. \u2014 An important discussion arose in the House of Commons on the 2nd of May, 1S76. Mr. Lowe, at a Liberal banquet at East Retford, had spoken against the Royal Titles Bill, enabling the Queen to assume the title of Empress of India, and said : \" I strongly suspect that this is not now brought forward for the first time. I violate no confidence, because I have received none ; but I am under a conviction that at least two previous Ministers have entirely refused to have anything to do with such a change. More pliant persons have now been found, and I have no doubt the thing will be done.\" Mr. C. E. Lewis brought the subject before the House of Commons, moving for a copy of the oath taken by Privy Councillors, and said that, if Mr. Lowe's statement were true, two Prime Ministers must have broken their oath \"to keep secret the Queen's counsel.\" Mr. Lowe in reply denied the right of any member to caU him to account for anything said at a meeting in the country, unless the privUeges of the House were infringed, or a personal attack were made on an individual member. Thereupon Mr. Disraeli, as the head of the Government, said Mr. Lowe had attempted to hold up to public infamy the chief Minister by asserting that, after the Sovereign had been balked and baffled in her appeals to previous Ministers, she had found a pliant aud a servile instrument who was now ready to do her wiU. If the state- ment as to the proposals to previous Ministers were true, it ought not to have been made by a Privy CounciUor, and one who had been a Cabinet Minister ; but was it true ? Mr. Gladstone had immediately denied it, so far as he was concerned, in a letter to the press ; and Mr. Disraeli said he had lived on such terms of political confidence with Lord Derby, especiaUy at the time when the Queen assumed the government of India, that he was able to say that no such proposal had ever been made to him. As to Lord RusseU and Lord Palmerston, Mr. DisraeU went on to say he was authorised by her Majesty to make a statement to the House. Some objections were urged on the Opposition side to this statement being received ; but the Speaker ruled that, as the name of the Sovereign was not to be introduced to influence the opinion of the House, the communication Mr. Disraeli proposed to make was not out of order. The Prime Minister then said there was not the slightest foundation for Mr. Lowe's story, and that the Queen had authorised him to state that at no time had any proposal to introduce such a measure been made to any Minister. The story, therefore, was a piece of calumnious gossip of the kind which would always be circulated, but which no one would expect from the mouth of a Privy Councillor and an ex-Cabinet Minister. \u2014 Mr. Lewis's motion was carried by 91 to 37, and two nights afterwards Mr. Lowe asked permission of the House to make a personal statement. He said he"], [429, "JOHN ARTHUR ROEBUCK. 409 had employed the interval in considering the matter, and, although he had believed the statement made at Retford to be true at the time, he must acknowledge he ought not to have made it. \" It was wrong,\" said he, \" because no one has a right to drag the name of the Sovereign, even indirectly, into our disputes in this House. (Cheers.) I sincerely regret that I did not remember the fact that in the whole of the Queen's dominions her Majesty is, by reason of her sovereign dignity, the only person upon whom is imposed tho disability of not being able to say any thing in personal defence. That alone, if there was no other reason, ought to have closed my mouth, and I hope the House wiU consider my acknowledgment both full aud ample. (Cheers.) But, Sir, that is not aU. After the communication which her Majesty has been pleased to make, I cannot doubt for a moment that I was entirely mistaken in what I asserted ; and nothing remains for me except to express my most sincere and extreme regret, as one who is whoUy and heartily a dutiful and loyal subject of her Majesty, that I have caused her Majesty to have been put to what she will have felt the disagreeable necessity of making a communication on such a subject to the House \u2014 a necessity that ought never to have been imposed upon her. I retract everything that I said, and, if such a thing be proper from a subject to his Sovereign, I humbly offer my most sincere apologies to her Majesty for the error that I have committed.\" (Loud cheers.) The Golden Age of a Government. \u2014 In the course of a speech returning thanks for his re-election by the University of London in April, 1880, Mr. Lowe said : \" What I want to point out to you is what I think it extremely important should be always remembered by Governments, I havmg now had the honour of serving in a good many. The first moments of a Government are golden. Napoleon said that people grow old quickly on fields of battle ; but Governments grow old more quickly still in the battle-fields of Parliament. The first year of a Government is golden, the second silvern, and it soon arrives at the iron age. Wisdom lies in seizing as far as possible upon these golden moments. Things may be done and questions may be settled between this time and next August, which if delayed it might afterwards be impossible to do or settle for ten years. There is every stimulus to activity and boldness. Now is the time when we can reaUy strike with effect, whereas nobody can tell what to morrow may bring forth. The very strength of a Government is sure to engender combats and weakness within, and gradually to eat into its power and essence. Therefore I hope no time will be lost in bringing forward measures of secondary importance, but that the opportunity wiU be used to deal with matters of the first and greatest importance.\" JOHN ARTHUR ROEBUCK. (1801\u20141879.) \" Tear 'em.\" \u2014 In a speech delivered at the Cutlers' Feast. Sheffield, September 2nd, 1858, Mr. Roebuck referred to the visit he had just paid to Cherbourg with other members of the House of Commons. After"], [430, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 410 expressing, in strong language, his opinion of the character of the French ruler, he proceeded : \" It may be said that those who stand in my posi tion ought not to say anything that excites national animosity; and I respond to that sentiment. But, Sir, the farmer who goes to sleep, having placed the watch-dog ' Tear 'em ' over his rick-yard, hears that watch-dog bark. He, in the anger of a half somnolence, says, ' I wish Tear 'em would be quiet ; ' and bawls out of the window, ' Down, Tear 'em.' ' Tear 'em ' does go down ; the farmer goes to sleep, and he is awoke by the flashing in at his windows of the light of his ricks on fire. I am ' Tear 'em.' I tell you to beware. What is the meaning of Cher bourg ? It is a standing menace to England.\" An Unaccustomed Character. \u2014 Mr. Roebuck, in one of the debates in 1855 on the condition of the Crimean army and the conduct of Ministers, spoke of the Duke of Newcastle as \" a scapegoat that had been sent into the wUdemess with the sins of the Administration on his head.\" He was replied to by some of the duke's coUeagues with great severity ; whereupon he said, \" Sir, I take shame to myself for once in my life. I have indulged in panegyric, but, like almost aU other men who attempt a character to which they are not accustomed, I have faded in representing it, and have faded also most completely in making myself understood. I did object to making the Duke of Newcastle a scapegoat. I gave that noble duke credit for industry and good intentions, and I said that he had done his duty according to his ability. Then I am turned round upon because I am said to have eulogised the noble duke.\" Official Restraint v. Political Morality. \u2014 In a speech at Shef field in 1868, Mr. Roebuck alluded to one he had made there during the American civil war, and to a conversation afterwards on the subject with Lord Palmerston. \"The moment I got into his room \u2014 he was standing writing at his desk, as he always did \u2014 he turned round and put out his hands, and said, ' Roebuck, Roebuck, what a devilish good speech you made in Sheffield ! ' I said, ' My lord, I am greatly obliged to you, and flattered for the kind phrase you have used about my speech ' \u2014 though it was rather a hard one, you know ; ' I am very much flattered.' ' Flat tered p ' he said. ' Why, I am entirely of your opinion, but I dare not officiaUy say so.' Now that struck me, according to the old woman's phrase, all of a heap, \u2014 that a man in power should say to me openly and without disguise that he was entirely of my opinion, and lead the people of England directly the opposite way. That, said I, is modern political moraUty. I did my work with the gay and pleasant old lord, and bowed my way out of his room.\" Reading from a Newspaper. \u2014 Mr. Roebuck was making a speech in 1855 on the resignation of Lord John Russell, after his return from the conference at Vienna on the war between Russia and the allies, when an incident occurred which is thus referred to in \" Hansard -. \" \" The honourable and learned gentleman was beginning to read a passage in Lord John RusseU's speech from a newspaper, when he was interrupted by caUs to ' order ; ' whereupon he tore a piece out of the newspaper and was proceeding with his quotation, when Mr. Speaker said the rules of the"], [431, "JOHN ARTHUR ROEBUCK. 41X House did not allow the honourable and learned member to quote from a newspaper a speech which had been delivered during the session, aud he did not think the honourable and learned member could cure the irregu larity by tearing a piece out. Mr. Roebuck : ' Then I will give the effect of the noble lord's statement from my own memory ; and if I am incorrect, the fault is not with me, but with the rule of the House which obliges me to rely upon that faulty instrument when I have a correct report at hand.' \"*\" An Independent Menibsr. \u2014 Mr. Roebuck on several occasions received from his constituents at Sheffield acknowledgment of his parlia mentary services, in the form of testimonials including purses of from one to three thousand pounds. On one of these presentations he said : \" I ask myself what it is that has given me the present occasion of returning you my thanks. It is not talent ; it is not name ; it is not rank ; it is not wealth. What is it, then ? It is steadfastness to the path which I marked out for myself in the beginning. I am proud to say that in the year 1832 I published a programme of the opinions I then held. I had prepared myself for a public life. I bad then formed my opinions ; I consigned them to paper ; I printed them ; and to them I now adhere. That which I said in 1832 I now say, and it is my thorough and steadfast adherence to the opinions which I then expressed that has won for me the approba tion of my countrymen. Going into Parliament unknown, unsupported, only recommended by that tried friend of the people, the late Joseph Hume, I determined not to ally myself with either of the great parties which then divided the House of Commons and the kingdom. I was neither Whig nor Tory, and I went into the House of Commons determined to advocate that which I believed to be for the interests of the people without regard to party consideration. To that rule I have adhered through life.\" Patriotism versus Party. \u2014 Perhaps the most striking display of Mr. Roebuck's independent spirit occurred in 1878. When, in anticipation of war with Russia, the Government of Lord Beaconsfield had summoned a contingent of Indian troops to Malta, a motion condemning the step was introduced in the House of Commons by the Marquis of Hartington, and, after three nights' debate, was decided in favour of the Government by 347 to 226. On the night of the division (May 23) Mr. Roebuck, then seventy-seven years of age, made a speech in support of the Ministry, from his usual seat below the gangway on the Opposition side of the House. In the course of his remarks he said : \" It appears to me that this debate is most inopportune, and the mode in which it has been conducted is even mischievous. . . I would ask the House, and I wiU ask my country, to weigh in the balance the conduct of the two sides of the House. On the one side we have the Executive Government; and will anybody say that they are not desirous to maintain the true interests of England ? WiU anybody say that they are not conversant with all the difficulties of the position in which they are placed \u2014 that they are not acquainted with the difficulties abroad as well as at home ? And, notwith standing aU this, they stand firm in their determination to maintain the * See Miscellaneous section, \" Heading from Newspapers.\""], [432, "412 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. interests of Europe against an over-ruling and despotic Power. That is the conduct of that side of the House. What is the conduct of this side ? Why, when the Government are in this critical position, when the interests of England are at stake, honourable members on this side come forward \u2014 with what? With a vague general proposition about some point of technical law. If it has not been done for purposes of faction, for what purpose has it been? . . If their grounds are weak and insufficient, punish them; but do not interfere with them at the very moment when the interests and vitality of the country are at stake. At the very moment when there is a crisis in the negotiations, you come down to trouble and embarrass the Government with a resolution of this sort. That is not what honest and patriotic men would do. But this is not a departure from the rules of conduct adopted by an Opposition. During the whole of the Napoleonic war there was an Opposition in the House of Commons which did precisely the same thing. They hampered the Government, they abused the general, and, until the battle of Salamanca, it was the one grand purpose of the Opposition to decry the Duke of Wellington. That is exactly what they are doing now; it is the same narrow and heartless spirit that guides their conduct. They feel that they cannot assail the Government directly \u2014 that they cannot rush forward and say, 'We wiU burn your camp over your heads by a vote of censure.' No ; they cannot do that, but they say, ' We can trouble you, we can weaken yonr country, we can make England less powerful than she is, and we wiU do it ; ' and to the utmost of their power they are doing it.\" The member (Mr. HaU) who rose immediately after Mr. Roebuck, said he \" hoped the patriotic words of one of the most venerated members of the House might extend to the four corners of the empire.\" But the indigna tion of the Opposition, who counted Mr. Roebuck as one of their own party, was greatly aroused. Leaving the House for a time, when he returned he found his usual seat among Liberal members below the gangway occupied by others. An eye-witness thus described what followed : \" Mr. Roebuck then returned to the bar, whereupon two honourable members, who had been sitting below the Conservative gang way, vacated their places, and invited him to seat himself there. The honourable gentleman accepted the invitation, and the incident, which had been watched with interest by a full House, gave rise to prolonged cheering and counter cheering.\" Sir Henry James, who had been speaking on the side of the Opposition when Mr. Roebuck re-entered, in continuing his remarks after the interruption, said he was glad to see the honourable member for Sheffield at length in his proper place ; where upon the cheers and counter cheers broke out as before. RALPH BERNAL OSBORNE. (1814\u20141882.) A Powerful Voice.\u2014 Ralph Bernal Osborne inherited from his Jewish ancestors a power of voice that is not usually granted to the Aryan races. That voice, it is said, was heard at the distance of nearly a"], [433, "RALPH BERNAL OSBORNE. 41<J mile from the hustings at Brentford when he stood, and came in, for Middlesex. In the House of Commons, whenever he spoke, it rang through the benches like the sound of a trumpet. And the trumpet gave no uncertain sound, for no speech of his but contained some witticism which clung to the memories of his hearers. \u2014 Quarterly Review. The \" Stormy Petrel of Debate.\"\u2014 The nature of Mr. Bernal Osborne's appearances in parliamentary strife caused this name to be applied to him by Dr. Giffard, long editor of the Standard newspaper. One of the most effective passages in Mr. Osborne's peculiar vein occurred in the great debate on the conduct of the Government with respect to Denmark, in July, 1864. The speaker thus alluded to Lord Palmerston and his Cabinet : \" The noble lord and the gentlemen on the Treasury Bench are men of great capacity, but a little past their time, and they bungle a little ; but if they wish to put tho country in a proper position with foreign powers, and restore the just influence of England, it might be easily done by their imitating that custom which is obligatory on unsuccessful officials in Japan. If, Sir, they would enact, in a modified form, that ' happy despatch ' which we have leamt from the Asiatics, I am sure this country would at once regain its proper position. . . There sits the noble lord. Sedet, \u0153ternumque sedebit. I was about to add, but it would not be true \u2014 infelix. I wish to speak of him with every respect, because I believe that a more active or a more able man never existed in this country. (General cheers.) It is said of him that ' Panting time toils after him in vain.' He is certainly facile princeps, the liveliest, if not the youngest, on tho Treasury bench. The noble lord deserves great credit for his admirable management through so long a time of the affairs of this House. He has acted with all sorts of men, and agreed with all sorts of opinions. These are great feats, but what is his policy ? Sir, his domestic policy, not to go beyond the lino of debate, is paternal but stationary ; his foreign policy up to this day has been pugnacious but progressive. . . I have not been unfair to the noble lord ; but now let us go into his Cabinet. His Cabinet is a museum of curiosities. There, Sir, are to be found some birds of rare and noble plumage, both alive and stuffed. (Great laughter.) But, unfortunately, there is a difficulty in keeping up the breed. For those Whig birds have been very barren, and they were obhged to take a cross with the famous Peelite breed. Certainly it cannot be said, either by their enemies or friends, that they have been prolific of measures since they have taken office. Even my right honourable friend (Mr. M. Gibson) \u2014 who is not connected with them by family, and somehow got into tho Cabinet, but, like the fly in amber, ' one wonders how the deril he got there ' \u2014 has not been fertile. I must say that his honourable friends the members for Rochdale (Mr. Miall) and Birmingham (Mr. Bright) are, I think, disappointed in this ' young man from the country.' When he married into tho family we expected some Uberal measures, but the right honourable gentleman has become indolent, and almost quarrelsome, under the guidance of the noble lord. Well, Sir, what is to be done ? We know by the traditions of the great Whig party that they wUl cling to the"], [434, "414 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. vessel, if not like shipwrecked sailors, like those testaceous marine animals -which somehow adhere to the bottom, thereby clogging the engines and impeding the progress. Sir, should a vote of this House displace that administration, what are the Liberal party to do ? Well, my advice to them is that they may feel perfectly happy as to the issue of this great duel which is being fought. They are somewhat in the situation of Iago in the play, and may say like him, ' Whether Cassio kills Roderigo, or Roderigo kills Cassio, or each kills the other,' they must gain. \" \"Angling for a PoHcy.\" \u2014 Another of Mr. Osborne's peculiar sallies occurred in a discussion on the Reform Bill of the Derby-Disraeli Ministry, in April, 1867 : \" The right honourable gentleman (Mr. Disraeli), iu introducing this measure, disclaimed the idea that in bringing forward these resolutions, which have been called a tentative process, he was angling for a policy. Well, I take it that angling for a policy is to some extent a tentative process ; at any rate, angling for a poUcy may be a fair and legitimate parliamentary practice. But, Sir, there is a species of fishing which is neither fair, sportsmanlike, nor legitimate. My honour able friend, the member for Birmingham (Mr. Bright), who is, I believe, a salmon fisher, knows to what I allude. There is a thing called cross fishing, where one line is used with different coloured baits, and where both sides of the stream are swept. The right honourable gentleman the ChanceUor of the Exchequer and his colleague, the President of the Poor Law Board, have lately been employed in this unsportsmanlike transaction. They have been fishing both sides of the parliamentary river \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 aud we have all seen with what success. The other evening the President of the Poor Law Board skilfully threw his flies over the head of the honourable member for Lincolnshire (Mr. B. Stanhope), and with drew the dual vote and two years' residence. That solitary fish rose to the occasion, and he was safely gaffed and landed. But after that, the Chancellor of the Exchequer threw the fly of household suffrage \u2014 not a real fly \u2014 down below the gangway on this side of the river, and imme diately my honourable and learned friend the member for Sheffield (Mr. Roebuck) gorged the bait, and was safely landed in the Ministerial basket. Such is the tentative process which has been going on. Now the right honourable gentleman has given up using the rod and taken to the net, and he has caught forty-eight members.\" (Great laughter.) EARL GRANVILLE. (1815\u20141891.) First Foreign Secretaryship. \u2014 Earl GranviUe was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs for the first time on the death of the Earl of Clarendon in June, 1870. Entering upon his duties at the Foreign Office on the 5th of July, he was informed by the permanent Under Secretary of State (Mr. Hammond) that \" in aU his experience he had never known so great a lull in foreign affairs.\" Two days after, the Spanish Government announced its intention to propose Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern as a candidate for the crown; and in ten days, war between Franco and Germany had become inevitable."], [435, "EARL GRANVILLE. 415 Family Connections. \u2014 Earl Granville's introduction to office, as a -connection of the \" great Whig families \" which long regarded Ministerial arrangements as their peculiar right, was thus alluded to by the writer of a sparkUng series of \" Political Portraits,\" published in 1873 : \" It was from the royal household that Lord GranvUle entered upon the career in which he has since achieved all but the highest place, with probably the succession to the highest place, in the Liberal party. For the first two years of Lord John Russell's first Administration he held the office of Master of the Buckhounds. He had been Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs for a few months before tbe break-up of the Melbourne Govern- ment, having previously served an apprenticeship to diplomacy as attache in Paris during his father's embassy there ; and had sat for ten years in the House of Commons before his succession to the peerage in 1846. But his political career really began with his transfer by Lord John RusseU, in 1848, from the charge of her Majesty's Buckhounds to the Vice- Presidency of the Board of Trade. Great was the clamour which this appointment raised below the gangway. ' Is thy servant a dog ? ' said Manchester, indignant at being handed over to the Master of the Buck hounds. Mr. Bright, we beUeve, made himself the mouthpiece of its anger in the House of Commons, and spoke his mind with that frank disregard of persons which has always characterised him. The appointment was denounced as a piece of nepotism on Lord John Russell's part. Very much to his credit, Mr. Bright not long afterwards admitted that Lord GranvUle's conduct at the Board of Trade had justified Lord John RusseU's selection, and had not justified his own assault. Lord John RusseU, with pardonable perversity, was more deeply aggrieved by the retractation than by the original charge. The word nepotism, naturaUy odious to a RusseU, rankled in his mind ; and ho ridiculed the idea that famUy affection for a descendant of his grandmother could influence his political appointments. Lord RusseU's grandmother does, indeed, carry the mind back to a period of history apparently too remote to affect Ministerial combinations. For a time, however, the unfilial aUusion of her grandson, and his ostentations indifference to her posterity outside the house of Bedford, gave the old lady an historical resurrection ; and Lord RusseU's grandmother, as the Mother Eve of an entire Whig Cabinet, became a subject of genealogical interest. .' ; was on this or on some similar occasion that Mr. Beraal Osborne accounted on physiological principles for the ricketiness of their legislative offspring, on the ground that all the members of the Govern ment were nearly related to each other.\" Making a Clean Breast. \u2014 Lord GranviUe on one occasion humorously aUuded to his family connections in the House of Lords. Defending, in 1855, the constitution of Lord Palmerston's Ministry, in which he was Lord President of the Council. Lord Granville said : \" My lords, I had better make a clean breast of it at once ; and I am obliged to admit that some of those who wont before me had such quivers fuU of daughters who did not die old maids, that I have relations on this side of the house, relations upon the cross-benches, relations upon the opposite side of the house, and I actually bad the unparalleled misfortune to have no"], [436, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 416 fewer than three in the Protectionist Administration of my noble friend opposite \" (the Earl of Derby). Declining the Premiership.\u2014 On the resignation of the Earl of Derby in 1859, Earl GranviUe was sent for by the Queen to form a Cabinet. That this should have been the case, in the lifetime both of Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston, who had in turn occupied tho principal offices of the State and held the reins of government, was the subject of much comment; but the matter was thus explained in a \" com munication\" which the Times published on the 13th of June in that year : \" Her Majesty, after listening to aU the objections which Lord Granville had to offer, commanded him to attempt to form an administration which should at once be strong in ability and parliamentary influence, and should at the same time comprehend within itself a fuU and fair repre sentation of all the sections into which the Liberal party has notoriously been divided. Feeling, probably, that it might be urged as an objection to this course that Lord GranviUe, who has never yet held the office of Prime Minister, would thus be placed in a position paramount to that occupied by Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, each of whom had served her long and faithfully in many high offices of state, and had each fiUed the office of First Minister of the Crown, her Majesty was pleased to observe that she had in the first instance turned her thoughts towards Lord Palmerston and Lord John RusseU. Her Majesty felt, however, that to make so marked a distinction as is implied in the choice of one or other of two statesmen so firil of years and honours, and possessing so just a claim on the consideration of the Queen, would be a very invidious and unwelcome task. Her Majesty also observed that Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston appeared to represent different sections of the Liberal party ; Lord Palmerston the more Conservative, and Lord John RusseU the more popular section. Impressed with these difficulties, her Majesty cast her eyes on Lord GranviUe, the acknowledged leader of the Liberal party in the House of Lords, in whom both Lord John RusseU and Lord Palmerston had been in the habit of placing confidence, and who might have greater facUities for uniting the whole Liberal party under one administration than could be enjoyed by either of the sectional leaders.\" The publication of this statement gave rise to remark in the House of Lords, to which Earl Granville repUed that he had asked and obtained from her Majesty permission to state to his political friends the result of what had occurred, but it was never intended that it should be communicated to any newspaper. At the same time, he could not see that any injury had resulted from the pubUcation, seeing that her Majesty appeared therein, as ever, desirous of walking in the spirit of the Con stitution. \u2014 Lord Palmerston became Premier for the second time on this occasion. In 1880 Lord GranviUe was again invited to form a Ministry, but decUned in favour of Mr. Gladstone. \"Ministerial Position.\" \u2014 In May, 1882, Lord Stratheden and Campbell had given notice that he would \" call attention to the Ministerial position,\" but refrained from doing so at the appointed time, contenting himself with moving for correspondence respecting the affairs of Egypt."], [437, "EARL GRANVILLE. 417 Earl Granville, remarking on the circumstances as a \" Minister,\" began with a story. \" When,\" said he, \" M. Thiers, the late President of the French Republic, was appointed Minister of the Interior under Louis Philippe, he revisited his native place, and called on his old schoolmaster, and asked him if he remembered his face. The schoolmaster said he did not. ' What,' exclaimed the Minister, ' don't you remember Uttle Adolphe ? ' The schoolmaster replied, ' Yes ; the little rascal was always playing tricks. I knew you would never come to any good. What are you now ? ' ' I am a Minister,' was the response. ' Good heavens ! ' ejaculated the astonished schoolmaster, ' You don't mean to say you have become a priest ? ' He (Lord Granville) would say that he was absolutely in the dark as to his noble friend's intention. For several days the noble lord had held this sword of Damocles over their heads, and then it was as suddenly and silently withdrawn.\" He concluded by saying that it would not be for the public advantage to give the required information at that particular time. A Handicapping Story. \u2014 Earl Granville, making a statement in the House of Lords in 1884 respecting the abortive Conference of European Powers on the affairs of Egypt, gave the following illustration of the preliminary Anglo-French agreement, which had met with con siderable criticism in both countries : \" Charles Fox, when he invented handicapping two race-horses, advised that the owner of each should place a sovereign in the hands of the handicapper. If one owner accepted the award, and the other refused, the sovereign went to the owner who accepted ; or, if both owners refused, the sovereigns remained with tho handicapper, who, Mr. Fox thought, might be assumed to have come to a fair and right decision. On the principle which a great statesman applied to a mere pastime, it may equally be argued that, when two Governments arrive at an adjustment of a national difference which at first obtains the approval of both countries, or which provokes considerable criticism in both, there is an d priori probability that the arrangement has not been of a very one-sided character.\" This gave occasion to the following from the Marquis of Salisbury : \" I do not understand the pleasant apologue which the noble earl told us from the history of Charles Fox, that, if the owners did not agree, the handicapper got the money. The owners are England and France, but who is the handicapper ? Who has got the money on this occasion P Some very powerful person, somebody they won't trust in, somebody who has got advantages which they have not got \u2014 I shall not mention who. I have not the advantage of the noble earl's eyes, to indicate the personage who must be considered the handicapper on this occasion ; but I am afraid that in the future the truth of the noble earl's apologue wiU be shown.\" A Good-humoured Rejoinder. \u2014 An instance of Earl GranviUe's good-humour in reply occurred in the debate on the Address, October 24, 1884. Lord Salisbury had said that a noble lord (Durham), a supporter of the Government, in addressing a provincial audience, had described how the majority of the previous July was obtained in that House, and proceeded to give a fancy sketch of the Conservative peers. \" He said E E"], [438, "418 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. this : ' It was fifty or sixty peers who formed that majority. He wished his audience could have seen some of them. There were old men in skidl caps, the lame, the deaf, and the blind. Heaven knew where some of them came from, but he did not know where they would go to. Possibly they might be sent to the British Museum. These devoted gentlemen were the subservient tools and voiceless followers of Lord Salisbury.' This remarkable utterance (said Lord Salisbury) is, perhaps, more worthy of attention than it otherwise would be, because this noble lord (Lord Durham) is, I believe, the only peer whom Mr. Chamberlain has ever eulogised.\" To this Earl Granville rejoined : \" I am not going to take up Mr. Chamberlain's particular phrases. It is not likely that I should share in his depreciation of the House of Lords ; but I am bound to say, when the noble marquis refers to me whether I know of any lame, or deaf, or blind to be found among your lordships, I am obliged to make the melancholy confession that I myself am always somewhat deaf, and that I am very often lame, but I trust to keep my eyesight a little longer.\" Opportunism. \u2014 Lord Granville made the following remarks concern ing the then existing Government of Lord Salisbury, at an election at Hanley in November, 1885 : \" In deciding the point as to whether the present Government were opportunists or not, they must first settle what opportunism was. In order to confirm his own judgment, he had asked an Englishman, a Frenchman, and an Italian what opportunism was. All three of them were men of great authority, great knowledge, and ability. The Englishman said, opportunism was ' the preference of expediency to principle ; ' the Frenchman said, he thought it was ' coquetting with principles which you do not approve of in your heart ; ' and the Italian, with the shrewdness of his nation, said ' it was adapting yourself to the circumstances which were the most likely to get you into power and to maintain you there.' All these three definitions very much applied to the conduct of the present Government since they had been in office.\" A Reply to the Duke of Argyll. \u2014 The Duke of Argyll having, on the third reading of the Criminal Law Amendment (Ireland) Bill (July 18, 1887), made some observations reflecting upon the conduct of the front Opposition bench, Earl Granville (leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords) replied as follows : \" As to the speech which the noble duke has made, I will ask the House to bear with me while I tell a story of between thirty and forty years ago. At that time the noble duke was supposed to be a great enemy of the Conservative party, and a rumour was spread that he was going to make a crushing attack upon the late Earl of Derby. There was great excitement, and we all came down to this House and heard a magnificent speech from the noble duke. We were equally curious to know what the Earl of Derby thought of it ; but the noble earl unfortunately condensed his reply into the answer which was given by a navvy, who, when asked why he allowed his wife to beat him so, said, ' Well, it amuses her and it doesn't hurt me.' I am much in the same position in reference to my noble friend's speech; but, whether it is attributable to my obtuseness of understanding or to the thickness of my skin. I really do not feel it. Notwithstanding tho vigour of a personal"], [439, "EARL GRANVILLE. 419 onslaught of which he does not appear to be aware, I am convinced that my noble friend is one of the best of personal friends, and one of the most tender-hearted of men.\" \u00ab The Work of a Foreign Minister.\u2014 In the debate on the Address at the opening of the session in January, 1887, Lord Granville raised objection to the combination by the Marquis of Salisbury of the offices of Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. He said: \"I believe this com bination is bad for the country, bad for the Sovereign, bad for the Cabinet, and most unfair to the noble marquis himself. I have had some oppor tunity of observing the work of the Prime Minister. It is true that at some moments it is not overwhelming, but there are periods in which almost every hour the Prime Minister is required to advise the Queen, to maintain harmony in the Cabinet, to regulate the action of the different departments, to superintend the preparation of legislation, and to watch over the Parliamentary business of both Houses. When I first entered the Foreign Office, in a subordinate capacity, the despatches were some 17,000 in the year ; when I succeeded Lord Palmerston they were 34,000 ; in 1870 they had risen to 70,000 ; and I believe they have now risen to more than 90,000. Lord Palmerston told us in 1852 that the routine work at the Foreign Office took him eight hours a day,* and this exclusive of diplomatic conversations, Parliamentary attendance, and the performance of all Court and social duties. Of all the offices I have ever known, the Foreign Office is the one in which it is least possible for a Secretary of State to remain ignorant of the general work of the office. He would be found out in a week. And I do say that it is impossible for anybody to have the mental and physical strength to carry on the duties of both offices in their full operation.\" The Marquis of Salisbury, in reply, defended the combination of offices, and said : \" The work of the Foreign Office has been diminished since Lord Palmerston's day, from the fact that two under-secretaries have been appointed, and the use of tho telegraph has very much diminished the number of important despatches. Practically the business of the office is now mainly done by the telegraph, and the telegrams are seen, as the noble lord knows, by all the members of the Cabinet as fast as they arrive. The knowledge of what is done is common to all members of the Cabinet, and the Foreign Minister is twenty times more under the control of his colleagues than he was in the time of Lord Palmerston. Lord Palmerston was practicaUy supreme, and the control of the Prime Minister was a very imaginary control indeed.\" Mot Beaten. \u2014 Mr. Forster, in addressing a Liberal gathering at Stonehouse in August, 1883, said : \" I do not think there is any man living to whom the Liberal party owes more than to Lord Granville. It is no slight matter to have to lead a House of Lords under a Liberal Ministry with a majority against one. Some little time ago I came across an old schoolfellow of Lord Granville 's, and he told me a very good story concerning him. He said he remembered being at school with him, and they had not got rid in those days \u2014 and I do not think they have got rid * See page 291. E E 2"], [440, "420 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. of it altogether now \u2014 of boys resorting to fisticuffs and having a pitched battle. It was Lord Granville's fate to have to fight a boy much bigger than himself, with whom he had not the ghost of a chance. But he went at it, and managed to stand up to his opponent after being knocked down time after time, because he knew that the school bell would ring, and that, if he kept up until it was rung, he would not be actually beaten ; and so he did keep up until the bell rang, and was not beaten. Well, Lord Granville has had to do the same thing in the House of Lords. He has had to keep fighting until the bell rang, and woke up public feeUng, and after all he has not been beaten.\" THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. (1830.) His Ministerial Career. \u2014 Tho Marquis of Salisbury, before his call to the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1867, was well known in the House of Commons as Lord Robert Cecil, and afterwards as Lord Cranborne. He resigned the office of Secretary for India in 1867, when the Earl of Derby's Cabinet determined on a large measure of parliamentary reform ; General Peel and the Earl of Carnarvon also retiring from the Government at the same time. He returned to the Indian Secretaryship in 1874, under Mr. Disraeli's leadership, and became Foreign Secretary on the resignation of the Earl of Derby in 1878. The Marquis of Salisbury attended the conference at Constantinople in 1876 as special ambassador, and was associated with Lord Beaconsfield in the representation of England at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The Theory of Government. \u2014 A \" Policy of Legerdemain.\" \u2014 Lord Cranborne, on his retirement from the Earl of Derby's Govern ment in 1867 on account of its policy with respect to Reform, severely attacked the ministerial biU, and on its final passage made the foUow ing remarks : \"I have heard it said that this biU is a Conservative triumph. Lf it be a Conservative triumph to have adopted the principles of your most determined adversary, the honourable member for Birming ham [Mr. Bright] ; if it be a Conservative triumph to have introduced a biU guarded with precautions and securities, and to have abandoned every one of those precautions and securities at the bidding of your oppo nents, then in the whole course of your annals I wiU venture to say the Conservative party has won no triumph so signal. After aU, onr theory of government is not that a certain number of statesmen should place themselves in office and do whatever the House of Commons bids them. Our theory of government is that on each side of the House there should be men supporting definite opinions, and that what they have supported in opposition they should adhere to in office, and that everyone should know, from the fact of their being in office, that those particular opinions wiU be supported. If you reverse that, and declare that, no matter what a man has supported in opposition, the moment he gets into office it shall be open to him to reverse and repudiate it all, you practically destroy the whole basis on which our form of government rests, and you make the House of"], [441, "THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. 421 Commons a mere scrambling-place for office. You practically banish all honourable men from the political arena, and you will find in the long run that the time wUl come when your statesmen wiU be nothing but political adventurers, and that professions of opinion wUl be looked upon only as so many political man\u0153uvres for the purpose of attaining office. . . I entreat honourable gentlemen opposite not to believe that my feelings on this subject are dictated simply by my hostility to this measure, though I object to it most strongly, as the House is aware. But even if I took a contrary view, if I deemed it to be most advantageous, I should stUl deeply regret that the position of tho executive should have been so degraded as it has been in the present session. I should deeply regret to find that the House of Commons has applauded a policy of legerdemain. And I should above all things regret that this great gift to the people \u2014 if gift you think it \u2014 should have been purchased by a political betrayal which has no parallel in our parliamentary annals, which strikes at the root of all that mutual confidence which is the very soul of our party government, aud on which only tho strength and freedom of our represen tative institutions can be sustained.\" Ministerial Heroism. \u2014 At a Conservative banquet at Hertford in October, 1873, the Marquis of Salisbury attacked Mr. Gladstone's Ad ministration in his most characteristic style, as \" a Ministry of heroic measures.\" He said : \" Far be it from me to accuse them of heroism. They keep their heroism to the Home Office ; they don't let it transgress the threshold of the Foreign Office. They offer to us a remarkable instance of Christian meekness and humility ; but I am afraid it is that kind of Christian meekness which turns the left cheek to Russia and America, and demands the uttermost farthing of Ashantee. This, how ever, is to be said for their heroism, that as regards these islands there is no doubt it has been heroism approaching to sternness towards every interest that happened to belong to the minority defeated at the poU.\" \" A Great Master.\" \u2014 The House of Commons having amended the PubUc Worship Regulation Bill, as passed by the House of Lords in 1874, Lord Salisbury spoke of the \" bluster \" of the lower Assembly, and aUuded to the majority there as a \" bugbear.\" This caused Mr. Disraeli (then Prime Minister) to make the foUowing remarks in the House of Commons respecting the language of the Indian Secretary : \" As to Lord SaUsbury's language, let us not for a moment be diverted from the course which wo think, as wise and grave men, we ought to foUow, by any allu sions to the spirit of any speech which may have been made in the course of the debates in the other House of Parliament. My noble friend was long a member of this House, and is well known to many of the members \u25a0even of this Parliament. He is not a man who measures his phrases. He is one who is a great master of gibes and flouts and jeers ; but I don't suppose there is anyone who is prejudiced against a member of ParUa ment on account of such qualifications. My noble friend knows the House of Commons weU, and he is not perhaps superior to the considera tion that by making a speech of that kind, and taunting respectable men like ourselves as being a ' blustering majority,' he probably might stimu-"], [442, "422 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. late the amour propre of some individuals to take the course which he wants, and to defeat the bid. Now, I hope we shall not fall into that trap. I hope we shall show my noble friend that we remember some of his man\u0153uvres when he was a simple member of this House, and that we are not to be taunted into taking a very indiscreet step, a step ruinous to all our own wishes and expectations, merely to show that we resent the con temptuous phrases of one of my colleagues.\" Free Discussion. \u2014 Iu 1868, the Marquis of Salisbury, responding to tho toast of the House of Lords at a banquet given by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said : \" Although the Upper House was not yet one of the subjects of the day, he expected it would become one, aud he looked forward to that contingency without appreheusion. Everybody was the better for being looked after, and he would abide by the principle that any institution which could not hold its own ground on the free and fair discnssion of its merits should cease to exist.\" Speech on the Compensation for Disturbance Bill. \u2014 On the proposal for the second reading of the Compensation for Disturbance (Ireland) BiU, which was rejected by the House of Lords in August, 1880, the Marquis of Salisbury made a vigorous speech against the measure. In the course of it he alluded to Mr. Gladstone's statement that Ireland was coming \"within measureable distance \" of civd war, and said : \"If it be really true that there is this great public emergency \u2014 a fact which has not been established to us by any reasonable evidence \u2014 and if you have no other way of meeting it except by suspending the ordinary right of the landlord to recover his just debts, then you are bound to lay upon the whole community the sacrifice that is necessary for the whole, and to compensate the landlord for the loss you inflict upon him. But let us be careful how in this hasty way we admit the existence of these great emergencies to justify the suspension of onr ordinary usages. When such exaggerated claims to confidence on the part of the existing Executive are put forward, it is impossible to forget that there are reasons besides pubUc emergencies which occasionaUy actuate Ministers of the Crown. Without referring to the constitution of Parliament and the mode in which Ministerial majorities are obtained, it is very natural that a Minister of the Crown, particularly if he is not very strongly impressed with reverence for the rights of property, should desire to make his own path smooth and his own term of office peaceful, by feeding the wUd beast he is not allowed to tame. . . You might as weU expect to satisfy a wild beast, when he is pursuing you, by casting him a portion of your hand to induce him to forego any further enterprise upon your body, as to hope to calm this socialistic, anti-rent, not to say reaUy rebellious agitation, by passing this biU. I decline, in deciding how I shall give my vote, to ask with the noble Earl (Derby) what wiU be thought of the action of the House of Lords out of doors. We have a higher responsibility. I do not believe that the reputation, the character, or the influence of any man or body of men is to be preserved by perpetually thinking of what may be thought of their conduct out of doors. The motto of the House of Lords is ' Be just and fear not ; '"], [443, "THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. 423 but be sure that if you fear you will not long be just. The landlords of Ireland may be a small class comparatively; but, after aU, they are a class many of whom assumed their present responsibilities and incurred the dangers which they are running at the hands of a Liberal Government, because they trusted to the word of Parliament, and invested their money in Irish land on what they caUed Parliamentary security. To these men you are bound in honour. If you do not defend the landlords, depend upon it nobody else will, Do that \u2014 do what is just and right to all classes \u2014 and you may safely leave your authority, your influence, and your mediatorial power to the good sense and consideration of your countrymen.\" Function of the House of Lords. \u2014 At the inauguration of a Conservative Club at Hackney, in November, 1880, the Marquis of Salisbury, in responding to the toast of the House of Lords, said : \" There are persons among us who maintain that it is the duty of the House of Lords to act as the pale shadow of the House of Commons, and to repeat in a feeble echo aU that that House may decide to pass. I believe that under any circumstances such a doctrine cannot be sustained. Even if the alternative were, in a day which is far from us, the abolition of the House of Lords, I should still say it was better for the House of Lords to speak out its independent mind before the community, than to deceive it with the false pretence of a security that does not exist. Do not understand me to be maintaining that it is the function of the House of Lords to maintain opinions different from the mature conviction of the nation at large. Such is the constitution of our English society that 6uch a condition of things would not only be unseemly, it would be impossible. The House of Lords will necessarily represent the durable and continued current of feeling and opinion in this country; but, if I were to try to define in a sentence the function of the House of Lords, I should say its duty was to represent the permanent as opposed to the passing feelings of the English nation.\" \" Land Hunger.\" \u2014 Speaking at a dinner of the Merchant Taylors' Company, May 19, 1881, Lord Salisbury thus commented on this phrase, which had recently been used with regard to the peasantiy of Ireland : \" This year will be long remembered in Constitutional history as tho year in which the argument of 'land hunger' was invented. It has been discovered that when a people hunger for land, that they are to have, I will not say all they ask for, but a considerable proportion of it, without compensation for the rights of those who happen to be in possession of tho land already. We have heard that, when land hunger was in question, political economy was a science only fit for the inhabitants of Jupiter and Saturn. Land hunger again, we are told, where it exists, produces this curious rosult \u2014 that whatever increase of value the land obtains in eon sequence of the excess of the demand over the supply, belongs, not, as ordinary people might think, to the owner, but to the yearly tenant who happens to be occupying it at the time. That is a vory interesting opinion for the inhabitants of the City of London. I think there is no doubt that there is scarcely a place in the world where land hunger"], [444, "424 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT . prevails to such a frightful extent as in the City of London. I am told the land hunger is so great as to be measured by the prico of \u00a350,000 per acre. (A Voice : ' A miUion in some places.') Well, that makes my argument all the more forcible, and therefore I think the citizens of London should have their attention invited to this new doctrine of land hunger ; for, depend upon it, it wiU play a very great part in the future. I cannot, indeed, help thinking that if this honour is paid to it, other kinds of hunger will come into fashion, and I do not see why we should not have 'house hunger,' 'Consols hunger,' and even 'sUver plate hunger.' I am afflicted even now with a very considerable amount of place hunger (laughter), and I do not know how far the same maxims are to be applied to these kinds of hunger.\" \" Legislation by Inadvertence.\" \u2014 On the second reading of the Irish Land Bill in the House of Lords, in August, 1881, the Marquis of Salisbury said : \" We are told that the Irish tenant has acquired a new property \u2014 a tenant right of land. And how do you think he has acquired it ? He did not buy it ; he did not earn it ; but he got it because at a certain moment Mr. Gladstone in the House of Commons went to sleep. (Laughter.) We have this strango statement attributed to the Prime Minister: 'It was not perceived by any one during the passage of the Act of 1870 that tho foundation of tenant-right was being laid. The House was not fully conscious of the result of what it was doing. The object was to fine the landlord for ejecting the tenant ; but the case was now very different. They had now formed a real tenant-right, and given tho tenant a power to sell that right.' Of aU the extraordinary forms of legislation of which I have heard, the form of legislation by inadvertence is at once the strangest and the most alarming. At all events, if it is reaUy the case that the property of the landlord has been given to the tenant because, in one unhappy moment, Mr. Gladstone was inadvertent, let us take care that no such accident occurs again.\" An Unpleasant Reminder. \u2014 In a discussion in the House of Lords on the subject of Jewish persecutions in Russia, Feb. 9, 1882, Earl Gran ville had said : \" During my first short tenure of the Foreign Office, I took the unusual and discourteous step of returning unanswered two notes as to our harbouring rebels, which Prince Schwarzenberg had trans mitted to her Majesty's Government. We cannot apply one rule to ourselves and another to foreign countries.\" On this the Marquis of Salisbury, in the course of his reply, remarked : \" I wish the noble earl had abstained from advertising what he is pleased to call his own dis courtesy to the Government of Austria ; for that is a matter in which the reputation of her Majesty's Government does not require to be heightened.\" (Laughter.)* Earl GranviUe presently explained : \"My feel ings towards Austria are of the most friendly and cordial character. I want to point out that the fact which I mentioned is not of recent occurrence, but is matter of history, having happened thirty years ago.\" * An allusion to Mr. Gladstone's remarks on Austria in his Midlothian speeches, and the explanation asked for by that Power on his return to office."], [445, "THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. 425 The Marquis of Salisbury : \" I did not hint that the noble earl had any hostUity to Austria, but that the Government to which he belongs had a reputation in that respect, and that his words might tend to heighten it.\" (Laughter.) \"A Great Calm.\" \u2014 At a meeting of the Working Men's Conser vative Association at Liverpool, in April, 1882, in response to a resolution welcoming the Marquis of Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote, the former delivered an address, in the course of which he said : \" It is a very convenient thing to say that anybody who stands up for the honour of England, or desires to maintain her position amongst nations, wishes to maintain a state of quarrel and to banish the blessing of peace from the world, or is indifferent to the horrors of war. But I maintain that the whole course of history and of our own recent experience shows the contrary, and that those are the truest apostles of peace, and have the most genuine sense of the horrors of war, who allow other countries thoroughly to understand that, while we deeply and earnestly value peace and goodwill amongst nations, we do not think that that end is to be attained by aUowing our interests to be disregarded or onr honour to be contemned. Mr. Bright recently told you that the great honour of the present Government was that there was a great calm. Well, any ship that chooses to run out of its appointed course, and out of the passage which it is its duty to perform, into the nearest harbour, can find the blessings of a great calm. The question is whether that calm has been honourably earned.\" The Germ Theory in Politics. \u2014 On the last stage of the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) BiU, in 1882, the Marquis of Salisbury introduced this expression. He remarked : \" It has been said that this is an exceptional, that this is a final measure, and that we shall hear no more of it. WeU, we heard that last year, and we know how marvellously the germ theory has infected politics in recent years. We know that measures which are pressed upon us one year as final, are pressed upon us the next as containing the germ of further legislation in the same direction.\" A Parliamentary \" Goose-step.\" \u2014 Late in the session of 1883, a Pawnbrokers' Bill was before the House of Lords, but without apparent probability that it would receive attention when passed to the House of Commons. On a question that the report of amendments be received, the Marquis of Salisbury said that, as an announcement had been made in another place of a general massacre of bills, some of them of great importance, he wished to ask whether there was the slightest chance of the present measure being passed this j ear. If there was no likelihood of the bill passing, was there any use in making their lordships go through this Parliamentary goose-step ? The Lord Chancellor replied that, if it were to be taken for granted that bills introduced into their House could not pass in another place, their lordships would be discouraged from passing any bills at all. \" Legislation by Picnic.\"\u2014 In addressing a Conservative moeting at Sheffield on the day following the Franchise \"demonstration\" iu London in July, 1884, the Marquis of Salisbury remarked respecting the"], [446, "426 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Government : \" They dare not ask for the verdict of public opinion where alone that verdict can be legitimately given, but they set up all sorts of shams and counterfeits. They descend into the streets. They caU for processions. They imagine that 30,000 Radicals going to amuse themselves in London on a given day, express the public opinion of the country. That is not the way in which a progressive, cultured, and civilised State determines the opinions of its citizens. Nothing could have been more good-humoured, as yet, than the multitudes of their own partisans whom they have summoned into the streets to keep them in countenance. But the appeal to the streets, the attempt at legislation by picnic, has its dangerous side as well. There is no more hopeless condition in which a popularly governed State can be plunged, than when its policy is decided by demonstrations held in the streets of the metropolis.\" The \" Pilot Balloon.\" \u2014 Lord Salisbury observed, in the debate in tho House of Lords on the Address at the opening of Parliament, January 21, 1886 : \" I believe that the worst symptoms which Ireland now shows are due to the declarations in favour of Home Rule which we believe to have been made by leading statesmen in this country. I say that those declarations have enormously added to our difficulties, and increased the belief in the minds of certain men that they were going to win, and their resolution to adopt every means and to run every risk for the purpose of coercing the opinions of their feUow-coimtrymen.\" \u2014 Earl Granville (suavely) : \" May I ask what declarations of distinguished men the noble marquis refers to ? \" \u2014 The Marquis of Salisbury : \" The declara tions which appeared in the newspapers. They seemed to be authentic, and they were not distinctly contradicted. Don't tell me that when a man in the position of Mr. Gladstone has attributed to him opinions at variance with aU the opinions of his life, and fatal to the constitution of this country \u2014 do not teU me that he is at liberty to skulk behind ambiguous generalisation, and not to say boldly before the country whether the opinions that, apparently with authority, are attributed to him are really his or not. If it be true that he has carefvdly concealed what he reaUy thought, and allowed the Separatist party in Ireland to derive all the advantage they have derived from the opinions attributed to him, he is scarcely less guUty of the result than if those opinions had been actually his own. I heard the other day of the effect these opinions, which the noble lord affects to disbelieve in, have had in Ireland. A great town in the north of Ireland desired to borrow \u00a3100,000, and endeavoured to borrow it of some financial authorities in London. Then came what shall I call it ? \u2014 the kite that was flown, the pilot baUoon that was sent up* Immediately the negotiations were broken off, and the refusal to lend any money to this great town was prompt and decisive. Men saw in the supposed opinions of a man like Mr. Gladstone \u2014 who has played such a splendid and enormous part in the history of the last half century they saw in the opinions attributed to him dangers which would make the. * A communication supposed to have been made by or through Mr. Herbert Gladstone to one of the Press agencies."], [447, "THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. 427 investment of capital in Ireland insecure, and which business men, at all events, whether statesmanship did so or not, concluded were a sufficient ground for acting as if the opinions attributed to him were really his.\" \u2014 It was only a few weeks after this, on the supercession of the Salisbury Government, that the country was astonished by the production of Mr. Gladstone's Irish Bills. Earl Granville's interrogatory may be particularly noted. \" Loopholes.\" \u2014 Lord Salisbury, at the annual dinner of the \" Consti tutional Union of Great Britain and Ireland \" in St. James's Hall, June 29, 1886, said : \" There is one kind of industry to which Mr. Gladstone has devoted himself without flagging for fifty years, and in which he has acquired an unsurpassed perfection, and that is the manufacture of loop holes. I have admired his skiU again and again. I have heard, perhaps, or read, as I thought, some statement which seemed to me a plump adherence to some opinion or some intention ; and then, later on, I have gone back to see if I could verify the words, and, to my surprise, I have always discovered lurking, in some ambiguous phrase that I had not noticed at the time, the inevitable loophole through which he could escape.\" \" Bamboozle \" and \" Bamboo.\" \u2014 The Marquis of Salisbury, on being admitted to the honorary freedom of the Grocers' Company (May 29, 1886), made some observations on the absorbing topics of the day, and aUuded particularly to the Government of Ireland Bill, then before the House of Commons. Mentioning the name of WiUiam Pitt, he said : \" His name calls up pecidiar recoUections at this moment, because it is his great work which we are now, as a matter of Parliamentary exjiediency and man\u0153uvre, engaged in knocking to pieces. It is, at aU events, one satisfaction that a species of homage is being done to his memory, in a matter about which he has been much attacked. We are often told that he carried the Union by bribery. Well, I believe he did give a certain number of honours and titles to persons who supported him. Of course, in these days you know we are so pure, no such things are ever done. We know that reluctant votes are never bought by a party ; but for a long time bribery has been associated in legal contemplation with a sister whose name is intimidation, and if Mr. Pitt bribed, persons who wish to undo Mr. Pitt's work know at least how to intimidate ; and if it be true that the Union was in any sense carried by bribery, it will be much more true, if that Union is shattered, that its death will be due to unscrupulous intimi dation. There is a cynical philosopher \u2014 I think an American \u2014 who, looking out upon the systems of government in the world, summarised them shortly by saying that they might be classified either under the head of bamboozle or bamboo. Do not imagine for a moment I subscribe to that sentiment. I am quoting it for the purpose of showing the exceUence of the Government imder which we live, because we have been able to exhaust ' the resources of civiUsation,' * and have been able both to * A phrase used by Mr. Gladstone in the City of London, in reference to the Parnellite proceedings. He said that the leaders of sedition in Ireland would find that \" the resources of civiUsation are not yet exhausted.\""], [448, "428 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. bamboozle and bamboo in the attainment of the great object for which statesmen are striving now. (Cheers and laughter.) We see one body of men promoting a certain policy with the conviction that it will lead to separation, and another body promoting it on the assured ground that it is the only way by which separation can be prevented. Well, our opinions may be right or wrong, but it is quite certain that one party is being bamboozled.\" Metaphors.\u2014 Lord Salisbury dropped the following observations on the occasion of the presentation of an address from a large body of Irish Nonconformist Ministers, November 14, 1888 : \" You are told that what is in store for you is that Ireland shall govern herself \u2014 that she shall have self-government. Metaphors are admirable things. They adorn oratory. They often enable you to explain in a short compass. But metaphors may be pushed to excess, and when the idea of the action of a single voluntary being is extended to Ireland, divided as she is into parties separated by the widest chasm and the strongest differences, the metaphor has ceased to be useful and become delusive. It is absurd to talk of self-government when there is no self to govern. 1\u00a3 three people are sitting upon two people and rifling their pockets, you must not say that they are a group of five enjoying the blessings of self-government.\" Parliament Ineffective against Public Opinion. \u2014 At a dinner of the Association of Chambers of Commerce in March, 1891, speaking of the proposed regulation of labour by legislative enactment, Lord Salisbury said : \" Parliament uses such grand language in its enactments that it has got to believe that it is omnipotent ; but that is a very great mistake. Parliament is a very potent engine, and its enactments almost always do something, though they very seldom do what the originators of those enactments meant. The outcome \u2014 to use a technical phrase \u2014 is the resultant of a composition of two forces, and the two forces are the enacting force of Parliament and the evading force of the individual. I\u00a3 the enactment squares -with the public interest and is agreeable to the public conscience, it will be carried out; if it has been adopted as the result of agitation, or at the bidding of a class \u2014 if it overrides the rights of minorities and tramples on principles which the conscience of the nation approves \u2014 that Act of Parliament -will have no effect in obtaining the objects for which it was made, but it will have an effect in surrounding the industry which it touches with precautions and investigations, inspec tions and regulations, in which it wUl be slowly enveloped and stifled.\" A Tribute from Mr. Gladstone. \u2014 In the debate on the Address at the opening of Parliament in January, 1886, Mr. Gladstone said, with respect to foreign relations generally : \" I have not, of course, been minutely informed of the transactions of the Prime Minister and of the Government, but so far as I have been informed of them, and with regard to the principal outline of those transactions, so far as I have been able to understand them, I have pleasure in repeating here what I have more than once stated elsewhere \u2014 that the conduct of Lord Salisbury appears to me to have done him honour, and to be worthy of the name and the credit of this country.\""], [449, "EARL CAIRNS. 429 EARL CAIRNS. (1819\u20141885.) An Exceptional Compliment. \u2014 Hugh McCalmont Cairns was returned to the House of Commons for Belfast in 1852, and continued to represent that borough until 1866. In 1858 he was appointed Solicitor- General under Lord Derby's second Administration. His eloquence was marked at this time, and drew from the first Lord Lytton in his \" St. Stephen's \" a tribute of praise, exceptional in the case of a living orator : \u2014 \" Still when Cairns rises, tho' at dawn of day, The sleepers wake, and feel rejoiced to stay, As his clear reasonings in light strength arise, Like Doric shafts admitting lucent skies.\" Sir Hugh Cairns was made Attorney-General in 1866, when Lord Derby again formed a Government ; but shortly after, a Lord Justiceship of Appeal becoming vacant, he was promoted to the bench, and created a peer in 1867. In February, 1868, Lord Cairns became Lord High Chancellor in Mr. Disraeli's first Administration, and was reseated on the woolsack when the last-named statesman returned to power in 1874. He was raised a step in the peerage, as Earl Cairns, in 1878. He is remembered, among other things, as the introducer of the Settled Estates Act, 1882. The Law of Primogeniture. \u2014 An example of the clear statement of a case which distinguished the speaking of Sir Hugh Cairns in the House of Commons may be taken from the debate on Mr. Locke King's proposal, in 1859, to alter the law of succession to real estate in cases of intestacy. Sir Hugh Cairns, then Solicitor-General, opposed the honour- able member's bill, and in the course of his speech observed : \" Honourable members opposite said that the present law as to descent was a -wretched remnant of feudal policy ; that it had its origin in feudal times, and that before the feudal times it was unknown in this country. His answiv to that was, that he did not care what was its origin. . . Looking at it as a question of policy, what were the results which flowed from this law P In the first place, it harmonised with an hereditary monarchy and an hereditary peerage. In the next place, speaking of the principle of the law, not merely as it affected the disposition of the estates of intestates, but as manifested in the habits of the country with regard to entails and settlements, it tended to maintain a class in this country distinct from the aristocracy of mere wealth, and the aristocracy produced \u2014 and rightly produced \u2014 by successful commercial enterprise. The law and the custom together, acting one upon the other, kept a class distinct, in consequence of their connection with the land, from those other classes who were of course in themselves as important elements as the aristocracy of the country. In the next place, this law and custom were favourable to the agriculture of the country. The tendency of this country, with regard both to agriculture and manufactures, had been to undertake production on a large scale; and honourable members opposite would not disagree"], [450, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 430 with the doctrine of Mill, that wherever a people had once undertaken production on a large scale in agriculture, commerce, or manufactures, they would not wiUingly relinquish its advantages. Again, the law was most important in a social point of view. It kept families together by preserving the headship of families. The certain effect of a division of property such as that recommended was in the second generation to dwarf a f amUy down to the rank of petty squires, and in the next genera tion to dwarf it into the condition of mere peasants. In the next place, while it preserved to them their social station and position, the law excited younger brothers to ambition and emulation in a manner that no other system in any country was ever known to do before. And, lastly, the benefit of it did not flow merely to the children of a family, but it stimulated the parent of the family also to make provision, by frugality, economy, and industry, for his younger branches, at the same time that it gave him the certainty of the importance of the family being pre served by the headship of his eldest son. These, then, were the con clusions at which he had arrived.\" The speaker went on to support these conclusions by references to sundry authorities. \u2014 The bill was defeated, on a division, by 271 to 76. The \" Tender Passion \" in Reform. \u2014 In March, 1859, the Government of the Earl of Derby introduced into the House of Commons a Reform Bill, the second reading of which was opposed by Lord John RusseU with an amendment, avowedly intended to lead to the rejection of the measure. At the close of his speech moving- this amendment, he remarked : \" I shall take this course, careless of any imputation which may be cast upon me. With regard to this great question of Reform, I may conclude by saying that I defended it when I was young, and I wiU not desert it now that I am old.\" Sir Hugh Cairns, in reply, said : \" The noble lord appeals as a proof of his sincerity in his amend ment to his long-known and long-tried attachment to the cause of Reform. We all know and admit the noble lord's attachment to this great national and political question. But we also know that there is a form of the tender passion which sometimes developes itself in jealousy of any atten tion to the object of its affection from any other quarter. . . I am sure the country will ask \u2014 the country have asked already \u2014 what are the real intentions of the noble lord, and what are the specific objects which he proposes to himself in meeting a biU of this kind, not openly, not broadly, but by an ambiguous and almost irregular amendment, which commits nobody and which means nothing that is precise. The people of this country have differed, and always wUl differ, about Reform Bills, about theories of representation, about social and domestic legislation of every kind. But there is one subject upon which the people of this country are entirely agreed. They do not like anything which bears the least appearance of approaching to artifice, or \u2014 I must use a homely phrase \u2014 a dodge. They do not like it in business, they do not like it in politics ; but least of aU wiU they admire it in a man who, at a time when the best interests of our country at home and our most peaceful hopes abroad demand aU the patriotism, aU the candour, and aU the forbearance of a"], [451, "EARL CAIRNS. 431 statesman, approaches the consideration of a great national question like this, not fairly to criticise, not boldly to reject, but to contrive a crafty aud catching device, to confuse and, if it may be, to dislocate parties, and in that confusion and dislocation to secure his own political aggrandisement and private advantage.\" After a debate adjourned over several nights, the amendment was carried by 330 to 291. The Government appealed to the country ; but, on the assembling of the new Parliament, an amendment to the Address, declaring want of confidence in the Ministry, was moved by the Marquis of Harrington, and carried by a majority of 13 in a house of 637. Minority Representation. \u2014 In the passage of the Reform Bill of 1867 through the House of Lords, the proposition for the representation of minorities was introduced on the motion of Lord Cairns, and eventuaUy carried in the Commons by 253 to 204. During the discussions in the Upper House on this measure, Lord Cairns addressed their lordships as many as twenty-four times on the various clauses. The Amendment to the Franchise Bill. \u2014 The opposition in the House of Lords to the second reading of the Bill of 1884 (see p. 64) was led by Earl Cairns, who brought forward a resolution objecting to it on the ground that the bill would make \" a fundamental change in the constitution of the electoral body, while not apportioning the right to return members so as to insure a true and fair representation of the people.\" In the course of his speech he argued that, in passing the Franchise Bill unac companied by a Redistribution Bill, there would be the danger of a general election with the old distribution and the new constituencies. \" You would then,\" he said, \"get a Convention Parliament elected by bodies intended to be mere temporary depositaries of power. Suppose that when that House of Commons assembled they were to say, ' W\u00ab are bound by no pledge ; we will undertake no redistribution ; we are quite satisfied with things as they are, and will let them remain as they are.'

It is this danger \u2014 I call it a grave and serious danger \u2014 that I ask your lordships to guard against. It is idle to say that we oppose ourselves to any wish of the country in this matter. We appeal to the country ; we desire to be judged by the country. It is a calumny to say that we set ourselves against the country or against a measure of reform. We desire that that which has been done on all former occasions of a reform of the constitution should be done now, and that a peril and danger of that character, to which a ' leap in the dark ' would be as nothing, should, if possible, be averted.\" In the division there appeared \u2014 For the second reading, 146 ; for Earl Cairns' amendment, 205 ; majority, 59.

Ministers and the Transvaal. \u2014 Lord Caims's speech on the conduct of the Government with respect to the affairs of the Transvaal, in 1881, made a great impression on the House, although no division was taken. The following were his concluding words : \" I wish that, whUe"], [452, "432 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. still the Transvaal remains, as you say it does, under onr control, the British flag had not been first reversed and then trailed in insult through the mud.

It has already touched, and wiU every day touch more deeply, the heart of the nation. Other reverses we have had, other disasters ; but a reverse is not dishonour, and a disaster does not necessarUy imply disgrace. To her Majesty's Government we owe a sensation which to this country of ours is new, and which certainly is not agreeable. ' In all the ills we ever bore, We grieved, we sighed, we wept ; \u2014 we never blushed before.' \" * THE EARL OF SELBORNE. (1812.) Lord Chancellorship Deferred. \u2014 Mr. Rounded Palmer (in later years Lord Selbome) was first returned to Parliament in 1847, for Plymouth, but afterwardy represented Richmond (Yorkshire). He was Solicitor-General in the Administration of Lord Palmerston in 1861, and Attorney-General in 1863. When Mr. Gladstone took office in 1868, to carry out the disestablishment of the Irish Church, it was understood that Sir Roundell Palmer would have been offered the Lord ChanceUorship, but for his known disapproval of the measures of disendowment which were also contemplated. In 1872 he was chosen to lay before the inter national tribunal at Geneva the case for Great Britain in the Alabama dispute ; and a few months later, Lord Hatherley resigning the great seal, Sir Roundell Palmer was made Lord ChanceUor. He returned to the woolsack on the reconstruction of Mr. Gladstone's Government in 1880, but declined to hold office on the formation of the Liberal Ministry of 1886. A Mild Rebuke. \u2014 On the abolition of the purchase system by royal warrant in 1871 (see page 363), the views of Sir R. Palmer, privately expressed, were commented upon in the House of Commons, in opposition to the course taken by the Government. Sir RoundeU thereupon wrote as foUows to Mr. Cardwell, the Secretary for War : \" I have always thought and said that the issuing of such a warrant was within the undoubted power of the Crown ; though to do so without having a sufficient assurance that Parliament would provide the necessary compensation for the officers who would otherwise suffer by such an exercise of royal power, would not be just, and therefore would not be consistent with the spirit of the Constitution, which vests aU such powers in the Crown, in the confidence * This quotation had, to use Mr. Disraeli's expression, \" previously received the meed of Parliamentary approbation,\" having been used with great effect under the circumstances recorded on p. 259."], [453, "THE EARL OF SELBORNE. 433 and for the purpose, that right, not wrong, shaU be done. I should have been glad if it had been generaUy and clearly understood from the beginning that, subject to the sense of Parliament being ascertained with reference to the point of compensation, the form of procedure would be that which was eventually adopted; because it is certainly an evil that the adoption of one constitutional mode of procedure, rather than another, should appear to arise from an adverse vote of the House of Lords.\" Appeals against Parliament. \u2014 In the debate on the second reading of the Irish Land BiU in the House of Lords, AprU 22, 1887, Lord Selborne referred to the Crimes BiU, which was being proceeded with concurrently in the House of Commons, and said : \" Is it or is it not part of the general political situation, that the measure which the Govern ment has introduced for the protection of liberty, and for the repression of crime and conspiracy, is being opposed with extreme energy all over the country by those who were lately responsible for the government of the country ? Is there or is there not at the present moment an aUiance offensive and defensive between those who lately had the government in their hands, and the same men who, a few short years ago, were denounced as ' marching through rapine to the disintegration of the empire ? ' And are they not ' marching through rapine to the disintegration of the empire ' as much now as then ? and is not the rapine as great now as it was then ? . . That is the situation with which you have to deal ; and people are going all over the country, and the late Prime Minister is calling spirits from the vasty deep \u2014 it does not seem to matter what sort of spirits they are. In words formerly quoted by Burke : ' Black spirits and white, red spirits and grey, Mingle, mingle, mingle, you that mingle may.' It was only yesterday that I read one of those letters which the late Prime Minister is scattering daily like snowflakes over the United Kingdom and the United States, in which he said that, to defeat this bill \u2014 introduced to put down crime and conspiracies for crime, and to enable government to be carried on in Ireland \u2014 those for whom he spoke were prepared to risk aU the political consequences. What is it that is being done ? An appeal is being made against Parliament, against the Legislature, against the very decided majority in the House of Commons recently returned \u2014 some thing is to be done out of doors which is to produce some political conse quences, for the purpose of overawing and intimidating the Legislature, and preventing them from passing measures for the restoration of order and the repression of crime. That does seem to be a state of things present on this occasion, and necessary to be borne in mind.\" Law and Liberty.\u2014 On the third reading of the Criminal Law Amendment (Ireland) Bill, July 18, 1887, Lord Selborne spoke as follows : \"In my opinion \u2014 it may be an old-fashioned one \u2014 both public and private liberty in Ireland depend upon the authority of the courts of justice, and upon the maintenance of the supremacy of the law. I there fore look upon this measure, which has for its object the maintenance of f F"], [454, "434 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the supremacy of the law in that country, as one rendered necessary by the circumstances of the country.\" Referring to the operation of the \" National League,\" he said : \" The attempt to substitute a different sort of law is not all. Yon have the Plan of Campaign, which deals with the rights of landlords and tenants, and uses influence of every sort which can be brought to bear upon tenants to pay no rents, or only such as the League thinks right \u2014 overruling the laws of the land, and making war upon private rights, and that whether people are willing to pay or not ; and, after preventing payment where the people are willing to pay, taking the money from the tenants, not to take care of it for them, not to keep it in reserve to pay the landlord, but to use it for their own purposes, and undertaking to hold the tenants harmless as well as they can. My lords, that is a vehmgericht. Are we to allow such a state of things to go on, without inquiring whether the law can be made stronger ? \" He passed on to refer to his old coUeague and associate, the Prime Minister in whose Ministry he had been twice Lord Chancellor, and concluded his speech bv saving : \" My lords, it is a subject of regret to me that I am com pelled to differ from so many of my noble friends, but most of aU do I regret to differ from the great man to whose service I have devoted much of the best years of my life. My separation from him will be a bitter thing to me to the end of my days ; but before aU regard for persons, before all regard for friends, before all regard for self, must be the regard I have for law and justice, for public liberty and public honour.\" \"Her Majesty's Ministers.\" \u2014 At a Trinity House banquet in 1880, this toast was prcmosed by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, and coupled, in very complimentary terms, with the name of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Selborne. Responding to this, he said : \" Whatever differences may prevail in the stormy atmosphere of the House of Commons or in the serener atmosphere of the House of Lords \u2014 whatever varieties of opinion may exist among the leading minds of the country as to questions of policy, every Ministry, during the time while it is in office, has entrusted to its care the great, the constant, and the permanent interests of the nation, and all right-minded men must desire, so far as those interests are concerned, to strengthen the hands of the depositaries of so great a trust. I do not think the permanent character of those duties can be better symbolised than by the three departments of the Government which are especially represented here to-day. I speak of the law, represented by the Chief Justice of England, and of the two great forces, military and naval, on which the peace of the country and the maintenance of the national power depends. These are permanent, immutable interests ; and amidst all our differences, and notwithstanding all the occasional heat of our discussions, I hope it will be believed of us aU, as I shall always be ready to believe of others with whom I do not politically agree when they are charged with the same duties, that it will be our endeavour, loyally and patriotically, so to perform them that these great interests of the commonwealth may suffer no detriment at our hands.\""], [455, "THE EARL OF IDDESLEIGH. 435 EARL OF IDDESLEIGH (SIR S. NORTHCOTE). (1818\u20141887.) \" My Right Honourable Friend.\"\u2014 Sir Stafford Northcote was a descendant of the Sir John Northcote whose \" Note-book \" respecting the Long Parliament is occasionaUy referred to in these pages. His first experiences of pubUc life were gained as private secretary to Mr. Glad stone, when that Minister was President of the Board of Trade in Sir Robert Peel's Government (1843 \u2014 1845). Mr. Gladstone generously referred to the fact, after Lord Iddesleigh's death, by remarking, \" In 1843 I had the honour \u2014 and it was a great honour \u2014 of introducing him into public life, and I had the advantage of profiting largely by his personal services and aid.\" To this early connection was owing the terms of mutual courtesy in which Mr. Gladstone and Sir Stafford in later years, although leading opposite parties in the House of Commons, and alternately ChanceUors of the Exchequer, constantly referred to each other as \" my right honourable friend.\" Sir Stafford entered the House as member for Dudley in 1855, but represented North Devon from 1861. Under the Administrations of the Earl of Derby aud Mr. Disraeli, he .successively held the offices of Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Presi dent of the Board of Trade, Secretary for India, and ChanceUor of the Exchequer. In 1871 he was appointed by Mr. Gladstone's Government one of the special commissioners to the United States, to arrange the Alabama treaty. On the formation of a Ministry by the Marquis of Salisbury in 1885, Sir Stafford was appointed First Lord of the Treasury, and at the same time received from his Sovereign the honour, unusual under the circumstances, of an earldom. The Confidence of the House. \u2014 The foUowing is a picture of Sir Stafford Northcote, by the author of \"Men and Manners in Parlia ment \" (1874) : \" There is a wonderfuUy wise and statesinauUke air about Sir Stafford Northcote as he sits, spectacled and bearded, on the Treasury bench, which of itself would go a long way towards acquiring the con fidence and the submission of the House. But the right honourable baronet is not dependent on his personal aspect alone for his claim to supremacy. He is not a good speaker, but he is a ready one, sees a long way through a question, and can, if need be, cleverly fence with it. He has a good deal of tact, is fair-minded, honourable, frank, and at very long intervals displays little flashes of humorous perception which are as precious as solitary stars twinkling in an apparently hopelessly murky sky. He is always listened to with that respect the House of Commons intuitively feels and liberally awards to any man who has succeeded in convincing it that he is an honest and clear thinker, and thus he per sonaUy enjoys the confidence of both sides of the House.\" A corroboration of this remark occurred soon after the meeting of the new Parliament in 1880. A temporary difficulty having arisen, aud the leaders of Mr. Glad stone's new Government being absent, a member suggested the guidance of \" the right honourable member for North Devon, in whom we aU have confidence,\" and the remark was received with general cheers. F F 2"], [456, "436 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. A Favourite Strain. \u2014 The Rev. T. Mozley, writing in his \" Reminiscences \" of a diocesan conference in Devonshire about 1868, says : \" Karslake had had his second turn of speaking, and had touched the old chord, that there was much to be said on both sides. Sir Stafford Northcote was there. He afterwards confessed to have been very much bored by the discussion. Speaking and hearing speeches, he said, alwa3*s did bore him. . . But, while not quite up to the mark, he had been basking under the mild wisdom of his native county, listening to the dear old strain, that there is much to be said on both sides. It seemed to take possession of his whole nature.\" Mr. Disraeli's Right Hand. \u2014 Mr. Disraeli thus wrote to his Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1875 : \" You are, and ever have been, my right hand, my most trusty counseUor ; and I look to your filling a higher post than that which you admirably discharge.\" Parliamentary Obstruction. \u2014 In a speech at Exeter in September, 1879, Sir Stafford Northcote (then leader of the House of Commons) com mented as follows on this subject : \" I trust that Parliament, stiU more the country, wiU assist us in setting our face against any conduct calcu lated to bring party government into disrepute, or to interfere with tho proper conduct of business. But do not be led away altogether by what yon hear ; do not suppose that obstruction comes from only a few Irish members ; the difficulty is far deeper than that. There are men who sit for important English constituencies who secretly, and sometimes more than secretly, favour obstruction which bears the name of certain Irish members. . . Remember what are the difficulties if you were to deal with the obstruction by altering regulations and making new rules. You do one of two things which you do not wish to do ; you either give a great triumph to Irish members, and that is exactly what you do not want to do, or in some future time you deprive yourselves of that valuable protection which minorities ought to have against the encroach ments of majorities. Do not let us, in order to get rid of a temporary evU, sacrifice an important permanent interest. What we want is a resolute determination on the part of the great bulk of the House that they will stand no more obstruction. If there is that feeUng absent on the part of any considerable number of the members of the House, then we want the feeling to be manifested by the constituencies of the country, by their demanding that their representative shall take a firm stand against that which may otherwise be the ruin of Parliamentary government. But I do not think there is any danger of the House of Commons or of Parliament losing its character. I myself believe that these are but temporary difficulties, which wiU pass away as other temporary difficulties have passed away.\" \u2014 The Marquis of Harrington shortly after this com plained that Sir Stafford Northcote had treated the matter as one of trivial importance. \"Parliamentary obstruction,\" he observed, \"will be dealt with and put down by a Government which presents to Parliament well-considered measures in which it takes an interest itself, and in which the country takes an interest; and when at the same time it manifests determination to set aside any business, however"], [457, "THE EARL OF IDDESLEIGH. 437 important, however much desired by Parliament and by the country, for the first and paramount object of assuring its own independence and authority.\" The Great Oyster Question. \u2014 Speaking at the Free Trade HaU, Manchester, in June, 1881, Sir Stafford Northcote gave the foUowing illustration of one way in which the time of the House of Commons was consumed : \" Every member in the House of Commons now desires to distinguish himself in some way or other. He has not the opportunity of making long speeches, because there is very little time given for speeches in debate, and therefore the only way in which a great many men can bring themselves into notoriety is to put questions, and, if they do not get satisfactory answers, to move the adjournment of the House, and get up a debate. That suits extremely well the tastes of a great many gentlemen, and they come in and ask questions suggested by some accident. A man goes to his club and asks for oysters ; he does not get them, and is told they are scarce. He immediately goes to the House and puts a question to the Home Secretary. He wants to know why oysters are scarce. Well, we have a very eloquent Home Secretary (Sir WilUam Harconrt), but his colleagues do not encourage his speeches now he is in office, and his only opportunity is when answering questions, so that the best way of indulging his own very powerful fund of humonr is in answering questions ; and the probability is that when a man gets up to ask why oysters are scarce, the Home Secretary gives him an answer carefully written out over five or six pages of notepaper, and which occupies six or seven minutes in delivery. But the man is not satisfied with that ; ho returns to the attack, because he has now got connected with the oyster question. He immediately receives letters from all parts of the country, and suggestions as to remedies, and so he moves for returns, for he wants to know how mauy oysters are consumed. This is the sort of way \u2014 in many cases at least \u2014 that a very considerable portion of tho public timo is wasted. But this gentleman's coUeague, or perhaps his rival in another part of tho empire, sees that his rival is e-ettinn- into notoriety, so he must speak of something else ; and in that way, instead of having, as I remember, some dozen or not twenty questions, we now find fifty, sixty, or seventy put in a night, and a debate got up on many of them.\" Hits at Mr. Gladstone. \u2014 In the House of Commons in June, 1882, questions being asked respecting our relations with Egypt, and the Suez Canal, Mr. Gladstone made some remarks which were thus commented upon by Sir Stafford Northcote : \" It is something to have drawn from the Primo Minister the modified expression which he has used with regard to his change of opinion as to the Suez Canal. I have no doubt that the words he used on former occasions can be more or less explained to mean that there has been no change. But undoubtedly, during the discussion which took place at the time of tho late Government being in office, the opinions of tho Prime Minister were generally felt to be that we were overrating altogether the importance of the Caual, and that we might look to some other means of access to India, I am happy to think that tluit"], [458, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 438 has now been disclaimed. (Opposition cheers, and \"No\" from Mr. Glad stone.) Of course, I understand that, as the sense of mankind is one way, and the sense of the right honourable gentleman is the other, it is mankind that is in the wrong.\" (Cheers and laughter.) Another similar passage occurred in a speech delivered by Lord Iddesleigh at Aberdeen in September, 1885, shortly after the publication by Mr. Gladstone of an address to his constituents. He said : \" AU through that address of Mr. Gladstone, one is reminded of the story of the old lawyer who wrote an extremely difficult hand. When he gave his opinion, he wrote in one of three different styles \u2014 one in a hand that both he and his clerk could understand and read ; one that he could read and his clerk could not read ; and one that neither the one nor the other could read. There is a good deal in the address which I defy either Mr. Gladstone or his friends to read, let alone the outside public.\" \" Shooting off \" Colleagues. \u2014 Addressing a meeting at St. Andrew's^ Hall, Glasgow (October 4, 1882), Sir Stafford made the foUowing observa tions : \" Time was, and still is with certain classes, that they have such implicit confidence in the Prime Minister that they really think it would be impertinent to ask what his opinions are. But when they see him driving his chariot with the great rapidity that he has lately been doing, and turn corners with such velocity that he shoots off an important coUeague* every now and then from a sort of outside car\u2014 (cheers) \u2014 there arises a little question, whether it is right and wise to put such implicit faith in his authority. I remember a very excellent definition of authority in a very able book, written by a respected member of the Liberal party,. Sir George Cornewall Lewis, in which he said, 'Authority is that influence which induces men to accept opinions without understanding the proof.' Well, that is a very good definition, and no doubt in many cases men are wise in accepting, without too much inquiry, the authority in which they think they have reason to believe. But we must remember that Mr. Gladstone, with all his great abilities, which nobody acknowledges and recognises more than I do \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 with all his great power of expres sion and of eloquence, and with all the remarkable character that he possesses, has one very fatal habit, and has had it all through his life \u2014 that of putting himself in untenable positions, and having to retire from them. You know that is very bad as regards the individual himself ; it is worse when he puts the coimtry into an untenable position \u2014 and therefore, I say, we who represent the Opposition are especially bound, if we are to be of any good at all, to cross-examine and question all these matters, in order to see that the same thing is not taking place now.\" Fine Phrases. \u2014 In bringing forward a vote of censure on the con duct of the Government in relation to Egypt and the Soudan (February 23, 1885), Sir Stafford Northcote said : \" What did we hear about ' Rescue and retire,' f and other phrases which were such salve to the consciences of the * In allusion to the defection from Mr. Gladstone's Ministry, formed in 1880, of the Duke of Argyll, Mr. Bright, and Mr. Forster. f This was first used by Sir Wilfrid Lawson in the session of 1884."], [459, "THE EARL OF IDDESLEIGH. 439 supporters of the Government who did not like the war ? The fact is, we have been too much the slaves of phrases in this matter. We have a Minister who is a great master of them, and makes them sometimes for himself and sometimes for other people ; but a master of phrases is very apt to become a servant and a slave of them. This is the case in regard to ' Rescue and retire.' General Gordon was, in the first instance, employed by the Government on very short notice, at a very critical period, to ' go and report ' as to the best way of withdrawing the garrisons from the Soudan. That phrase of ' going to report ' is a very convenient phrase for the Government when there is anything to be done, and it is a question whether they should or should not undertake it. . . I want the Government to get out of the habit of putting matters off by fine phrases, and to tell us, in such a way as can bo understood by all the world, what they really mean to do.\" A Defence of the \"Stop-gap \" Ministry, \u2014 Lord Iddesleigh, in a speech at Aberdeen in September, 1885, took up this expression, which had been applied to the Ministry formed after the defeat of Mr. Glad stone's Government in the preceding June. He said : \" A more curious phenomenon than the break up of the late Administration I do not know that I have ever witnessed. There is a certain analogy between it and the action of Mr. Gladstone eleven years ago, when in 1874 he by a sudden movement dissolved Parliament. Nobody was quite sure whether that was a measure forced on him by circumstances, or whether it was a clever little bit of tactics. I believe it was meant to be tho latter ; but it was one of those clever little bits that are popularly described as being ' too clever by half,' and the result of it was that, as you know, the response of the coimtry to Mr. Gladstone was to shut the door quietly in his face. Now, with regard to this recent change, what has that been ? Was that a matter of necessity, or was that also a clever little bit of tactics ? There were many Liberals at the time of the resignation of the Government who said, ' It will bring the country to their senses ; it will show that no Conservatives will venture to take or be able to retain office for a single week or a single month.' We had all sorts of names given to us. We were called the ' stop-gap Government ; ' we were caUed tho ' Government of caretakers ; ' and some other little expressions were used, which I suppose were not intended as altogether complimentary. But I am not at all sure that they were not in deed and in truth very complimentary. If we are a stop-gap, who has made the gap ? If we are caretakers, who has given occasion for the appointment of caretakers P Who but they, who had been returned some five or six years ago with a great flourish of trumpets, at the head of a majority not far short of a hundred against all parts of the House ? Who but they who had been supported by their followers so long; who but they who vacated the trust committed to them ; who but they made it necessary that wo shoidd have that which I admit to be an inconvenient arrangement\u2014 a Government that could be called a ' Government of caretakers ? ' I have no doubt that many of you have read enough of ancient history to remember that when, in the State of Rome, a time of difficulty and perplexity arose, it was not uncommon tl at"], [460, "440 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the people and Senate passed a resolution calling upon the Consuls to take care that the public suffered no injury. Such a mission was felt to have heen given to ourselves ; and, so far as it was in our power \u2014 though we were conscious we had not the command of a majority of the House of Commons \u2014 so far as it was in our power, we have endeavoured to discharge that trust.\" A Recognition. \u2014 In the spring of 1886, the Earl of Iddesleigh was presented, at Willis's Rooms, with a service of plate, subscribed for as a token of esteem by members of both the great political parties. Although individual subscriptions were limited in amount, over \u00a312,000 was raised. The plate was adorned with emblematic and other figures, among the latter being medallion portraits of Lord Iddesleigh himself, as well as Lords Palmerston, Derby, Beaconsfield, Salisbury, and Mr. Gladstone \u2014 all leaders with whom Lord Iddesleigh had worked at different times. Lord Chancellor Herschell, in the course of the proceedings, referred to the fact that he had been, and was then, a member of the opposite side ; but he expressed the regard and esteem of aU parties for one who had been an ornament of the House of Commons for thirty years. Party and Patriotism. \u2014 Sir S. Northcote, in a speech to some of his constituents in October, 1880, said : \" He supposed there was a general feeling that the two leading parties in the State were always so violently opposed to one another, that their whole hearts and souls were devoted to the work of trying to counteract each other, to get their opponents out of office, and to take their places. That was not a truly English sentiment. Beyond doubt, persons worthy the name of Englishmen, who belonged to any particidar party, would show in the time of conflict the same spirit that animated the British soldier, who would never show that he was beaten, but who, if he had the worst of a conflict, determined to work back, again and again, until he got the best of those to whom he was opposed. So any party, and certainly the party to which he belonged, would, when out of office, determine to convert their minority into a majority \u2014 never to lose heart, but to work with the determination of winning their way back to the confidence of the country. But there was something else upon which he hoped they were all still more determined : he hoped they all took to themselves the lesson in the well-known case of the Judgment of Solomon, where the true mother preferred that the child should be taken from her, rather than that any harm should happen to it for the sake of injuring her rival. What they desired was not so much that they should get to the head of affairs again, as that the true interests of the country should be regarded by those who had come after them. So far as the Conservatives were concerned, they felt it their duty to make it their object to promote in any way they could, either by speech or by reticence, the true interests, as they conceived them to be, of the country.\" Youth and Politics.\u2014 On his installation as Lord Rector of the University of Edinburgh, in February, 1884, Sir Stafford Northcote delivered an address to the students, in the course of which he said \u2022 \" I expressed the hope that our meeting to-day might not bo marred by any unseemly display of party spirit ; but it was far from my intention to"], [461, "THE MARQUIS OF HARTINGTON. 441 -discourage the healthful expression of a genuine interest in political affairs, which, to my mind, is very much to be commended among the educated youth of a nation, and tends greatly to preserve the true spirit of our free institutions. Party spirit among the young men in our national seats of learning may easily be abused, and may become mischievous, as is the case with all good things ; and unquestionably there is a kind of party spirit \u2014 that which refuses to do justice to opponents, or to see any merits except on its own side \u2014 which is much to be deprecated and discouraged. But I \u25a0confess that I value so highly the training of our youth for political life, that I would rather see among you a little exaggeration, and even a little temporary misdirection of your partisanship, than a dull indifference upon questions of high importance, or a selfish insensibUity to the interests of your native country. Yon aU remember the beautiful and touching words of the Greek orator and statesman \u2014 'The taking of. the youth out of a State is like taking the spring out of the year.' They were words which he applied to the loss sustained by the State in the premature death of those who were cut off by war or disease. But they might with equal truth and force be applied to the loss which it suffers when the flower of its youth withdraw themselves from active political life, to devote tho energies which should be employed for their country's benefit to selfish \u2022objects, or to allow them to become enervated by indolence or luxury.\" And, comparing the universities of the middle ages with those of the present day, he went on to remark : \" With us the object of the University is not merely to protect scholars, but to form citizens ; and our sons should \u25a0be encouraged to look on the sight of the great vessel of the State labouring among the turbulent waves and the whitening breakers \u2014 not with indolent indifference, nor with tame self -gratulat ion over the ease and safety of their own position, but with noble sympathy, and -with a generous longing for tho time when the}-, too, may take part in the toils and in the perils of the voyage.\" THE MARQUIS OF HARTINGTON. (1833.) Varied Experience. \u2014 The Marquis of Harrington, eldest son of the seventh Duke of Devonshire, was attached to the embassy of Earl Granville to Russia on the coronation of the Emperor Alexander II. in 1857. He was returned to the House of Commons for North Lancashire in the same year. In March, 1863, he was made Lord of the Admiralty, but soon removed to the Under-Secretaryship for War, and he became Secretary for War in Lord RusseU's Administration of 1S66. He filled the office of Postmaster- General from 1S68 to 1S70, and of Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1870 to 1874. His younger brother. Lord Frederick Cavendish, was assassinated when filling the same post in 18S2. When Mr. Gladstone retired from the leadership of the Opposition in 1S75, the Marquis of Harrington was selected by the Liberal party to take his place ; and he was consulted by the Queen as to the formation of a Cabinet \u25a0on the return of the Liberals to power in 1880. He then accepted office under Mr. Gladstone as Secretary of State for India, aud afterwards"], [462, "442 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. transferred his services to the Secretaryship for War ; but entirely left Mr. Gladstone's side on the introduction by that Minister of his Home Rule scheme, and became the recognised leader of the \"Liberal Unionist party. In that capacity he was invited by Lord Salisbury in 1886 to join him in office ; and it was understood that Lord Salisbury had proposed to serve either under or with him. Lord Harrington, however, preferred to retain an independent position. He was called to the Upper House by the death of his father in December, 1891. Home Rule and Imperial Rule. \u2014 Mr. Butt having brought forward a motion in favour of Home Rule, in June, 1874, \" That this House resolve itself into a committee of the whole House to consider the Parliamentary relations between Great Britain and Ireland,\" the Marquis of Harrington said : \" In his judgment the Government [of Mr. Disraeli} had taken a wise line, and the House would do weU to support them in preferring to meet the resolution by a direct negative, rather than by the adoption of the suggested amendment [by Mr. R. Smyth], which, though eminently satisfactory as emanating from an Irish member, did not cover the whole ground. In honour and in honesty, the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain were bound to teU the Irish people that, what ever arguments might be used in reference to this question as it applied to Ireland, they could only look at it from an Imperial point of view ; and they were convinced that, whatever might be the effect of the proposal upon the internal affairs of that country, they could never give their assent to the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Limerick. It might be said that this was a strong declaration, but at the same time a very safe one on his part, seeing that the party to which he belonged were at present in a hopeless minority in that House, and that they had therefore nothing either to hope or to fear from the support of the Irish members. But he could say for himself \u2014 and he thought he might say the same on behalf of those who sat round him \u2014 that no motive of personal ambition, no consideration of party advantage, could ever induce them to purchaser the support of honourable members representing Irish constituencies by any sacrifice which, in their opinion, would endanger the union between the two countries. He knew it might be said that protestations of this kind were of little avail, and that, when the exigency of the moment demanded it, they might be easily evaded and set aside ; and therefore it was of more importance that he should express his firm conviction, that if any honourable members sitting on that side of the House were so reckless as to show a symptom on their part of a disposition to coquet with this question, there would instantly be such a disruption and disorganisation of parties, that they would find that they had lost more support from England and Scotland than they could ever hope to obtain from Ireland.\" The motion of Mr. Butt was rejected by 458 to 61. The Charge of Secession. \u2014 The following remarks were made by Lord Hartington at Chesterfield, at a meeting in support of Unionist candidates, during the elections of July, 1886. Repelling the accu sation cast upou him, and other prominent politicians on the same side, of being \" seceders,\" he asked: \"What have we seceded from? Have"], [463, "THE MARQUIS OF HARTINGTON. 443 we seceded from the traditional policy of the Liberal party ? If they want to prove that, they must go back eighty-six years. The only argu ment by which they can show that we are seceders from any policy which was ever held by the Whig or the Liberal party, is to go back to the time of the Union. Since that time every Liberal and every Whig has accepted the Union as completely without reservation as any Conservative in this country. The name ' seceder ' is not quite so ugly a word as ' deserter,' but the meanings are not very different. Suppose that, instead of carrying on a controversy by political methods, we were engaged in actual defence of our country with arms in our hands ; suppose we were members of a great army who were defending the country against invasion ; suppose that the general of that army were suddenly to be convinced that resistance was hopeless, or that it would be a better policy not to continue resistance at all ; supposing he himself, followed by the great bulk of his army, were to vacate and abandon the position he was holding ; and suppose, again, that a small section of his army were to refuse to abandon that position, and were to say they would hold on to it to the last, and untU they had received the command of the commander-in-chief himself that the position was to be abandoned \u2014 who in such a case would be the deserters, and who would be tho true and faithful soldiers P I maintain that we, tho Liberal party, form one of tho greatest corps of the army whose duty it is to uphold the greatness of this empire. Up to the present time we, in common with other political parties iu this country, have occupied a position of resistance to the Irish demands for separation. Our general, the Prime Minister, has, unfortunately in my opinion, given the order for a partial retreat and evacuation from the position we have been holding. What we say is this \u2014 that the order has not yet been issued by the coinmander-in-chief. The commander-in-chief in this battle is the British people as represented in the British Parliament ; and until the British people, through their representatives in Parliament assembled, order us to quit the position which we have been holding, not only will wo maintain that position, but we will also maintain that it is we who are upholding the traditional policy of our party, and that it is our opponents, and not we, who deserve, if anybody deserves it, the name of seceders from our party.\" Union and Heart Union. \u2014 At a Liberal Unionist meeting at Truro, October 31, 1887, Lord Harrington thus touched on this subject : \" I do not think that an)' one will ever accuse me of having disparaged the great genius or tho influence of Mr. Gladstone ; but I profess to be a Protestant in politics as well as in religion. I claim for myself and for my friends the right of private judgment and of individual opinion ; and as a political Protestant I protest, and shall continue to protest, against the acceptance by any members of the Liberal party of opinions which do not commend themselves to their own judgment, upon the authority of any man, however eminent. I do not wonder at the vast influence exercised by Mr. Gladstone ; but when I see the opinions of vast masses of men blown about like feathers in tho gale, or swayed like the weathercock on tho steeple \u2014 not by the force of argument or conviction, nor by any gradual"], [464, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 444 process of reasoning, but by the simple order or injunction of one man \u2014 then I protest against what I hold to be an injurious one-man influence. . . I know it is said that a * union of hearts ' * is to be substituted for a sham paper or parchment union. I do not deny that sentiment and imagination are both required in a great statesman. But there are other qualities which go to the making of a great statesman \u2014 qualities which, I am afraid, have been more exemplified in Count Cavour and in Prince Bismarck than in Mr. Gladstone. You want not only sentiment and imagination, but yon want determination and courage ; and those statesmen with whom he is now compared had the courage to suffer \u2014 aye, and to inflict upon their countrymen great evils, in order to secure great objects. Count Cavour did not hesitate to spill Italian blood in the cause of Italian unity ; and under Prince Bismarck, Germans have fought against Germans in the consolidation of the German Empire. Thousands of men have lost their lives in the work which will constitute the title of Cavour and Bismarck to a place in history ; and, if you had gone to either of these statesmen and had told them to look to a 'union of hearts,' and to disregard paper unions or political connection, I think that either of them would have paid but scant regard to any arguments you might have addressed to them on that point.\" Defence of Liberal Unionists. \u2014 Lord Harrington, at a public meeting in Ipswich, March 7, 1888, thus defended the political party with which he was then acting : \" Our belief is, rightly or wrongly, that that Irish policy which was embraced by the majority of the Liberal party in 1886 was a policy subversive of our existing Constitution. We believe that the existing Constitution of Great Britain affords the surest means of obtaining reform, of securing progress, and of promoting popular and public liberty. Well, if we believe that, are we not warranted in resisting, to the utmost of our power, a measure which we believe contains within itself the seeds of disruption and decay of that Constitution of which we are so proud ? We believed in 1886 that the plan which was proposed, for the creation within the United Kingdom of a separate Parliament and a separate Government for a portion of the United Kingdom, was a blow which struck at the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament. We believed that the supremacy of our Imperial Parliament is the foundation, the mainspring of our system of government ; and we believed that there are no devices, no contrivances however cunning or subtle, which could main tain for the Imperial Parliament that supremacy which we believe to be essential to its usefulness, if it were proposed at the same time to cut off from the administration and control of the Imperial Parliament a portion of the United Kingdom, and to deprive it of powers which necessarily would be henceforth entrusted to another, a separate and an inferior assembly. We hold that the proposals contained in the measure submitted to Parlia ment in 1886 were in many respects incomplete, impracticable, and vicious; and we contended \u2014 at least the greater part of us contended \u2014 that these were not mere defects of detail which could be avoided by tho * Mr. Gladstone's expression."], [465, "THE MARQUIS OF HARTINGTON. 445 introduction of another scheme. Our contention was that they were defects inherent in the principle of the measure which created within the United Kingdom a separate and an almost independent Parliament, and a separate and almost independent Government. I think that our conten tion has been to a great extent borne out by the experiences of the last two years.\" Sudden Conversion.\u2014 At a meeting at Carlisle, March 21, 1888, Lord Hartington said : \" Speaking in the name of my brother Liberal Unionists, we do not believe in the principle of passive obedience ; and if in former times Liberals, or the predecessors of Liberals, have refused to pay passive obedience to any temporal Sovereign or any spiritual Pontiff, we are not, in these later days, going to offer passive obedience to any political leader, however great his services may have been, or however much we may respect and venerate his character. The manner in which the majority of the Liberal party was converted to these new doctrines reminds me of those miraculous conversions of the heathen of which we read in the history of the Middle Ages, when some times in one day thousands of pagans were converted by the miraculous eloquence of some missionary preacher ; or perhaps they remind one no less of the conversions when whole nations embraced the faith of Mahomet at the point of the sword. I think we have a right to doubt, to some degree, the genuineness and the depth of a conversion so sudden and so complete. We have no right to doubt the sincerity of the converts who fuUy believed, or, at all events, thought they fully believed, in the new doctrines ; but we, to whom faith is not quite so easy \u2014 we who want to be convinced before we are converted \u2014 have a right to refuse to take the fact of their sudden and complete conversion as a reasou why we should modify our own unconvinced opinions.\" Rebellion against Parliament. \u2014 The following remarks were made at a gathering of Liberal Unionists and others at Inverness, October 3, 1888 : \" I want to know what is the foundation upon which the influence and power of the Parnellite party rests ? The first thing which brought the Parnellite party into a position of prominence and power was Parlia mentary obstruction. Now, Parliamentary obstruction is nothing but flat rebellion against Parliament. It is an attempt not only to lower tho dignity of Parliament, but to impair its usefulness and bring into con tempt its procednre, and destroy the confidence which members of Parlia ment used to entertain in one another \u2014 in fact, to lower and discredit Parliament. I must say I shall never forget, and I don't think I shall easUy forgive, the mortal injury which has been inflicted on, and the insidious poison which has been instilled into, our Parliamentary system by the tactics of that faction which in an evil clay obtained a place in our Parlia ment on equal terms. And I shall never cease to wonder at the conduct of that statesman who, during fifty years' connection with the affairs of his country, has won his greatest triumphs in tho House of Commons, in condoning and apparently forgetting the injury that has been inflicted, and that has been attempted to bo inflicted, upon the dignity and power and usefulness of tho House of Commons.\""], [466, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 446 Inconveniences of a Two-sided Chamber. \u2014 Lord Hartington spoke as foUows at a meeting of Liberal Unionists at Liverpool, December 18, 188S, taking the opportunity of reply to a speech delivered a few days before by Mr. Gladstone at Limehouse : \" There was the usual attack upon the Liberal Unionists, and I scarcely know whether it is worth whde to refer to the reiteration of the complaints which are brought against us because we still insist on sitting, where we have a perfect right to sit, on the front Opposition bench and on the Opposition side of the House. 1 will not say anything about the generosity of an attack of this kind. Some of us have occupied the seats, and have had a right to occupy the seats, we now occupy for a much longer period than most of those who sit by the side of and around Mr. Gladstone. I myself may, perhaps, remind you that I was called upon, I think now more than fourteen years ago, to occupy the seat upon that bench under very responsible circumstances ; * and I do not know that there is any particular or special reason why I should resign the seat, to which I consider myself to have a perfect right, because it is not altogether convenient to Mr. Gladstone when he turns round to find himself confronted by a sturdy Liberal Unionist. But it is a very trifling and a very unimportant subject, upon which it is not worth while to dwell. The fact is that the arrangements of the House of Commons are not very convenient, and it is difficult for three parties to dispose themselves to their mutual satisfaction in a chamber which has only two sides. That fact has led before now to very curious combinations and arrangements in the House of Commons, and no doubt will lead to more ; and I really do not know whether there is anything more anomalous in the present arrangement than in what took place no later than in the last Parliament, when tho most enthusiastic supporters of the Government then in power (that of Mr. Gladstone) sat below the gangway on the Opposition side of the House, by the side of the Conservatives who were engaged in the most strenuous opposition.\" The \" Privilege of Speech.\"\u2014 Speaking in the adjourned debate on the Closure resolutions, in March, 1882, the Marquis of Hartington observed of the Government proposals: \"The principle is that the time of the House belongs not to every individual member of the House, but to the House itself. It is the assertion of the principle that the privilege of speech is a privilege to be exercised \u2014 which the House permits to be exer cised \u2014 for its own instruction and for its own information, in order to form its own opinion ; and that it is not a personal privilege to be used quite irrespective of the convenience and of the efficiency of the House. Privilege of speech is not a personal right attaching to the position of a member of Parliament. If privilege of speech is a personal privilege, I presume it belongs to every member of the House \u2014 every member has a right to make use of it in an equal degree. But, if every member made even but a sparing use of this privUege, the question would be brought to * Lord Hartington had long occupied the position of leader of the Liberal party (then in Opposition) after Mr. Gladstone's so-called \" resignation \" (See p. 371.)"], [467, "WILLIAM EDWARD FORSTER. 447 a reductio ad absurdum. If the right can only be exercised by a few, and owing to the forbearance of the vast majority, on what ground can it be said that this is a personal right at aU ? . . Liberty of opinion and freedom of discussion exist not only in this House, but in the country. Any man may speak when and where and what he likes, provided it be within the law ; but outside this House he must find his own audience \u2014 he may say what he likes, but no one is bound to listen ; but here, those whose duty detains them are obliged to listen, whether they wish or no. The privilege that is claimed is not a privilege of free speech ; it is not the privilege of saying what one wishes to say and others wish to hear ; it is the privilege of appropriating an appreciable portion of time, precious and valuable time, for which possibly the House has very much better employ ment. The principle contained in this resolution is a principle of which it is impossible to exaggerate the importance \u2014 the principle that the time of the House belongs to the House itself, and that the privilege of speech is to be used for the convenience and advantage of the House, and not for the personal convenience or advantage of any member.\" Unrecognised Agents of Government. \u2014 The Marquis of Hart- ington, in addressing the University of Edinburgh on his installation as Lord Rector in 1879, said : \" Much governed as we are, centraUy and locally, public administration would, in my opinion, utterly break down were it not for the unrecognised forms of government which have grown up among us, created by no legislation, nor even inherited from our ancestors. In these days civilised nations are led rather than governed. They are led by their reason, by their feelings, by their passions ; but they are led by their necessities and their desires, by their fears, aud by their hopes ; and the men who lead them, aud thus have a share in and render possible the task of government, are the authors and journalists, the members of learned professions, the employers and organisers of labour, and their innumerable subordinates, by whom iu regular gradations tho armies of industry and of commerce are marshalled. These are amongst the most powerful, if not the most conspicuous, agents of government at the present time. And if the influence of these unrecognised rulers is necessary and powerful at home for the proper working of our social arrangements, how much more necessary are they for the maintenance of that complex system, without precedent in history, which is called the British Empire ? \" WILLIAM EDWARD FORSTER. (1818\u20141886.) A Candidate for the Leadership.\u2014 Mr. William Edward Forster, son of a weU-known minister of the Society of Friends, was head of a manufacturing house at Bradford, for which town he was first sent to Parliament in 1861, as ter unsuccessfully contesting Leeds two years before. In the Ministry of Earl RusseU in 1865. he became Under Secretary for the Colonies; and he fiUed the office of Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education in Mr. Gladstone's Administration a few years later, introducing the Education Act of 1870, and the BaUot Act of 1872."], [468, "448 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. On the temporary retirement of Mr. Gladstone from the leadership of the Liberals in 1875, Mr. Forster was put forward as his successor by many members of the party, but the choice eventually fell upon the Marquis of Hartington. Mr. Gladstone returning to power in 1880, Mr. Forster was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet. ; but resigned the office in May, 1882, disapproving of the change in policy with regard to Irish affairs which had then been determined on by the Ministry, especially with regard to what was called \" the Kilmain ham Treaty.\" While in the Irish Office, he narrowly escaped assassination on more than one occasion. A Painful Duty.; \u2014 In moving for leave to introduce \"A Bill for the Protection of Persons and Property in Ireland \" (sometimes called \"the Coercion Bill\"), January 24, 1881, Mr. Forster said: \"This has been to me a most painful duty ; I never expected that I should have to discharge it. If I had thought that this duty would devolve on the Irish Secretary, I would never have held the office. If I could have foreseen that this would be the result of twenty years of Parliamentary life, I should have left Parliamentary life alone. But I never was more clear than I am now that it is my duty ; I never was more clear that a man responsible, as I am, for the administration of the government of Ireland ought no longer to have part or share in any Government which does not fulfil its first duty \u2014 the protection of person and property, and the security of liberty.\" Mr. Forster and the House of Lords. \u2014 Mr. Forster's remarks upon . the House of Lords, in September, 1880, gave occasion for much comment, being interpreted as a denunciation of the one House by a Minister sitting in the other. The Upper House had just rejected the Registration of Voters (Ireland) Bill, on the ground that it had been sent up from the Commons too late to receive due consideration ; and this had occurred after the recent rejection of the Compensation for Disturbance Bill. On the Appropriation Bill nearing committee in the Commons, Mr. Pamell moved that it be an instruction to the committee to insert a clause reviving an important section of the Registration measure; but the Speaker pointed out that it was contrary to established usage to add such a tack-on to a money bill, as it was equally contrary for the Lords to amend such a measure. Mr. Forster then rose to say that the Government could not accept the proposed instruction, for the reason named by the Speaker. \" On the other hand,\" he continued, \" the members of the majority in the House of Lords must not be surprised if such an interference as this, with the endeavour of the House of Commons to change the mode of\" electing its members, should lead many men in and out of that House to consider whether the frequent repetition of such action did not call for some change in the constitution of the Upper House, or suggest that it might be advisable or even necessary. The only reason given for that action on the part of tho other House was that there was not time to consider the question. If the course adopted by the Lords in this case were to be very often taken, it would become exceedingly difficult for the two Houses to go on. It seemed to him that this was one of those cases"], [469, "WILLIAM EDWARD FORSTER. 449 in which the House of Lords ought not to put forward the argument of personal inconvenience, in order to prevent the passing of a BiU sent up from the Commons at any period of the session from being thoroughly considered. At any rate, the country would not forget these two facts. The House of Commons was the hardest worked assembly of law makers in the world. On the other hand, there probably was no assembly of law makers which had so much power, with so little demand upon its time, as the House of Lords. Nor could it be forgotten that the Commons were the representatives of tho people, whilst the power of the Lords was simply owing to the accident of birth. It was, therefore, not too much to ask that when the House of Commons sent up measures to the other House, their lordships would give the consideration necessary for those measures, without pleading personal inconvenience. He could not help thinking that in some respects the House of Lords had uot sufficiently realised their responsibility, but he thought that they were more likely to do so in future.\" These remarks elicited much cheering from Ministerialists \"below the gangway,\" and from the Irish members. \u2014 Sir Stafford Northcote rose immediately after, and expressed his amazement that a responsible Minister of the Crown should throw out suggestions of the kind just heard ; and on the following evening, in the House of Lords, Earl Granville, in reply to some observations, said he had thought it necessary to have some communication with his coUeague (Mr. Forster) on the subject, and that gentleman had stated he had not asserted that he believed a reform in the House of Lords advisable, but that such a reform might have to be considered under certain conditions. \"At the same time,\" continued Earl GranviUe, \"I must add that my right honourable friend also informs me that in saying this much he was only expressing his own opinion, and had no intention whatever of expressing the opinion of the Government, or of committing them to any course of action.\" The subject then dropped. Resignation of the Irish Secretaryship. \u2014 After resigning the office of Chief Secretary for Ireland, in May, 1882, Mr. Forster stated to the House of Commons that he had received her Majesty's permission to put before the House his reasons for that step, and that foremost amongst these reasons was the determination of the rest of the Govern ment to release the three Irish members (Messrs. ParneU, Dillon, and O'Kelly) from their imprisonment under the Protection Act of 1881. In his explanation he said: \"Tho same reasons which obliged me to vindicate the detention of these gentlemen, on tho ground of the prevention of crime, make me now object to their release, because I believe that tends to the encouragement of crime. Lot the House do what is right, but let it not try to buy obedience to tho law by concessions. Surrender is bad, but a compromise or arrangement is worse. I think we may remember what a Tudor king said to a great Irishman in former days : ' If aU Ireland cannot govern the Earl of Kildare, then let the Earl of Kildare govern Ireland.' He thought it better that the Earl of Kildare should govern Ireland, than that there should be an arrangement between the Earl of Kildare and his representative in Dublin Castle. . . 1\u00a3 there is one G G"], [470, "450 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. thing worse than secret societies, it is an open acknowledgment of the powerlessness of tho law without the assistance of the law breakers. Better even secret societies, which we can put down as we have put them down before \u2014 better even these hideous institutions of demoraUsa tion, than paying blackmail to law breakers.\" The Preservation of Liberty. \u2014 The speech of Mr. Forster just quoted was made on the evening of the 4th of May; and on Saturday, the 6th, his successor, Lord Frederick Cavendish, and the Under-Seeretary, Mr. Burke, were assassinated in the Ph\u0153nix Park. These murders induced the Government to bring in, on the 11th, a biU for the more effectual prevention of crime in Ireland ; and on the 13th Mr. Forster, in a speech at Bradford, made the following remarks : '\u2022 What happened on Saturday made it clear to everyone that nothing could take precedence \"of such measures as were necessary to prevent crime in Ireland. I believe that liberty is at stake in this matter even more than law and order, and that it is our duty to support the Government, and the duty of the Government to pass strong measures \u2014 not merely for, as some people would say, the preservation of law and order, forgetting liberty, but to secure even liberty itself. . . Let us show that we are determined to uphold the true principle of liberty \u2014 the preservation of individual liberty; taking care that there shall be no tyranny either by Government, or by oligarchy, or by landlords, or by assassins, or by any secret society, or by any intimidating organisation.\" Mr. Forster and Mr. ParneU. \u2014 In the debate on the Address on the 22nd of February, 1883, Mr. Forster spoke on the affairs of Ireland and the course he had taken while Chief Secretary, and at the same time denounced the conduct of the member for Cork (Mr. ParneU), then present, in terms of severity perhaps unexampled in the House of Commons. In the course of his remarks he said : \" I charge against the honourable member and his friends, that he and they aUowed themselves to continue the leaders of an organisation \u2014 of which he was the avowed chief \u2014 that not merely advocated, and ostensibly and openly urged, the ruin of those who opposed them, and avowed the doctrine of boycotting, which was to make life almost more miserable than death ; but which set on foot an agitation which organised or promoted outrage, and incited to murder. The natural outcome. of this agitation was murder, and the honourable member ought to have known that this would be the natural result. . . It has been often enough shown by statistics that outrages and murders followed the meetings and the action of the Land League. Will the honourable member deny and disprove that statement ? I will repeat again the charge I make against him ; and probably no more serious charge was ever made by any one member of this House against another. It is not that he himself directly planned or perpetrated outrages and murders, but that he cither connived at them \" (Cheers.) \u2014 Mr. ParneU : \"It is a lie.\" Hereupon there were cries of \" Order \" and \" Name,\" and during their continuance, Mr. O'Kelly shouted out, \" It's a lie,\" three times in succession, loud and sustained cries of \" Chair \" and \" Name \" arising at these interruptions. \u2014 The Speaker now named the member for"], [471, "THE DUKE OF ARGYLL. 451 Roscommon (Mr. O'Kelly) as disregarding the authority of the Chair ; and the Marquis of Hartington thereupon moved that Mr. O'Kelly be suspended from the service of the House. The motion was carried by 305 to 20. Mr. Forster afterwards continued his remarks in a similar strain, and, although having directly challenged the member for Cork to reply, was left for the time without rejoinder. Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Forster. \u2014 In the debate on a proposed vote of censure on the Government respecting Egyptian affairs, and the position of General Gordon at Khartoum, in May, 1884, the following remarks by Mr. Forster elicited much cheering from the Opposition : \"As to the request for information contained in the telegram [to General Gordon] of immediate or prospective danger at Khartoum, he believed that every one but the Prime Minister was convinced of that danger. He was tolerably suro that the Prime Minister was not convinced of it ; if he had been, he would have acted very differently. He attributed this to the Prime Minister's wonderful powers of persuasion. The Prime Minister could persuade most people of most things, and, above all, he could persuade himself of almost anything.\" \u2014 These observations were censured by some members of the Liberal party, and the \" four hundred,\" or caucus, of Bradford (Mr. Forster's borough) forwarded to Mr. Gladstone resolu tions expressive of sympathy and support. They received a reply from the Prime Minister's secretary, stating, \" The committee will understand that Mr. Gladstone thinks it his duty wholly to abstain from comment on the line taken and the language used by Mr. Forster in the recent debate. Mr. Gladstone, however, allows himself the pleasure of expressing his full assurance that any personal attack ou himself was never intended by Mi-. Forster.\" A similar reference to the Premier occurred in Mr. Forster's speech in the debate on a vote of censure in February, 1885. He said : \" My right honourable friend, as we all know, is tho greatest master that ever existed of distinctions and differences. He convinces himself and he convinces others, but he does not always convince facts.\" THE DUKE OF ARGYLL. (1823.) Leaving the Boat. \u2014 George Douglas CampbeU, eighth Duke of Argyll, succeeded his father in 1847, and sits in tho House of Lords as Baron Sundridge and Hamilton. He occupied several ministerial offices in the \" Liberal \" Cabinets of former days, among them Lord Privy Seal (to which he was first appointed in 1853), Postmaster-General, and Secretary of State for India (1868). He was made Lord Privy Seal for the third time in Mr. Gladstone's Administration of 1830, but resigned the foUowing year, in consequence of his disapproval of the early Irish policy of his coUeagues. His censures on their later measures were (it wiU be seen) as strong as those of their most determined opponents. A \" Jelly-fish Administration.\" \u2014 On the second reading of the Land Law (Ireland) Bill in the House of Lords, in August, 1881, the Duke of ArgyU, who had resigned his position (as Lord Privy Seal) in G G 2"], [472, "452 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Mr. Gladstone's Ministry on account of the introduction of that measure, made the following reflections on his former coUeagues : \" When I look back upon the general character of the biU, although I think it is a sincere and ingenious attempt to settle a difficult question, I cannot help smiling at the adulation with which it has been greeted. It is called a great act of constructive statesmanship and policy \u2014 a great act of constructive policy by a Liberal Government, placing absolutely in the hands of a triumvirate [the Land Court] the whole land of Ireland. Is this the wisdom and statesmauship of a Liberal Government ? I cannot doubt for a moment that the Government has been driven to this bill, as we are driven to its acceptance, by circumstances of external pressure. The Government has been driven to this rough and coarse expedient, worthy of a despotic government, and wondered at by every civilised nation in Europe. When I look at my noble friends below me, I cannot help regarding them as like something I have often seen on the seas of the Western Highlands \u2014 a row of jeUy fishes. My noble friends need not be affronted by the comparison, for jeUy fishes are the most beautiful creatures in the world. (Laughter.) They have been the study of the most eminent biologists, and it has been discovered that they are endowed with a most elaborate nervous system ; but I am sorry to say they have beeu found destitute of skeleton or backbone. (Renewed laughter.) There is one great peculiarity about them \u2014 they make a most beautiful and convulsive movement in the water, and in doing so the poor creatures think they are swimming ; but when you take the bearings of the land, you find that they are simply floating with the currents and tides. That is the position of my noble friends below me with regard to the Land BiU. Success can only be obtained on one condition, and that is that you develop your jelly-fish qualities untU you get in them something like a skeleton.\" The \" Cross-bench Mind.\" \u2014 The cross-benches in the House of Lords are generaUy occupied by peers who own no strict party aUegiance, but are supposed to express independent views when they address the House. In a debate in the House of Lords on the second reading of the Franchise BUI, in 1884, the Duke of Argyll (who voted for the measure) made the following remarks : \" Both political parries are to a great extent independent of the individual, and, in my opinion, the individual is also to a very great extent independent of party. My noble friend the Foreign Secretary (Earl GranviUe), in some good-humonred banter a few weeks ago, spoke, I thought, in a tohe of some contempt of what he called the ' cross-bench mind.' My lords, I disagree with him. I am conscious very largely of partaking of the cross-bench mind. I have been summing up the years during which I have had the honour of being in high office since I entered this House, and I find that the total number of years I have been in this House is 37, and of those 37 years I have been 18 years a member of various Cabinets. Therefore I have some right to know what are the advantages and the disadvantages of the cross-bench mind and of the Treasury-bench mind. They each of them have their dangers and their temptations ; but I have no hesitation"], [473, "THE DUKE OF ARGYLL. 453 in saying this\u2014 that it would be well for this House if a great majority of its members had the cross-bench mind, and if every man was determined to vote upon the merits of every question that came before him, without regard to political ties.\" A Ministerial Collapse.\u2014 On the 10th of July, 1885, the Duke of ArgyU rose, according to notice, \"to call the attention of the House of Lords to the circumstances attending the recent change of Administra- tion,\" an adverse vote of the Commons on the Budget having led to the downfall of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry. In the course of his speech he said : \" We have seen the great political transformation which has taken place, and which is typified by the change of sides in both Houses. How is it that the great Administration of Mr. Gladstone, which came into office with a majority ranging from 100 to 130 \u2014 the most powerful Administration in numbers that has ever succeeded to power in this country \u2014 how is it that that Administration came to such sudden grief ; how has it gone upon the rock, and how has its wreck compelled the leaders of a comparatively small minority in Parliament to assume the responsibilities of office ? That is a question which I think we have a right to look into, and which, in my opinion, is full of iuterest and instruction. I really believe that when any Ministry in this country holds office for four or five years, they accumulate gradually a sense of dis- content, of falsified expectations, and of disappointed hopes, which sap and undermine their popularity. Then there is the Irish vote, which is always an uncertain element in political affairs. But none of these causes \u25a0can account for the great and sudden crash that has recently taken place. The cause of that crash I believe to be, that there has been for a long time a waning confidence in the leaders of the Liberal party, due to a growing persuasion that they were not united, and that the policy which they pursued was a policy of compromise, not completely fitting into the opinions of any one fraction of the Government. In arriving at that conclusion, I have not been influenced by any of the newspaper paragraphs which have been published with reference to supposed splits in the Cabinet, although in this instance the accuracy of those paragraphs has been proved by subsequent events. During the last month, in the streets and even at garden parties, if one saw any man coming along with a peculiarly elastic step and a most jovial countenance, he was sure to be a member of the late happy family. (Laughter.) They always seemed to say to themselves, ' We have got out of tho mess, and not only that, but we have put the Tories into it.' \" (The adverse vote had been owing chiefly to abstentions on the part of usual supporters of the Ministry, and it was considered that, if the Gladstone Cabinet could have gone on, it must at least have been reorganised.) United Faces and Constitutional Principles. \u2014 In the same speech the duko commented upon some remarks recently made hy the Earl of Rosebery, and said : \" Looking at my noble friend's speech in Edinburgh I found this singular passage, in which he insists on the necessity of compromise. He says \u2014 ' We aU have to sacrifice points very \u2022dear to us ; 1 venture to say that no one can realise that absolutely and"], [474, "454 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. completely until he has been a member of a Cabinet. . . Though there must be constant compromise on lesser matters going on iu a Cabinet, yet it manages to preserve a united face.' Not a united heart or mind, but a united face. (Laughter.) . . I was astonished to find him ending with a solemn denunciation against breaking the unity of the Liberal party. The expressions my noble friend used were very solemn. He said, ' Let no man dare to lay his sacrUegious hand on the sacred ark of Liberal unity.' (Laughter.) I confess when I read this paragraph I did not quite know how to express my own feelings. My state of mind was similar to that indicated in the exclamation of the Italian musician when for the first time he heard the Highland bagpipes \u2014 ' Voila, voila, ! J'aime cela \u2014 c'est atroce.' I do not know where my noble friend has placed the ark of Liberal unity \u2014 whether it is stiU being carried on, or whether my noble friend has taken it back with him to Dalmeny ; but I have uo confidence that such a sacred ark ever existed in the Cabinet which my noble friend joined, and I have something more than confidence that if it cUd it was touched by very unholy hands. . . We may have united faces, but we have not a united policy. I am ready to stand under an umbrella with anybody,* but I decline to foUow Cabinets which cannot make up their minds on the most fundamental questions. I say distinctly that it would be infinitely better to go back to the customs and habits of the last century, when members of the same Administration openly spoke and voted against each other, and when, in truth, the responsibiUty of Cabinets had not yet become firmly rooted in the constitution of the country, than to revert to the more personal references to which my noble friend invites us.\" \" Exclusively Irish \" Questions. \u2014 The Duke of Argyll put some questions on the announcement, in the House of Lords (Juno 10, 1886) that the Queen had been advised to dissolve the Parlia ment. He said : \" I rise to complain of the extreme meagreness of the explanation which has been given to this House. We are in the midst of a great political crisis. I think we are entitled to ask \u2014 what is the question upou which an appeal is to be made to the constituencies P There are three or four questions which the independent members of this House have a right to put to the Government. I believe the latest definition of the question on which an appeal is to be made to the country is whether or not there shall be ' an Irish Parliament for the management of affairs specifically and exclusively Irish.' These are the words by which has been last defined the question which has been put to Parliament and is now to be put to the country. I find no meaning in these words by themselves \u2014 things ' specifically and exclusively Irish.' I want to know from the Government what they mean by these words. Is it exclu sively au Irish question that every Irishman shaU be able to go to his bed without tho fear of being dragged out of it and murdered before his family ? Is it an exclusively Irish question that commercial companies * Lord Eosebery had said that he would stand \"under the same umbrella\" with Mr. Gladstone."], [475, "THE DUKE OF ARGYLL. 455 shall be free to trade with the world and with the subjects of the Queen, and to perform their commercial duties to the community, without violent interruption ? Are these matters of which we are to wash our hands by handing them over to an Irish Parliament? We have the right to understand what the Government mean by exclusively Irish affairs when they dissolve Parliament upon this enigmatical question.\" Combinations.\u2014 The Duke of ArgyU made the following remarks on the second reading of the Criminal Law Amendment (Ireland) BUI in 1887 : \" My right honourable friend who leads the Opposition in the other House (Mr. Gladstone) has been busy lately in confounding the case of trade unions with combinations in Ireland for agrarian purposes. Now, can there be a more transparent fallacy than this ? The right honourable gentleman said, ' To give to the Irish tenants and cottar population the same protection in respect of their land strikes that you give to the English artisan in respect to his labour strikes.' Certainly the trade unionist has a right to combine in defence of the price of his own property. There is not a man in the other House or a demagogue ou any platform who would assert more clearly than I do the right of workmen to combine in defence of the price of their property. Their labour is their property, the most sacred of aU property, and they have a perfect right to combine in defence of it. There may bo economic difficulties, but there is nothing dishonest, nothing iUegal, nothing unjust in combi nations of that character. Compare with that the case of the Irish tenants. The essence of the case of the Irish tenant is that he holds the property of another ; and Mr. Gladstone's position is that the tenant is to have the same liberty of dealing with the land as the Euglish labourer with his own property. No Minister has ever laid down such a doctrine as this before. The two cases are absolutely different.\" Re-making Constitutions. \u2014 The \" Round Table \" Con- ference.* \u2014 In the same speech (July 14, 1887) the duke remarked, with reference to some recent political proceedings : \" There has been a complete forgetfulness of everything, a complete repudiation of those things which go clown deep to the very foundation of society. We have seen during the last eighteen months four or five gentlemen sitting round a green table at Westminster, and drawing up a new edition of the British Constitution. No such thing has over been adopted before, go back as far in our history as you please. There have been no span-new inventions, no brand-new constitutions, given to the foundation of society ; aud it was, therefore, unprecedented, unjustifiable, immeasurable presumption. The greatest of Mr. Gladstone's constructions was the famous Budget of 1853. I do not deny that the measure disestablishing the Irish Church showed immense constructive power ; but in that case he had to deal with a Christian Church, and all ho had to do was to divide the spoil. In this case he has attempted to reconstitute a whole Constitution, to make a brand new system of government for the three kingdoms. Not even he was adequate to these things. I shaU vote for this BiU, because I wish to * For the \" Bound Table Conference,\" see p. 462."], [476, "456 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. secure for every individual of the Irish people the liberties which have come down to them under the Imperial system.\" EDWARD HENRY, EARL OF DERBY. (1826.) Official Experience. \u2014 Edward Henry Stanley, fifteenth Earl of Derby, is son of the fourteenth Earl, who was three times Prime Minister. He succeeded to the title on the death of his father in 1869. As Lord Stanley, he sat in the House of Commons for King's Lynn from 1848 until he entered the House of Lords. In the first Ministry of his father (in 1852) he was Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; and in the second, he filled the offices of Secretary for the Colonies, President of the Board of Control, and Secretary of State for India. In his father's latest Administration he was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as he also was under Mr. Disraeli from 1874 to 1S78, when he left that Government on account of difference of opinion on certain matters of Eastern policy.* After occupying for a time an independent position in the House of Lords, he transferred his allegiance to the Liberal party, and in 1S82 was appointed Secretary for the Colonies iu Mr Gladstone's Government. He ceased to be a supporter of Mr. Gladstone on the development of that Minister's Irish policy. An Estimate of his Earlier Life. \u2014 \" Good Sense.\" \u2014 In Mr. R. H. Hutton's \" Studies in ParUament,\" published in 1866, the place then held by Lord Stanley in the House of Commons and amongst politicians was thus critically estimated. \"No man commands more of that respect which is yielded to shrewd judgment and careful informa- tion. The strongest statesmen listen to him for instruction, and even his party \u2014 by whom he is, on the whole, sincerely disliked, and with good reason (for Lord Stanley's cold understanding is rather repelled than attracted by the exigencies of party) \u2014 Usten to him with the sort of irritated submission with which prejudice listens to the authoritative condemnation of worldly good sense. Yet Lord Stanley can never be a popular statesman ; and if he should come to the top at all \u2014 for which his abilities clearly qualify him \u2014 it must be in some era like the present, in which no warm political feeling animates any party or any section of the country, and in which England is quite willing to be ruled by repellent good sense. There is a good sense which is essentially genial, as was Lcrd Palmerston's, and a good sense which is essentiaUy depreciating, like Lord Stanley's. He is, like logo, 'nothino- if not critical,' and his criticisms almost always bring down your estimate of something of which you previously thought better. His last great speech to his constituents was a frigid bid for power in the sense of submitting a programme in which Conservatives who do not care much for Conservatism, and Radicals who do not care much for Radicalism might join. And he has intimated pretty distinctly that no Conservatives of sense can care very much for Conservatism, and that no Radicals of * See p. 339."], [477, "EDWARD HENRY, EARL OF DERBY. 457 sense can care very much for Radicalism. Lord Stanley thinks the time ripe for a great neutral party that is not a party, that cares at least for no party principles. The rule of Lord Stanley would be the rule of the strong commonplace essence of the nation. Conservatism and Radicalism might, in a certain sense, reaUy unite under Lord Stanley ; for Conser vatism would be gratified by the cold shoulder which he uniformly turns to imaginative or enthusiastic Liberalism ; and Radicalism would be gratified by the cold shoulder which he uniformly turns to sentimental or traditional Conservatism.\" The \" Wheels \" and the \" Drag.\"\u2014 The Caucus.\u2014 Lord Derby, however, must be allowed to explain his own views of his stand point, which wUl be found in the following passage. On the eve of joining Mr. Gladstone's Ministry in December, 1882, be was entertained by the Manchester Reform Club, and, in the course of a speech acknowledging his welcome, remarked : \"There is room in our English community for both the great political connections into which it is divided. There have been, and there may be again, times when the dominant feeling is really Conservative, aud in such times it is better for everybody that Liberals should be in opposition. But just now, and I thiuk for some years to come, there is business on hand which a Conser vative Minister, still more a high Tory Minister, could not undertake, and which, if he did undertake, his foUowers would not allow him to perform. We require the drag as well as the wheels, but just now, at least, we do not want a drag powerful enough to stop the coach altogether. The truth is, that it does not depend upon one politician or another whether events shaU move in a certain direction ; that is settled for us by causes which are very little under individual control. What we can determine is whether the stream, which no power known to us can arrest, shaU flow on equably and steadily in channels arranged for it, or whether it shall be dammed up by temporary obstacles, which at one moment shall cause it to stagnate, and at another to break through in a dangerous and destructive torrent.\" \" Sections \" in the House of Commons. \u2014 In the speech just quoted, Lord Derby defended the \" caucus \" organisations, and said : \" Forty years ago, Sir Robert Peel said to his friends, as the practical sum of his political advice to them, ' Register, register, register.' If he had lived till now, the words would have been, ' Organise, organise, organise.' An organised party against one that is not organised is a disciplined force against a mob. Let me repeat here what I said at a meeting in London tho other day. The Liberal party has only one want, which is union ; and only one danger to fear, which is division. Separate we must bo beaten ; united we cannot, fail to win. We shaU not have smooth or easy times. With the enlarged constituencies of the future, new questions will turn up and new difficulties possibly arise ; but the gravest of all difficulties, affecting not merely one or other party, but the efficiency of Parliament itself, would bo the splitting up of the majority of the Houso of Commons into little groups or sections too weak to act singly and too jealous to act together.

It is not for me to express any opinion on that subject, but this at least I may say, that we are not given to unnecessary speeches, and the device of obstruction is unknown among us. It would be idle to deny that in an age like ours \u2014 an age of democratic tendencies and aspirations \u2014 and in the presence of a House of Commons which more and more represents the entire population, the position of an aristocratic body such as the House of Lords is, aud necessarily must be, always delicate and sometimes difficult. But difficulties are opportunities. There is no credit to be earned where there is no possibUity of going wrong ; and if there is, as I hope and believe, among the members of the House of Lords that prudence, that judgment, that statesmanlike temper, that knowledge of what is necessary and possible, without which no legislativo body, however ancient and august, can long continue to hold its own \u2014 if,. I say, we possess these virtues, we shaU probably in the next few years have abundant opportunities of exercising them. (Cheers and laughter.) And it is my hope and belief that we shad make our way through the embar rassments and perplexities of the present day, as we have done through those of many preceding generations.\" The Liberal Party and Socialistic Ideas. \u2014 At a Liberal demonstration in Blackburn in October, 1885, Lord Derby made a lengthy speech, in the course of which he uttered some characteristic remarks on several prominent topics. He said, for instance : \" The Liberal party can only win by cordial union among all its sections. Moderate men, Whigs \u2014 it is a historic name, and not a name to be ashamed of \u2014 must not let themselves be scared by a few utterances which may not be altogether prudent or just toward them ; and our enthusiastic friends with socialist leanings must recollect that they are not the whole world ; that they are not, in aU probability, a majority of their own party ; and that if they go for all or nothing, they may quite possibly get nothing for their pains.\" Again: \"As to the plan, which has been so much talked of lately, of enabling local authorities to buy land by compulsion in order to sell it again to labourers in small holdings, I am not absolutely hostile, but I am sceptical. It has never been thoroughly examined or discussed; it has never even been debated in Parliament. We have not heard the objections that could be taken to it, nor the answers to those objections ; and till we have I should be sorry either to condemn it or to sanction it in an unqualified manner. But what strikes me most strongly in connection with it is that it proposes to throw on the ratepayers what may probably be a very heavy burden, for the benefit of one class. It must be a losing operation; for, of course, I assume that the price paid is to be a fair one ; and I can hardly see the farmer, the shopkeeper, the"], [479, "SIR WILLIAM VERNON HARCOURT. 459 clerk, and the artisan submitting to a large increase in their rates for the sake of supporting a new class of cultivators who are to be created at their expense. I think they would be apt to ask, ' If one set of men are to be helped out of the rates to set up in business, why not another ? ' Why is the man who wants to stock a shop not as well entitled to public assistance as he who wants to set up a farm ? Either a thing will pay or it wiU not pay. If it will, why should not private enterprise carry it through ? If it wUl not, the question wiU, I think, be asked whether the general public ought to be taxed to do it. At the same time I am not saying that the experiment should not be tried. There is nothing like practice to test theory.\" Five Parliaments. \u2014 In taking the chair at a gathering of Liberal Unionists at Liverpool, Dec. 18, 1888, Lord Hartington being the chief guest, Lord Derby made the following remarks : \" Our urgent duty at present is to maintain the Union, to take care that organised obstruction does not destroy the efficiency of Parliament, aud to maintain order aud law in parts of the country where at present neither the ono nor the other is respected. I do not like to use sensational language, but it is my sincere conviction that no issue equal in importance to this has beeu before the country in the memory of any man living. When Canning said that to repeal the Union was to restore the Heptarchy, he spoke rather in jest than in earnest ; but the talk of seventy years ago has become a reality now. You have a proposal for Home Rule for Scotland. You may be quite sure that Wales will claim an equal concession to what it caUs its nationality. If anybody believes that in these two little islands there is room for four separate national Governments with one Imperial Govern ment over them aU \u2014 five Cabinets and five Parliaments \u2014 and that aU those Cabinets and Parliaments can continue to work together, he must be of an exceptionaUy sanguine disposition, or must possess the happy faculty which some politicians have of being able to shut his eyes very hard.\" SIR WILLIAM VERNON HARCOURT. (1827.) \" Historicus.\" \u2014 Sir William George GranviUe Venables Vernon Harcourt, Secretary for the Home Department in Mr. Gladstone's second Administration, and Chancellor of the Exchequer in his third, is a descendant of the weU-known family of tho Harcourts of Nuneham Park, Oxfordshire, his father having been a clergyman, and his grandfather Archbishop of York. He was educated at Cambridge, and caUed to the bar in 1854. For a time he occupied himself in journalism, and he was author of a remarkable series of letters on international law, signed \" Historicus,\" which appeared in the Tidies during the discussion respecting the claims of America against England concerning the escape of the Alabama. He was returned for the city of Oxford in December, 1868, and held the office of SoUcitor-General from November, 1873, to the fall of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry in February, 1874. Con tinuing to represent Oxford imtd 1880, he was then rejected by that"], [480, "460 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. borough on seeking re-election after taking office as Home Secretary. He was, however, soon after returned for Derby. His occupation of the Home Offico was identified with the passage of the Ground Game Act, and with the introduction of the Prevention of Crime (Ireland) BiU, after the assassination of Lord F. Cavendish and Mr Burke in Dublin in 1882. A Whig. \u2014 Sir WiUiam Harcourt was taunted in the House of Commons with having boasted that he was \" a Whig of Whigs ; \" where upon he replied : \" The honourable member thought, in calling him an old Whig, he had passed upon him a sentence of condemnation. For himself, he liked old names, and he had always admired the late Lord Reaconsfield, who, instead of caUing himself a Constitutionalist, or a Conservative, or what not, stuck by the old name of Tory. He thought the old names of Whigs and Tories just as good names as any that had been invented since, and, therefore, he was not at aU unwUling to be described by one of the two names which the great political parties had borne for the last two centuries.\" The House of Commons and the Government, \u2014 At a banquet in the Victoria Hall, Leeds, in AprU, 1884, Sir WiUiam Harcourt (Homo Secretary) was called upon to reply to the toast, \" Her Majesty's Ministers,\" and in the course of his remarks said : \" I have to warn you of a great and growing evil against which you must be upon your guard. To-day there is no danger of tho tyranny of kings, there is no peril from the privileges of the aristocracy, but there is a greater power growiug up which is not incapable of abuse. We profess to be the friends, we are the advocates, of popular power, but we are not its parasites or its sycophants, and we dare to tell it of its faults. One of the besetting sins and the greatest danger of democracy is the attack which it is disposed to make upon local self-government, and the attempt to centralise power in a form in which it may be most injurious. I speak of this matter with some practical knowledge. Every day demands are made upon the Home Office to interfere in matters with which it has nothing to do, and to assume an authority which it does not and ought not to possess. Every day I am asked questions about the conduct of people over whom I have no authority. Every day I am expected to assume new power, and this is not at all complimentary to me or my office. It is not because the people who desire this have a particularly good idea of this Home Secretary or that Home Secretary, but because they know that the House of Commons is the master of the Executive Government, and they wish that power to be in the Executive Government in order that they may control it. That is a principle which, if yon aUow it to be carried out to its fullest extent, is fatal to the principle of local self-government. The House of Commons has a tendency, and a most dangerous tendency, to usurp the functions of the Executive Government ; and having usurped those functions, it naturally desires to throw upon the Executive Government more and more work. There is another very insidious form of this evil, and that is in the demand for subsidies from Imperial taxation. What do these subsidies .mean ? If you are to have subsidies from the Imperial Government you"], [481, "SIR WILLIAM VERNON HARCOURT. 4.QI must have central control and central interference ; and this is one of the most insidious and mischievous forms in which local self-government can possibly be attacked. This at least I may say on behalf of her Majesty's Ministers, that their policy is not in this direction.\" \" Parnellite Juice.\"\u2014 In a speech at Lowestoft in December, 1885, Sir William Harcourt declaimed against the supposed action of the Tory party in forming \" an intimate alliance with men who openly avowed their object was the dismemberment of Ireland from England.\" He continued: \"Was it possible the country was going to tolerate such a transaction? Liberals must not be in a hurry to turn the Tories out. He would let them for a few months stew in their own Parnellite juice, and when they stank in the nostrils of the country, as they would stink, then the country would fling them, discredited and disgraced, to the constitueneies, and the nation would pronounce its final judgment upon them. They would hear no more of Tory reactions for many generations.\" In the following spring Sir William held high office in a Government brought in by Parnellite votes, and which presently astonished the country by its \" Home Rule \" proposals. The Missing Stars.\u2014 In his speech in support of the second reading of Mr. ParneU's \" Irish Tenants' Relief BUI,\" Sept. 21, 1886, Sir William Harcourt thus referred to the recent divisions among leading members of the Liberal party : \" I am not surprised that the party opposite, which ispar excellence the landlords' party, should adopt a landlords' policy. I do not complain of the Tory party taking np that line. But there is an interesting section composed of dissenting Liberals \u2014 what are they going to do ? My noble friend the member for Rossendale (Lord Hartington) has left us in no doubt as to what he is going to do. He made to-night as stout a landlord speech as I ever heard in my life. I do not complain of him for this. It is quite natural. I remember the story of a conversation in which the head of the Holy Roman Empire was discussing matters with a Liberal politician, and in the course of it he observed, ' As for me I am a Royalist ; it is my profession.' My noble friend is a landlord ; that is his profession. (\" Hear,\" and murmurs.) But my noble friend, though a most important member, is not the only member of the dissenting Liberal section. Where is my learned friend the constitutional adviser of the dissenting Liberals (Sir H. James) ? Where is the voice of Birmingham ? We have heard one voice from the Treasury bench, but at Birmingham ' they are seven.' Where are the six ? It reminds me of the constellation of seven stars, the Pleiades, in which there is occasionaUy a star missing. In the Birmingham constel lation there are several bright particular stars missing to-night. Where is the senior member for Birmingham (Mr Bright), the great champion in former days of impoverished tenants ? Has the right honourable gentleman come to the conclusion that force is the only remedy ? There is another member for Birmingham absent to-night, my right honourable friend (Mr. Chamberlain) who a few months ago proposed, as the only necessary remedy for the maintenance of social order in Ireland, the suspension of evictions. Where is he, and what has become of that eminent"], [482, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 462 \"body the Radical Union ? There is yet another member \u2014 the hero of 'three acres and a cow' (Mr Jesse Colliugs), the friend of the poor tenant all over the world ; and when I ask where is he, I am reminded of a celebrated apostrophe of Lord Chatham, ' Gentle shepherd, teU me where.' Birmingham, that used to lead the Liberal and Radical opinion of England upon this great and critical question, speaks now with one voice, and the voice of Birmingham is the voice of a Tory Minister (the Home Secretary, Mr Matthews).\" The second reading of the biU was refused by 297 to 202. Called to Order. \u2014 In discussing an amendment to the Address, on the subject of riots at Belfast (Sept. 2, 1886), Sir W. Harcourt was called to order by the Speaker, under the followiug circumstances. He had asked, \" What was the character of the Orangemen of 1798 ? He would read extracts from a history of Ireland to show.\" He was pro ceeding to read the extracts, when a member asked whether the history of Orangemen had anything to do with the amendment before the House. \u2014 The Speaker: I am bound to say I do not think a general discussion upon the antecedents of the Orange party has much connection with the amendment. \u2014 Sir W. Harcourt : Of course, Sir, I shall strictly obey your ruling; but this I wiU ask you. My charge is that the people of Belfast were invited by the noble lord (R. ChurchiU) to imitate their forefathers in 1798. I wiU ask whether I am not at liberty to point out to the House what was the meaning of that invitation, how it was under stood, and what was the effect on the riots. (After a pause.) As I understand, you agree that I am justified The Speaker : I do not think the right honourable gentleman is justified in that Une of argument. I said the remarks of the right honourable gentleman were not pertinent to the amendment before the House. \u2014 Sir W. Harcourt : Of course, Sir, I bow absolutely to your ruling. If you rule that the noble lord's speech at Belfast The Speaker : The right honourable gentleman is now arguing with the Chair. I have already given my opinion, and I expect the right honourable gentleman to accept it. \u2014 Sir W. Harcourt said he would bow absolutely to the Speaker's riding He understood it to be that he could not refer to the speech of the noble lord. \u2014 The Speaker : What I did say was, it appeared to me that a history of the Orange Society was superfluous in a debate on the amendment now before the House. \u2014 Sir W. Harcourt then concluded by asking for an expression of the views of the Government especially with reference to the possession of arms by the people of Belfast. The \" Round Table Conference.\"\u2014 Sir William Harcourt, when addressing his constituents at Derby, Feb. 27, 1S8S, thus alluded to this conference, which was held at his London residence early in 1887, and had for its object the possible reunion of the divided chiefs of the former Liberal party. He said: \"The origin of the Round Table Conference might be simply told. On the resignation of Lord Ran dolph Churchill in the year 1886, Mr. Chamberlain made a speech at Birmingham couched in so conciliatory a tone that, taking advantage of their personal friendship, he (Sir WiUiam Harcourt) wrote to him"], [483, "SIR WILLIAM VERNON HARCOURT. 463 expressing his satisfaction thereat, and bis sincere desire to co-operate with him in any attempt which might lead to the reunion of the Liberal party. He received from Mr. Chamberlain a letter cordiaUy responding to his sentiment. It was understood that there should be a conference to ascertain what common grounds existed between the two sections of the Liberal party, and to reduce any points of difference to a minimum. It was finally settled that Lord Herschell, Mr. John Morley, and himself should represent the Liberal party in the conference, and Mr. Chamberlain and Sir George Trevelyan should represent the dissentients ; and aU the transactions of the conference were to be strictly secret, subject to com munications to Mr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington. At the conference Mr. Chamberlain proposed an elaborate and ingenious plan for land purchase iu Ireland ; but it involved too much detail to be f uUy discussed on the spot, and it was referred for further examination to Lord Herschell aud Mr. Morley. When the conference closed, no conclusion had been reached on this matter, though it was his impression that Mr. Gladstone, before whom the plan was ultimately brought, was not unfavourable to its principle. They then came to that which constituted the principal subject of the discussions of the conference, namely, the establishment of an Irish Legislature. The difficulties of this subject were recognised on all hands, and the matter was postponed for further consideration. There were two hard nuts to crack; first, the presence of the Irish members at Westminster ; and secondly, the great Ulster stumbling-block, which we discussed over and over again. . . WeU, the conference came to an end solely because he (Sir WiUiam) and his coadjutors could not accept the position that Mr. Chamberlain should, in spite of repeated remon strances, continue vehement attacks upou Mr. Gladstone, while conducting a friendly negotiation for tho accommodation of their differences.\" \u2014 Mr. Chamberlain took up the subject the foUowing evening in the House of Commons, and remarked : \" His right honourable friend Sir William Harcourt had said he had taken his own course. That would necessitate his (Mr. Chamberlain's) taking his own course. One thing was absolutely beyond dispute, and that was that at the conference they were, if not in entire agreement, at least in sight of one a lother. Were they still within sight of one another ? (ParneUite cries of ' No.') Oh ! they had changed their minds. Well, who were the real leaders of the party? (Ministerial cheers.) That might be the difficulty.\" Later on Mr. Chamberlain entered more fuUy into the subject in a speech at Plymouth, and said : \" Perhaps you will be anxious to know why, if we were thus agreed, the negotiations which promised so well were broken off. Well, iu my opinion, they were broken off because there was a power behind the Liberal leaders which they did not dare to face. The party which has come to be known as the new Radical party was furious at the idea of reunion. They do not want the Liberal Unionists to be brought back, \u2022knowing, as they do, it would reduce them to their former state of insignificance. I protest against the arrangement to which Sir William Harcourt has submitted, of giving way and aUowing the tail to wag the dog.\""], [484, "464 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. The Tail and the Dog. \u2014 In the debate on the second reading of the Local Government BiU (April 20, 1888), referring to these observations by Mr Chamberlain, Sir W. Harcourt said : \" We have heard before of Liberal Unionists meeting in Devonshire House* to teU the Government what to do when bills were introduced ; but for the Radicals to meet in the National Liberal Club \u2014 that is a terrible thing indeed ; it is a thing which ought not to be permitted ; and so he said, in original and elegant language, ' The tail wags the dog.' Yes ; but if it happens to be a high-bred taU from Devonshire House, there is no objection at all on the part of the dog (laughter) ; that is aU right ; but as for the Radical tail \u2014 a low Radical taU \u2014 that is most deplorable. Yet I do remember that in the days of old, in the golden age of ParUamentary life, there was a tail, a Radical taU, below the gangway, which used very rudely to wag the dog upon these benches. That poor dog was my noble friend the member for Rossendale (Lord Hartington). Then he was declared to be deposed ; he was told that he was ' the late leader ; ' and yet we are reminded of the tail wagging the dog. What have the poor Radicals done ? They have demanded that there should be a fuU discussion of the bill.\" GEORGE JOACHIM GOSCHEN. (1831.) Transferred from Commerce. \u2014 Mr. George Joachim Goschen, after taking a first class in classics at Oxford, joined the mercantUe house of Fruhling and Goschen, in the City of London. He was returned as one of the members for the City in May, 1863, and held this seat until 1880, when he retired to Ripon. In the RusseU Administration of 1865, his knowledge of business affairs led him to be appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade, when he left commercial pursuits ; and he was made ChanceUor of the Duchy of Lancaster shortly after. On the formation of a Ministry by Mr. Gladstone in 1868, he became President of the Poor Law Board ; and he was First Lord of the Admiralty from March, 1871, to February, 1874. From May, 1880, to April, 1881, he was engaged on a special mission to Constantinople. GraduaUy holding aloof from the Radical section of the Liberal party, he resigned membership of the Reform Club in 1884. Prior to this, he was offered nomination as Speaker of the House of Commons in succession to Sir Henry Brand. After the resignation of Lord Randolph ChurchiU in 1886, Mr. Goschen was invited by Lord Salisbury to join his Ministry, and did so as Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the full assent of his Liberal-Unionist colleagues. His operations for the Conversion and Redemption of tho National Debt (18S8-89), and the reduction of the Funds to a new deno. mination currently known as \" Goschens,\" will be weU remembered. Steering Straight. \u2014 In addressing his constituents at Ripon in January, 1883, Mr. Goschen referred to an incident in the Egyptian war a few months previously, and pointed from it a moral applicable to men * Lord Hartington's town residence."], [485, "GEORGE JOACHIM GOSCHEN. 4g5 engaged in public life. He said: \"There was a gallant young naval officer, ( 'ommander Rawson, who was appointed by Lord Wolseley to guide the Highland Brigade in that dark night by the light of the stars. Commander Rawson brought the brigade to the point, the action com menced, and Rawson fell mortally wounded. The news was brought to Sir Garnet Wolseley on the battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir, and in the very flush of victory. He had time, nevertheless, to think of his wounded friend, and he galloped off the field to see Commander Rawson, and bid him farewell. And what were the words with which the wounded man received him? 'General,' he said, 'did I not lead them straight?' There you have the spirit of the English naval officer. Could any statesman at the close of his career wish to utter prouder words to his countrymen than ' Did I not lead them straight ? ' . . No greater revolution was introduced into navigation when sail power was given up and steam power was introduced, than the revolution which is going on in political life, now that the strong powers of popular forces have been substituted for the less powerful forces that wielded the destinies of this empire years ago. The ship of the State now is being driven through the water at au increased speed, by more powerful engines and more scientific machinery; aud more nerve and science are required now than before. But there are guides on high. There are the bright and fixed stars of courage, principle, self-sacrifice, and duty. Let the pilots of the State fix their eyes on these, provided they steer an undeviating course. Happy will they be if, when their end comes, they are able to exclaim to their fellow-countrymen, in words like those of the dying commander, ' Have we not steered you straight ?'\" Political \" Blank Cheques.\" \u2014 In the debate on a proposed vote of censure on Mr. Gladstone's Government respecting the affairs of Egypt in 1884, Mr. Goschen said : \" I am asked to have the courage of my opinions, and vote to-night against her Majesty's Government because I do not agree with them on some points. I have the courage of my opinions, but I have not the temerity to give that political blank cheque to Lord Salisbury. The Government have declared a policy which is disinterested, and Europe believes it. (Ironical Opposition cheers.) You do not wish to believe it, and it is for that reason that it would be impossible for me to support any motion coming from that side of the House. It would be a calamity now, after what has taken place, that the present Government should be replaced by another not bound by those pledges to Europe which I have described. Europe blames her Majesty's Government because they are not doing enough j and I say better a thousand times that, than, when engaged in this fearfuUy compli cated programme, three or four European countries should intrigue against us for trying to establish a protectorate over Egypt. I care as much as any man that this country should maintain its reputation for courage, strength, resolution, and power, but I care no less that we should maintain our reputation for good faith and for abiding by pledges, and that neither the hope of profit nor the fear of difficulties should persuade us to abandon those pledges. By those pledges her Majesty's H H"], [486, "466 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Government will stand, and I shaU stand by her Majesty's Govern ment.\" Distribution of Power.\u2014 The Centre of Gravity.\u2014 In the debate on the introduction of the Representation of the People BiU in 1884,* Mr. Goschen made the following remarks : \" The Prime Minister (Mr. Gladstone) said, in 1866, that, 'on the general ground of political prudeuce, it was not well to make sudden and extensive changes in the depositaries of political power.' Well, in 1867, 900,000 voters were added to the register, as the result of the competition of rival practitioners ; but now they were asked to add 1,300,000 electors in England and Wales, in addition to these 900,000. He must apologise to his right honourable friend (Mr. Gladstone) if he retained some of his doctrine on that subject, but it stdl seemed to him a question of political expediency whether it was wise to make, without due precautions, this great change in the ' depositaries of political power.' What he wished to caU the attention of the House and the country to was this \u2014 that, if they put the additions of 1867 and the present proposed additions together, the new constituency emanci pated under these two bills would be larger than the whole of the con stituency which existed before 1867. That was to say, in these two Reform Bills they would have taken the power away from the classes who previously enjoyed it, and placed an absolute majority in the hands of the new electors, to whom would be committed the future destinies of the country. He hoped there were members on both sides of the House who would still contend that arrangements must be made so that the rights of minorities should be guaranteed. This was a question which must be faced with the utmost determination by the Government, for upou it the true representation of the country in the future must depend.\" Mr. Goschen thus concluded his speech : \" The Prime Minister had spoken of ' deck cargo, which might lead to the foundering of the ship.' Another right honourable gentleman took up the simile, and spoke of the stowing of the cargo. He would continue the simile. When he was at the Admiralty, one of the first lessons he learned was that when there was a fresh distribution of weights in a ship which was being rebuilt, it was tho paramount duty of those who were responsible for her safety, when sent to sea, to calculate afresh the centre of gravity, and the angle of vanishing stabUity. Gigantic new engines were now being put into the old hull of the British Constitution. He believed that the hull was strong enough to bear them, for of stouter and more seasoned stuff had never craft been built. But those who would be responsible for the seaworthiness of the reconstructed ship would, it appeared to him, be reckless if, before they sent her to face the perils of the sea, they had not made themselves absolutely sure that no change in the weights had shifted dangerously the centre of gravity, and that she would stiU possess a sufficient reserve of stability to prevent her heeling over to the angle of danger under any pressure of wind or wave.\" An English Democracy. \u2014 At a meeting of his constituents at * See p. 63, &c."], [487, "GEORGE JOACHIM GOSCHEN. 467 Ripon in January, 1884, Mr. Goschen made a speech on current poUtics, and, in concluding, thus alluded to the prospects of the future : \" The time draws nearer and nearer when popular forces, unhampered by con stitutional checks, wiU have more and more free play. When English democracy asserts its victory, becomes conscious of its power and anxious to use it, I trust it wiU never forget that it is English\u2014 that it has an inheritance of English traditions, and remains the guardian of English principles. It wiU remain English if it resists the taint of cosmopolitan heresies, if it is deaf to incitements to class hatreds, if it is sceptical as to the Utopias of impracticable dreamers. It will be English if it keeps its faith in self-reliance and independence; if it does not believe that the Executive can play the part of Providence to the people; if it combines zeal in social reform with watchfulness over the rights of individuals ; if in finance it refrains from the reckless bribery of localities and classes by Government expenditure, and equally from the destructive policy of starving the necessary public services. It wUl be English if it is equaUy slow to be disheartened by disaster as to lose its head over a first success ; if it does not denounce its favourite aim when the biU has to be paid ; if it does not throw up pledges and principles the moment a task looks less easy than it was thought. It wiU be English if it is sensitive to national honour without being greedy of national gain. But, above aU, the democracy of the future will continue to have a peculiarly English character if it takes for its motto \u2014 to govern it in aU times, in the exuberance of its might as well as under the exasperation of difficulty or opposition \u2014 a phrase to be found only in our Saxon tongue, almost untranslatable into a foreign idiom, yet written in the heart of every one of us and honoured by child and man \u2014 the honest, homely, English phrase, ' Fair play aU round.' \" The Nation's Reserve of Power. \u2014 In an address delivered at the invitation of some of the electors of Edinburgh, in January, 1885, Mr. Goschen said : \" The Redistribution Bill is as good as settled, and, though I have not agreed with my party upon this group of subjects, yet now I say this\u2014 that I wiU do as much as in one man's power lies to falsify my own misgivings, and I shaU look accomphshed facts boldly and cheerfully in the face. There is only one remark that I wish to make upon the mode in which the Redistribution BUI has been carried, and upon the extraordinary rapidity with which its details are being worked out. To what is this due ? Is it due to the fact that the two great parties in the State seem to have agreed upon the principles, and are both anxious that this BiU should come into force as soon as possible ; and so you see the rapidity with which all the details are being carried out now. Not long ago Europe thought that Great Britain was about to pass through an ordeal under which her traditional love of order and compromise would break down. But no ; British common sense triumphed in the end, and now, instead of having indignation meetings, culminating in riots, we have Boundary Commissioners settUng areas of poUtical con stituencies with as little difficulty and with as little opposition as if they were poor-law officers settUng the boundaries of a parish. What a H H 2"], [488, "458 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. contrast to the way in which public business generally progresses ! See \u2014and I wish the country to note this fact\u2014 see what a reserve of power we possess for speedy action and for effective action when the nation is determined that its will shaU be done. That is a reserve of power that may stand us in good stead in some hour of emergency. It might help us in foreign troubles. Suspend the action of party for a time, and foreign nations would note and marvel when they saw with what rapidity, with what decision, with what steadfastness, and with what unanimity the voice of Great Britain and Ireland would speak.\" \" After All.\" \u2014 Some remarks, which were taken up at the time as a catchword, were made by Mr. Goschen at the Literary Institute, Edinburgh, Feb. 3, 1885 : \" Here I will say that I have frequently noticed a phrase that I detest, and against which I once before took the opportunity of making a public protest. The phrase is this \u2014 ' After aU.' I will show you how it is used. People say, 'Ah! Egypt is indispensable to the supremacy of England. Egypt is the high road to India ; we must defend it at aU costs. The British supremacy must be maintained iu Egypt.' Difficulties arise \u2014 very great difficulties \u2014 and you find a number of men going about saying, ' After all, is Egypt so very important to us ? After all, have we not been too hasty in our views with regard to Egypt ? On the whole, we think we might give it up.' I do not object to the word ; but I am objecting to the change of front under difficulty and under disaster. It is perfectly arguable whether we should do such and such a thing. It is not arguable, after having maintained any view, when troubles occur, whether we should turn from it. It is perfectly arguable that we should never again annex the Transvaal; but is it arguable, after having undertaken to back up the subject races, to say ' after all ? ' Surely I think we might be quite agreed upon this \u2014 that, whatever our politics are, that which we agree to we had better stick to. I have no particular set of men in view. I have known men who began that question in the year 1865, when Lord Palmerston had come down to the House of Commons and stated that if Denmark should go to war with Germany she would find herself not standing alone. It happened that it made a great impression upon my youthful enthusiasm At that time. A great many members of Parliament came and said, ' WeU, after all, what have we got to do with Denmark ? ' It is a word that may lead to much mischief in onr political life ; it has led to much mischief. What does it mean, ' After aU ? ' If it were defined in a dictionary, it would be said to be ' A word used occasionally by timid people when they wish to back out from a position which they have taken up.' But I trust that in future political dictionaries we shall find when we open them at that phrase, ' An expression once current, but which has become obsolete, and is no longer considered good British style.' \" \" Breakages of Civilisation.\" \u2014 In a speech at Edinburgh in October, 1885, Mr. Goschen said : \" It was my fate at one time to be President of the Poor Law Board, and I made it my business then to examine and to probe to the bottom, as far as I could, this most sorrowful"], [489, "GEORGE JOACHIM GOSCHEN. 469 -subject of pauperism, and to gauge its causes and to look into its extent Well, it is frequently put as if, were you to speak of there being three- quarters of a million or a million of paupers, there were so many men or women out of work\u2014 as if they were men and women who ought to be employed, but who unfortunately cannot get employment\u2014 and the want of this employment is laid at the door of some blots on our social system. I do not know how it is here, but I can tell you that there are workhouses in this country containing one thousand or two thousand inmates, in which there are not forty able-bodied men or women, in which there are not a hundred, who come from what may be caUed the working classes of this country. It is not the working men from the towns, whether they are in employment or out of employment, who fiU our workhouses aud who swell these fearful rolls of pauperism. (A voice \u2014 ' Who are they ? ') I will tell you. They are, if I may use so sad a word, in London the breakages -of civilisation. They are men with broken hearts and broken fortunes, coming from all classes of society. It is the waifs and strays of a vast- metropolis that are there gathered together. And so it goes through the country.\" Ciceros and Catilines. \u2014 Mr. Goschen made the following remarks when responding to the toast of the \" House of Commons,\" at a banquet to Ministers at the Mansion House in August, 1887 : \" You do not know the number of muzzled Ciceros who are sitting in the House of Commons \u2014 men who have come fresh from the constituencies, conscious of their power, anxious to render service to the State, but whom the exio-encies of the session have condemned to a silence painful to themselves, but which has nevertheless been a sacrifice patriotically made in the interest of the country. It is very possible that the Ciceros have said to themselves that the Catilines have had too good a time of it. There is a new custom in the House of Commons, of asking questions with regard to speeches made out of the House ; and it is possible that I shall be asked whom I meant when I spoke of there being Catilines possibly in the House of Commons. I should refuse to answer \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but I shaU say this that if there were Catilines in the House of Commons, I know precisely the place which they would occupy on the benches of the house. (Cheers.) I say that if there has been garrulity, and if certain sections of the House of Commons have absorbed time which was quite out of proportion to their own influence, and to the fair share of time which ouo-ht to have fallen to their lot, there nevertheless has been in many parts of the house conduct which would commeud itself to the general sense of the country, as indicating as profound a patriotism as has ever animated any previous House of Commons.\" The House of Commons a \"Public Meeting.\" \u2014 In the debate on the Address, Feb. 17, 1888, the ChanceUor of the Exchequer (Mr. Goschen) was speaking, but had delivered only a few sentences when some members rushed into the house announcing the result of a South wark election. The Irish members thereupon rose iu their places, cheering vigorously for some minutes, and waving their hats. There were cries of \" The flowing tide !\" and \" Remember Southwark! \" The right honourable"], [490, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 470 gentleman, after a long interval, said: \"He presumed be had to con gratulate honourable members upon a piece of news which would console them to some degree for the diminution of their majority at Dundee. The whole traditions of that House had changed. Everything had been so entirely changed that they were more like being in a public meeting than in the House of Commons.\" Necessity Forbidding Repeal. \u2014 Mr. Goschen thus enforced this idea at a Unionist meeting in the Northampton Corn Exchange, May 14, 1890 : \" If we were free, as we never shaU be free, from obligations of honour and duty, nevertheless, as a matter of defence, as a matter which we owe to the many millions of our countrymen, we should have to say that Ireland, the outpost of the Atlantic ; Ireland, linked geographicaUy to this country as it is; Ireland, with its history and geography and its physical position, should never, and can never, be put under any other Executive Government or any other Legislative Assembly than that which is the Executive Government of our United Kingdom, the Legis lature of Great Britain and Ireland. Sir Robert Peel, the first master of Mr. Gladstone, used splendid and eloquent words in respect to Irish disintegration. He said, ' Physical necessity forbids repeal. Look at your map, look at your history, look at the conditions of your existence, and you will find that necessity forbids repeal.' We are not prepared to set up in Ireland an Executive Government for the actions of which we should be responsible to foreign nations, but over which actions we should have no control. We are not prepared to put Ireland into hands that might at some moment be unfriendly to this Empire. Looking to that stern necessity which no change in sentiment and no change in modern' times has been able to overcome \u2014 looking to that, I tell you there is an obligation upon us to see that Ireland shaU remain in the hands, not of England, but of the people of Great Britain and Ireland. I want you to know to the fuU that we should be weaker as a great Power, that we might become a fourth-rate European Power, if we so weakened ourselves, if we were to give up what is one of the points of vantage for any enemy that might hold Ireland. Onr opponents would admit a great deal of that argument, but they would say, ' If you wiU but give to Ireland self government and Home Rule, then you would find that Ireland would love you to such a degree that you might safely confide the fortunes of this country to her.' History shows the contrary.\" JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN. (1836.) A Step into the Cabinet.\u2014 The Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain unsuccessfuUy contested the Parliamentary representation of Sheffield in 1874, but in June, 1876, he was returned for Birmingham as one of the coUeagues of Mr Bright. He had performed the duties of mayor of the town on several occasions. On the formation of Mr. Gladstone's second Ministry in 1880 he was appointed President of the Board of Trade, with a seat in the Cabinet. Mr. Chamberlain had so closely identified"], [491, "JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN. 471 himself with the extreme Radical party, that some surprise was expressed at this appointment ; but it was understood to be owing in great measure to his energetic services in promoting, by the establishment of \"the caucus\" and otherwise, the interests of the Liberal party, and their return to power at the general election of 1880. A Successful Manufacturer.\u2014 Mr. Chamberlain thus alluded to his own antecedents, at an election meeting in his candidature for West Birmingham, in November, 1885. He said his opponent wanted to put a tax on leather. He (Mr. Chamberlain) knew something about leather. His father and great grandfather for 120 years carried on a business connected with the leather trade in London; they were wholesale boot and shoe manufacturers. These Tories thought .they said something clever when they said that he was a screw maker. WeU, he was proud of having been a successful screw maker, and having given employment to thousands of people ; and he thought that was a much more satisfactory position to fill than that of a broken down landlord, or an unsuccessful farmer. But these people did not know, perhaps, that before he was a screw maker he was a shoemaker. He was a shoemaker for two years, and he knew something about the trade, for, like his opponent (a Mr. Dumphreys) he could say that he had worked at the bench, although, unlike him, he had not got any \" corns on his hands.\" \" Toil Not,\" &c. \u2014 Mr. Chamberlain spoke, at a meeting at Birmingham in March, 1883, of the House of Lords as composed of a class \" who toU not, neither do they spin.\" The remark was frequently commented upon in the discussions which ensued on the Franchise question, and the existence of an hereditary chamber. One member of the opposite party, with family connections in the Upper House (Lord George Hamilton), observed, ironicaUy, that Mr. Chamberlain had probably intended his quotation as a compliment, inasmuch as he had, by inference, compared the House of Lords to \" the lilies of the field.\" The Pupil Beyond the Master. \u2014 In January, 1884, Mr Bright and Mr. Chamberlain attended a meeting of the \" Forward Liberal Club \" in the Birmingham Town Hall, and Mr. Bright gave a political address, in the course of which he remarked : \" I presume it wiU not be beyond my duty to say that I think there is a going forward which is sometimes unreasonably fast, and that there is a going forward which is steady and wise, and wholly satisfactory in its results.\" Mr. Chamberlain, who followed him, took up these words, and, in some measure, administered a rebuke to his past leader and guide. He observed: \"My right honourable friend who preceded me said, with somo humour, that if our opponents were to establish a club they shoidd caU it the ' StandstiU' club ; and he went on to say that he was an advocate of steady progress. I am afraid there was a time when his enemies would not have accepted that view of his character. But I am reminded of the retort which was given with respect to an agricultural labourer, concerning whom his new master inquired of his old one whether he was a steady man. ' Steady ! H he were only a little steadier he would stand stiU.' I beUeve Mr. Bright and myself agree on this point, as we usuaUy do on most other"], [492, "472 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. questions. I also am in favour of steady progress, providing that it does not mean standing still. Provided that we are advancing, I am not at all anxious to hurry the pace to such an extent that we should put any of our opponents out of breath.\" The \" March to London \" Speech. \u2014 At a meeting in Bingley Hall in 1884, to protest against the action of the House of Lords upon the Franchise Bill, Mr Chamberlain acknowledged, \" on behalf of the Government,\" a resolution approving the Ministerial policy in the matter, and went on to say : \" I doubt the wisdom, and I doubt the prudence, of the insults which the Tory leaders are lavishing upon the expression of popular opinion which their action has caUed forth. I wonder what proof of earnestness they desire to provoke. The opinion of the streets has had a mighty force in our political history. It has shaken monarchs on then thrones. It has overturned Ministers. In 1832 it carried the Reform BiU in the teeth of a House of Lords more powerful than that with which we have to deal, but after a conflict which had brought the country almost to the verge of revolution. We read that at that time there were 100,000 men in Birmingham and the surrounding district, who were sworn to march on London if need were, in defence of their liberties. The peace was broken in many parts of the country. We had hoped that we had left those days of disorder far behind us ; but there are stiU evU councUlors provoking and slandering the people, who are straining their privileges to the uttermost, and who obstinately resist the extension of popular liberties. Let them take heed. If we are commencing this great conflict with temper and moderation, it would be a mistake to suppose that we are less earnest or less resolute than our forefathers. We are grateful for the rights which they have won for us ; we are true to the traditions which they have left us. The love of freedom and a sense of justice are not extinct among us, and we will carry on and we wiU complete the work which they so weU began.\" He also said : \" It is not necessary, and it may not be expedient, that a member of the Govern ment should offer any opinion upon proposals which are rife in many quarters for ' mending or ending ' tbe House of Lords.* It is the less necessary in my case, because on many past occasions I have expressed my own opinion on the subject. The ' divine right of kings ' \u2014 that was a dangerous delusion ; but the divine right of peers is a ridiculous fiction ; and we, who boast our freedom and are proud of our liberties, who claim that England is the chosen home of a self-governed people \u2014 we will never be the only race in the civilised world subservient to the insolent pretensions of an hereditary caste.\" This speech, with others of similar character, were the subject of comment in both Houses on the reassembling of Parliament. Lord Randolph Churchill (Oct. 30, 1884) brought forward an amendment censuring Mr. Chamberlain, as a Minister of the Crown, for having uttered these and similar remarks. Mr. Gladstone replied, defending his colleague, and the amendment was negatived by 214 to 178. * A phrase previously used by Mr. John Morley in a speech at St. James's Hall."], [493, "JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN. 473 Mr, Chamberlain and Lord Salisbury. \u2014 At a meeting at Hanley, Oct. 7, 1884, Mr. Chamberlain said, with respect to such gatherings as the Franchise demonstration in London, \" These meetings cost time and labour ; and what compensation were they to receive from the peers ? \u2014 for the vanquished nowadays paid an indemnity. . . I think these gentlemen presume on your love of order and hatred of violence. These are, no doubt, characteristics of the English people ; but, unless this generation has lost other qualities which have made the name of Englishmen respected aud honoured throughout the world, they will show courage and resolution,\" &c. These remarks were taken up a few days after by Lord Salisbury, in a speech at Kelso. He observed : \" If these words have any meaning, they say to the English people that if they stiU possess the courage and resolution of their race, they wiU part with that love of order and that hatred of violence which they have hitherto displayed. I only hope that, if Mr. Chamberlain incites the people to riot, he will head the riot himself. I hope that if he is going, according to his threat, to march on London from Birmingham, we may see him at the head of the advancing column. My impression is that those who wiU have to receive him wiU be able to give a very good account of him, and that Mr. Chamberlain will return from his adventure with a broken head, if nothing worse.\" The rejoinder was thus given by Mr. Chamberlain at a meeting in Montgomeryshire : \" He was not afraid of Lord Salisbury, nor of his retainers, and he would accept his challenge on one condition \u2014 that if his constituents should do again what they were prepared to do in 1832, and should march to London to lay their grievances at the foot of tho throne, Lord Salisbury would himself lead the column which was to withstand them. In that case, if his head was broken, it would be broken in very good company.\" The speeches made by the President of the Hoard of Trade in the provinces were commented upon by Lord Salisbury iu the House of Lords at tho reopening of the session, when he \" called Attention \" to certain expressions used by a responsible Minister of the country. \" Shoulder to Shoulder.\"\u2014 In contrast with the above passages, during the heated conflict of 1884, is to be noted the change brought about by the political vicissitudes of the next few years, and the consequent reversal of party relations. At a gathering of Unionists in Birmingham, November 25, 1891, Lord Salisbury being present, Mr. Chamberlain thus alluded to the recent divisions between sections of the Liberal party: \" Even after the rupture had taken place, there were many of us\u2014 I was one of them\u2014 who hoped that it would be only temporary ; who believed that the Gladstonians would speedily abandon the path on which we knew, and they had good cause of knowing, that they had most reluctantly entered; and we looked forward, therefore, to a speedy reunion. If I refer to that now, it is to say that since then the gulf has widened and deepened. Now I neither look for nor desire reunion. (Great cheering.) The Gladstonians have accepted the policy of the Parnellites. Yes, but they have accepted something more ; they have accepted their principles, their methods, and even their manners. Meanwhile the branches of the"], [494, "474 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Unionist party have been brought into closer and more cordial relations. Confidence has been created, prejudice has been removed. For the last five years we have fought under the same flag together, we have won victories together, we have suffered reverses together ; and now I say we are determined, whatever may be the vicissitudes of the protracted struggle iu which we are engaged, we are determined to march shoulder to shoulder until our object has been attained, and until we have finally defeated the vile conspiracy with which the integrity of the Empire has been threatened. Last night, and again this afternoon, Lord Salisbury has spoken with a generosity which I desire to recognise of the loyal support which has been given to his Government by the Liberal Unionists, It is my duty to acknowledge to what an extent our way has been made smooth for us by the personal influence of Lord Salisbury, and by the patriotism of his friends. In 1886 it seemed probable that, although we were agreed in resisting the repeal of the Union, we might fail to find a common ground in foreign policy, and, above all, in domestic constructive legislation. The Gladstonians counted upon our disagreement, and were confident that the alliance woidd come to a speedy end. That they have been completely disappointed is due to the prudence, the wisdom, and, if I may say so, the liberality, in its best sense, of the policy of the Government.\" Ransom, &c. \u2014 At a dinner of the Eighty Club * in Westminster, in April, 1S85, Mr. Chamberlain thus explained certain expressions used by him in previous speeches. Replying to a vote of thanks proposed by Mr. Raleigh, he observed that gentleman \" said he was in doubt as to the definition I would give of two expressions which have appeared in my speeches, and have been the subject of a good deal of criticism. He wants to know what I mean by ' natural rights.' I thought I had sufficiently defined it. I hold that every man who comes into the world has a natural right to life, and a fair enjoyment of life ; and that is a right you ought to secure by law. And if you do not hold that view, if you think it is Utopian, then you ought to cany your principles out, adopt the Chinese view, and poison children when they come into the world, without giving them any chance of life. Then Mr. Raleigh wants to know what I mean by the word ' ransom.' I dare say he knows his Bible, and I think he wiU agree with me that the word is used in Scriptural phraseology again and again, as the compensation which a man has to pay for wrong-doing, before he can be received into the congrega tion ; and I teU you that society owes a compensation to the poorer classes of this country ; that it ought to recognise that claim, and pay it, and that society must pay it before it can be admitted to have discharged its obligations. That is the sense in which I have used these words.\" Looking Forward. \u2014 In a speech at Hull on the 5th of August, 1885, Mr. Chamberlain thus expressed himself both as regards the past and the future : \" In the Liberal army there must be pioneers to clear the * A club so called to commemorate the victory of the Liberal party, and its return to power under Mr. Gladstone, in 1880."], [495, "JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN. 475 way, and there must be men who watch the rearguard. Some may always be in advance, others may occasionally lag behind ; but the only thing we have a right to demand is that no one shall stand stiU. I do not conceal from you my own opinion that the pace wiU be a little faster in the future than in the past. Everywhere in the country I see a quickening of the political life. Everywhere there is discussion and hope and expectation. It will be dangerous to disappoint that hope. . . Although, in the speeches I have recently made, I have disclaimed any right to speak for the party as a whole, I have been soundly rated for my presumption in daring to speak at all, and I have been solemnly excommunicated by some of the great authorities who claim a monopoly of the orthodox Liberal faith and doctrine.* I am not discouraged. I am not repentant. I am told that if I pursue this course I shall break up the party, and that I shaU altogether destroy any chance I might otherwise have had of office. Do not believe it. But, if it were true, I say that I care little for party and nothing at aU for office, except so far as these things may be made iustrumental in promoting the objects which I publicly avowed when I first entered Parliament, and which I will prosecute as long as I remain in it. I had looked forward with hope to the future, but I had not supposed in my time so great a change could have been successfully effected; but now my wildest expectations have been surpassed. I am not willing to be silent as to the uses to which I believe the people ought to put the new power and the privileges which have been conferred upon them. I have always had a deep conviction that, when the people came to govern themselves, and when the clamour of vested interests and class privileges was overborne by the powerful voice of tho whole nation, that then the social evils which disgrace our civilisa tion, and the wrongs which have cried vainly for redress, would at last find a hearing and a remedy. This is a critical time ; it is the turning point in our political history ; aud if the people are content with the old formulas and watchwords, the enfranchisement of two miUions of men will have been a barren and an unprofitable business.\" A Fertile Soil, \u2014 The following remarks were made by Mr. Chamberlain at a banquet in Hiril, Aug. 6, 1885: \"To me it is most satisfactory to find the way in which education is advancing among the Tory party. It is said that imitation is the sincerest flattery, and I am greatly flattered to see that a great and important section of that party has received and even outbid the policy which I have laid before the country. It is perfectly incomprehensible to me how it is possible that the moderate Liberals can find any relief at aU, when they leave the Liberal party to join that of which Lord Randolph Churchill is one of the principals. ' Oh,' it is said, ' Lord Randolph ChurchUl is an exception, and he wiU not be able to carry his party with him.' Well, up to the present time I do not see any diminution in his influence. I remember reading a story not long ago\u2014 an American story \u2014 which told you how a \u2022These references were more particularly to speeches made by the Duke of Argyll and Mr. Goschen."], [496, "476 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. land agent was praising the character and qualities of the estate which he had to seU. It was the most extraordinarily productive estate in the whole world. A sceptic who was present said, ' Pray, Mr Agent, is there anything your estate won't grow p ' ' Yes,' said the man, ' pumpkins ; it won't grow pumpkins.' ' Why not ? ' said the inquirer. ' Well,' said the agent, ' you see the soU is so rich, the vines grow so quickly, that they drag the pumpkins along with them and wear them out.' WeU, the vine is dragging the pumpkins along the ground in the Tory party, and the democratic growth is wearing out the old Tory principles and traditions.\" No Finality. \u2014 Mr. Chamberlain made a series of political speeches in Scotland in the autumn of 1885, and in one of them (at Callander) he declared : \" A new chapter has been opened in the political history of our \u2022country; for nothing could be more fooUsh than to imagine that there is any finality with regard to Liberal progress. Time woidd not permit me now to speak at length upon the future, but there is one thing which wiU form the principal part in the work of legislation, and which deeply concerns the interests of the country population, and that is the universal extension of local government. Local government is more important to the happiness of the people than even imperial administration. It is closer to them ; it concerns more directly their domestic life and social condition than anything we can do in the Parliament at Westminster. Hitherto in Scotland, and iu England unfortunately, local government of the country has been very much an affair of privileged individuals and classes. Now it wiU be our business to make it a real Government by and for the people. We must see that those who have been found worthy to take their part in the administration of a great empire shall have confided to them the fuU and entire control of their local affairs.\" A National Party. \u2014 Mr. Chamberlain thus spoke at an enter tainment given to him by the Bradford Liberal Unionist Association, Sept. 20, 1888, after the great break in the Liberal party which Mr. Morley described as its \"pulverisation\" (p. 495): \"It is not desirable that the Liberal Unionist party should be absolutely identified and con founded with the Conservative party. It is desirable to maintain a distinction. So long as this great Irish danger is upon us, we are Unionists first of aU, and we are Liberals and Conservatives secondly ; but at the same time we remain respectively Liberals and Conservatives. It is not desirable, I think, that we should fight otherwise than as loyal aUies, and our Conservative friends must bear that in mind, and must be prepared to make some concessions to us, as we must be prepared to make some concessions to them. Something of this mutual concession ought to govern our relations with Conservatives locally, as they have governed, and governed successfully, our relations with the Conservative leaders. (Cheers.) I do not doubt that we, each in his own way and in his own place, will be able to secure this result, and that in that way we may, perhaps, in the end succeed in raising, out of the clash of parties which has been brought about by the unfortunate action of Mr. Gladstone, a party which is greater than all other parties \u2014 a party of the nation, a"], [497, "JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN. 477 party which shall have national interests, national security, and national faith as the only watchwords to which it owes its existence.\" The People with a big \" P.\"\u2014 In the debate on the Royal grants, July 29, 1889, Mr. Chamberlain opposed the line being taken by some of his closest political connections in former times, and said : \" If you are to measure by other standards, by the greatness and the wealth of the couutry \u2014 if you are to measure by the standard of living which generally prevails ; if you are to measure by comparison with other monarchies \u2014 I say the sum taken by the Queen is reasonable and even moderate. We are told that the people \u2014 the people with a capital P \u2014 think it is exorbitant. We are told this by honourable members who profess on all occasions to speak for the people with a capital P \u2014 who never speak to us on any popular question without giving us to understand that in some special sense they have a mission to represent the people. Sir, I deny their claims. I should like to see their credentials. They represent only a majority, and in some cases it is a very smaU majority, in the con- stitueucies which severally return them to this House. Yes ; they repre- sent something else ; they represent the class jealousies, the petty spite, and the enmities which they do their utmost to stimulate ; they represent the superficial prejudices to which they truckle. An honourable member tells us it is a shameful thing to fawn upon a monarch. So it is ; but it is a much more shameful thing to truckle to a multitude. Let these honourable members dare to tell the whole truth upon this matter to their people. Let them, instead of carping at the expenditure on monarchy which is essential to the maiutenance of the institution, teU the people that if they want a monarchy they must pay for it ; but let them teU also that their object in these endeavours is to belittle tho monarchy, to make it unpopular, and to prepare the way for its destruction. Then we shall see whether the people, of whom we hear so much \u2014 who enjoy at least a measure of political liberty, under all circumstances, which is more democratic than exists in any republic of Europe or the world \u2014 whether the people wiU be willing, when they understand everything, to enter upon a contest which must be prolonged, which must be exasperated; to throw the Constitution iuto the melting pot ; to postpone altogether indefinitely aU hope of practical and material reform, in order to accept the programme of those who call themselves new Radicals \u2014 new, because they have nothing in common with the old Radicals ; who are destructive in their aims and objects ; who have never shown the slightest construc tive capacity ; who are, in short, nothing more nor less than the NihUists of English poUtics.\" There was frequently great interruption in the course of these remarks. The Development of Empire. \u2014 Mr. Chamberlain made the foUowing observations in addressing his constituents at Birmingham, Jan. 23, 1889, and referring to some remarks made a day or two before by Mr. John Morley, respecting the constant growth and expansion of tho British empire : \" In the history of its growth and development Mr. Morley sees nothing to be proud of. He sees only what he caUs, with a flourish of tawdry rhetoric, an ' empire of swagger.' What ! This great"], [498, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 478 dominion, which has sent forth free nations to every comer of the globe\u2014 which holds now under its temperate and orderly sway myriads of men of hostile race, who owe aU their hope of tranquillity and prosperity to the \u25a0continuance of our rule \u2014 which has spread civilisation, which has deve loped commerce till it is competent to support the crowded millions that inhabit this small island, that otherwise would be altogether insufficient to support them ; this great machine of progress, this potent force in the history of the world, to Mr. Morley 's philosophic mind, is only an ' empire of swagger !' \u2014 an empire whose growth he deplores, but which he cannot restrain ! In the seven years during which this great Irish agitation has lasted, and during the latter portion of which Mr. Morley and his friends have been endeavouring to get rid of Ireland, we have added to the dominions of the Queen a population as large as that of Ireland, and an area twenty times as great. He cannot prevent the tree from branching, but he would, if he could, injure the trunk and strike a fatal blow at the root. The issues which you are caUed upon to decide are momentous : they involve the principles of our national existence. Apply the policy which these men advocate in Ireland to the government of our great dependency of India. They seem, from signs which have recently been manifest, not disinclined to do so; and if they succeed, I will venture to predict that in a few years the ordered peace of 250,000,000 ,of our fellow subjects wiU give way to the anarchy of the empire of the Moguls, or to the gospel of plunder that was preached by the Mahratta chieftains. It is not, believe me, a policy of Home Rule alone that we have to resent and to resist \u2014 it is a policy of universal disintegration. I have confidence that the people of this country, when its aim and object are made clear to them \u2014 with their old characteristics, their pride and resolution, and power and stubborn resistance, which has carried them through so many crises and so many dangers \u2014 wiU come out of the .difficulties by which they may now be assailed, and wUl maintain intact and undefiled the splendour of an empire which it has cost much to win, but which is still worthy of aU the sacrifices that its sons may make.\" Home Rule Dead. \u2014 At a dinner given by the Liberal Union Club to Mr. T. W. RusseU, M.P., in June, 1891, Mr. Chamberlain spoke as foUows : \" I said the other day that Home Rule was as dead as Queen Anne. That remark has been the cause of some little misapprehension. It is very hard upon us that we have to find intelligence for our opponents, but I need scarcely point out to you that, although I said Home Rule was .dead, I did not say that the Gladstonians had buried it. (Laughter.) On the contrary, I am perfectly ready to acknowledge that they still carry the corpse in front of their army, just as, in ages long gone by, barbarous nations used to carry the body of some deceased saint or warrior. But they cannot restore the corpse to life. They may, if they please, inscribe the name of Home Rule upon their banners, although, as we have seen, they sometimes drop it out of their programme ; but they are perfectly well aware that Home Rule has ceased to be a question of practical politics. I do not believe for a moment that they are ignorant of the hopelessness of the task which they profess to be able to accomplish.\""], [499, "LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. 479 LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. (1849.) Early Elevation. \u2014 Lord Randolph Henry Churchill is second son of the seventh Duke of Marlborough, who was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the Beaconsfield Administration. He was first returned to the House of Commons for the family borough of Woodstock in 1874, and occupied the seat continuously until 1885, when he was elected for South Paddington. In the same year he had the boldness to contest Mr. Bright's seat for the central division of Birmingham, and actuaUy poUed 4216 votes against the popular tribune's 4989. Ho made himself promi nent, during Mr. Gladstone's second Administration, by frequent attacks and criticisms on the Ministerial policy, and his independent course frequently embarrassed the leaders of his own party, who yet found him, altogether, a most useful auxiliary. He was the leader, also, of the little knot of members, sitting below the gangway on the Conservative side of the house, to whom the name of \" the Fourth Party \" was given.* On the formation of a Government by Lord Salisbury in June, 1885, Lord Randolph was appointed Secretary for India, with a seat in the Cabinet, to which he had attained at the unusually early age of thirty-six. la the following year he became ChanceUor of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons. Rhetoric and Fact. \u2014 On the third reading of the Irish Land Bill (July 29, 1881) Lord Randolph Churchill had proposed an amendment, in a speech to which Mr. Gladstone thus replied : \" I have no intention of offering any detailed reply to tbe speech of the noble lord the member for Woodstock, nor to enter into any detailed discussion of the amendment of which he has given notice. That amendment, in fact, admits of being dealt with, from my point of view, in a very convenient and summary manner. It contains six propositions, some of them negative and some of them affirmative ; and my humble method of disposing of that amendment is this. I will take aU the negative propositions and convert them into affirmatives, and then take all the affirmative propositions and convert them into negatives. By this most expeditious process I find that the amend ment, so modified, becomes an adequate aud satisfactory vehicle of my own creed. The speech of the noble lord does not admit of being dealt with quite so briefly. It was a speech eminently representative of the opinions and methods of the noble lord. It abounded in declamatory invective, of a large portion of which I had the honour and distinctiou of being the object. There are in creation certain small animals whose office it is to bite, which are able to produce a sense of irritation in the victim ; and there are other small animals whose office it is to bite, but who do not even produce in the victim the sensation that he is actually bitten. (Laughter.) I must say, as far as a comparison can be made, that the speech of the noble lord reminds me rather of tho second class of animal \u2022Seep. C3."], [500, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 480 than of the first. One counsel I beg to give to the noble lord, and that is to keep to rhetoric, of which at his time of life he is no inconsiderable master, and, above all things, to eschew fact. If ho does that, I have no doubt he wiU do extremely weU ; for rhetoric and declamation are arts in which it is not difficult to excel, provided you can escape from the fetters and servitude which are imposed upon a man by a rigid adherence to matters of fact.\" Notwithstanding this onslaught, Mr. Gladstone in the foUowing year made a kindly reference to his young antagonist- Lord Randolph had been absent from Parliament for some months on account of ill-health, and on his return, when he resumed his former practice of putting troublesome questions, the Prime Minister, replying to one of them, said he was very glad to see the questioner again in his place. Youth. \u2014 In 1883, when entertained at Edinburgh by the young men of the University Conservative Association, Lord Randolph, in the course of a speech to them, remarked : \" Youth appears on some occasions to excite among those who do not possess it aU the worst passions of human nature. But we may, I think, chase away these somewhat depressing reflections by remembering that youth is a calamity which grows less bitter and less poignant as years go by ; that time is on our side, and that, by the sheer and simple process of living and survival, we too must approach the summit of the waves.\" An Encouragement. \u2014 Early in June, 1885, Lord Randolph Churchill (himself an Oxford man) was invited to Cambridge to preside at a dinner of the University Carlson Club, and, in making the speech of the evening, he said : \" It may not be uninteresting to many of you to know that the Cambridge Carlson had a very remarkable effect on my own political career, whatever it is, and such as it has been. There was a time last year when it happened to me to be engaged in something partaking of the nature of a struggle \u2014 at any rate, in a difference of opinion \u2014 with men of great position, great responsibUity, and great experience, as to the form which modern Conservative political organisa tion ought to take. WeU, that difference of opinion at one time became very sharp, and I did not know what the result of it might be ; and I was getting extremely anxious, more for the sake of the Conservative party than for my own sake. But this matter had attracted a great deal of public attention; and one evening I came home from the House of Commons very anxious and rather discouraged, because at the House of Commons, among people whom I ought to look upon as my poUtical friends, I had met nothing but gloomy looks, and I felt very much inclined to retire from the game, thinking I was doing more harm than good; and rather \u2014 to use a slang expression \u2014 cut the whole concern. However, when I arrived at my house, I found there waiting for me a deputation from the University Carlson \u2014 three gentlemen. They conveyed to me an expression of entire sympathy and agreement from this club with the views which I had then put forth, and they invited me to a banquet to be held in this town under the auspices of this club. I do not think you can imagine the effect that expression of sympathy"], [501, "LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. 481 and that cordial invitation had upon me at the time. Before I received it, I felt that I was very young, very inexperienced, and very much alone, and I did not know to what extent any portion or fraction of public opinion might be with me. But the expression of opinion from your club fiUed me with hopes that, after aU, I was not going so very far wrong ; that I might still persevere a little longer ; and, though I was not able at that time to come to the banquet to which I was invited, stiU I did persevere ; everything came all right, everything settled down, both to the harmony and, I think, to the advantage of the Tory party. That was to my mind, as far as I was concerned, and must always be, a most interesting and memorable incident. It was an encouragement from youth to youth.\" Criticisms as a Free Lance. \u2014 At a meeting at Bow to celebrate an anniversary of the Tower Hamlets Conservative Association (June 3, 1885), Lord Randolph Churchill, in proposing the toast of the evening, made a very characteristic speech. In the course of it he said, alluding to the fact that the meeting wa3 held on the Epsom Derby day : \" I cannot help thinking that the occasion on which we are met is strikingly indicative of the change which has come over the Tory party. I imagine that, a generation ago, the Tory party would to-day have gone to the Derby. But, owing to the exigencies of the time, we have altogether ceased to be a party of pleasure or amusement ; we have become a serious and earnest political party, thoroughly democratic in its nature, and we occupy our selves on this Derby evening by considering the prospects of our party and the condition of our country. I feel little doubt myself that, in contrast with our present occupation, the entire Radical party is at tho present moment returning in a state of more or less exhilaration from Epsom Downs.\" (Laughter.) He went on to criticise the then existing Government, and to say : \" Let me draw your attention to Ireland. How many policies have Mr. Gladstone's Government successively tried in Ireland? Their first policy was that they would, for the government of Ireland, rely upon the good sense and loyalty of the Irish people. Their second policy was to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act. Their third policy was to establish a new tenure of land. Their fourth policy was to arrest Mr. ParneU, and to suppress the Land League. Their fifth policy was to make a treaty with Mr. PameU, and to revive the Land League under the name of the National League. Their sixth poliey was to alter dangerously and prodigiously the criminal procedure in Ireland. Their seventh poUcy was to enfranchise 700,000 of the Irish peasants. Their eighth policy was to abolish the constitutional Uberties of the 700,000 peasants whom they had enfranchised. Their ninth poUcy\u2014 and now I am coming to the time when these policies have not lasted for months, but have only lasted, literally, for hours\u2014 their ninth policy was not to abolish the constitutional liberties of the 700,000 enfranchised peasants, but to grant Home Rule, and to estabUsh a new land law for Ireland. Their tenth policy was that they decide to abolish \u2014 or they are about to decide, perhaps I should be more correct in saying\u2014 the con stitutional liberties of the 700,000 enfranchised peasants for one year more ; that they woidd not at the present moment grant Home Rule, but that i I"], [502, "482 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. they would pretend to try to establish a totaUy new land law for Ireland. Now, these are the ten policies by which in the short space of less than five years her Majesty's Government have attempted to govern Ireland ; aud I defy any single person to make even a speculation as to which of these ten policies the Liberal party will adopt, if you give them a majority at the next election. Well, on the tenth policy \u2014 you recollect what that was ? \u2014 her Majesty's Government are not altogether agreed ; there is a little difference of opinion, and we are informed it is to be settled to-morrow.\" After similar comments on the conduct of the Government in other directions, the speaker asked what was the general result of the ten distinct policies in Ireland, eighteen in Egypt, and nine distinct policies in Central Asia. Large Latitude. \u2014 Shortly after becoming a Cabinet Minister, Lord Randolph, being asked in the House of Commons whether he adhered to certain views on Irish policy which he had expressed in Edinburgh many months before, gave the foUowing rejoinder : \" That speech was made nearly two years ago, and I cannot be perfectly certain as to the accuracy of the report. But I neither withdraw nor apologise for anything I have ever said at any time ; believing, as I do, that everything I have said at any time was perfectly justified by the special circumstances of that time, and by the amount of information which I may have had at that time in my possession.\" (Laughter and cheers.) An Appeal to the Whigs. \u2014 In addressing a Conservative meeting at Sheffield (Sept. 4, 1885), Lord Randolph referred to the tone of speeches made by Lord Hartington and other members of the Liberal party, aud in the course of his observations said : \" I want to know what is the differ ence between an ordinary political speech and an electioneering speech. Lord Hartington is a man of great experience and common sense, and when he says he is going to make a political speech, and not an electioneer ing speech, it is perfectly evident that he is reserving for a future occasion a speech of a totally different tone and quality, and that he wiU reserve controversial topics tiU the general election takes place. What does that mean ? That is called in vulgar language the policy of the ' jumping cat.' . . When I read over that speech, the first question I asked myself was, Why does Lord Hartington oppose Lord Salisbury's Government ? Because there was not a word which showed the faintest shred of differ ence of political principle between Lord Hartington and those who are now responsible Ministers of the Crown. . . I, as one who has recently devoted much study to the subject in common with others, cannot refrain from saying to Lord Hartington, having read his speech and having studied it, something to this effect : ' If this is reaUy aU that you can bring yourself to utter on poUtical questions, you cannot indicate any difference of political principles between yourself and your friends and the Govern ment which is now in power. If, on the contrary, you are absolutely compelled by the honesty of your nature to indicate the strongest possible difference of poUtical principle with a certain section of the Liberal party with whom for years you have hopelessly and vainly tried to agree, then I say that you have no longer the right, as a patriot and as"], [503, "LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. 483 \u00c6 citizen, to oppose the Government and the party simply on the aground of certain old antiquated names which are the relics of an effete controversy. And if Lord Hartington, as time goes on and as the general election approaches, finds himself stiU unable to escape from those vague generalities on political questions, stiU unable to express anything but the strongest possible disagreement with Mr. Chamberlain and his foUowing, then I say to him and his friends and his foUowing, words which were said to men two thousand years ago nearly, who were destined to become great political guides\u2014 I say to Lord Hartington, and I say to his friends, ' Come over and help us.' \" The Appeal Rejected. \u2014 This invitation to Lord Hartington was shortly after commented upon by the latter with some severity, and this led Lord Randolph, at an election meeting in Manchester in the foUowing November, to rejoin as foUows : \" Lord Hartington permits himself contempt in dealing with what he caUs the new Conservative. The noble lord Uves in a very fragile glass house, and, as he has permitted himself to throw stones at me, I will proceed with your permission to smash some of his panes. Lord Hartington says the new Conservatives, or Tory democracy, have no political principle. What political principle has the Marquis of Hartington? Lord Hartington says he wiU hold himself free to support in 1887 what he considered he ought to oppose in 1886. That is political principle ! . . The proof that office is his only aim is the fact that he continues to swallow doggedly, bit by bit, all the great morsels of the political programme which Mr. Chamberlain chucks at him. (Laughter.) He swaUows it aU, though the food is perhaps the most nauseating that could possibly be supplied to any politician. Did any of you ever go on a particular day to the Zoological Gardens ? If you go there, you may have the good fortune to observe the feeding of the boa constrictor, which is supplied with a fat duck or a rabbit. If you are lucky and patient, and if the boa constrictor is hungry, you may be able to trace the progress of the duck or the rabbit down his throat, and all along the convolutions of his body. Just in the same way, by metaphor and analogy, the English public can trace the digestion and the deglutition by the Marquis of Hartington of the various morsels of the Chamberlain programme which from time to time are handed to him ; and the only difference between the boa constrictor and the Marquis of Hartington is this \u2014 the boa constrictor enjoys his food and thrives on it, and Lord Harrington loathes his food, and it makes him sick.\" The Rival Versions. \u2014 Lord R. ChurchUl said, in addressing a meeting during his candidature for Mid-Birmingham in opposition to Mr. Bright (October, 1885) : \"Mr. Gladstone a short time ago issued an address to the electors of Midlothian. It was a very long address, but it was also an obscure address, and the consequence is that it has had many commentators, who have added to its obscurity, and, like aU commentators, they have quarreUed dreadfully among each other, and have fought over this address like a pack of hungry wolves over a bone. You have now before you three versions of the address Mr. Gladstone has placed before the country. You have the authorised version, as it left the pen of Mr. i i 2"], [504, "484 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Gladstone ; then you have the revised version according to Mr. Goschen ; and then you have the apocryphal or the uninspired version \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 which is promulgated by Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke. That is a very baffling and confusing state of things ; but it is nothing to what is to come, because Mr. Gladstone by-and-bye wiU proceed to Midlothian, and then he will explain the authorised version. But Mr. Gladstone's explanation of the authorised version wiU be immediately followed by Mr. Goschen's explanation of Mr. Gladstone's explanation of the revised version according to Mr. Goschen ; and that wiU be again \u2014 and I ask you to foUow me very closely here \u2014 that wiU be again immediately foUowed, or perhaps accompanied, by Mr. Chamberlain's explanation and Sir Charles Dilke's explanation of Mr. Goschen's explanation of Mr. Glad stone's explanation of the apocryphal or uninspired version promulgated by Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke. I think you wiU agree with me that that is a very puzzling and exasperating state of things.\" Grounds of Resignation. \u2014 At the opening of the session in January, 1887, Lord Randolph Churchill entered into an explanation of the reasons which had induced him, a few weeks before, to resign his office as ChanceUor of the Exchequer, putting it on the ground of the refusal of his coUeagues to reduce the estimates for the coming year. In the course of his speech he said : \" My right honourable friends (the Ministers for War and for the Admiralty) wiU fuUy confirm me in this \u2014 that the only request which I made was that they should make a sensible and appreciable effort, which should be expressed in pounds, shiUings, and pence, to return, or to make a commencement to return, to a more normal expenditure for mUitary and naval purposes. I named no figure ; I care fully avoided it. I left the amount entirely to the discretion and judg ment and superior knowledge of my right honourable friends. In my mind \u2014 and I may have mentioned it casually in conversation, without insisting upon it \u2014 I thought that a reduction of \u00a31,000,000 in the time of peace, upon the naval and military expenses of the country, would have been an adequate and satisfactory reduction ; but my right honourable friends know perfectly weU that I shoidd not have made any obstinate quarrel about \u00a3100,000, \u00a3200,000, or even \u00a3300,000. In fact, I reaUy believe, if the worst came to the worst, I should have been satisfied with a reduction of half a miUion. (Laughter.) It was only when I found, from the views which my right honourable friends took of the position, that they were absolutely unable to make even the commencement of an effort to return to a more normal state of expenditure \u2014 it was only then, Sir, I was forced by a power greater than party ties \u2014 forced by what I said in the country, forced by the knowledge I acquired at the Treasury \u2014 to offer my resignation to Lord Salisbury.\" The Primrose League. \u2014 In a speech in London in April, 1885, Lord Randolph (one of the founders of this movement) said : \" I have often been asked the question, ' What is the Primrose League p ' Radicals have asked it with that derision which conceals anxiety. Conservatives have asked me the question, with the hope that I might be able to inform them that it will be a powerfnl adjunct to our party forces. My lords"], [505, "LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL. 435 and gentlemen, the Primrose League, to give it the best definition which occurs to me, is a transformation into political energy of the emotions which were aroused by Lord Beaconsfield's death, and the sentiments which are excited by the knowledge of his career. Those emotions and those sentiments were displayed with extraordinary force by the spontaneous determination of great numbers of people to commemorate the anniversary of the 19th of AprU by the wearing of the primrose. It was not the work of any political organisation. It was not suggested by any leading statesman, or any powerful newspaper. It was not confined to the wealthy and the great ; on the contrary, it was essentially among the masses of the people that the phenomenon was shown. It was, as it were, a mysterious, magnetic thrill which caused thousands of English hearts to resolvo that, on every recurring 19th of April, they would display to the world their knowledge of a great man's life, and their faith in the excellence of his parliamentary and ministerial deeds.\" Revolutionary Forces.\u2014 Lord Randolph thus spoke at a political meeting at Newcastle-on-Tyne, Oct. 22, 1887: \"Depend upon it that the moment those revolutionary forces, which must exist in aU great communities, escape from control, the moment they have reason to believe that any large proportion of public opinion, or any important political party, wiU tolerate or excuse or justify the disorder that they cause, then you may be certain that the sun of British wealth and British commercial prosperity wiU rapidly decline. The question is, WiU the democracy of England be quick enough to discern the danger, and guard against it, while there is yet time ? I have no scruple myself in confessing before this meeting that I am startled aud alarmed at the adhesion which the majority of the electors of Newcastle, and generaUy speaking, I regret to say, of the north of England, have given to the Repeal of the Union. It may be that our exuberant wealth, our bounding prosperity in times not long ago, our rapid annexations of territory and acquisitions of empire, our measureless commerce, our proud marine \u2014 it may be that aU these possessions, all this hoarding up of treasure, have blunted the perceptions and dulled tho energies of our race, and have led 11s to believe that wo may lightly acquiesce in any political experiment or any organic change. Yet surely there are moments when we must reaUse that England, surrounded as she is by mighty States disposing of colossal armies, is not invulnerable ; that her resources are not inexhaustible ; and that there is no certainty that her empire wUl last for ever and for aye. I know not what may be the fate of the British Empire. AU I know is that, in history, other empires as great and as wide as yours have waxed, have waned, and have faded away. Other States as powerful and as wealthy as yours have risen, and have sunk into the ocean of the past ; and it may be that the time is inscribed on the book of Fate when the busy marts, the crowded streets, the bustling factories of this living city shaU be as desolate as the ruins of Thebes, and as sUent and mournful as the courts of the palaces of the Mogul.* I know not, and who tviU dare to * Compare with Disraeli, p. 324."], [506, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 486 pronounce ? But of this I am sure \u2014 that, if such is the inevitable fate of the British Empire, history wiU indisputably declare that the kneU of our glory and our might was earliest toUed on the day when tbe people relaxed their firm grip of the noble principle of union, and feebly and fataUy foUowed the broad and downward path of separation ; on the day when popular cowardice was substituted for civic courage ; when surrender to rebellion, treason, and sedition was disguised under the specious pretexts of concession, conciliation, phUanthropy, and the rights of man j when order, law, and loyalty and authority were no longer the watchwords of the community, no longer the bulwarks of the State .\" \" Tory Democracy.\" \u2014 The foUowing remarks were made in an address to a Conservative Club in Birmingham, April 9, 1888: \"I cannot but feel that we have at last realised, or nearly realised, what was some years ago apparently only a dream \u2014 the dream of Tory democracy. You remember with what scoffs and scornings and sneers the phrase Tory democracy was received, when I first made use of it in the House of Commons in the year 1883. Nothing was too bad, too taunting, too ludicrous or absurd to apply to the idea, or to those who dared to sustain it. You in Birmingham were the first publicly to associate yourselves with the policy which is contained in the phrase ; and, after aU, what is Tory democracy ? People have often written to ask me what it is, and I have always declined to give them any answer. But now I don't mind, under present circumstances, giving an answer, and I wiU describe Tory democracy. Tory democracy is a democracy which supports the Tory party \u2014 (laughter and cheers) \u2014 but with this important qualification, that it supports a Tory party not from mere caprice, not from momentary disgust or indignation with the results of Radicalism, but because it beUeves, by experience and by knowledge, in the exceUence and the soundness of true Tory principles. But Tory democracy involves another idea of equal importance ; it involves the idea of a Government who, in aU branches of their policy and in aU features of their administration, are animated by lofty and Uberal ideas. That is Tory democracy.\" WILLIAM HENRY SMITH. (1825\u20141891.) The Great \" Smithery.\" \u2014 The Right Hon. William Henry Smith, First Lord of the Treasury in Lord Salisbury's Government, and also leader of the House of Commons, was head of the weU-known firm of newspaper agents, &c, as to whom it was said long ago by Sir James Stephen, at the time of the development of railway book-staUs, that the whole trade was turning into a \" Smithery.\" He was brought forward as a candidate for Westminster in 1865, but, failing on that occasion, was successful against Mr. John Stuart Mill in 1868. He continued to sit for Westminster until 1885, when he was returned for the Strand division. He took office under Mr. Disraeli in 1874 as Financial Secretary of the Treasury, afterwards becoming First Lord of the Admiralty, and, later, Secretary of State for War, resigning the latter"], [507, "WILLIAM HENRY SMITH. 487 portfolio in 1887 for the First Lordship of the Treasury. His death while stiU occupying this office, and the leadership of the House of Commons, was regretted by all parties. His widow was raised to the peerage as Viscountess Hambleden. A Notable Victory.\u2014 In July, 1870, Mr. W. H. Smith signalised himself by obtaining a victory against the then powerful Government of Mr. Gladstone, on a question of popular rights. He proposed a motion condemning the erection of any public offices on that part of the Thames Embankment which was reserved to the Crown, and had been reclaimed from the river at the cost of the ratepayers of the metropolis. The motion was carried by 156 to 106, many of the Prime Minister's ardent supporters withdrawing from him on the occasion. Debates on the Address.\u2014 Mr. W. H. Smith, in giving a notice respecting the new Procedure Rules (Feb. 17, 1887), said : \" I have only to point to the number of days that the discussion upon the Address has this session already occupied, to bring home to every honourable member a sense of the necessity for the imposition of some restraints upon the prolongation of debate. We are now in the fourth week of the present session, and we have been debating the Address over sixteen sitting days of Parliament. I will state to the House the number of days occupied in the discussion of the Address in past years. In tho first session of 1880, four sitting days were occupied in the discussion of the Address, and in the second session one day; in the session of 1881, eleven days, and of 1882, six days ; the session of 1883-84, ten days, and of 1884, eight days ; 1884-85, nine days ; in the first session of 1886, five days ; and in the second session ten days were so occupied. Under those circumstances I think the House wiU admit that it is necessary it should impose some restraint upon itself in the transaction of affairs. I daresay it may be said that I have, individuaUy, opposed the restrictions which are now sought, to be imposed. That, as it appears to me, does not enter into the consideration of this question at all. As I have said, I make this proposal to the House with a sense of humiliation, but I admit its absolute necessity. 1 feel that nothing short of the course now proposed will save the House from that which is virtually self-destruction, and the abrogation of the duties which belong to it as the Parliament of tho United Kingdom.\" The new rules, including an amended form of the closure, were eventually carried. Obstruction and \" Avowed Enemies.\" \u2014 In the House of Commons on the 24th of AprU, 1887, Mr. Smith (First Lord of the Treasury) was asked whether he had used certain expressions, such as \"avowed enemies of England,\" in letters sent by his secretaries to local Couserva tive bodies. In reply he said : \" I have not seen the letter, but I am not prepared to say that the purport is that from which I desire to withdraw. I am entitled, Sir, and honourable gentlemen are entitled, to have my own opinions as to the character of the proceedings in Parliament, and the discussions which may, in my judgment, arrive at a point where obstruc tion might result from it. Whether it is unconstitutional obstruction or not, depends entirely on the judgment of Parliament, and the judgment of"], [508, "488 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. honourable gentlemen who may agree with or differ from that opinion ; but I may say this for myself, that I think the record of Parliament has seldom presented, if it has ever presented, a condition of affairs such as that at which we have now arrived, under which the public business of the country has been delayed and frustrated, and the public interests endangered. Whether that be an unconstitutional obstruction or not, is for the country and for the public judgment to decide. I am asked whether the expression about the ' avowed enemies ' of England is one which I am prepared to acknowledge. I do not wish, Sir, to apply epithets if it is possible to avoid them ; but if honourable gentlemen avow themselves to be the enemies of England, it is, I think, not altogether undesirable that that fact should have attention drawn to it. I am again asked, as leader of the House, whether I will caU attention to obstruction when I deem it to be obstruction. I wiU as far as, in my judgment, it is wise and advisable to do so ; and I shall seek to exercise the powers which the House has put in the hands of members of the House in order to prevent obstruction; but I must have regard also to the fact that, by repeatedly drawing attention to obstruction, I may be myself contributing to that terrible evil, which I fear threatens the Parliamentary institutions of this country.\" Much Speaking. \u2014 Mr. W. H. Smith further illustrated the growth of obstruction by some remarks in a speech at Doncaster, Dec. 5, 1887. Referring to the history of the previous session, he adduced the following figures : \" The House sat 160 days, or 1453 hours. The number of speeches made by Radicals and Parnellites was 7368, averaging forty -two speeches for each Parnellite and nineteen speeches for every Gladstonian Liberal. There were 3590 Conservative speeches and 552 Liberal- Unionist speeches ; so that the Opposition spoke 7368 times, while the Ministerial party, who had to answer them, only spoke 4100 times. The Parnellites and Gladstonians were about three -sevenths of the House of Commons, and the Unionist and Conservative party were four-sevenths. The three-sevenths had 7300 speeches ; the four-sevenths had 4100 speeches. In other words, the average number of speeches of each member of the Opposition was twenty-nine, including Gladstonians and Liberals, whUe the average speeches for the Government side of tho House were ten. Under these circumstances, it was impossible for the Government to carry through all the business which the country demanded. There was another form of obstruction, which found vent in breaking the rules of the House ; and the consequence was that members of the Opposition were called to order 612 times by the Speaker and the Chahman during the last session, while only on sixty -four occasions were those who supported her Majesty's Government caUed to order.\" Defence of a Second Chamber.\u2014 In March, 1888, Mr. Labou chere brought forward one of his frequent motions * against the House of Lords, this time condemning the principle \" that any person should be a member of one House of the Legislature by right of birth.\" He argued * See p. 66."], [509, "ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR. 489 that a second Chamber was useless, because if it agreed with the other Chamber it was not wanted ; and if it disagreed, it was pernicious. Mr. W. H. Smith (First Lord), in the course of the discussion which ensued, remarked that \" When the mover of the resolution declared that the House of Lords was absolutely needless because the Honse of Commons was the centre of gravity, he argued for the constitution of a sort of convention which would have the power of passing measures with the utmost rapidity. Very few people, however Radical their principles, would seriously approve of entrusting the vital interests of the nation to such an assembly. It could not be too often repeated that the second Chamber existed as a check against ill-considered legislation. As such, it was doubtless capable of being reformed; but the reform to be suc cessful must be inaugurated by itself, and the Government would welcome any changes which, without being revolutionary, would enable the House of Lords the better to discharge its duties as a branch of the Legislature.\" \u2014 In the end the motion was negatived by 223 against 162. A Sarcasm. \u2014 In March, 1890, the Lunacy Consolidation Bill, in which there were upwards of 300 clauses, passed rapidly through com mittee of the House of Commons, the Chairman (Mr. Courtney) putting the clauses a score or more at a time. Coming to the third reading without amendment being made, Mr. John Morley interposed with the hope that tbe First Lord of the Treasury would inform some of his friends, who were in the habit of saying that the Opposition persistently obstructed public business, of the assistance the Opposition had just afforded the Government. Mr. Smith caused much laughter by the dryness of his reply: \"I shall certainly have great pleasure in commnnicating to my honourable friends that the Opposition have given the greatest faciUty \u2014 for passing a Lunacy BiU ! \" ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR. (1848.) A Scotch, and Irish, Secretary.\u2014 The Right Hon. Arthur James Balfour (a nephew of the Marquis of Salisbury) succeeded Sir M. Hicks-Beach as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887. He sat for Hertford from 1874 to 1885, aud in the latter year held office as Presi dent of the Local Government Board. He was returned for the eastern division of Manchester in 1885. In 1886 he became Secretary for Scot land, with a seat in the Cabinet, which he retained on appointment to the Irish Secretaryship. On the death of Mr. W. H. Smith in the autumn of 1891, Mr. Balfour was appointed his successor as First Lord of the Treasury and leader of the House of Commons. Maintenance of the Law.\u2014 Mr. Balfour made the following remarks at a conversazione of the Nonconformist and Unionist Alliance, May 8, 1889 : \" An interesting criticism is furnished by a phrase I found in a speech of Mr. Gladstone's iu 1870. Mr. Gladstone then explained to the House of Commons that the best test and criterion of a civilised and Christian country were to be fonnd in the fact that her Majesty's peace able and well-conducted subjects are enabled to pursue the ordinary"], [510, "490 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. avocations of life with comfort and with confidence. Nobody pretends for an instant that at this moment, stiU less a year and half ago, her Majesty's peaceable and well-conducted subjects in Ireland are enabled to pursue the ordinary avocations of life with comfort and with confi dence. It is certain, therefore, that since the year 1870 something has very materiaUy changed. Either it is Christianity or it is Mr. Gladstone. . . Our course appears to be perfectly clear. If some one endowed with a perfect insight into futurity were to tell me that in three or four years' time, or whenever the next general election happens, a large Separatist majority would be returned; that that Separatist majority could be found to agree upon a Bill; that, having been able to agree upon a Bill, they were able to pass it through the House of Commons ; that, having passed it through the House of Commons, they were able to pass it through the House of Lords ; and that therefore in five years' time, or thereabouts, Home Rule would be established, I should require very special guarantees as to the credibility of my witness. But if I believed him, I should not alter my conduct by one iota. (Cheers.) Every day and every hour in which we stretch the strong arm of the law to protect the weak in Ireland, is a day and an hour gained. And if I were certain that everything we had done to maintain the Empire were destined to crumble into the dust, that our efforts were to be vain, and that it would be our hard fate to look back upon years spent in attempting to preserve a country that was determined to be lost, stiU I should not regret for one moment the efforts that we have made in the cause of law and order in Ireland. Those efforts are good and justifiable as a means to an end, but they are equaUy good and justifiable iu themselves ; and of this, at aU events, I am as certain as I am of any law which governs this world \u2014 that whether Ireland is to be prosperous as a separate country, whether she is to be prosperous as a country connected by those shadowy ties of Home Rule to England which Mr. Gladstone desires, or whether she is to be prosperous as an integral part of the Empire, it can only be by obeying willingly the laws which we are attempting at this moment to enforce.\" A Defence of Pitt. \u2014 On a visit to Manchester to meet his constituents, in October, 1889, Mr. Balfour spoke as foUows : \" Epithets have been hurled against Mr. Pitt, the author of the Union \u2014 violent, and more suited, I should say, in their violence to be applied to a living Chief Secretary than to a dead Prime Minister.* But if Mr. Pitt could come down to teU us what he thought of his poUtical successors; if he could see the condition to which the Gladstonian party has brought pubUc morality in England; if he could see the convictions of a lifetime abandoned by a whole political party in the course of twenty-four hours ; if he could see that party caressing men whom they had imprisoned, fawning upon those who had crueUy traduced * The allusion was more particularly to a remark made by Mr. Gladstone, in a (published) letter to one of his friends, on the \" blackguardism \" Pitt displayed in his measures to carry the Union."], [511, "ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR. 491 them ; if he could see public life degraded by a method of gaining votes which considers nothing more than the temporary success of the election, which panders to every fault of the constituency \u2014 would he not say that, at aU events, it was far better to corrupt a few venal placemen in carrying the Union, than to destroy that Union by debauching half a nation p As a party man I do not object \u2014 I ought rather to rejoice \u2014 at seeing our opponents plunge themselves deeper and deeper in the course they have commenced; for I do not believe that political power can permanently belong to any party in the country who show themselves indifferent to those fundamental principles on which every civilised soeiety rests. I mourn, indeed, over the evUs which even their temporary success may bring upon us ; but I am convinced that victories bought at the price I have described are very dearly bought for those who have gained them. I am perfectly certain that, if we pursue in the future the policy of the past \u2014 a policy of solid reform, of a generous treatment of Irish difficulties, of a firm administration of R-ish law ; if we show a steady resolution to maintain the honour of the country abroad, aud at the same time not to sacrifice those great interests bound up with the cause of peace ; whatever tempo rary reverses the party may suffer, it is to us and to us alone that the people of this country wiU permanently confide the repository of power.\" \" Shadowing \" by the Police. \u2014 In June, 1890, Mr. BaUour was the centre of some stormy passages in the House of Commons, arising out of this subject. In answer to Mr. J. O'Connor and Mr. T. Healy, he said that, in the case of persons who were \"shadowed\" by the police in Ireland, some discretion was necessary on the part of the constable. General directions were given to the police how they should carry out this duty. As soon as those gentlemen who were \" shadowed \" would give an undertaking that they would abstain from the illegal practices in which they were now employed, they would not be followed by the police any longer. \u2014 Mr. H. Fowler : Will the right honourable gentleman say whether he has consulted the law officers as to the legality of this practice ? \u2014 Mr. Balfour : It is not usual to have a case stated, unless there is some doubt as to the legality of the course to be taken. I have taken pains to convince myself that there is no doubt as to tho legality in this case, and therefore I have not made a formal request of tbe law officers' opinion. \u2014 Mr. Healy, amid cries of \" Order,\" asked whether it was part of the instruction that the constable was to remain within earshot of the person whom he was to \" shadow.\" \u2014 Mr. Balfour : No, Sir. I am desirous of limiting, as far as possible, this method of dealing with crime. I most gladly take advantage of any presumption. \u2014 Mr. Dillon: You have no right to speak of people as being guilty of crime. (\" Order !\")\u2014 Mr. Balfour : I wUl gladly take advantage of any presumption that persons are not engaged in these Ulegal practices ; but, in view of the terrible suffering arising from boycotting, this practice must be continued, if those persons wiU not give the undertaking required. \u2014 Mr. DiUon : I have a question on the paper, asking the Chief Secretary whether he wiU order the police iu Irelaud to discontinue the system of shadowing individuals.\u2014 Mr. Balfour : I cannot deprive myself of the means of"], [512, "492 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. dealing with and limiting the crime of boycotting and intimidation, and therefore I cannot promise that this shadowing will be done away with, so long as boycotting and intimidation prevail. \u2014 Mr. John Dillon : This charge of crime is abominable. (Uproar, and cries of \" Withdraw.\") \u2014 Mr. ParneU : With reference to this practice which it is proposed to continue in future, may I ask the right honourable gentleman if it is not English law to assume a man is innocent until he has been proved guilty of an offence ? \u2014 Mr. Balfour : Sir, if the honourable gentleman wUl undertake on behalf of these people that they will not indulge in a course of boycotting and intimidation, then I will deal with this question. (Ministerial cheers, and cries of \"Withdraw.\") \u2014 Mr. John O'Connor (rising amid general excitement) : I throw the word crime back in your teeth with scorn. (Cries of \" Order.\") \u2014 The Speaker and Mr. Dillon here rose together, and a \" scene \" ensued, Mr. Dillon still standing and waving his arm. \u2014 The Speaker (calmly, when the confusion had sub sided considerably) : I must remind the honourable member that he has committed a breach of the rules of this House, because when I rise it is customary for an honourable member to resume his seat. \u2014 Mr. Gill : Balfour shouldn't tell lies. \u2014 Mr. Balfour : IS I am at all responsible for the excitement which has occurred, I deeply regret it \u2014 (An Irish Member : \" It's a lie.\" Uproar.) Let me substitute for the word \" crime \" boy cotting and intimidation, reserving to myself my own opinion. \u2014 Sir G. Trevelyan : As this is a new method, this shadowing \u2014 (\" Oh ! \" from the Ministerial benches) \u2014 I would ask the right honourable gentleman if land agents, who are putting pressure on the tenants to agree to buy their holdings, are shadowed by the police P \u2014 Mr. Balfour : I had better say at once that the practice will be put in force in order to put down intimida tion, no matter by whomsoever it may be practised. But shadowing is not a new practice ; I believe it was largely indulged in by the right honourable geutleman himself when at the Irish Office. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone : If the right honourable gentleman is correct in saying that my rio-ht honourable friend, his predecessor at the Irish Office, indulged in this practice of shadowing, wiU he be kind enough to lay on tho table of this House an account of those cases ? \u2014 Mr. Balfour made no reply. \u2014 A short time after, during other proceedings, Mr. Dillon rose and said : Mr. Speaker, I wish to apologise to you, and to express my regret. I was labouring under great provocation. \u2014 The Speaker bowed in acknowledg ment. Political Dexterity. \u2014 Mr. Balfour addressed a meeting of Unionists at Bury in October, 1891, and in his speech thus referred to \" the programme \" recently unfolded by Mr. Gladstone at Newcastle, disestablishment being one of the articles. He said : \" Mr. Gladstone finds himself in a great difficulty because there are two subject nationali ties, two oppressed nationalities, to both of which he means to give the enormous boon of disestablishment, but the precedence between whose claims he does not wish to decide, for a very obvious reason \u2014 that if he were to decide in favour of Scotland he would offend Wales, and if he decided in favour of Wales he would offend Scotland. Now"], [513, "ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR. 493 observe the dexterity of the eminent statesman whom Sir WiUiam Har court compared to the late Field Marshal von Moltke\u2014 though I do not think the power of ' keeping silence in seven languages ' is characteristic of Mr. Gladstone. (Great laughter.) How does he deal with this difficult question? It is really as dexterous in point of politics as anything Moltke ever did in matters of war. He says : ' I have nothing to do with this question ; you have both, you Welsh and you Scotch, bold and resolute champions ; ' and apparently he means that those bold and reso lute champions are to bo shut up together in a room, there to fight it out until we find which is the boldest and which is the most resolute. In fact, what he wants them to do, first, is to decide among themselves in a free fight who is to have the precedence ; and then for the two parties to join together in coercing everybody else. What idea do you carry away from this programme ? You have to choose between that which is going to be done ' at the earliest opportunity,' that which is going to be done 'when its turn comes.' that which is going to be done ' during the lifetime of the present generation,' that which is to be done as soon as the rival champions have decided upon it, that which is ' at this moment remote, and which may have precedence over aU other questions,' that which will have ' a very forward place,' and that which ' must not be forgotten.' All this has a very simple explanation. Mr. Gladstone is not in the least thinking of these subjects of Liberal legislation ; be is thinking of one subject only \u2014 Ireland. He wants to get, by hook or by crook, a majority together which will enable him at aU events to propose \u2014 for I do not suppose he expects to carry \u2014 a Homo Rule BiU for the acceptance of the House of Commons, and therefore, whether we like it or not, we are driven back again and again to the subject of Ireland.\" The \"Writing on the Wall.\" \u2014 At a meeting in the Town Hall. Huddersfield, in December, 1891, Mr Balfour thus referred to expressions frequently used by opponents of the Government : \" They have only two metaphors when they win a bye election. I notice one of two things always happens : either ' the rising tide' is with' them, or else there is ' a writing on tbe waU.' Sir William Harcourt is peculiarly partial to ' the rising tide ; ' Mr. Morley has a marked weakness for ' the writing on the waU.' According to him, those humble banquets at which Conservatives and Unionists no less than Separatists and Radicals are wont to exchange opinions, are so many Belshazzar's feasts. WeU, gentlemen, I am not sure that the metaphor is whoUy just. For my own part, I think Mr. Morley has as little resemblance to the prophet Daniel as Lord Salisbury has to Belshazzar the king. Very strange things happen in politics. (A voice : \" Tha' art reight, lad.\") Since the Liberal party in 1885 went out upon the subject of beer, with a Coercion BiU in their pockets, just consider what revolutions in political affairs have occurred.

JOHN MORLEY. (1838.) Literature and Politics. \u2014 The Right Hon. John Morley was well known in the literary world before entering the political arena, having edited the Fortnightly Review and the Pall Mall Gazette, as weU as written several works, such as his \"Life of Cobden,\" \" Edmund Burke,\" \" Voltaire,\" &c. He unsuccessf nUy contested Westminster against Mr. W. H. Smith at the general election of 1880 ; and was first returned for Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1883. In Mr. Gladstone's third Administration, formed in 1886, he was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet; but the Ministry had held office only a few months when it was overturned on the proposal of Mr. Gladstone's Irish measures. Blunders. \u2014 In the course of a lecture on \" The Study of Literature,\" delivered in February, 1887, Mr. Morley said : \" PoUtics are a field where action is one long second best, and where the choice constantly Ues between two blunders.\" Further Storms Predicted. \u2014 In a speech at Bradford, in June, 1886, Mr. J. Morley observed: \" You had last night, in the neighbouring town of Leeds, a very iUustrious statesman t^Lord Salisbury), aud he congratulated some friends of ours upon what he caUed, in very handsome language, ' their magnificent superiority to party ties.' I do not think that some of my friends at Birmingham* will bask in the sunshine of these compliments ; and, though the Leeds Tories cheered this phrase of the ' magnificent superiority ' of our friends who have left us in the lurch, I teU them the day wUl come \u2014 and I know weU the people of whom I am speaking \u2014 when they wiU have to pay a pretty price for those compU ments. Lord Salisbury need not think that by pretty words he wiU escape the necessity one of these days, at the hands of my right honourable friend the member for Birmingham (Mr. Chamberlain), of ' ransom.' He need not think that he wdl not have to pay the penalty that awaits those who ' toU not, neither do they spin.' He need not think that the Restitution BiU of my good friend Mr. Jesse Collings is laid up in lavender. Oh no ! gentlemen. All these very handsome blandishments are only the prelude to what I predict will one of these days be a most furious storm.\" An Upholder of the Monarchy. \u2014 Mr. Morley made the foUowing remarks in the debate on the grants to the royal family, July 29, 1889 ; although at the same time moving an amendment to the Government proposal : \" While, of course, it is our strongest conviction that our chief and paramount duty is to watch and guard over the interests of the people, that conviction in no way lessens our belief that we shaU most steadily and surely travel along the path of national progress under monarchical forms. A constitutional monarchy is woven into the very web of our national life and our national history. We feel, as weU as * Mr Chamberlain was more particularly referred to."], [515, "JOHN MORLEY. 495 you feel, that monarchy is the outward and visible symbol of the historic continuity of our nation \u2014 the outward and visible symbol of that unity which binds together aU our scattered colonies and dependencies in the vast realm beyond the sea. I do not like to imitate the First Lord of the Treasury (Mr. W. H. Smith) in speaking about sacred institutions, and I do not know what other honourable gentlemen around me may think ; but I believe that it is not a disadvantage, but an immense advantage, to a democracy to possess and to retain aU that touches the historic imagina tion of our people. The mace on the table, the closing of the door on the approach of the Black Rod, remind us of the struggles of our prede cessors in this House to take care that the king should neither make laws nor take their money without their leave and assent. So, on the other hand, we may be, and we are, none the less ardent for the reforms of the new time because we find pleasure, and because we find elevation, in the thought that the successor and kinswoman of the great Normans, the Plantagenets, the Tudors, the two Edwards, Henry IL, and Elizabeth, stdl holds the sceptre, though with a milder sway, in the seat of the hereditary chief of these great and ancient kingdoms. This heritage is the common property of both parties.\" \"Pulverisation\" of the Liberal Party. \u2014 Mr. Morley made the following remarks in the House of Commons, in the discussion on the Irish measures of Mr. Gladstone's Government, April 9, 1886 : \" The main criticisms of my right honourable friend (Mr. Chamberlain) upon the proposals laid before the House by the Prime Minister were worthy of very close and careful attention. But when he said that we were going to exclude trade and navigation from the scope of the domestic legislature of Ireland, he laid too much stress upon what is a mere technical term of law. Trade and navigation do not exclude bankruptcy. (Ironical cheers.) My right honourable friend, after aU, went very far in the direction in which his late colleagues have persisted. He admits that his differences with us arose not on these small points of trade and navigation and the like, but because, though he was prepared to go so far as a statutory body with legislative power sitting in Dublin, he could not consent to that body having in its control, directly or indirectly, such matters as the appoint ment of judges, and the control of Customs aud Excise. In the control of Customs and Excise we have met my right honourable friend. In my opinion, the election of judges is hardly a point so important \u2014 important as it is \u2014 as to warrant so serious a step as the breaking up of a Cabinet, and what looks like the pulverisation of a party.\" \u2014 Lord Randolph Churchill, a few days after, at a dinner of the Beaconsfield Club, thus referred to Mr. Morley 's words- \"The Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutonant, in the House of Commons on Friday night, made use of an expression which throws a lurid light upon the policy which the Prime Minister is bringing before the House of Commons. In rebuking Mr. Chamberlain for leaving the Government, he declared that the grounds put forward were not adequate for what he called breaking up the Cabinet, or for pulverising a party. Pulverising a party ! I have always observed that if there is a thing which it is advisable not to say, the"], [516, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 496 Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant is perfectly sure to say it. He has tho most extraordinary talent, one perfectly peculiar to himself, of uttering things absolutely tme which are singularly fatal to the cause he is endeavouring to advocate. Are not the Chief Secretary's words a very fair test to apply to this policy of Mr. Gladstone ? It has already pulverised the Liberal party.\" The \" Irish Spectre.\" \u2014 An unusual outburst of metaphor from Mr. Morley, although accompanied by simple narration of facts, occurred in an address to the Cambridge and County Liberal Club in September, 1891. He said : \" It is idle for us to start forth on our voyage of social reform in Great Britain, so long as the deck of the ship of State is cumbered and loaded with the Irish question. Just look back. You chose a great Parliament in 1880, and you installed a great Minister. No sooner was that done than the Irish question, like a spectre, stalked down the floor of the House of Commons, and with an ice-cold hand throttled, slowly throttled, the enthusiasm and the energy out of the most splendid and most hopeful majority that has been returned to the House of Commons this century. That was in 1880, when the Government ought to have set about the proper buciness of Imperial and British government. First of aU there was the Compensation for Disturbance Bill. In 1881 the session was entirely taken up, first with a Coercion BiU, and secondly with a Land BiU. In 1882 another Coercion BUI, another Land BUI, and an Arrears Bill. In 1883 and 1884 we had certain leisure to attend to our own affairs. In 1885 the Irish vote \u2014 given, not for Imperial or British reasons, purely for Irish reasons \u2014 turned out a Government. In 1886, first of aU the Tories were turned out, practicaUy on the question of coercion. The session was taken up, and gloriously taken up, with Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule BiU. Then came the election. The Liberals were turned out upon the Irish question. In 1887 the attention of the House of Commons was again absorbed by a Coercion BiU and by a Land BiU. The session of 1891 was practically taken up, in the longest portion of its time, by a Land Purchase BiU. The roU of 1892 is not yet unfolded. For ten years Ireland has absorbed by far the greatest portion of the time, and energy, and pubUc interest of Great Britain. What reason have we to suppose that the next ten years wiU be different? What reason have you to suppose that the Irish spectre wiU be laid during the next ten years, or be any less destructive to the legislation we desire than it was in the ten years I have described to you ?\""], [517, "MINOR CELEBRITIES AND ODD CHARACTERS. 497 MINOR CELEBRITIES AND ODD CHARACTERS. Price of a City Member. \u2014 Sir John Barnard took his seat for the City of London in 1722. The writer of his memoirs remarks that to Walpole's frequent observation, \" Every man has his price,\" it was once triumphantly objected, \" What, then, is Sir John Barnard's ? \" \" Popu larity,\" was the minister's reply. But Walpole once paid Sir J. Barnard a great compliment. Riding out on the same day in two parties, they happened to come where only a narrow close prevented their view of each other. Sir J. Barnard, talking with his company, was overheard. A gentleman of the other party said, \" Whose voice is that ? \" Sir Robert replied, \" Do not you know ? It is one I shall never forget ; I have often felt its power.\" \" Single-Speech Hamilton.\" \u2014 Lord Halifax was the first Lord- Lieutenant of George III. His secretary was WiUiam Gerard HamUton, known by the name of \" Single-Speech HamUton,\" having made one splendid speech, which he left unequalled ever after. His first measure was a proposal to raise six regiments of Irish Roman Catholics, amounting to three thousand men, to be officered by Catholics, and to be taken into the pay of an ally (Portugal). He proposed this in a long and exceUent speech ; but the measure met with so much opposition from the Protes tant party that it was ultimately given up by the Government. \u2014 Grattan's Life and Times. Hamilton's famous speech was delivered in 1755. \" He broke out,\" said Walpole, \" like the Irish rebellion, three-score thousand strong, when nobody was aware or in the least suspected it.\" Other of his speeches were printed in his posthumous work entitled \" Parliamen tary Logic.\" Edmund Burke obtained his initiation into pubUc life under Hamilton, whom he accompanied to Ireland in 1761. An Irish Celebrity. \u2014 Sir Boyle Roche, who was a member of the Irish Parliament in the period preceding the Union, achieved renown by the remark that he could not be, \" like a bird, in two places at once.\" Some other sayings imputed to him are scarcely less celebrated. \"I would gladly, Mr. Speaker, sacrifice not only a part of the constitution, but the whole of it, to preserve tho remainder.\" And again, speaking of what might be expected if the leaders of the rebeUion gained sway, \" Our heads will be thrown upon that table to stare us in the face ! \" To him also is ascribed that example of mixed metaphor, \" I smeU a rat, Mr. Speaker ; I see him floating in the air ; but I will yet nip him in the bud.\" But on one occasion Sir Boyle gained the victory over Curran in a contest in the Irish House. \"Do not speak of my honour,\" said Curran ; \" I am the guardian of my own honour.\" \" Faith,\" repUed Sir Boyle Roche, \" I knew that at some time or other you would accept a sinecure.\" A Seat for Eighteenpence.\u2014 John Elwes, the miser, was re turned for Berkshire in 1774, by the interest of Lord Craven.

He was a great gambler in his earUer years, although miserly in trifles. He stipulated that he should be at no expense in standing for Berkshire, and is said to have obtained his seat for eighteenpence, laid out in the ordinary at Abingdou. He sat for Berkshire for about twelve years, in three successive Parliaments. Unwigging a Member. \u2014 Elwes, writes Harford, \" wore a wig ; it looked as if it m.ght have been picked off a hedge or a scare-crow. At that time we used to wear dress swords occasionaUy at the House ; for instance, if going to the opera. One day, Bankes, whose carriage is stiff and lofty, had on his sword, and was seated next to Elwes, who leant his head forward just as Bankes was rising up to leave his place, when the hUt of his sword came in contact with Elwes' wig, which it whisked off and bore away. The House was instantly in a roar of laughter. I never shall forget the scene. There was old Elwes, without his wig, darting forward to reclaim it; and Bankes marching on quite unconscious of the sword-knot which he wore, and wondering what the laugh was about.\" Not Heartless.\u2014 Lord Brougham in one of his letters (1813) made the foUowing reference to Mr. Ward, at that time a person of some note in the House of Commons, and afterwards Lord Dudley : \" I heard a joke of Lord Byron's annoyed him t'other day, though it was a baddish sort of pun. Ward was talking of being 'rewhigged,' and Lord Byron said he fancied he wanted to be ' rewarded.' They have fired an epigram at him : ' W d has no heart, they say, but I deny it ; He has a heart, and gets his speeches by it.' \" A Suggestive Speaker. \u2014 Dr. Laurence had (says Brougham) \" the very worst delivery ever witnessed \u2014 a deUvery calculated to aUenate the mind of the hearer, to beguUe him of his attention, but by stealing it away from the speaker, and almost to prevent him from comprehending what was so uncouthly spoken. It was in reference to this unvarying effect of Dr. Laurence's delivery that Mr. Fox once said, a man should attend, if possible, to a speech of his, and then speak it over again himself : it must, he conceived, succeed mfalUbly, for it was sure to be admirable in itself, and as certain of being new to the audience. But in this saying there was considerably more wit than truth. The doctor's speech was sure to contam materials not for one, but for half-a-dozen speeches ; and a person might with groat advantage Usten to it, in order to use those materials, in part, afterwards ; as indeed many did, both in Parliament and at the Bar where he practised, make an effort to attend to hini, how difficult soever, in order to hear aU that could be said upon every part of the question.\" Lord Brougham adds that he had repeatedly tried at the Bar the experi ment mentioned by Fox, to a certain extent, and with success. \"Once Bit, Twice Shy.\" \u2014 Dr. Laurence's outward aspect was unwieldy, and almost grotesque. His mouth especiaUy excited observa tion; and being fancied to resemble a shark's, the House of Commons"], [519, "MINOR CELEBRITIES AND ODD CHARACTERS. 499 jest ran that Alderman Brook Watson, who had lost his leg by that animal's bite, avoided the side where the doctor sat or lay. Alderman Watson and his accident are thus aUuded to in \" The RoUiad : \" \u2014 \" ' One moment's time might I presume to beg,' Cries modest Watson, on his wooden leg ; That leg in which such wondrous art is shown, It almost seems to serve him as his own. Oh ! had the monster who for breakfast ate That luckless limb, his nobler noddle met, The best of workmen and the best of wood Had scarce supplied him with a head so good.\" A Lucid Interval. \u2014 Sir Charles Wetherell made a strong speech against the CathoUe Relief Bill, brought in by the Government in which he was Attorney- General, and in consequence had to resign. Mr. Greville thus writes respecting him and his speech (March, 1829) : \" The anti- Catholic papers and men lavish the most extravagant encomiums ou WethereU's speech, and caU it ' the finest oration ever deUvered in the House of Commons,' ' the best since the second PhUippic' He was drunk, they say. The Speaker said ' the only lucid interval he had was that between his waistcoat and his breeches.' When he speaks he unbuttons his braces, and in his vehement action his breeches faU down and his waistcoat runs up, so that there is a great interregnum.\" \" Chicken Taylor.\" \u2014 Mr. Michael Angelo Taylor, who for several years brought forward a motion in the House of Commons against Lord Eldon, was known (says Lord CampbeU) by the sobriquet of \" Chicken Taylor.\" On some points of law which arose in the House. Taylor had auswered the great lawyer, Bearcroft, but not without an apology, \" that he himself, who was but a young practitioner, and, as he might phrase it, a chicken in the law, should venture on a fight with the cock of West minster Hah.\" He then acquired, and he never lost, the above nickname. \"Orator Hunt.\" \u2014 Henry Hunt was the accepted leader of the discontented in the pre-Reform era, and his orations were circulated all over the country. He was the Radical of his age. The white hat ho wore was regarded as almost as significant as the republican bonnet rouge in the Reign of Terror. \u2014 Life of Duncombe. Hunt having been brought before Lord Chief Justice EUenborough to receive sentence upon a con- viction for holding a seditious meeting, he began his address in mitigation of punishment by complaining of certain persons who had accused him of \" stirring up the people by dangerous eloquence.\" Lord EUenborough (in a very mild tone) : \" My impartiality as a judge calls upon me to say. sir, that in accusing you of that they do you great injustice.\" \u2014 Campbell's Life of EUenborough. While addressing the House of Commons in support of the Reform BiU in 1831, Hunt said, \" Now, when the honourable member for Calne (Mr. Macaulay) was talking so much of the rabble, In- looked very hard at me (laughter). I understand that laugh. But I am only sorry that the honourable member for Calne has not remained in his place, that I might now have looked in the same way at him.\" \u2014 On the passing of the Reform BiU, Hunt lost his seat for Preston.

An ex-Prizefighter in Parliament. \u2014 John Gully, who had been a prize-fighter and \" champion of England,\" and who afterwards took to the turf and made mitch money by betting and racing, was returned to the House of Commons for Pontefract on the passing of the Reform BiU, iu opposition to Lord Mexborough. He was also elected to the ensuing Parliament. He eventually resigned his seat on account of iU-health, aud gave his entire attention to the turf, twice winning the Derby as well as other of the most important races. On his first election an epigram of the day ran as follows : \" If anyone ask why should Pontefract sully Its name by returning to Parliament Gully, The etymological cause, I suppose, is, He's broken the bridges of so many noses.\" \" Small-Journal Wynn.\"\u2014 The Right Hon. Charles W. W.Wynn, who died in 1850, sat in the House of Commons as representative of Montgomeryshire for fifty-one years, and at his death was \" father \" of the rlouse. He held office for a time under Earl Grey as Secretary for War, but resigned on account of his disapproval of the Reform BiU. His kuowledge of Parliamentary rule and precedent was highly esteemed, and obtained for him the above nickname. He has before been aUuded to iu connection with a saying of Brougham's (p. 241); and, in the Autobio graphy of his lordship, Charles Wynn is also mentioned under the name of \" Squeak.\" The reason for this appellation is thus explained : Charles Wynn was brother to Sir Watkin, and from a peculiarity in the utterance of the latter, and the shrillness of Charles's voice, they had a joint nick name as \" Bubble and Squeak.\" Quizzing a Bill out of the House. \u2014 Sir Andrew Agnew was identified in the House of Commons with the question of Sabbath obser vance. He brought in a measure so extreme in its nature that his friends appealed to his judgment in private against such a scheme. Professor Pryme tells us, \" He said, ' I quite agree with you as to the absurdity of some of the enactments, but it is the bid of the Society for the Better Observance of the Sabbath, and I cannot help it.' It was lost, of course, because it went too far, but the discussion produced great good throughout the kingdom, in leading people of aU classes to attend to the subject, and improve the observance of the Lord's Day. The last time that Sir A. Agnew brought forward his biU, Mr. Hawes, M.P. for Lambeth, and two or three other members, succeeded in, I may say, quizzing it out of tho House. We were in committee of the whole House, and I was in the chair. When we came to that clause which enacted that it should be unlawful for any cab or public carriage to be let out on a Sunday, Hawcs moved as an amendment, ' or for any private carriage to be used.' Before putting it to the vote, Sir A. Agnew appealed to me not to do so. I answered that, as it had been moved and seconded gravely, I had no option. The clause was carried by a majority, and no more was heard of the biU.\" Attack on a Royal Speech. \u2014 Colonel Sibtborp, who for many years represented Lincoln, wore a very long beard, which was never deso-"], [521, "MINOR CELEBRITIES AND ODD CHARACTERS. 501 crated by touch of steel. He is referred to on a previous page as one of the subjects of O'Connell's wit (p. 272). His speeches were usuaUy brief, but extremely forcible. On the evening of the explanations which ensued in 1851 upon the dismissal of Lord Palmerston by his chief, the colonel followed Lord John RusseU's grave aud deliberate speech by a sudden onslaught on the effects of the Great Exhibition. \"There was,\" he said, \"but one opinion, and it was universal, as to the gross insult which had been offered to the merchants and tradesmen of this country by the wholesale introduction of foreigners and their wares which had taken place in consequence of the Exhibition ; and, for his own part, he would not for a thousand guineas enter the walls or approach within smeU of the unwieldy, ill-devised, and unwholesome Castle of Glass. The speech which the ministers had put into her Majesty's lips was a mass of trickery, trash, and trumpery. It was they who were responsible for the sentiments it contained, and he sincerely hoped that the Queen would speedily escape from their fangs.\" An Insane Member. \u2014 It is said of Mr. Feargus O'Connor, chiefly remembered in connection with the Chartist movement and the monster petition of 1848,* that in his later days he used to wander idly about the lobbies, or go to the refreshment rooms and sit down and help himself to the food or drink prepared for other members. At last, as a crowning offence, he offered his snuff-box to the Chairman of Committees in the middle of a debate. He was removed by the officers of the House, and handed over to the custody of his relatives. He died a few mouths after. An Old County Member. \u2014 The Right Hon. Joseph Warner Henley, who died in 1884 at the age of ninety-one, represented Oxford shire from 1841 to 1878, when he retired into private life. He was President of the Board of Trade in the first and second Administrations of Lord Derby. Although a Conservative in polities, he was much esteemed by both parties, and in his later years was recognised as a kind of Mentor in the House. He had a homely style in putting his remarks and opinions, of which an instance that was frequently quoted, during the later Reform agitations, was the foreboding in 1859 of an \" ugly rush \" for the franchise unless tho wishes of the people were satisfied. A Pioneer of Free Trade.\u2014 The Right Hon. Charles Pelhaui Villiers, first returned to Parliament for Wolverhamptou in 1835, has continued to sit uninterruptedly for that borough for fifty-six years, and in 1885 took part in a discussion in the House of Commons. In the earlier years of his representation he was famed for his annual motions against the Corn Laws, before that subject had become a question of popular agitation. Under Liberal Administrations, he filled for some years the offices of Judge Advocate General and President of the Poor Law Board. A statue in his honour was erected in Wolverhamptou in 1879. The Champion \" Blocker.\" \u2014 Mr. C. N. Warton, elected for Bridport in 18S0, identified himself with the system of \" blocking \" bills, Pee under \" Petitions.\""], [522, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 502 which is explained in a later section.* His borough died out of ParUa mentary existence in 1885, under the latest Reform measure ; and in the foUowing year Mr. Wartou was appointed Attorney-General of Western Australia. On being eutertained at a f areweU banquet by the St. George's Club in London, he said : \" He had been called the great ' blocker,' and all the time he was in Parliament he was assailed by countless invectives on that account. Hitherto he had scorned to take notice of these attacks, but now that he was to block no more, he would teU them why he acted as he did. His theory was that the primary duty of Parliament was not legislation, but to look after the defences of the country and the efficiency of the services. Far more important was it that they should have an army and a navy thoroughly efficient, and their taxes properly expended, than that a number of generally worthless bills, proposed by inefficient members, should be passed, containing as a rule both bad grammar and bad law.\" (Laughter. I Mr. Warton once introduced a biU himself, on the subject of Government stamps for patent medicines; but it was promptly blocked by some observing opponent, and died a natural death. \"THE ROLLIAD.\" This celebrated collection of Pariiamentary squibs, which is several times quoted iu this volume, was written by some of the most eminent of the adherents of Mr. Fox, and published occasionaUy in the form of small pamphlets, The writers gavo their witticisms the shape of criticism on an imaginary poem, the title of which indicates the coming burlesque, aud their effusions appeared in 1785. A full list of the authors, with their various contributions, is given by Lord Braybrooke in the first series of Notes and Queries. Earl RusseU says : \" WhUe Mr. Fox, wearied with strife, was inclined to recruit his strength in the delightful shades of St. Ann's, the followers of the mighty warrior covered his retreat with the sharp missiles of wit and fun. A cloud of arrows flying around made the supporters of the Minister (Pitt) smart with pain, at once triumphant and ridiculous. ' The Rolliad,' or ' Criticisms on the RoUiad,' as it is more properly called, is the quiver of this squadron of wits.\" The origin of the title is thus explained by Moore in his \"Life of Sheridan:\" \u2014 \u25a0 \" Mr. RoUe (M.P. for Devonshire), the hero of ' The RoUiad,' was one of those unlucky persons whose destiny it is to be immortalised by ridicule, and to whom the world owes the same sort of gratitude for the wit of which they were the butts, as the merchants did in Sindbad's story, to those pieces of meat to which diamonds adhered. The chief offence, besides his poUtical obnoxiousness, by which he provoked this satirical warfare (whose plan of attack was aU arranged at a club held at Becket's), was the lead which he took in a sort of conspiracy, formed on the ministerial benches, to interrupt, by coughing, hawking, and other unseemly noises, the speeches of Mr. Burke. The chief writers of these Uvely productions * See undjr \" Usages.\""], [523, "\"THE ROLLIAD.\" 503 were Tickell, General Fitzpatrick, Lord John Townshend, Richardson, George Ellis, and Dr. Laurence.\" The interruptions referred to by Moore are thus alluded to :\u2014 \u00ab \" Great Rollo's heir, whose cough, whose laugh, whose groan, Th' Ant\u00e6us Edmund has bo oft o'erthrown ; Whose cry of ' Question ' silenced Charles's sense- That cry, more powerful than Pitt's eloquence.'

But, for an Indian Minister more fit, Ten cups of purest padrae ponr for Pitt, Pure as himself ; add sugar, too, and cream, Sweet as his temper, bland as flows the stream Of his smooth eloquence ; then crisply nice The muffin toast, or bread and butter slice, Thin as his arguments, that mock the mind, Gone ere you taste \u2014 no relish left behind.\" The Speaker of the House is feelingly commiserated -.\u2014 \" There Cornwall sits, and oh ! unhappy fate, Must sit for ever through the long debate.

The Marquis of Graham had said in debate, \" If the honourable gentleman calls my honourable friend goose, I suppose he will call me gosling.\" The remark was received with significant cheers. The marquis shortly after was elected Chancellor of Glasgow University, aud he is thus referred to : \u2014 \" If right the bard, whoBe numbers sweetly flow, That all onr knowledge is ourselves to know, A Bage like Graham can the world produce, Who in full senate called himself a goose ?

MISCELLANEOUS. ELECTIONS. Universal Suffrage. \u2014 Selden says : \" There was a time when all men had their voice in choosing knights (of the shire). About Henry the Sixth's time they found the inconvenience, so one Parliament made a law, that only he that had forty shiUings per annum should give his voice ; they under should be excluded. They made the law who had the voice of all, as well under forty shiUings as above ; and thus it continues at this da}-. AU consent civiUy to a Parliament; women are involved in the men, children in those of perfect age, those that are under forty shillings a year in those that have forty shillings a year, those of forty shillings in the knights.\" Early Election Disturbances. \u2014 In the eighth and tenth years of the reign of Henry VI. (1430 \u2014 1432), laws were enacted limiting the electors to such as were possessed of forty shillings a year in land, free from all burdens, within the county. The preamble of one statute is remarkable : \" Whereas the elections of knights have of late, in many counties of England, been made by outrages and excessive numbers of people, many of them of small substance and value, yet pretending to a right equal to the best knights and esquires ; whereby manslaughters, riots, batteries, and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties shall very likely rise and be, unless due remedy be pro- vided in this behalf,\" &c. We may learn (says Hume) from these ex- pressions what an important matter the election of a member of Parlia- ment was now become in England. A Sheriff Assaulted for Delaying a Writ. \u2014 Richard Calle writes to John Paston about 1450 : \" I recommend me unto your good mastership ; like you to weet (know) that on Childermas Day there wero much people at Norwich at the shire (county court), because it was noised in the shire that the under-sheriff had a writ to make a new election, wherefore the people was grieved because they had laboured so often, saying to the sheriff that he had the writ, and plainly he should not away unto the time the writ were read. The sheriff answered and said"], [526, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 506 that he had no writ, nor wist who had it ; hereupon the people peaced and stiUed unto the time the shire was done, and after that done, the peoplo called upon him, ' Kill him ! head him !' and so John Damme, with help of others, got him out of the shire-house, and with much labour brought him into Spurrier Row, and there the people met against him, and so they avoided him into an house, and kept fast the door unto the time the mayor was sent for, and the sheriff, to strengthen him and to convey him away, or else he had been slain. Wherefore divers of the thrifty men came to me, desiring that I should write unto your mastership to let you have understanding of the guiding of the people, for they be full sorry of this trouble ; and that it please you to send them your advice how they shall be guided aud ruled, for they were purposed to have gathered an hundred or two hundred of the thriftiest men, and to have come up to the King to let the King have understanding of their mocking.\" Influence of Peers on Elections. \u2014 The foUowing letter, written about the middle of the 15th century, and included in the Paston series, shows the influence then exercised by peers in elections for the Lower House, and the estimation in which members of that House were at that time held : \" The Duchess of Norfolk to our right trusty and weU-beloved John Paston, Esq. We greet you heartily well, and forasmuch as it is thought right necessary for divers causes that my lord have at this time in the Parliament such persons as belong unto him, and be of his menial servants \u2014 wherein we conceive your goodwill and diligence shall be right expedient \u2014 we heartily desire and pray you that, at the contemplation of these our letters, as our special trust is in you, ye wiU give and apply your voice unto our right well-beloved cousin and servants, John Howard and Sir Roger Chamberlayn, to be knights of the shire ; exhorting aU such others as by your wisdom shaU now be behoveful, to the good exploit and con clusion of the same. And in your faithful attendance and true devoir in this part ye shaU do unto my lord and us a singular pleasure, and cause us hereafter to thank you therefore, as ye shaU hold you right weU content and agreed with the grace of God, who have you ever in his keeping.\" Court Dictation. \u2014 The writs issued to summon a ParUament in 1553 were accompanied by a letter in the name of the King (Edward VI.) to each sheriff, which concluded as foUows : \" Our pleasure is that where our Privy Council, or any of them, shaU recommend men of learning and wisdom, in such case their directions be regarded and foUowed, to have this assembly to be of the most chiefest men in our realm for advice and good counsel.\" The \"Prince Elector.\" \u2014 Evelyn writes: March 5, 1685 [a few days after the accession of James IL] \u2014 A Parliament was now sum mon'd, and greate industry us'd to obtaine elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the corporations being now by their new charters impower'd to make what resumes of members they pleased. May 22. \u2014 Mr. Seymour made a bold speech against many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were obnoxious to withdraw, till they had clear'd the matter of their being legally return'd ; but no one seconded him.

It was reported that Lord Bath carried down with him into CornwaU no fewer than fifteen charters, so that some eaU'd him the Prince Elector. A Court Candidate in the Seventeenth Century. \u2014 Sir John Reresby, Governor of the city of York in the reign of James H., gives in his \" Memoirs \" the foUowing account of the mode in which the Court manipulated the constituencies for the purpose of securing the return of its own nominees : \" I sent notice to the mayor and others of Tork that I intended to stand for one of their representatives at the ensuing election, and found the magistracy would be for the most part against me, though I had good encouragement from the other citizens. The truth is I was at some loss how to act in this matter ; I was not desirous to be of this Parliament, not only because I was grown infirm and unfit to attend the duty of the House, but also because I was afraid the King would expect more from me than my conscience would extend to ; for, as I was determined not to violate this on the one side, so I could hardly resolve to offend so good a master on tho other. In these straits I went to the King at Windsor, and showed him the letters I had sent to Tork, and the answers I had received thereto ; desiring his Majesty to indulge me with replies to three queries I had to make. (1.) Whether, seeing the contest was like to be both chargeable and difficult, and the success ex tremely doubtful, it was his pleasure I should stand ? He replied posi tively, I should. (2.) Whether, as the opposition was very strong against me, he would impute it to my remissness if I miscarried ? He promised he would not. (3.) Whether he would assist me aU he could to prevent my being baffled, and particularly by such means as I should propose to him ? His answer was, Ves ; and he gave immediate orders to the Lords for purging of Corporations, to make whatever change I desired in the city of York, and to put iu or out (which the King, it seems, had reserved to himself by the last charter) just as I pleased. Then, taking leave of the King, and presenting him with some Roman medals, which he took very kindly, he again charged me to do what I could to be chosen.\" The worthy knight proceeds to narrate the steps he took to carry out the King's wishes ; but in tho meantime the Prince of Orange landed \u2014 an event by which these and many more important schemes were rendered futile. Electioneering Strategy in 1685.\u2014 The Whig candidate for Buckinghamshire, Thomas Wharton, eldest son of Philip Lord Wharton, was a man distinguished alike by dexterity and by audacity, and destined to play a conspicuous, though not always a respectable part, in the politics of several reigns. He had been one of those members of the House of Commons who had carried up the Exclusion BiU to the bar of the Lords. The Court was therefore bent on throwing him out by fair or foul means. The Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys himself came down into Buckingham-"], [528, "508 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. shire, for the purpose of assisting a gentleman named Hacket, who stood on the high Tory interest. A stratagem was devised which, it was thought, could not fad of success. It was given out that the poUing would take place at Ailesbury; and Wharton, whose skiU in aU the arts of electioneering was unrivalled, made his arrangements on that supposi tion. At a moment's warning the sheriff adjourned the poll to Newport Paguell. Wharton and his friends hurried thither, and found that Hacket, who was in the secret, had already secured every inn and lodging. The Whig freeholders were compelled to tie their horses to the hedges, and to sleep under the open sky in the meadows which surround the little town. It was with the greatest difficulty that refreshments could be pro cured at such short notice for so large a number of men and beasts, though Wharton, who was utterly regardless of money when his ambition and party spirit were roused, disbursed fifteen hundred pounds in one day \u2014 an immense outlay for those times. Injustice seems, however, to have animated the courage of the stout-hearted yeomen of Bucks, the sons of the constituents of John Hampden. Not only was Wharton at the head of the poU, but he was able to spare his second votes to a man of moderate opinions, and to throw out the Chief Justice's candidate. \u2014 Macaulay's \" History.\" Tricked by the Sheriff. \u2014 John Evelyn writes : \" April 8, 1685. \u2014 This day my brother of Wotton and Mr. Onslow were candidates for Surrey against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin Sir Edward Evelyn, and were circumvented in their election by a trick of the sheriff's \u2014 taking advantage of my brother's party going out of the smaU vUlage of Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the as ternoone being tempestuous \u2014 proceeding to the election when they were gone, they expecting the next morning ; whereas before and then they exceeded the other party by many hundreds, as I am assured. The Duke of Norfolk led Sir Edw. Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party. For this Parliament, very meane and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clearkes, and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up, but the country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it by the trick above mentioned.\" An Election for Norfolk Two Hundred Tears Ago. \u2014 Sir Thomas Browne, the learned physician of Norwich, writing to his son Edward, then a member of the CoUege of Physicians and residing in London, gives the following account of the election of representatives for the shire of Norfolk : \" Norwich, May 7th, 1679. \u2014 Our election was the last Monday. The competitors were the former elected Sir Christopher Calthorp and Sir Neuille Catelyn, and Sir John Hobart and Mr. Wind ham.

They came not down from the hill vntiU eleven o'clocke at night. Sir John Hobart and Sir NeuiUe Catelyn caryed it, and were caryed on chayres about the market-place after eleuen o'clocke, with"], [529, "ELECTIONS. 509 trumpets and torches, candles being lighted at windowes, and the markets place full of people. I could not butt obserue the great number of horses which were in the towne, and conceive there might haue been fiue or six thousand which in time of need might seme for dragoone horses ; besides a great number of coach horses, and very good sadle horses of the better sort. Wine wee had none butt sack and Rhenish, except some made prouision thereof before hand ; butt there was a strange consumption of beere and bread and cakes. Abundance of people slept in the markett place, and laye like flockes of sheep in and about the crosse.\" Letting Loose the Tap. \u2014 Roger North, in his \" Life of Lord Keeper Guilford,\" relates that \" Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, succeeded Sir Francis North in the burgess-ship of Lynn (1685), but not so easy and cheap ; for his managers did not keep in due bounds, but let loose the tap all over that large town, and made an account of 7000Z. or more resting due to the town, besides what had been paid for the expenses.\" A Call for Reform. \u2014 John Evelyn thus writes, in 1696, to Lord Godolphin, First Commissioner of the Treasury : \" Truly, my lord, I cannot but wonder and even stand amaz'd that Parliaments should have sate from time to time, so many hundred yeares, and value their constitu tion to that degree as the most sovraine remedy for the rodresse of publiq grievances, whilst the greatest still remaine unreform'd and untaken away. Witnesse the confus'd, debauch'd, and riotous manner of electing members qualified to become the representatives of a nation, with legislative power to dispose of the fate of kingdomes ; which should and would be compos'd of worthy persons, of known integritie and ability in their respective countries, and still would serve them generously, and as their ancestors have don, but are not able to fling away a son or daughter's portion to bribe the votes of a drunken multitude, more resembling a pagan bac chanalia than an assembly of Christians and sober men met upon the most solemn occasion that can concerne a people, and stand in competition with some rich scrivener, brewer, banker, or one in some gainfull office whose face or name, perhaps, they never saw or knew before. How, my lord, must this sound abroad ! With what dishonour and shame at home ! \" A Simple Ceremony. \u2014 Formerly, says Waller (1673), \"the neigh bourhood desired a candidate to serve ; there was a dinner, and so an end ; but now it is a kind of an empire. Some hundred years ago, some boroughs sent not ; they could get none to serve ; but now it is in fashion, and a fine thing they are revived.\" A Dinner to Voters. \u2014 The following appears in the Annual Register, 1761, as an exact account of the articles consumed at dmner only, by the voters of a small borough, on the day of electing their members; independently of veal, mutton, poultry, pastry, &c., and a preparatory break fast, which last alone cost \"hdl. Consumption at dinner : \u2014 980 stone of beef; 315 dozen of wine; 72 pipes of ale; and 365 gallons of spirits converted into punch. The Pat and the Lean Voters. \u2014 Frederick Douglas, Lady Glenbervie's son, sat in Parliament for the family borough of Baubury, and amused us one day (says Harford in his \" Recollections of Wilber-"], [530, "510 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. force \"), by teUing what had formerly occurred to some recreant electors, who had ventured, though vainly, to oppose Lord North's nomination of the mayor, shortly before the annual dinner, to which his lordship was in the habit of sending venison. The old steward, whUe carving it, sent plenty of fat to the obedient voters, but made the rebels feelingly sensible of his displeasure, by exclaiming, as he dispatched their respective plates, \" Those who didn't vote for my lord's Mayor sha'n't have none of my lord's fat ! \" Origin of Conveyance of Electors and Splitting Free holds for Votes. \u2014 In January, 1679, the Parliament, which had been in existence ever since the beginning of the year 1661, was dissolved, aud writs were issued for a general election. During some weeks (writes Macatday) \" the contention over the whole country was fierce and obstinate beyond example. Unprecedented sums were expended. New tactics were employed. It was remarked by the pamphleteers of that time as something extraordinary that horses were hired at a great charge for tho conveyance of electors. Tho practice of splitting freeholds, for the purpose of multiplying votes, dates from this memorable struggle.\" Wholesale Multiplication of Preeholds. \u2014 Oldfield relates that a committee was appointed to try the petition of John Arbuthnot, Esq., on the 10th February, 1804, against the return of certain candidates for Weymouth. In consequence of the decision of this committee, twr/ hundred freeholds were at once split into two thousand. Freeholders of Weymouth were to be found in London, and in almost all the towns and villages to the Land's End in Cornwall, and in the islands of Jersey and Guernsey, whence many hundreds were afterwards brought at an enormous expense to vote at every election for this borough. Some even voted for the thirteen-hundredth part of a sixpenny freehold. Fagot Votes in 1877. \u2014 At Exeter Registration Court, in October, 1877, thirty-two claims were made by Conservatives in respect of rent charges on one house. The property was bought two years before from the trustees of the Earl of Devon, who sold under an order of the Court of Chancery. Mr. Henry Drew, brother of Lord Devon's steward, was the purchaser, and he admitted having bought for the express purpose of creating votes. He said he gave 1350/., but had made 1600?. of the rent charges, while he valued the residence at over 200?. ; it was a specula tion, and had paid him weU. He was not aware that the tenant had previously offered 1600?. for the property. The Earl of Devon knew nothing of the intention to manufacture these votes, but a good many claimants were tenants of his lordship. \u2014 On behalf of the Liberals it was contended that the deed conveying the property to Mr. Drew was void. The Revising Barrister allowed Mr. Drew's claim, but intimated that he should require personal attendance of every one of the other claimants. The Fagot Vote in Midlothian. \u2014 In bringing forward a motion in favour of household suffrage in counties, in 1879, Mr. Trevelyan com mented upon the recent creation of a large number of fagot votes by members of the Conservative party in Midlothian, in anticipation of the next contest for the representation of that con uty, in which Mr. Gladstone"], [531, "ELECTIONS. 511 had announced his intention to take part. Lord Claud HamUton repUed, defending the votes recently made, and he referred to the tactics of Mr. Cobden. Speaking in London, November 26, 1849, that gentleman said : \" In that great division (the West Riding of Yorkshire), at present containing 37,000 voters, Lord Morpeth was, as you are aware, defeated on the question of free trade, and two protectionists were returned. I went into the West Riding with this 40s. freehold plan. I stated in every borough and district that we must have 5000 qualifications made in two years. They were made. The siUy people who opposed us raised the cry that the Anti-Corn Law League had bought the qualifications. Such a cry was ridiculous. We foUowed the same plan in South Lanca shire, and with a similar result. Our friends walked over the course at the next election, though at the previous ono we had not a chance.\" Fagot Voting Extraordinary. \u2014 At the Revision Court at Oxford, in September, 1883, an objection was lodged by the Liberals against a clergyman, bursar of Lincoln College, on the ground that he did not occupy the house for which he claimed. It was stated that he was one of the largest fagot-voters in England, and he admitted that at the last election he voted seventeen times, and then was obliged to miss seven places where he was entitled to vote. He claimed to be represented in Parliament by 64 members. The objection was overruled, as the gentle man stated that he owned the house, and had used it during the year. Mr. Bright referred to this case in a speech in Yorkshhe shortly after, when he said : \" We saw the other day a statement in the papers of a reverend gentleman at Oxford. I think he stated that he had twenty-four qualifications for voting. Of course this included a vote in Oxford city, in the University, the county, and many other places all over the country. He had actually been so active, so energetic, and so patriotic in his mistaken views that he had polled at one general election no less than seventeen times. I should suggest that that sort of thing should be put an end to. I am against disfranchising anybody, but I should have no reluctance in voting that he should be shut off from twenty-three of those qualifications.\" Potwalloping.\u2014 This qualification for the suffrage, extinct since the passing of the first Reform Bill, consisted in having \" boUed a pot \" in a parliamentary borough for a certain time \u2014 usually six months \u2014 prior to an election. It was, in fact, residential qualification expressed in a popular term, which is said to have been partly derived from the Saxon weallan, to boU. Scot and Lot.\u2014 Scot or shot (says Richardson) is so much cast or thrown down as a share of the whole sum to be paid ; and lot means aUot ment or portion assigned. To pay scot and lot, therefore, was for a person to pay the ordinary tributes, and also the personal tax allotted to him. A curiously elastic provision in reference to this qualification is recorded in \"Determinations of the House of Commons concerning Elections\" (1753) : \" 11th January, 1699.\u2014 Resolved, that the mayor, aldermen, and aU the inhabitants within the borough of Newark-upon-Trent, who pay, or ought to pay, scot and lot within the said borough, have a right to"], [532, "512 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. vote at the election of members to serve in Parliament for the said borough.\" Household Suffrage. \u2014 This principle, which excited so much con troversy during the passage of the Reform Bill of 1867, and was eventually adopted subject to the payment of poor rate, existed in simpUcity in the case of many boroughs in former times. \" PotwaUoping \" was another name for it, but in occasional instances wo find it expressly laid down. The \"Determinations concerning Elections,\" just quoted, include, for instance, a decision of the House, Jan. 28, 1695 : \" Resolved, that the right of election of burgesses to serve in Parliament for the borough of Aylisbury, in the county of Bucks, is in aU the householders of the said borough, not receiving alms.\" The same principle governed the elections at Northampton. In most cases, however, the payment of scot and lot, without admission of default as in the Newark instance, was an essential condition. Honorary Freemen. \u2014 In the East Retford case, decided in the Court of King's Bench in 1802 (reports Oldfield), \" it appeared to have been the custom for two hundred and twenty years for the sheriffs and aldermen to make whom they pleased freemen, for the purpose of creating voters, till they became so confident of their possessing such a power that they proceeded to create forty-two honorary freemen at one time. This caused an information in the nature of a quo warranto to be filed within six years, as the statute limits such information to that period after they obtain the freedom of any corporation. Upon hearing the same, the bailiffs and aldermen pleaded a custom of two hundred and twenty years. Upon which it was observed that it had been also customary to rob upon the highway for so many years, but that it was always the custom to hang the offender when he was detected. Judgment of ouster was issued against the whole forty-two honorary freemen.\" The \"Christians\" of Shoreham. \u2014 In 1771, the House of Commons discussed a proposal for the cUsf ranchisement of New Shoreham. It had been discovered that corruption of the most flagrant character existed in the borough, chiefly under the auspices of a body caUed \" The Christian Club,\" which, professedly formed for the promotion of religion and charity, exercised its functions in negotiating the sale of the seat for the borough to the highest bidder. This was done by the agency of a secret committee, which concluded a transaction with the most liberal candidate, received the money, and divided the spoil among the club generally. As the members of this committee abstained from voting themselves, on the ground of conscientious scruples, they escaped the imputation of bribery, until a disagreement with the returning officer> who was in their confidence, led him to reveal all their plans. It appeared that at this particular election there were five candidates, only two of whom came near the mark with their offers. General Smith offered 3000?. down, and to benefit the place by building shipping. Mr. Rumbold bid 35?. a vote to aU the freemen, and was consequently chosen by the com mittee. The returning officer, however, preferred the General, and the disagreement led to an open quarrel. The Opposition of the day wished"], [533, "ELECTIONS. 513 to disfranchise the borough, but were outvoted, the House resolving instead that eighty-one of the freemen should forfeit the franchise for ever, and that the boundary of the borough for the future should be extended to the Rape of Bramber. \"The Borough of Old Sarum.\"\u2014 The Rev. T. Mozley writes in his \" Reminiscences,\" that having to take the early day service for a friend at Stratford-sub-Castle, near Salisbury, he found the congregation consisted of \"the clerk, some school chUdren, and a bright-looking old fellow, with a full, rubicund face and a profusion of white hair. The service over, the children went to the parsonage for the breakfast they had well earned. The old gentleman hung behind, waiting for me. He expressed his warm approval of the daily service. When people had nothing else to do, they could not do better than say prayers. For his part, his work was over, and he was proud of it. He had been the borough of Old Sarum, and had returned two representatives to Parlia ment for forty years, all honest men and gentlemen, not the sort of f eUows they were sending to Parliament ' in these days.' \" Stones Voting. \u2014 In the \"History of Sussex\" it is mentioned, respecting the old borough of Midhurst, \" There were formerly 120 burgage tenements, which entitled their respective owners to vote. One of the Lords Montague pulled some of them down that he might enlarge Cowdray Park, but had stones inscribed ' A Burgage ' put into the waU to indicate their sites. Hence it was said that at Midhurst the very stones voted for Members of Parliament.\" Sale of Boroughs. \u2014 Professor Pryme says : \" I have seen an advertisement, before Grampound was disfranchised, offering a borough for sale (Westbury), as not only to be sold, but to be sold by order of the Court of Chancery. A short time before the Reform Bill, Lord Monson paid 100,000?. for Gatton, which contained about twenty-five houses, and rather more than one hundred inhabitants. Mr. Aubrey, feUow-commoner of Trinity College, and nephew of Sir J. Aubrey, told mo that his uncle, whose heir he was, thought that he could not spend 1000?. a-year more pleasantly than in buying a borough and sitting in ParUament. He sat for Aldborongh, in Yorkshire, by arrangement with its proprietor, Mr. De Crespigny, and on the understanding that he was to vote as he pleased. He did not pay 1000?. annuaUy for the privUege, but calculated that it cost him that. 5000?. was the sum usually paid for a seat.\" Proprietary Bights. \u2014 Earl Russell relates in his \" Recollections :\" \" One noble lord used to go out hunting foUowed by a tail of six or 6even members of Parliament of his own making. Another, being asked who should be returned for one of his boroughs, named a waiter at White's Club ; but as he did not know the man's Christian name, the election was declared void, and a fresh election was held, when, the name having been ascertained, the waiter was duly elected. . . A seat for the whole duration of a Parliament was sold for 5000?. But as Parlia ments were subject to sudden death, prudent men made a bargain to pay 1000?. a year so long as they sate in the House of Commons. Mr. Ricardo and many others were members of the House of Commons in virtue of L L"], [534, "514 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. such payment. Sir Francis Burdett entered Parliament by purchase of a seat from the trustees of the Duke of Newcastle\u2014 a minor.\" An \" Elegant Contingency.\" \u2014 Thomas Holcroft, the dramatist, was member of a poUtical club caUed \" The Society for Constitutional Information,\" and in 1794 was prosecuted for high treason, with other members of that body. He drew up a paper in his own defence, in which he gave the following as an instance of the corrupt state of the parUamentary representation : \" The borough of Gatton, within these two years, was publicly advertised for sale by auction : not sold for a single parUament, but the fee simple of the borough, with the power of nominating the two representatives for ever. On the day of sale, the celebrated auctioneer scarcely noticed the value of the estate. The rental, the mansion, the views, the woods and waters, were unworthy regard, compared to what he called an elegant contingency. Yes, the right of nominating two members to Parliament, without the embarrassment of voters, was an elegant contingency ! ' Need I teU you, gentlemen,' said he, glancing round the room with ineffable self-satisfaction, and exulting in what he caUed the jewel, the unique, which was under his hammer, ' Need I tell you, gentle men, that this elegant contingency is the only infallible source of fortune, titles, and honours in this happy country ? That it leads to the highest situations in the State ? And that, meandering through the tempting sinuosities of ambition, the purchaser wiU find the margin strewed with roses, and his head quickly crowned with those precious garlands that flourish in fuU vigour round the fountain of honour ? On this halcyon sea, if any gentleman who has made his fortune in either of the Indies chooses once more to embark, he may repose in perfect quiet. No hurri canes to dread ; no tempestuous passions to aUay ; no tormenting claims of insolent electors to evade ; no tinkers' wives to kiss ; no impossible promises to make ; none of the toUsome and not very clean paths of canvassing to drudge through ; but, his mind at ease and his conscience clear, with this elegant contingency in his pocket, the honours of the State await his plucking, and with its emoluments his purse will overflow.' \" Administrations and Rotten Boroughs. \u2014 Lord Palmerston wrote as foUows in his Journal, respecting the manipulation of con stituencies by the Grenville Administration in 1806 : \" The method adopted by Ministers with regard to their borough seats was very politic and ingenious. They purchased seats from their friends at a low price, making up the deficiency probably by appointments and promotions. These seats they afterwards sold out at the average market price to men who oromised them support; and with the difference they carried on their contested elections. The sum raised in this manner was stated, by a person who was in the secret, to be inconceivably great, and accounts for an assertion afterwards made by Lord Grenville in the Lords', that ' not one guinea of the public money had been spent in elections.' \" This observation by Lord Palmerston (as his biographer, Lord DaUing, remarks) seems to imply that the spending public money for party elections would not have been deemed, on the part of any Government, an extra ordinary occurrence."], [535, "515 ELECTIONS. Dear Seats. \u2014 Sir Samuel Romilly wrote as foUows in his diary, in 1807 : \" I shaU procure myself a seat in the new Parliament, and Tierney, who manages this business for the friends of the late Administration, assures me he can hear of no seats to be disposed of. After a ParUament which has lived little more than four months, one would naturally suppose that those seats which are regularly sold by the proprietors of them would be very cheap; they are, in fact, sold now at a higher price than was ever given for them before. Tierney teUs me that he has offered 10,000?. for the two seats at Westbury, the property of the late Lord Abingdon, and which are to be made the most of by trustees for creditors, and had met with a refusal. 6000?. and 5500?. have been given for seats with no stipulation as to time, or against the event of a speedy dissolution by the King's death, or by any change of Administration.\" Depreciated Value. \u2014 After the dissolution of 1831, the price of rotten boroughs was greatly diminished by the anticipation of the eventual passage of a Bill sweeping them away. Mr. Torrens relates that Lord Yarborough, as guardian of the daughter of Sir L. Holmes, sold to the Government for 4000?. the next presentation to the eight political staUs iu St. Stephen's appurtenant to her property in the Isle of Wight. The eight incumbents duly prayed for sudden death, and had the rare privdege of performing the part of chief mourners at their own funerals. Boroughmongering after the Reform Bill. \u2014 Mr. Grevdle writes, Dec. 4, 1835 : \" Lord Segrave has got the Gloucestershire Lieu tenancy, and this appointment, disgraceful in itself, exhibits aU the most objectionable features of the old boroughmongering system, which was supposed to be swept away. He was in London as soon as the breath was out of the Duke of Beaufort's body, went to Melbourne, and claimed the appointment on the score of having three members, which was nioro than any other man in England now returned. ' My brothers,' he said, ' the electors do not know by sight ; it is my influence which returns them.' The appeal was irresistible, and ' We are three ' was as imperative with Melbourne as ' We are seven ' was with the Duke of Newcastle. Tho scarcity of the commodity enhances its value, and now that nominations are swept away, the few who are stiU fortunate enough to possess some remnants are great men ; and Segrave's three brothers, thrown (as they would without scruple have been) into the opposite scale, would have nearly turned it.\" The First Conviction for Bribery. \u2014 In the session of 1571, a fine was imposed on the borough of Westbury, for receiving a bribe of four pounds from Thomas Long, \" being a very simple man and of smaU capacity to serve in that place ; \" and the mayor was ordered to repay the money. Long, however, does not seem to have been expeUed. This is the earliest precedent on record for the punishment of bribery in elections. \u2014 Hallam's \" Constitutional History.\" Magisterial Delinquents. \u2014 In 1716 (writes Oldfield), PhiUp Ward, Esq., Mayor of Oxford, in conjunction with several other magis trates of the city, wrote a letter to Sir Thomas Stapylton and the Hon. Robert Lee, their members, offering to elect them again at the next h L 2"], [536, "516 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. general election for a stated sum of money. The letter was produced in the House ; whereupon the writers were ordered to be arrested and com mitted to Newgate. After a confinement of some time, they were dis charged, upon petitioning the House, having first been reprimanded on their knees by the Speaker. Imprisonment for Bribery. \u2014 The Annual Register for 1804 records : Alexander Davidson, Esq., the opulent banker and contractor ; John White Parsons, and Thomas Hopping, gents., have been sentenced by the Court of King's Bench, for gross bribery and corruption at the late Bchester election, to twelve months' confinement in the Marshalsea prison. A Heavy Punishment for Bribery.\u2014 On March 18th, 1819, Sir Manasseh Lopes, Bart., was tried and convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of 10,000?., and to be imprisoned in Exeter Gaol for two years, for bribing several of the electors of the borough of Grampound. With reference to this case, Lord John RusseU moved in the House of Commons (July 11th, 1820) that the House should address the Throne to remit part of the punishment. The motion, after some discussion, was withdrawn. A Constituency Heavily Fined. \u2014 In recent times we have an instance of a somewhat heavy penalty falUng upon a constituency for cor rupt practices at an election, as the foUowing statement from the Times of 6th March, 1871, wiU show : \" The Bridgewater Town Council were on Friday informed that they would have to pay 3146?. as the cost of their election commission. It was stated that the payment would necessitate a rate of 2s. 6d. in the pound.\" In the end it amounted to 3s. Price of Votes. \u2014 Previously to the Reform BiU of 1832, pecuniary influence had operated upon the electors of many boroughs to an extent scarcely now to be imagined. At HnU and Beverley, and probably at many other places, it was customary after the election to give four guineas for a single vote, or two for a divided one. At Hedon, a smaU borough and sea-port on the Humber, now disfranchised, it was usual to give twenty guineas for a single vote, and ten for a divided one. Before an election there was no actual promise made, but the voter woidd say on being canvassed, \" You wiU do what is usual after the election, sir, I suppose P \" and the candidate would reply in the affirmative. Many of the poor electors did not wait for an election, but borrowed of the member sums of money, for which they gave a promissory note. When an election came, ten or twenty guineas was receipted upon the note, the residue of which stiU gave the candidate a hold upon the elector for a future occasion. This was told to me (says Pryme) by Mr. Chaytor, of Spennithorne, in Wensleydale, who long represented the borough. To show the extent to which corruption prevaUed, I may mention that when the Reform BiU was spoken of to some electors in Stafford, they expressed their pleasure at it, and hoped that there would be introduced into it some plan for the better payment of poor voters ! St. Alban's was on the Great North Road, which gave the town prosperity by its posting ; and it was said of its inhabitants, when the great inn was given up, that they re marked, \" We have nothing now left to seU but our votes.\" \u2014 Pryme's"], [537, "517 ELECTIONS. \u25a0\" Recollections.\" Oldfield, in his \" Representative History,\" states that the freemen of the borough of Grampound had been known to boast of receiving three hundred guineas a man for their votes at one election. Respecting the general election of 1826, the Times of June 20th of that year has the foUowing : \"During tho election at Sudbury, four cabbages sold for \u00a310, and a plate of gooseberries fetched \u00a325 ; the sellers where these articles were so dear being voters. At Great Marlow, on the con trary, things were cheap, and an elector during the election bought a sow and nine young pigs for a penny.\" A Visitor from the Moon. \u2014 When the borough of Wendover was in the possession of Earl Verney, the electors in general Uved rent free on condition of giving their votes to his lordship's nominee. A remark able circumstance happened in 1768, in connection with this mutual arrangement, which Oldfield describes. In the year named, a Mr. Atkins had undertaken, by a coup-de-main, to carry the election against his lordship's interest ; and quite unexpectedly, on the day of the election, Sir Robert DarUng was proposed and returned by a considerable majority. The voters were punished for their treachery to their superior by being instantly ejected from their houses, and were obliged to take refuge in huts and tents for six months, when, upon a proper acknowledgment of their contrition, they were allowed to repossess their former dweUings. In 1784, his lordship being in straits, the voters retaUated upon him by \u2022engaging with two candidates against his lordship's interest and influence, for a sum of 6,000?. This being settled, a gentleman was employed to go down, when he was met, according to previous appointment, by the electors at a mile from tho town. The electors asked the stranger where he came from. He replied, \" From tho moon.\" They then asked, \" What news from the moon H \" He answered that ho had brought from thenco 6,000?. to bo distributed among them. Tho electors, being thus satisfied with the golden news from the moon, chose the candidates and received their reward. The \" Dancing Punch.\" \u2014 The Annual Register for 1775 says : \u2014 In the course of the evidence given before the select committee appointed to try and determine the Hindon election, the foUowing circumstances came out. On a day previous to the election, a man, disguised in a fan tastic female habit, went about the town to canvass for two of the can didates. This figure, which was caUed the Dancing Punch, called at the door of almost every elector, and gave each five or ten guineas ; and sent for such as had not been canvassed at their own houses, to an inn in tho town, and there distributed its favours in the same manner. Some others in the opposite interest attended in an outer apartment of the house where their friends sat in an inner room, and there obUged the electors to sign an acknowledgment for a certain sum of money, which being done, a paper containing ten or fifteen guineas was handed out to every elector through a hole in the door. Upon that and other evidence the committee resolved, That Richard Smith and Thomas Brand Hollis, Esqs., had been returned by notorious bribery; That the House be moved for leave to bring in a biU to disfranchise the borough of Hindon, in Wilts. These"], [538, "518 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. resolutions were confirmed by the House on the 24th of February, when it was also decided that no writ should be issued for one month. It appears, however, from Oldfield's \" Representative History,\" that the disfranchising bill was not passed, and a new writ was ordered to be issued on the 8th of May, 1776. \" Gold Pills.\" \u2014 In an article on \" Bribery, Ancient and Modern.\" in the Quarterly Review, it is remarked that, \"As in the history of th < Roman Republic, so in the history of England, the form of corruption which meets us oftenest is the direct bribery of the electorate. This first became an organised system under Charles II. It reached its climax under George III., who recognised and recommended it. Writing to Lord North, October 16, 1779, ho said, ' If the Duke of Northumberland requires some gold pills for the election, it would be wrong not to satisfy him.' These expenses were paid out of the King's Civil List, and were a heavy burden on his resources. The Secret Service money seems at present to be spent in electioneering.\" * \" Mister Most.\" \u2014 Lord Dundonald relates in his \"Autobiography,\" that while canvassing the electors of Honiton one of these independents said to him, \" You need not ask me, my lord, who I votes for; I always votes for Mr. Most.\" An Election Ruse. \u2014 Lord Dundonald also tells that when he first stood for Honiton (while Lord Cochrane) he refused to give bribes, and the seat was secured by his opponent, who paid five pounds a head. On this, Cochrane determined that the next time there was a vacancy in the borough the seat should be his without bribery ; and he sent the bellman round the town to proclaim that all persons who had voted for him might repair to his agent and receive ten guineas. At the next election no questions were asked, and he was triumphantly returned. This effected (he says in his \"Autobiography\"), \"it was then plainly asked what ex \"tost facto consideration was to be expected by those who had supported me in so delicate a manner. ' Not one farthing ! ' was the reply. ' But, my lord, you gave ten guineas a head to the minority at the last election, and the majority have been calculating on something handsome on the present occasion.' ' No doubt. The former gift was for their disinterested con duet in not taking the bribe of five pounds from the agents of my opponent. For me now to pay them would be a violation of my own previously expressed principles ! ' \" The Rich and the Poor Candidate. \u2014 The story is told by Mr. Abraham Hayward that he had given a dinner to Louis Blanc, and some prosy guest had been elaborately explaining the working of our Constitu tion to the French historian. Mr. Quintin Dick, a wealthy West Indian, who had for long been returned by the borough of West Looe, at length lost all patience. He broke out : \" At the last election I spoke to my constituents as follows : ' Gentlemen, my opponent is a very poor man with a large family. I am a rich man, and I thank God all I care for in this world is covered by my hat.' I put my hat on my head, and they * This came out in answer to questions in Parliament in the spring of 1886,"], [539, "ELECTIONS. 519 returned me. That, sir, is the practical working of the British Con stitution.\" Parliamentary Agents and Bribery. \u2014 On the second reading of the St. Alban's Disfranchisemeut Bill, in March, 1852, Mr. Jacob BeU, who had been returned for the borough, rose in its defence, and in the course of his speech thus commented on the general corruption which he maintained rendered St. Alban's no worse than other places : \" There were certain expenses which were illegal, but which, nevertheless, must be paid \u2014 not the purest election in the world could be conducted without them \u2014 and yet, in the strict letter of the law, they endangered the seat. Consequently, it was necessary to employ various agents. The genus ' Parliamentary agent ' comprised several species. Those who performed what was called the ' awkward business ' must be cunning, ingenious, and energetic, and must have a contrivance at hand to meet every case. They must be indefatigable, fear nothing but defeat, care for nothing but victory. These agents, while performing the most slippery business behind the candidate's back, must convince him when in his presence that they were the purest persons in the world, and that, if a shiUing im properly spent could save his election, they would not expend it. They perpetrated the most unblushing wrong in the most daring manner. They had many methods of accomplishing their purpose, of which an example or two might be instructive. A Parliamentary agent of this kind bad a room in some part of the town called a committee-room, but which the candidate never heard of. When an elector came he was ushered into the presence of the agent, who would say, ' Well, Mr. Smith, how do you do to-day ? ' at the same time holding up three fingers, to signify he was to have three sovereigns. The elector would perhaps say, if ho were dissatisfied with the amount, ' I am not veiy w eU to-day.' The agent then, holding up five fingers, would say, ' I am sorry you are not weU to-day, Mr. Smith.' The elector would then say, ' Oh, I am not very iU. It is aU right.' He would then go and look out of the window, and while he was doing so the agent would put five sovereigns unou the table. The agent would then go and look out of the window in his turn, and the elector would walk to the table, and when the agent turned round the elector was gone, and the sovereigns had vanished. The elector did not see the agent put down the money, and the agent did not see the elector take it up. When a Parliamentary Committee was appointed, the agent swore he never gave any money, aud the elector swore no one gave him any. When the five honourable gentlemen who sat upon the committee heard this, they said, ' There has been some clever management here, but there is no evidence.' . . This was only one method in which bribery was carried on. He had heard of fifteen or twenty guineas being given for a canary bird. There was another method which was much more easy to practice without risk of detection \u2014 that of employing people for various purposes, and paying them. There were usuaUy a great number of agents, spies, secretaries, and messengers, aU retained for five or six weeks preparatory to an election, and paid so much a week. These were put down as legal charges, though if thoroughly"], [540, "520 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. sifted it would be found that almost the only service these people per formed was at the hustings or polUng-booth. . . He claimed indulgence for his borough. It was in the mud, and he was in the mud with it, but he would never shrink from performing his duty towards it.\" Mr. Bell's arguments were ineffectual. The biU passed, and St. Alban's no more afforded practice for parUamentary agents. A \" Good and Safe Man \" Wanted. \u2014 At the general election in 1852, some curious circumstances occurred at Derby. A leading member of the Liberal committee, accompanied by two or three policemen, obtained access to a committee-room of the Ministerial candidate, where they found seated at the table a man named Morgan, who had a pile of money before him, and a book in which were entered the names of several of the electors, with marks affixed. He was arrested, and on examination before a magistrate admitted that the book contained the names of persons who had received money for their votes. Upon him was found a letter running as foUows : \" A good and safe man, with judgment and quickness, wanted immediately at Derby. I suppose that you cannot leave your own place ; if not, send some one in whom you can trust in your place. Let him go to Derby on receiving this, and find the County Tavern in the centre of the town, and send his card to Cox, Brothers, and Company, leadworks, as coming from Chester. That will be enough. \u2014 W. B., Monday.\" This letter was addressed to Mr. Frail, of Shrewsbury, a weU-known electioneering agent ; and an inquiry into the Derby election being held by a select committee of the House of Commons, they reported that an organised system of bribery prevailed in the borough, and that the letter was written by the Right Hon. WUUam Beresford, Secretary-at-War. They did not, how ever, think thero , was sufficient evidence of his complicity in Ulegal transactions, but they considered the letter \" exhibited a reckless in difference and disregard to consequences which they cannot too highly censure.\" \" The Man in the Moon.\" \u2014 An election commission pursuing its inquiries into bribery at Wakefield, in 1859, came across several references to an individual caUed \" the Man in the Moon,\" who appeared to have been actively concerned as an agent in electoral corruption. At length a witness said he had engaged the man in question. \u2014 Mr. Serjeant Pigott : Who is he ? \u2014 Witness : WeU, I'd rather not disclose his name yet ; but I can produce him if necessary. The secret has been so well kept that it would be a pity to disclose it before it is necessary. \u2014 Serjeant Pigott : Can you produce him to-day ? \u2014 Witness : Oh, yes; he is hard by. I can bring him in at once. \u2014 Serjeant Pigott : We shall be delighted to see him.- \u2014 Witness then left the court, and in a few minutes returned with the \"Man in the Moon,\" who said his name was Whitehead, and he was an upholsterer at Bradford, but had been in the habit of taking part in electioneering affairs. \u2014 Mr. Serjeant Pigott : I suppose you know you went by the name of \"the Man in the Moon\" while you were here? Whitehead : Well, I believe that was my designation. \u2014 Serjeant Pigott : And there is no doubt about your identity ? \u2014 Whitehead : Oh dear no; I'm the man, sure enough."], [541, "ELECTIONS. 521 The Hole in the Wall.\u2014 In the election of 1868 for the city of Dublin, each freeman got his five-pound note from a hole in the wall. The same thing was done at Beverley about the same time. At Shaftesbury, in 1774, an alderman of the town, disguised as Punch, passed through a hole in the door twenty guineas to each voter, for which each had to sign a biU payable to a fictitious \" Glenbucket,\" to disguise the nature of tho transaction. \u2014 Quarterly Review.

Corrupt Practices in 1880. \u2014 The elections in 1880 were in many"], [542, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 522 cases exceedingly corrupt, and gave rise to some remarkable inquiries. The Commission which sat at Macclesfield reported that they were \"much struck by the open, fearless, and confiding manner in which corruption was practised on both sides.\" They went on to say that, \" though it seems doubtful whether a contested election has ever been fought in Macclesfield on reaUy pure principles, the corruption at the late election was far more widespread and far more open than had been the case at any previous Parliamentary election.\" They scheduled 2872 persons as guilty of corrupt practices, including tbe two members unseated on petition, as weU as certain justices of the peace, aldermen, and counciUors. They also gave it as their opinion that, out of 6000 voters, more than 5000 had been operated on by bribery. Both sides engaged \"money captains,\" who distributed bribes among the electors in their respective wards. Here, as in many other places, electors confessed to having received money from both parties. One of the unseated members said he had taken part in politics since 1832, when his father was first elected, and had succeeded him in the representation. \" He had no doubt there was a good deal of ordinary Parliamentary electoral amusement going on at the late election. It had been the custom in Macclesfield since 1832 to distribute refreshment tickets to voters after the election. He could remember standing at the polling booth presenting voters with tickets in his father's name, giving 6s. for a single vote and 12s. for a plumper. Not infrequently tickets dissolved into drink, and he remembered one woman teUing how she and her husband bought a barrel of ale, took it home, sat up with it, and ' rostled ' with it till it was finished. Candidates were on happy terms with the voters in those days, and there was a general jollification at elections.\" \u2014 Sandwich was another remarkable case. Here 1005 persons were reported guilty of corrupt practices, and 127 as having received bribes from both sides. One of these confessed that, having received 3?. from each party, he tossed up a penny to see how he should vote. The Commissioners reported, \" It did not appear that the mode of taking votes by ballot had the slightest effect in checking bribery. On the contrary, whUe it enabled luany voters to take bribes on both sides, it did not, as far as we could ascertain, render a single person unwilling to bribe for fear of bribing in vain.\" The agent of one candidate, whose expenses were returned at 3153?., confessed to an outlay of 5600?. \u2014 At Chester similar practices prevailed. A witness here said that beer was flowing like water, and men and women were drinking it aU day. They were all drunk. \u2014 At Glou cester, 1916 electors admitted having received bribes to the amount of about 2500?. The Commissioners believed 2756 were bribed out of 4904 who recorded their votes. Magistrates and aldermen were scheduled among the guilty persons. Shops, known as \" sugar shops,\" were hired as centres for the bribing agents, and money was sometimes distributed from them through a hole. \u2014 At Oxford, in addition to other malpractices, the use of forged ballot papers in facsimile was discovered some days after the close of the poll. Punishment for Corrupt Practices. \u2014 Some of the offenders, in the cases of Sandwich and Macclesfield, were brought before the Queen's"], [543, "ELECTIONS. 523 Bench Division for judgment, in November, 1881. Two soUcitors of Macclesfield were sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, without classification as misdemeanants, the judges saying, \" there was no reason for treating persons convicted of bribery differently from persons who had committed other offences of a bad character.\" A solicitor and a town councillor of Sandwich were sentenced to six months' imprisonment each, and six other offenders in the borough to terms of two and three months respectively. Increased Prevalence of Corruption. \u2014 At a conference of Liberal associations held in the City of London, December, 1883, Lord GranviUe said : \" With regard to the mode of electing members to the House of Commons, it was hoped by some that a self-acting process of purification was going on ; but if anybody entertained that notion, it must have been rudely dispelled by the last general election in 1880. I believe it is an undoubted fact that two and a half millions of money were spent then, the greater part of which would have been more usefully and more beneficiaUy employed if it had been thrown into the sea. A greater number of individuals were bribed than had ever been bribed before, and some constituencies were so notoriously corrupt that no one belonging to them ventured to lodge a petition on the subject. Nineteen petitions were, however, presented, and the result showed a frightful extent of bribery and corruption, and, what was stiU more material, an immense demoralisation in the tone and sentiment with which these practices were regarded. Her Majesty's Government had not hesitated to grapple with this great evU, and last year successfully carried their bill, the object of which was to try to stop corrupt practices, and to prevent unnecessary expense being thrown upon candidates.\" Disfranchised Voters at Chester. \u2014 In March, 1888, expired the period of seven years during which 700 or 800 citizens of Chester were condemned to lose the franchise, in consequence of corrupt practices during the election of 1880. Owing, however, to the decision of the Revising Barrister, they could not be placed on the register in time to exercise the franchise until January 1, 1889. The city itself was dis franchised for some time, and under the Redistribution Bill was granted one member only instead of two. The entire expenses of the Royal Com mission appointed to inquire into the corrupt practices alleged to prevaU at Chester were, to the amount of over 4000?., also borne by the ratepayers. Total Cost of Parliamentary Elections.\u2014 A blue-book was published in 1887 containing a return of the costs of aU the candidates at the general election of the previous year, together with the details of such costs, and in each case the maximum scale allowed by the Corrupt Practices Act of 1883. The sums given are inclusive of returning officers' charges. The summary shows that the total sum for England and Wales spent by 857 candidates was 515,683?. (an average of 4s.

Gloucester came next with 4161?., Oxford foUowing with 3781?., Chester with 3352?., Boston with 2760?., Knares borough with 2258?., Sandwich with 2139?., and Canterbury with 1727?. From the classification of the principal items of expenditure, it appeared that the cost of shorthand notes at Macclesfield was 1200?., and at Sandwich 341?. An Expensive Election in Oxfordshire. \u2014 An Oxfordshire election in 1754 was the cause of great party animosities. The sheriff returned all the four candidates, and they aU petitioned, complaining of undue election and double return. After a very long debate, on the 18th of November and on many subsequent days, it was eventually decided that Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner were the sitting members, and that Lord Wenman and Sir James Dashwood had not been duly elected. The sums of money spent on this occasion were enormous. Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann : \" A knowing lawyer said to-day that, with purchasing tenures, votes, and carrying on the election and petition, 55,000?. wiU not pay the whole expense.\" Half a Million spent in an Election. \u2014 In 1807 (writes Oldfield) the most expensive contest took place for the representation of York shire that ever distinguished the annals of electioneering. The candidates were Viscount Milton, son of Earl FitzwiUiam, supported by the Whig party ; the Hon. Henry Lascelles, son of Lord Harewood, proposed by the Tories; and WiUiam Wilberforce, Esq., on the Dissenting and inde pendent interest. The election was carried on with doubtful success between the two party candidates for fifteen days, but Mr. Wilberforce was at the head of the poU for the whole time. It terminated in favour of Mr. Wilberforce and Lord Milton, the numbers being \u2014 For Wilberforce, 11,803; for Lord MUton, 11,177; for Lascelles, 10,990. This contest is said to have cost the three parties near half a million of money. The expenses of Mr. Wilberforce were defrayed by public subscription; and such public zeal was manifested in his favour, that more than double the sum necessary was raised in a few days, and one moiety was afterwards returned to the subscribers. \u2014 Lord Brougham notes that \" The committee"], [545, "ELECTIONS. 525 which conducted Mr. WUberf orce's election for Yorkshire in 1807 state their expenses at 58,000?., with every resource of the most rigid economy, and great voluntary assistance in labour.\" A Yorkshire Lady's Zeal. \u2014 Mrs. Fanny Kenible, in her \" Records of Later Life,\" relates the foUowing of Mrs. Wentworth Beaumont, which she was told by Lord Dacre : \" Left the widowed mistress of a princely estate in Yorkshire, on the occasion when the most passionate contest recorded in modern electioneering times made it doubtful whether the Government candidate, or the one whose politics were more in accordance with her own, would be returned to Parliament, she \u2014 then a very old lady \u2014 drove in her traveUing carriage with four horses to Downing Street, and, demanding to see the Prime Minister, with whom she was weU acquainted, accosted him thus : ' WeU, my lord, are you quite determined to make your man stand for our seat ? ' ' Yes, Mrs. Beaumont, I think quite determined.' ' Very weU,' replied the lady ; ' I am on my way down to Yorkshire with eighty thousand pounds in the carriage for my man. Try and do better than that.' \" The Nottingham Lambs. \u2014 In the year 1790, a fiercely contested election took place for Nottingham. On one of the poUing days, I, being at a window in the market-place, saw the people set ladders against the Exchange HaU, burst through the windows, and seize a depot of con stables' staves, which they cut into bludgeons and threw out to the people below. One of them was aimed at the head of Mr. Smith (one of the caudidates), as he was leaving the hustings in the market-place, but he was saved by having on an exceedingly high- crowned hat, such as was then fashionable. \u2014 Pryme's \" Recollections.\" Tho professor's daughter adds in a note, \" On July 12, 1865, about ten a.m., an attack was made by the Lambs on a committee-room of Morley aud Paget (Nottingham), and it was completely gutted. One cannot here say, Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in Mis.\" The Use of Red-Hot Pokers. \u2014 During an election inquiry at Norwich in 1875, some curious particulars were unfolded. Colourable employment of voters it appeared was common, and also the hire of sham committee-rooms to stimulate the landlords. One of the Conservative agents stated that he put on about 100 men in a district in which the voting power was 800 or 900 ; and also that his committee-room had been attacked, and if he had not had a determined will it would certainly have been sacked. But he had a messenger to keep the fire up, and had hot pokers ready. He offered them to his assailants at the top of the stairs, but they would not take them. (Laughter.) \u2014 Another agent said the Liberals were like rats, for when stowed up in one hole they got out of another. They might hold a prayer meeting, and present each man with one of Moody and Sankey's hymn-books with something between the leaves. The law must be altered to make elections pure. \u2014 A solicitor of the town said a pure election was not possible in Norwich. The number of corruptible electors was between 3000 and 5000, and if either party agreed to leave them alone, that corrupt element would start a candidate of their own in order to get money."], [546, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 526 Electioneering Arts. \u2014 Mr. Labouchere related, in 1890, the fol lowing as his experiences of an election at Windsor : \" Some twenty-five years ago the free and enlightened of Windsor did me the honour to elect me as one of their members. The constituency was a smaU one, and the borough returned two members. For about one month I passed six hours each day in canvassing, and weary work it was ; for Lord Palmerston was then Prime Minister, and there was very little difference between him and the Conservatives. So I had to kiss the babies, pay compliments to their mothers, and explain the beauties of Liberalism to their fathers, who never could be got to say how they would vote. On the day of election everything turned upon about half a dozen votes. I remember one Tory went out to fish in a punt, and the boatman who accompanied him was induced to keep him weU in the middle of the river until the poUing hour had passed. Another aged and decrepit Tory was kept in his house by cabs being put to run at him whenever he tried to issue from his door. FinaUy the Liberals won the day. On this the Tories petitioned. The Committee decided that there had been no bribery, but unseated my colleague and myself, because they thought that we had hired a somewhat excessive number of committee-rooms.\" The Ballot Act. \u2014 The BaUot Act was passed in 1872, to remain in force untU the end of 1880. Its operation was prolonged in subsequent years, by its inclusion in the Expiring Acts Continuance BiU at the end of each session. The first Parliamentary election tinder it occurred at Ponte fract on the 15th of August, 1872, and was reported in the newspapers at the time to have been \" characterised by remarkable tranquillity.\" At this election Mr. Childers was returned by a majority of eighty over Vis count PoUington, the numbers being 658 and 578 ; but only about two thirds of the number of registered electors were poUed. The last of the open poUings under the old system took place in the city of Aberdeen, and the last hustings was erected in the borough of Wakefield. Nomination Days. \u2014 The old nomination days were abolished by the Ballot Act of 1872. They did not, however, pass away without a strong effort being made for their retention. On the bringing up of the report of the committee, Mr. Sclater-Booth moved that the clause dis pensing with the ancient practice in nominations (clause 1) should be struck out of the biU. Here ensued a discussion in which some peculiar facts were disclosed. Mr. Bernal Osborne said : \" In my opinion, one of the most valuable clauses in the biU is that which proposes to aboUsh nomi nations. The honourable gentleman talked about the voices of the electors. As if the individual voice of an elector were ever heard at a nomination, and as if there were not a general agreement to roar, to hiss, and become debased with drink ! The true-born Englishman is said to delight in that day. Now, who are the true-born Englishmen who take part in the pro ceedings at nominations ? Why, the representatives of muscular Chris tianity \u2014 prize-fighters and people of that sort. I have spent as much money in retaining the services of those gentlemen as anybody in this House. (Much laughter.) One of my most efficient supporters in Notting ham was a gentleman who was always clothed as a clergyman of tho"], [547, "ELECTIONS. 527 Church of England, but who was ready an ex-champion of England, Bendigo by name. This is a sample of your true-born Englishman on whose behalf we are to strike out the first clause. . . The honourable gentleman said in the simpUcity of his heart that we might do away with open-air meetings, and hold the nomination in some hall or public room. Why, you would be worse off there than you would be in the open air. On the hustings it is possible to dodge the missiles ; but what are you to do in a small town-hall, where, perhaps, the gaUeries are stormed vi et armis by opposing forces, and there is a general shindy? Immemorial custom indeed ! I know it is a custom which often breeds disorder and riot. It is true wisdom to get rid of these immemorial customs, and thus make the proceedings at elections more quiet and orderly.\" \u2014 On the other hand, Mr. Bouverie (one of the most influential members of the House) said, \" H the House accepted this clause, a nomination would become so Uke a funeral that they might as well have the parish church bell tolled during the pro ceedings.\" On a division, the clause was retained by 253 against 177. Hours of Polling. \u2014 By an Act passed in 1878 (known as Sir Charles Dilke's Act) the time for poUing in the boroughs of the metropoUs was extended from 4 to 8 p.m. In June, 1879, a bill was brought in by Mr. Chamberlain, to make the same extension in aU boroughs and all kinds of elections throughout the United Kingdom. It was opposed by tho Government, and rejected by 190 to 165. Largest Number of Votes Polled. \u2014 At the election of a member for Liverpool in February, 1880, upwards of 50,000 votes were poUed between two candidates, out of a total number of 63,946 on the electoral list. This was the largest number up to that time ever polled in a con stituency of Great Britain. Deducting between three and four hundred \" spoiled votes,\" the numbers officially declared were \u2014 for Mr. Whitley (Conservative), 26,106; for Lord Ramsay (Liberal), 23,885; majority for Whitley, 2,221. Total Number of Electors. \u2014 It appeared that in 1885, after the extension of the franchise in the previous year, there were in the United Kingdom a total of 5,716,000 electors, or 160 per thousand inhabitants. In 1871, after the then recent Reform Act, the numbers were 2,553,000, or 81 per thousand inhabitants. In 1835, after the passing of the first Reform measure, there were 839,000 only, or 33 per thousand inhabitants. Voters in Boroughs and Counties. \u2014 According to a Parlia- mentary return issued early in 1889, the total number of borough voters in England and Wales for the year 1888 was 1,911,955. This total included 1,807,281 occupation voters (56,630 of them non-resident), 72,089 lodgers, and 32,585 freemen, freeholders and others possessing ancient rights (of whom 11,156 were non-resident). A similar paper for the counties in England and Wales showed that in the same year there were 2,579,403 voters, of whom 504,246 were ownership occupiers, and of these 121,287 were non-resident; while the occupation voters were 2,061,548 in number, of whom 10,770 were non-resident; there were also 13,604 lodger voters. Therefore, out of 4,491,358 voters, the total number for"], [548, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 528 England and Wales, there were 199,843 (or something under 4\"5 per cent.) who were non-resident. Illiterate Voters. \u2014 From a Parliamentary return published in February, 1887, it appeared that, with a total recorded poU of 2,969,381 in the United Kingdom at the general election of the previous year, there were 80,145 illiterate voters. In England and Wales there were 2,416,272 voters, and 38,587 illiterate voters ; in Scotland, 358,115 and 4,836 ; and in Ireland, 194,994 and 36,722 respectively. Election Riots in 1880. \u2014 The elections of 1880 were in many cases accompanied by scenes of great violence. At several of the towns \u2014 for instance, Rotherham, Leamington, and Dorchester \u2014 the Riot Act was read ; and at others, including Chester, Kendal, Abingdon, and Chard, the proceedings of the mob were of a most threatening character, and much damage was done to property. At Dundee a candidate, attempting to address a meeting at the harbour, was saved by the arrival of tho police from being hustled into the docks ; and at KirkwaU, Mr. Pender, the only candidate for the Wick Boroughs, was attacked in his carriage, and an attempt was made to run it into the sea, but frustrated by an accident happening to the vehicle, which gave time for its owner's friends to inter pose and deliver him. Riotous Elections Cancelled. \u2014 The House of Commons has fre quently cancelled elections on the ground of riot prevaUing at the time. Nov. 6, 1722, it was \" Resolved, that it appears to this House that there were notorious and outrageous riots and tumults at the late election of citizens to serve in Parliament for the city of Westminster, in defiance of the laws of this realm, and in violation of the freedom of elections.\" The election was therefore declared void, new writs being issued. A similar decision was given in 1702 in the case of Southwark, where the additional circumstance was noted that the riot was committed by the servants and agents of the persons returned. Coventry was also a con spicuous offender, its elections being canceUed for rioting in 1706, 1722, and 1736 ; and on the second occasion several persons of standing were committed to custody as the \" authors, contrivers, and promoters\" of the tumults. An Election Return Stolen by Highwaymen. \u2014 This occurred in 1740. Mr. Charles Trelawney had been elected for Liskeard, but could not take his seat, as the proper document was not forthcoming. The under-sheriff of CornwaU, being in town, was ordered to attend the House, and having explained the circumstances, the counterpart of the indenture executed by the Sheriff was admitted as sufficient return, \" it appearing to this House that the writ, and the principal part of the aforesaid indenture, were taken away, in coming up to the Clerk of the Crown, by highway men, who destroyed the same by burning them.\" (\" Determinations of the House of Commons concerning Elections,\" 1753.) Vexatious Election Petitions. \u2014 The presentation of such peti tions has been visited at times by the signal displeasure of the House. We find it recorded : \" March 4, 1695. \u2014 Resolved, that Sir Richard Gipps, having preferred to the House a frivolous, vexatious, and ground-"], [549, "ELECTI02\\'S. 529 less petition relating to the election of members to serve for the borough of Totnes, be taken into custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms.\" He was also to defray the costs of the members petitioned against. In the month of December in the same year, Sir George Meggot was ordered into the Serjeant's custody for having preferred a groundless and vexatious petition relating to the borough of Southwark, and for \" having scanda lised this House in declaring ' That, without being duly chosen, he had friends now in the House to bring him into this House.' \" In the foUow ing year, Sir George Meggot was again committed to custody, for breach of privilege in having prosecuted at law two persons for what they had testified before the election committee in the previous session. Trial of Election Petitions by the Judges. \u2014 The bUl trans ferring the hearing of election petitions from committees of the House of Commons to the judges, was introduced by Mr. Disraeli when Chancellor of the Exchequer, in February, 1868. It was the subject of an emphatic protest addressed by Lord Chief Justice Cockbum to the Lord Chancellor of the day (Lord Chelmsford), asking, among other things, \" Is a judge to set aside her Majesty's commission, and leave the gaols undelivered and causes untried, while he is occupied in investigating the unclean doings in a corrupt borough ? \" Extra judges were appointed under the Act, and they commenced their labours on the meeting of a new ParUa ment in 1869. Minority Representation. \u2014 The representation of minorities was introduced by the Reform Act of 1867, which provides that two votes only shall be given by each elector in a place returning three members, and three votes in the City of London, which returns four. In Juue, 1870, Mr. Hardcastle brought in a biU for abolishing this system. On a division, the numbers for and against it were equal \u2014 181. The Speaker gave his casting vote, according to custom, in such a way that the question would again come before the House, and on a second division the biU was rejected by a majority of two. The places in which this system of voting is established are commonly termed \" three-cornered\" or \" cocked-hat \" constituencies. Introduction of the Caucus System. \u2014 This plan, by which a section of the leading politicians in a district endeavour to control the result of an election, was introduced from America, and came into favour with the Liberal party after the defeat of that body in the general election of 1874. It was said to have originated in the meetings of some aggrieved ship-caulkers in Boston, U.S., about 1770; that these gatherings were called \" caulkers' meetings,\" the expression being afterwards corrupted into caucus. This definition, however, has been disputed on historic grounds, and even an American-Indian origin has been assigned for the expression. In the \" New English Dictionary,\" edited by Dr. Murray. tho subject is discussed, and a reference is made to it as \" the Birmingham system.\" It is added, \"In American use, 'a caucus' is a meeting ; English newspapers apply ' the caucus ' to an organisa tion or system. Such organisations have since been, in one form or another, adopted by all parties ; and caucus is now a term which M M"], [550, "530 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. partisans fling at the organisations of their opponents, and disclaim for their own.\" Caucus Dictation. \u2014 In July, 1880, the Hull Liberal Club wrote to the sitting members for the borough, Messrs. Norwood and WUson, dictating the course they should adopt on a question pending before the House of Commons. Both these gentlemen had been returned in the Liberal interest, at the general election in the previous spring, by an immense majority over their Conservative opponents; and Mr. Norwood had represented the borough for many years. He wrote to the chairman of the club, in reply : \" I feel it due to myself at once to intimate to you that, so far as I am concerned, it wiU be unnecessary for your association to issue its mandates until it learns to adopt a tone which any gentleman has a right to expect.\" Mr. WUson also returned an indignant letter, saying, \" There is no inducement for me to be in Parliament unless I have the sympathy and confidence of my supporters ; and I beg you wdl convey to the Liberal Association my sense of the undesirable relations which would exist between us if my conduct is to be criticised and my course of action dictated in such a spirit.\"* Westminster Elections. \u2014 Many interesting anecdotes respecting these are on record. \"It is curious\" (says Isaac DTsraeli) \" to observe that the Westminster elections, in the fourth year of Charles's reign (1629), were exactly of the same turbulent character as those which we witness in our days. The duke (of Buckingham) had counted by his interest to bring in Sir Robert Pye. The contest was severe, but accom panied by some of those ludicrous electioneering scenes which still amuse the mob. Whenever Sir Robert Pye's party cried, ' A Pye ! a Pye ! a Pye ! ' the adverse party would cry, ' A pudding ! a pudding ! a pudding ! ' and others, ' A lie ! a Ue ! a Ue ! ' This Westminster election ended as we have seen some ; they rejected all who had urged the payment of the loans ; and, passing by such men as Sir Robert Cotton and their last representative, they fixed on a brewer and a grocer for the two members for Westminster.\" Putting an End to the Poll. \u2014 The Parliament expired with the session that closed April 25th, 1741, and a general election consequently ensued. Westminster had hitherto been a Government borough, and the nominees of the minister had been returned as a matter of course. Sir Charles Wager, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Lord Sandon, a lord of the Treasury, were proposed to be re-elected ; but some of the electors were resolved to recover their representation, and Admiral Vernon and Mr. Edwin were put in nomination. The contest, although severe, seemed likely to terminate in favour of the ministerial candidates, since on the fifth clay of polling they had a considerable majority ; but on that day the high bailiff, Mr. John Lever, through cowardice or folly, put an end to the poll. Seeing a mob advancing to the hustings, bearing banners inscribed with the watchwords of the Opposition, he became alarmed either for his owu safety or for the success of the Government candidates. * See, under Edmund Burke, \"Representative and Constituents,\" p. 160."], [551, "ELECTIONS. 531 Tie mounted upon a form within the hustings, called out that he appre hended a riot was intended, and, ordering his clerks to shut their poU books, ran into the vestry with them. The crowd, enraged at this inter ference, attacked Lord Sandon, who narrowly escaped with his life. Cooke, in his \" History of Party,\" emotes the particulars of the affair from a \" Review of the Westminster Election,\" which he observes \" is of course grossly exaggerated for party purposes.\" There can be no question, how ever, that the Guards were caUed out, and sixty or seventy of them marched to Covent Garden churchyard, with drums beating and bayonets fixed, and drew up beforo the hustings. Several of the electors petitioned against the return of Sandon and Wager, whereupon, after an inquiry, the House ordered \" That John Lever, Esq. (the high bailiff), Nathaniel Blackerby, George Howard, aud Thomas Lediard, Esqs., justices, who ordered the soldiers to attend, be severally taken into the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms.\" The order having been carried into effect, the delinquents were reprimanded on their knees by the Speaker, and then discharged, paying their fees. A Dirty House. \u2014 Delinquents on their Knees. \u2014 Mr. R. Pal- grave states that the practice of ordering delinquents on their knees was stopped by the obduracy of a Mr. Murray in February, 1750. Being ordered to kneel to receive the censure of the House for a breach of privilege, he refused, and his audacity being voted a high contempt, ho was sent to Newgate, where he remained until set free by the prorogation, four months afterwards. No one (says Mr. Palgrave) was ever after com pelled to kneel at the bar. Oldfield, however, records the following among other later instances. (See p. 515.) An election for the city of West minster took place in 1751, when Lord Trentham was returned against Sir George Vandeport. Serious outrages having been committed by a mob, one of tbe ringleaders \u2014 Mr. Crowle, an attorney \u2014 was summoned before tho House of Commons. The delinquent was commanded to kneel, and was duly reprimanded by the Speaker. On rising he wiped his knees, and said he had never been in so dirty a house before. A Westminster Election described by a Foreigner. \u2014 O. P. Moritz, of Berlin, wrote as foUows in 1782 : \" While I was in London, what is called ' hanging day ' arrived. There was also a parlia mentary election. I could only see one of tho two sights, and therefore naturaUy preferred the latter, while I only heard tolling at a distance the death-bell of the sacrifice to justice. Mr. Fox is one of the two members for Westminster ; one seat was vacant, and that vacancy was now to bo filled. Sir CecU Wray, whom Fox had before opposed to Lord Hood, was now publicly chosen. The election was held in Covent Garden, a large market-place, in the open air. In the area before the hustings immense multitudes of people were assembled, of whom the greatest part seemed to be of the lowest order. To this tumultuous crowd, however, the speal rs often bowed very low, and always addressed them by the title of 'gentlemen.' The moment Sir Cecil Wray began to speak, this rude rabble became aU as quiet as the raging sea after a storm \u2014 only every now and then rending the air with the parliamentary cry of ' Hear him ! hear M M 2"], [552, "532 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. him ! ' Even little boys clambered up and hung on the rails and on the lamp-posts; and, as if the speeches had been addressed to them, they also Ustened with the utmost attention, and they, too, testified their approba tion of it by joining lustily in the three cheers, and waving their hats. At length, when it was nearly over, the people took it into their heads to hear Fox speak, and every one called out, ' Fox ! Fox ! ' I know not why, but I seemed to catch some of the spirit of the place and time, and so I also bawled ' Fox ! Fox ! ' and he was obliged to come forward and speak. When the whole was over, the rampant spirit of liberty, and the wUd impatience of a genuine English mob, were exhibited in perfection. In a very few minutes the whole scaffolding, benches, and chairs, and every thing else were completely destroyed, and the mat with which it had been covered torn into ten thousand long strips, or pieces, with which they encircled multitudes of people of aU ranks. These they hurried along with them, aud everything else that came in their way, as trophies of joy ; and thus, in the midst of exultation and triumph, they paraded through many of the most populous streets of London.\" Ladies on Canvass. \u2014 At the general election which took placo consequent on the dissolution of Parliament in 1784, Fox appealed again to his old constituents at Westminster; so did Sir Cecil Wray. Tho- Government set up Lord Hood as their candidate. It soon appeared that Lord Hood would be at the head of the poll, and that the real contest would be between Fox and Wray. The voters came forward slowly, aud the poll continued open from day to day and from week to week \u2014 that is, from the 1st of April to the 17th of May. During this time every nerve was strained on either side. Several ladies of rank and fashion stood forth as Fox's friends \u2014 at their head, Georgiana, the eldest daughter of Earl Spencer, and the wife, since 1774, of the fifth Duke of Devonshire. Of great beauty and unconquerable spirit, she tried aU her powers of persua sion on the shopkeepers of Westminster.* Other ladies who could not rival her beauty might at least follow her example. Scarce a street or alley which they did not canvass in be' nils of him whom they persisted in caUing \" the Man of the People,\" at the very moment when the popular voice was declaring everywhere against him. The Prince of Wales rodo through the streets of Westminster wearing Fox's colours. Pitt writes to Wilberforce on the 8th of April, \" Westminster goes on well, in spito of the Duchess of Devonshire and the other Women of the People.\" \u2014 Stanhope's \" Life of Pitt.\" Earl RusseU observes, with respect to this election : \" The Duchess of Devonshire canvassed for Mr. Fox, and con tributed greatly, by her charms, her activity, and her zeal, to gain electors to his side. She was, in revenge, libelled in the grossest manner by the advocates of the Court candidates. At the end of the election there was an immense crowd collected for the chairing of Mr. Fox. He mounted a car; an immense procession followed, which was closed by the state carriages of the Duchesses of Portland and Devonshire, drawn by pit * \"Devon's kiss seduced a blacksmith's vote.\" \u2014 Lyiton's \"St. Stephen's.\""], [553, "ELECTIONS. 533 horses each. Mr. Fox descended from the car at Devonshire House, where the Prince of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire were assembled on a temporary platform to receive him. He dined at Willis's Rooms, where he made a warm speech on the subject of the election. On the same day, the Prince of Wales, after attending the King at a review at Ascot, rode up St. James's-street iu his uniform, and afterwards went to dine at Devonshire House, wearing Mr. Fox's colours aud a laurel branch for victory. On the following day more festivities took place. The Prince of Wales gave a grand breakfast, which lasted from noon till six o'clock in the evening.\" Pauper Proxies. \u2014 Stapleton writes : \" I remember Canning's being very much amused when (having to deal with Knaresborough, then a close borough, in which the Duke of Devonshire's interest was paramount, and for which Mr. Tiemey and Sir James Mackintosh were the members) he discovered the following sentence in a publication describing the borough : ' The members never appear at the elections, and it is the constant practice to chair two old paupers by way of proxies.' His merriment was unbounded at the idea of such grave old members of Parliament as Mr. Tierney and Sir James having those undignified representatives on these important occasions.\" Caging the Voters. \u2014 I had to go to Kilkenny on the business of my own election (says Mr. John O'ConneU, in his \" Parliamentary Experiences \"), and while there some 120 or 130 Carlow freeholders were sent in to our especial care. It appeared that the landlord practice at the \u25a0 Carlow elections had been to \" sweep the countryside \" of the voters several days before the election, and keep them comfortably under watch and ward within the demesne walls of one or other of the candidates, and so secure them from being operated upon by agitation. Refusal to submit to this species of abduction was considered as gravo an offence as refusal to vote according to tho landlord's wish, and punished accordingly. The popular party at the election of 1841 retaliated this practice on the landlords. For three whole weeks, as I have said, we had 120 or 130 voters of the neighbouring county snugly quartered in an old brewery in the city of Kilkenny, fed most abundantly, entertained during the day with the music of the temperance bands of tho city, and during the evening with political speechification \u2014 a strong and active watch of true Kilkenny boys being meanwhile maintained within and without, day and night, to prevent desertions and invasions. The feats of swallowing which some of these poorfeUows accomplished during the two or three first days, while they were quite new to good feeding, and our commissariat was not sufficiently regulated, were wonderful. On the day of nomination at Carlow we set out from KUkenny with our \" caged birds,\" to traverse the twenty-two Irish miles intervening between us and the scene of action. First came a stage-coach, loaded with the \" agitators \" \u2014 Carlow and Kilkenny men intermixed ; then one of Bianconi's long stage-cars, with a temperance band to enliven us on the road ; then twenty jaunting-cars, with the voters, and a \" guard \" car bringing up the rear. On either side we had an escort of county Kilkenny farmers, on their stout hacks, to"], [554, "534 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. guard our convoy from any guerilla charges that the enemy might take it into their heads to make. Disorderly Electors. \u2014 I recollect (once said Mr. Bright) an. election for the borough of Carlow. There were two troops of dragoons, two companies of infantry, and one hundred and fifty police ; the whola of this force having, during the period of the election, been engaged in keeping the peace in a town which comprised only two hundred electors. A Carlow Election in 1880. \u2014 At the general election in 1880, Carlow sustained its previous reputation. WhUe the voting for tho county representatives was proceeding, one of the candidates (Col. Bruen) was attacked in his committee-room, and with difficulty effected his escape, after receiving a cut over the eye, and having his hat smashed in by a. stone. Another gentleman received a dangerous hurt from a blow on the forehead. The streets of the town in the evening had repeatedly to be cleared by the police charging with the bayonet. During this election also, at a meeting held in a village near Ossory, the Lord Mayor of Dublin (Mr. Gray) being one of the candidates, he stated that parcels of dynamite had been placed under the platform, and fortunately discovered before the time appointed for the proceedings. An Election for Waterford. \u2014 In February, 1870, an election took place for the city of Waterford, Mr. Bernal Osborne and Mr. Smyth being the candidates, when the former gentleman was returned by a narrow majority. A writer in tbe Times gave the following account of the proceedings, and the scene which f oUowed : \" A large force of infantry, cavalry, and police had been marched into the town, and a most able stipendiary magistrate sent to preside over their movements. The day of polling was as usual at an Irish election; voters escorted to the poll by dragoons ; politicians obnoxious to the ' national ' party stoned and beaten in the public streets. I was drinking tea last night when an avalanche of paving stones shattered the entire front of the windows, and the roar of an enormous mob announced that the town was at their mercy.. The hotel was attacked, aud an omnibus propelled against the entrance door with the view of breaking it in. Some shots were fired through the shutters into the hall. During a period of two hours not a policeman or a soldier appeared. The inmates of the hotel barricaded the hall-door with mattresses, and, with such arms as could be procured on the instant,. stood ranged on the staircase prepared to sell their lives dearly. After a most anxious interval, a force of police arrived, but no magistrate could be found, aud \u2014 tell it not in England \u2014 the police actually looked on, almost ' standing at ease,' while houses were wrecked and stores set on fire. Neither a soldier nor a magistrate came to the spot, and the town through the night was left in the hands of a mob more resembling a horde of Cherokee Indians than Christian men. Several stores were set on fire ; the market-house on the quay was burnt ; the chapel of the Dominican Friars completely wrecked, and the houses of all the principal supporters of Mr. Osborne attacked, aud wrecked ; one in particular was broken into and gutted, the furniture broken up and thrown into the road, . the mob dancing on the piano before destroying it.\""], [555, "535 ELECTIONS. Intimidation in Galway. \u2014 In May, 1872, Mr. Justice Keogh, who had been trying a petition respecting a recent election for the county of Galway, gave a decision which attracted great attention, and caused much excitement in Ireland. In the course of his judgment, which occupied nine hours in delivery, he said that, after carefully examining the whole evidence, he was convinced that it presented the most astonishing attempts at ecclesiastical tyranny which the whole history of priestly intolerance afforded. Both Catholics and Protestants had been intimidated from voting. Shots had been fired into houses ; gentry had been hunted through the fields, and one nobleman had been obUged to absent himself from chapel, in order that he might not hear himself defamed from the altar. Sir Arthur Guinness had fought his way to the poUing booths at the head of twenty-seven men, and several of them had been injured. He declared Captain Nolan unseated, and reported the Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, Bishops of Galway and Clonfert, and a number of priests, as guilty of intimidation. A few clays after, the Dublin Court of Common Pleas declared Captain French entitled to the seat from which Captain Nolan had been ousted. Mr. Gladstone's Government determined to prosecute the Bishop of Clonfert and nineteen priests for illegal practices at the election ; but the bishop and two others being acquitted on trial, the remaining prosecutions were abandoned. A Preposterous Request. \u2014 Mr. John O'ConneU relates the foUow ing : The candidate for a county representation in the west of Ireland had asked a friend of his \u2014 a gentleman resident and greatly liked in the part of the county which he was going to visit \u2014 to accompany him on a ride to visit and canvass the farmer voters. They drew up their horses at the door of one farmhouse, where stood a stout and sturdy yeoman waiting to be wooed. The candidate, with aU the deferential urbanity de rigueur on such occasions, raised his hat, and respectfully expressed his hope that he might have the honour of Mr. 's vote and support at the next election. \" Oh, well, Mr. F., I am sure I respect you and your family, sir, very much ; but before I promise my vote I'd like to hear, sir, what are your prenciples.\" Mr. F. was about to answer, with undiminished urbanity, when his canvassing friend and aid-dc-camp pulled him back, and, craning over the neck of his horse, opened a broadside on the astonished farmer. \" His principles ! You ask a gentleman like Mr. F. his principles ! Get along with you ! A pretty pass things are come to when Mr. F. must stop on the road to tell you his principles ! Come away, F. ; pitch the fellow, and his vote, and his principles to the d together, and don't be losing your time.\" \" Oh, my dear ,\" said the candidate, as soon as he got breath again, after the double effects of laughter and the smart canter into which his indignant aid-de-camp had forced the horses, \"you're an excellent feUow, and I am much obliged for your offer to assist me; but, unless you want me to lose my election, never more be canvasser of mine.\" A Hustings Speech Plagiarised.\u2014 Perhaps the queerest election that occurred in the three kingdoms in 1832-33 (says Mr. John O'ConneU) was that of Feargus O'Connor, for the county of Cork. In his canvass he"], [556, "536 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. was assisted by his cousin, O'NoUl Daunt, then standing, and afterwards elected, for the borough of Mallow. Between them both the plan of taking county and borough aristocrats simultaneously by surprise had been concocted and carried out with infinite cleverness ; but Daunt, although far superior to O'Connor in information and general ability, was no match for him in dexterity. He had a proof of it on one occasion in particular, when, as both stood on the hustings, Daunt, to his dismay and horror, had to Usten while Feargus delivered, ore rotundo, and greatly to the admiration of the multitude, the very speech that Daunt himself had carefuUy prepared for that occasion ; Feargus having, during their journey to the place of meeting, industriously and successfully pumped his unsuspecting companion of aU his treasured eloquence. The Less Exceeding the Greater. \u2014 Amongst the elder O'Con- nell's anecdotes was one of the son of a Wexford elector, whose father had been promised patronage by a member of the Loftus family, in return for a vote. The father's ambition aimed at a scrgeantcy in tho artillery. Lord Loftus, on applying for this post for the youth, was informed that it was totaUy impossible to grant his request, inasmuch as it required a previous service of six years to qualify a candidate for the sergeantcy. \u2022\u25a0 Does it require six years' service to qualify him for a lieutenant ? \" de manded Lord Loftus. \" Certainly not,\" was the answer. \" Well, can't you make him a lieutenant, then?\" rejoined his lordship. \"Whereupon,\" said O'ConneU, laughing heartily, \" the fellow was made a lieutenant, for no better reason than just because he wasn't fit to be a sergeant.\" An \" Intimidating \" Visage. \u2014 During the Clare election in 1828, when Mr. Daniel O'ConneU and Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald were the candidates, an attorney employed by Mr. Fitzgerald rushed in and ex claimed that a priest was terrifying the voters. This accusation produced a powerful effect. The counsel for Mr. O'ConneU defied the attorney to make out his charge. The assessor required that the priest should attend ; and behold Father Murphy, of Carotin. His solemn aspect struck every body. He advanced with fearlessness to the bar, behind which the sheriff was seated, and inquired, with a smile of derision, what the charge was \u25a0which had been preferred against him. \" You were looking at my voters,\" cried the attorney. \"But I said nothing,\" replied the priest; \"and I suppose I may be permitted to look at my parishioners.\" \" Not with such a face as that ! \" cried Mr. O'Doherty, one of Mr. Fitzgerald's counsel. This produced a loud laugh ; for the countenance of Father Murphy was fraught with no ordinary terrors. At this instant one of the agents of Mr. O'ConneU precipitated himself into the room, and cried out, \" Mr. Sheriff, we have no fair play ; Mr. Singleton is frightening his tenants. He caught hold of one of them just now, and threatened ven geance against him.\" This accusation came apropos. \" What ! \" ex claimed the advocate of Mr. O'ConneU, \"is this to be endured? Do we live in a free country, and under a constitution ? Is a landlord to commit a battery with impunity, and is a priest to be indicted for bis physio gnomy, and to be found guilty of a look ? \" Thus was obtained a valuable set-off against Father Murphy's eyebrows."], [557, "ELECTIONS. 537 Swearing an Irish Elector. \u2014 The following scene is described hy Mr. John O'ConneU, in his \" Parliamentary Experiences ;\" the actors being the sheriff's deputy, presiding in the polling-booth, his clerk, the voter, and occasionally one or other of the attorneys or election agents there stationed. Clerk : \" Now, repeat the words after me. ' I, Patrick O'Shaughnessy '\" Voter: \"Yis, that's me.\" Deputy: \"That won't do, voter ; you must say exactly as the clerk says.\" Voter : \" Yis, your honour; I wiU, sir.\" Clerk: \"I, Patrick O'Shaughnessy, do swear \" Voter: \" Yis, I do.\" Clerk: \" Come, come, you stupid feUow, repeat the words after me. ' I, Patrick O'Shaughnessy,' \" &c. &c. Voter : \" Well, anything for a quiet life. ' I, Patrick O'Shaughnessy, do swear ' \" Clerk : \" ' That I am the same Patrick O'Shaughnessy whose name appears in this certificate.' \" Voter : \" That I am \u2014 the same . Arrah ! (indignantly) to be sure I am ! Who else could I be ? Is it wanting to make game of me you are ? \" Deputy : \" Come, come, voter ; I'll send you off the table if you don't do as you're bid, and not be wasting our time in this manner. Repeat after the clerk, sir, as you are told, or I won't take your vote at all.\" Voter : \" Well, sure I will, sir \u2014 I will ! This is a poor case, now. WeU ; ' that I am the same,' &c. &c.

WeU, you know it yourself that I wasn't up here before to-day,\" &c. &c. Again, when the bribery oath is being put. Clerk : \" 'And that I have not received anything, nor has any one in trust for me.' \" Voter : \" No ; the dickens a hap'orth ; nor any one for me either ! Troth, if I was going to sell my conscience that way, it's little I'd thrust to another to resave she valley for me!\" &c. &c. At length the poor clerk gets him to the end of the oath, and the formula of kissing the book is gone through. This is the signal for a new difficulty. Up starts the opposing attorney, ripe and ready for a row, and protests that the man did not \" kiss fair ; \" that he \" kissed his thumb \" instead of the book. At such an imputation upon his honesty and due regard for his oath, the indignation of the voter knows no bounds. \" Kiss my thumb, indeed ! Kiss your granny ! Truth, then, if you only said yer prayers this fine mornin' as surely as I kissed the book, the ould boy below wouldn't have the howld of yer sowl that he has, Misther Attorney ! \" Here the sensitive professional appeals to the deputy for protection, amid the shouts of laughter of the people in the body of tbe court, while his learned brother at the other side jumps up, quite as smartly, to argue the matter with him. The deputy storms ; the poUce vainly shout for silence; and meantime the voter quietly slips away, perfectly satisfied with himself, since he had an opportunity of giving an answer to his assailant, and greatly rejoicing in the confusion he has created.

(1543) George Ferrers, Esq., member for Plymouth, was arrested for debt and committed to prison, under the orders of the judges of the King's Bench. The House, on receiving information of the fact, sent their Serjeant to demand their member. In the execution of his orders he met with resistance, his mace was broken, and his assistant knocked down. In consequence, the Sheriff of London and those who were concerned in the arrests were brought before the House, when some of them were committed to the Tower, others to Newgate, where they remained until they were discharged on the petition of the Lord Mayor. Protecting an Unworthy Member. \u2014 In February, 1558, there was an inquiry into a complaint that John Smith, returned burgess for Camelford, had come to tho House, being outlawed, and had deceived divers merchants in London, taking wares of them to the sum of 300?., minding to defraud them of the same under colour of privilege. The complaint was reported to be true, and the House divided on the question that he should be allowed privilege. The ayes were 112, the noes 107. Prynne says, \" How honourable this vote was for the House in tho ease of such a cheating member, carried only by five votes, is not fit for me to determine.\" Dishonest Use of the Privilege. \u2014 In 1807, a Mr. MUls wrote to the Speaker stating that he was under arrest. He was held entitled to his privilege, and on motion discharged out of the custody of tho marshal of tho King's Bench, although it was notorious that he had pur chased his seat to escape payment of his debts, which amounted to 23,000?. Another case of similar kind was that of a Mr. Bourke, who, being confined in the King's Bench in execution for a considerable debt, procured, through the instrumentality of some friends, his return for a pocket borough, but never went near the House, for he had horses ready at the door of the prison on his release, started direct for the Continent, and never returned. Lord Cochrane's Arrest in the House of Commons. \u2014 The attention of the House of Commons was caUed, on March 21st, 1S15, to a singular circumstance connected with the subject of arrest. Lord Cochrane, who was a prisoner in the King's Bench, during his confine ment had been re-elected for Westminster, and, having contrived to escape from prison, he went to the clerks' room in the Honse of Commons, where members were usually sworn previously to taking the oaths at the table of the house. Being informed that it was necessary he should have with him the certificate of Iris return, ho sent for it from the Crown Office, and * See also the references in the Indcs, under this heading, to the other sec tions of the book."], [560, "540 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. then went into the house, where he seated himself on the bench at the right hand of tho chair, no member at that time being present, and prayers not having been read. The marshal of the King's Bench, having been apprised where his lordship was to be found, now entered with two or three of his officers, and carried him back to prison, notwithstanding his remonstrance that they had no right to lay hands on him in that place. After the House was assembled, the Speaker informed them that he had received a letter from William Jones, Esq., marshal of the King's Bench prison, which he read. Its purpose was to acquaint the House with what he had done, and that he was in waiting to receive their commands on the occasion, humbly hoping that he had not committed any breach of privilege by the step he had taken. The question was referred to a Committee of Privileges, who reported \" That, under the peculiar circumstances given in evidence, it does not appear that the privileges of Parliament have been violated, so as to call for the interposition of the House by any proceedings against the marshal of the King's Bench.\" Duration of the Immunity from Arrest. \u2014 A remarkable case, concerning the freedom from arrest, was decided by Vice-ChanceUor Sir Charles Hall in April, 1880. On March 24, the day on which ParUament was dissolved, a motion was made before the Vice -Chancellor to commit Mr. Fortescue Harrison, at that moment M.P. for Kilmamock, for con tempt of court in not complying with an order of the Chancery Division in regard to certain transactions in which he was concerned. Mr. Harri son's counsel raised the preliminary objection that as a member of Parlia ment his cUent was privileged from arrest, and this objection was sustained by the Vice-ChanceUor. Parliament was dissolved within a few hours of this decision, and the question then arose whether its privilege stiU protected Mr. Harrison. On the 15th of April this question was argued, and the Vice-ChanceUor held that the period claimed by Parliament had been legally defined by the Court of Exchequer as a period of forty days before and after the meeting of ParUament. His honour said it was clear time must be given for an ex-member to return home before his privilege expired. Was this time indefinite and uncer tain, or definite p An indefinite period would be very inconvenient, and that being so, having regard to the fact that the only case which mentioned any particular time, Duncombe's case, gave forty days as the term during which the privilege extended, he must hold that Mr. Harri son was stiU entitled to privilege, twenty-three only having expired since the dissolution. The motion must therefore be refused, but that would not prevent the liquidator from again moving against Mr. Harrison when the full term had expired. Committal of Members by the Law Courts. \u2014 Mr. WhaUey, member for Peterborough, having in 1874 been committed by the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench (Sir A. Cockburn) for contempt of court, and fined 250?., a letter from the Chief Justice to the Speaker, notifying the circumstances, was read to the House on the first meeting of the Parliament in that year, and, the explanation being accepted as satis factory, the House declined to interfere. Iu a simUar case in 1837, Mr."], [561, "541 PRIVILEGE. Lechmere Charlton having been committed, the House, \" as sole and exclu sive judge of its own privileges,\" claimed to be informed of the nature of the offence, and having received the information, a committee of privileges reported that Mr. Charlton's claim to be discharged ought not to be admitted. In another case, in 1831, Lord ChanceUor Brougham laid it down that a committal by order of the court was \" no violation of the privileges of Parliament if the members of ParUament have violated the rights and privileges of this court, which is of as high a dominion and as undisputed a jurisdiction as the High Court of ParUament itself.\" Protection of Servants. \u2014 On the 8th of February, 1620, a com plaint was made in the Commons (writes Sir T. E. May) that two of the members' pages had been punished for misbehaviour in the Court of Kiug's Bench. It was stated, however, that the judges had sent one of the offenders to be punished by the House, and would send the other when he could be found ; \" and yet, but for respect for this House, they would have indicted them for stroke in face of the court ; and many for less offences have lost their hands.\" Arresting the Servant of a Member. \u2014 On the 4th of June, 1621 (says Hatsell), the House is informed of Johnson, Sir James Whit lock's man, being arrested. The parties are immediately called to the bar, and heard on their knees in their defence ; and after a variety of proposi tions for various degrees of punishment, it is ordered upon the question, \" That they shaU both ride upon one horse, bare-backed, back to back, from Westminster to the Exchange, with papers on their breasts with this inscription, ' For arresting a servant to a member of the Commons House of Parliament ; ' and this to be done presently, sedente Curia.\" A Rank Abuse of Privilege. \u2014 John Selden, in the \" Table Talk,\" thus refers to an abuse which was prevalent in his time : \" The Lords giving protections is a scorn upon them. A protection means nothing actively, but passively : ho that is a servant to a Parliament man is thereby protected. What a scorn it is to a person of honour to put his hand to two lyes at once ; that ' such a man is my servant, and imployed by me,' when haply he never saw the man in his life, nor before never heard of him.\" A later instance of the abuse which justly excited Selden's scorn is given by Mr. R. Palgrave -. \" A foreign lady married an Englishman of some wealth, aud she had, unfortunately, to take proceed ings against her husband. He was a man of property \u2014 his income was \u00a32000 a year \u2014 but ho would not pay his wife what he owed her. The court of law declared the debt to be just ; she was compeUed to enforce her claim by arrest ; aud then her husband turned round against her. He had the audacity to pretend that he was a menial servant in the house hold of a member of ParUament, and the pretence had its effect ; no ono dared to arrest him, as it would be a breach of parliamentary privilege to do so. The evidence that this gentleman was the menial servant of a member of Parliament was clear enough; he held a protection from arrest, signed by a member, one Colonel Wanklyn. This paper was drawn up in the grandest style ; it was addressed to all ' sheriffs, under sheriffs, gaoler-, bailiffs, constables,' and threatening them with the"], [562, "542 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. vengeance of the House of Commons if they arrested his servant, this rich man of \u00a32000 a year. Defeat of justice like that was beyond endurance. The House of Commons, in a just fit of indignation, imme diately expeUed such an unworthy member as Colonel Wanklyn, and he was led out of the house weeping for shame.\" Servants' Protection aUowed to Lapse. \u2014 The protection from arrest, as to servants of members, came to an end in the reign of George III. An Act was then passed expressly declaring the immunity of members, but making no such reservation in the case of their servants ; and thus, says Sir T. E. May, \" without any distinct abrogation of the privilege, it was in fact put an end to, as executions were not to be stayed in their favour, and their freedom from arrest was not reserved.\" The Privilege of Pree Speech. \u2014 In the reign of WUliam III., Colonel ChurchiU complained, in the House of Commons, of receiving a summons to attend the Board of Admiralty the night before, stating, \" When I was caUed in, the Lords accused me of what I said here, that some persons in the fleet were cowards. I know not that I am to answer anywhere for what I say here but to the House.\" The assembled Commons were instantly in a flame, several members asserting that there was an end of privilege \" if officers, many of whom had seats, were to be caUed to account for what might be said or done there.\" It appeared on inquiry that Colonel ChurchUl had used elsewhere the words complained of, and a satisfactory explanation was given, that a man in the fleet had been condemned to be shot as a coward, that the King had been peti tioned for pardon, and that the board wished to ascertain from Colonel ChurchiU whether he were a fit subject for pardon. A resolution pro posed by Sir Charles Musgrave, \" That no member be examined for what he has said here,\" was negatived on the judicious objection of Colonel Titus : \" Do yon think that this is a new privilege ? This is calling that in question that was ever out of question ! \" The House, having vindi cated the privilege beyond cavU, aUowed the subject to drop, with a rebuke from the Speaker to the Board of Admiralty, inculcating more caution for the future : \" It had been civil and reasonable for the board to inform Colonel ChurchiU they had no intent to interrogate him as to anything said in the House.\" Abusing Freedom of Speech. \u2014 Iu 1621, a Mr. Edward Floyde was punished by the House of Commons for a breach of privilege, in having scoffed at the son-in-law and daughter of the King (James I.). The sentence is thus reported : \u2014 1. Not to bear arms as a gentleman, nor be a competent witness in any court of justice. 2. To ride with his face to a horse's tail, to stand in the piUory, and have his ears nailed, &.c. 3. To be whipped at the cart's tail. 4. To be fined \u00a35000. 5. To be perpetually imprisoned in Newgate. It was put to the question, first, whether Floyde should be whipped or not, because he was a gentleman \u2022 yet it was agreed, per plures, that he shoidd be whipped. Then it was put to the question whether Floyde's ears should be nailed to the piUory or not, and agreed, per plures, not to be nailed. An Ingenious Evasion. \u2014 In the reign of Anne, Sir WUliam"], [563, "PRIVILEGE. 543 Whiteloeke, member for the University of Oxford, referring to the Act of Settlement, made the remark, \" Should the Elector of Hanover succeed to the throne, which I hope he never wiU .\" The conclusion of his sentence was drowned in shouts of \" To the bar ! To the bar!\" But he recovered his presence of mind in the clamour, and refused to apologise, saying, \" The Queen is younger in years than the Elector, and I merely expressed a loyal hope that she might survive him.\" His words clearly admitted of this explanation, and he was excused, although many of the same mind with himself applauded his ingenuity. \" The Mildest Censure.\"\u2014 On the 5th of April, 1715, a fortnight after the House had met, a motion was made to take into consideration George the First's proclamation of the 15th of January for the calling of a new Parliament. The new monarch having been made to express his conviction \" that his loving people would send up to Parliament the fittest persons to redress the present disorders, and therein have a particular regard to such as showed a firmness to the Protestant succession when it was most in danger,\" Sir WUliam Wyndham complained of this procla mation as \" not only unprecedented and unwarrantable, but even of dangerous consequence to the very being of Parliaments.\" When caUed upon to jnstify his charge, he declined giving any particular explanation, but repeated that, \" as he thought some expressions in the proclamation of dangerous consequence, so he believed every member was free to speak his thoughts.\" In this belief (says Mr. W. C. Townsend) the Opposition orator found himself whoUy mistaken. Mr. Walpole, himself fresh from the Tower, could with difficulty ward off the same unjust punishment for uttering unwelcome truths, a rampant majority being determined to fix some mark of their displeasure upon a Jacobite professed. It was moved \" that Sir William Wyndham, having reflected upon his Majesty's procla mation, and having refused to justify his charge, although often caUed upon so to do, is guilty of a great indignity to his Majesty, and a breach of the privileges of this House.\" After three divisions, it was decided, by 212 against 138, that he be reprimanded in his place. The Speaker, Sir S. Compton, acquainted him with the resolution, sitting in the chair covered, and Sir WiUiam standing up uncovered : \" Sir, the arraigning a proclamation issued by his Majesty for caUing the present Parliament, and refusing to assign any cause why such proclamation is blameable, tho House thought an indignity to his Majesty, and so unwarrantable an use of that freedom of speech which is the undoubted privUege of ParUament, that the House thought they could not let it pass without animadversion ; but, being willing their moderation should appear, notwithstanding their lenity has been too much despised and contemned, they have inflicted the mildest censure your offence was capable of, and have commanded me to reprimand you in your place ; and, in obedience to their command, I do reprimand you accordingly.\" Whereupon Sir WUliam Wyndham said: \" Mr. Speaker, I very truly return my thanks to you for performing that duty which is incumbent upon you, from your office, in so candid and gentlemanlike a manner. As I am a member, I know I must acquiesce in the determination of the House ; but, as I am not conscious to myself of"], [564, "544 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. having offered any indignity to his Majesty, or of having been guilty of any breach of the privilege of the House, I have no thanks to return to those gentlemen who, under a pretence of lenity, have brought me under this censure.\" A Reprimand for Breach of Privilege. \u2014 The reprimand of an offender at the bar is sometimes an occasion of much solemnity. By him (says Mr. R. Palgrave) stands the Serjeant-at-Arms, holding up in air the sceptre of gilded silver that is called a mace. In the far distance at the end of the great haU, raised on high, sits the Speaker ; in solemn tones he questions the offender ; so frightened, indeed, was one poor fellow that he fell down on the floor of the house in a convulsive fit. Then the House directs the Speaker to give his reprimand, and the prisoner is perhaps led away with such words ringing in his ears as those addressed by Mr. Speaker Abbot to Sir W. Rawlins, Sheriff of Middlesex, in 1805 : \" Because you have, in defiance of the law of this country, knowingly and wilfidly violated at once the privileges of this House, and the just constitution of Parliament, you are committed to the gaol of Newgate, the common receptacle of malefactors, there to remain a prisoner \u2014 a signal proof of the power and justice of this House, an indelible disgrace upon you, and a memorable example to others.\" Speaking against a Member. \u2014 A curious question of privilege was brought before the House of Commons in December, 1640, by a petition from Leicestershire concerning an affront given to Sir Arthur Hazlerig, member for that county, at his election, by a Mr. Richard Holford. This person, it appears, had said, \" They had chosen a man for the knight of the shire who had more will than wit, and it was to the disparagement of the county.\" Sir John Northcote thus notes the pro ceedings which followed : \" CaUed in, says that if he made no better speech than the last he heard, they would have Uttle cause to joy in their choice. \u2014 Lord Grey of Groby (member for Leicester) : That he is no gentleman. That in memory of divers he kept hogs. \u2014 Sir A. Hazlerig : That the petition moved not from him, nor expects reparation. Offence to the House, because after election ; and to the county. \u2014 Ordered, to be sent to the Tower, to make humble submission, to be drawn here in house, and at Leicester assizes, and go to Tower.\" A Member Denouncing Fellow Members. \u2014 In February, 1880, Sir Charles RusseU, member for Westminster, complained to the House that a handbUl addressed to his constituents had been circulated by Mr. PUmsoU, member for Derby, in which his conduct in giving notice to oppose the Merchant Shipping BiU of the latter gentleman was stigmatised as inhuman and degrading. He represented this as an attempt to coerce and intimidate him in the discharge of his duties, and moved a resolution to that effect. A like complaint was made by another member. The discussion having been adjourned for two or three days to give time for consideration, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir S. Northcote) then moved, as a substitute for Sir Charles RusseU's resolution, the following : \" That in the opinion of this House the conduct of the honourable member for Derby, in publishing printed placards denouncing- the part taken by two"], [565, "PRIVILEGE. 545 members of this House in the proceedings of this House, was calculated to interfere with the due discharge of the duties of a member of this House, and is a breach of its privileges. But the House, having regard to the withdrawal by the honourable member for Derby of the expressions to which the honourable and gallant member for Westminster had drawn its attention, is of opinion that no further action on its part is necessary.\" The motion was warmly opposed, but eventuaUv carried by 182 to 116. Complaints of Outdoor Speeches.\u2014 On the 18th of June, 1883, Sir Stafford Northcote called the attention of the House of Commons to a speech delivered by Mr. Bright at Birmingham, in which he had charged the Conservative party with being in aUiance with Irish rebels to delay the business of Parliament ; and he moved that the words in question constituted a breach of privilege. The House, however, rejected the motion by 151 to 117. In July, 1885, Mr. CaUan (member for Louth) made a complaint respecting one of Mr. Bright's recent speeches, also moving that his words be declared a breach of privUege ; but this was rejected by 154 to 23. A Challenge in the Peers. \u2014 In November, 1780 (writes Camp beU), an affair of honour was brought before the House of Lords by Lord Chancellor Thurlow, as a breach of privilege. The Earl of Pomfret, erroneously supposing that a gamekeeper whom he had discharged had been countenanced by tho Duke of Grafton, wrote some very intemperate letters to his grace, and insisted on fighting him, either with sword or pistol. Thurlow, on tho rumour of what had happened, moved that they should attend in their places in the house ; and both parties being heard, it was resolved that the behaviour of the Duke of Grafton had been highly laudable and meritorious ; and Lord Pomfret, being made to kneel at the bar, was informed that he had been guilty of \" a high contempt of the House.\" The Privilege of Franking Letters.\u2014 This was first proposed when a Post-office BiU was before Parliament in 1660. The \" Parlia mentary History \" says : \" Sir Walter Earle delivered a proviso, for the letters of aU members of Parliament to go free during their sitting. Sir Heneage Finch said ' it was a poor, mendicant proviso, and below the honour of the House.' Mr. Prynne spoke also against the proviso ; Mr. Bunckley, Mr. Boscawen, Sir George Downing, and Serjeant Charlton, for it \u2014 the latter saying the counsels' letters were free. The question being caUed for, the Speaker, Sir Harbottle Grimstone, was unwUling to put it, saying he was ashamed of it ; nevertheless the proviso was carried, and made part of the biU, which was ordered to be engrossed. The Lords subsequently disagreed to this proviso, and it was ultimately thrown out. At a subsequent period, however, both Houses did not feel it to be below their honour to secure for themselves this exemption from postage.\" Breaking open Members' Letters. \u2014 In an abstract of \"Pro ceedings in the last Session of Parliament,\" published in the London Magazine for 1735, occurs the following: \" On Feb. 17, W r P r, N N"], [566, "546 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Esq., moved the H e of C ns, ' That the Postmaster General might be ordered to lay before that House a copy of his Majesty's warrant, whereby letters were permitted to pass free of the duty payable upon post letters ; ' which copy was accordingly laid before the House upon the 19th ; and on the 26th the same gentleman moved, ' That it might be taken into consideration.' The warrant being accordingly read, the House proceeded to take it into consideration ; upon which occasion complaints were made by several members that their letters were not only charged at the Post Office, but that they were often broken open and perused by the clerks ; and that this practice of breaking open letters was become so frequent, and was so publiekly known, that the very end for which that liberty was given to the postmasters was entirely disappointed ; for the intention being at first to discover any treasonable correspondence that might be carried on against the Government, that intention was rendered altogether vain, because by the practice of opening letters being so frequent, and so weU known, it was certain that no man would carry on any treasonable correspondence by means of the Post Office. . . It was moved that a committee should be appointed to inquire into the affair. This motion was supported by E d L le, Esq., member for M gh in WUtshire [and other members who are referred to in the same way], and it was a Uttle opposed by Sir R 1 W e and H ry P m, Esq. ; but at last they agreed to the motion, provided that committee should not enquire into anything that might tend to tho discovering of any of the secrets of the Government.\" The committee reported several resolutions to the House, by which the franking privUege was confirmed, and it was also eventuaUy agreed, \" That it is an high infringement of the privilege of the knights, citizens, and burgesses . . . to open or look into, by any means whatsoever, any letter directed to or signed by the proper hand of any member, without an express warrant in writing, under the hand of one of the principal Secretaries of State, or to detain or delay any such letter.\" The Opening of Private Letters. \u2014 A question on this subject was asked in the House of Commons in February, 1881, the Postmaster- General (Mr. Fawcett) being requested to say whether any officials of the Government were at present empowered to open and read, for purposes of State, private letters entrusted to the care of his department, either in Great Britain or Ireland. To this Sir William Harcourt (Home Secre tary) replied : \" The duty of answering this question belongs to the Secretary of State, and not to the Postmaster- General, who has no respon sibility in the matter. I will, therefore, with the leave of tbe House, reply to it. The power of the Secretary of State to open and detain letters is one reserved and sanctioned by Parliament in the statute 1st Victoria, c. 36, s. 25, and has been deliberately continued ever since. The employ ment of that power is an act of the gravest responsibility, not to be exer cised except upon urgent necessity for tbe safety of the State and of her Majesty's subjects. The existence, known to the Government, of treason able plots, carried out by secret societies like the Fenian conspiracy, which pursues felonious ends by the most atrocious means, would justify and"], [567, "PRIVILEGE. 547 require the use of that power in the present as in past times ; but the very nature of the dangers which might demand its employment is such as requires the Minister entrusted by Parliament with the right and the duty of putting it in force, to ask the support of this House in declining to make any statement which might baffle and defeat the object for which it was conferred. This power should either be taken away from the Secretary of State, or, if the grave responsibility of possessing it is imposed upon him, he should be protected in times like the present in his discretion as to its exercise.\" (See also p. 267.) Privilege of Printed Documents.\u2014 \" Stockdale v. Han- sard.\" \u2014 In the memorable struggle which arose in 1840 between the Commons and the courts of law on the subject of privilege, the Melbourne Cabinet (writes Torrens) stood firmly for the rights of either House of Parliament to print and publish matter of any kind whatsoever at its discretion. For printing and circulating the report of a Select Committee on Prisons, which stigmatised a certain book as \" disgusting and obscene,\" its pubUsher, J. J. Stockdale, brought an action against Messrs. Hansard, whose plea of authorisation was disaUowed by Lord Denmau, on the ground that no order of the House of Commons could justify the publication of a libel. Damages were assessed at \u00a3600, which the Sheriffs of Middlesex were directed by tho Court of Queen's Bench to pay over to the plaintiff. The House summoned them to appear at the bar, commanded them to refund the money to the defendants, and com mitted them for contempt of its privileges in hesitating to do so. A writ of habeas corpus required the Serjeant-at-Arms to bring the im prisoned Sheriffs into court, where their submission that they could not disobey the order of Parliament was aUowed, and they were remanded to Newgate. After weeks spent in discussing the conflict of jurisdiction, on the 5th of March a bill was brought in by Lord John RusseU, and carried by 149 to 106, interdicting aU further procedure in pendiug suits, and for the future rendering the privUege of either House a legal warrant for the report of any words spoken within its walls, or the circulation of any document laid upon its table. The Sheriffs were liberated under an order of the House. The Umbrella Case. \u2014 Lord Eldon, shortly before his retirement in 1827, took occasion to vindicate ParUamentary privilege on a very peculiar occasion. A stranger, having been admitted below the bar of the House of Lords, was required by one of the doorkeepers to deposit his umbreUa in an anteroom, and the article not being returned to him when the debate was over, he brought an action against the messenger for the value of it, and recovered a verdict for 17s. 6d., with 2s. lOd. costs. Complaint, however, being made to the ChanceUor respecting the business, he caused the plaintiff and his attorney to be summoned at the bar, and only refrained from committing them to Newgate on their making a humble apology, and renouncing the fruits of their verdict. Claim to the Franchise by Peers.\u2014 During the registrations of the year 1872, this subject came before the law courts, on claims mado N N 2"], [568, "548 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. by the Marquis of SaUsbury and Earl Beauchamp, the former to vote in elections for the counties of Middlesex and Hertford, and the latter in the county of Worcester. In the registration court at Hatfield, the revising barrister (Mr. Charles Clark) had disallowed the claim of the Marquis of Salisbury, making the following remarks : \" Though there can be no Common Law rule in the ordinary sense of that term, except what has been pronounced by a decision of the Common Law Judges, nor any legal incapacity created in a particular subject by statute, except such as has been created by the wUl of the two Houses, assented to by the Sovereign, there can bo a Common Law of Parliament which is not so created \u2014 a law of Parliament necessary for the dignity and freedom of each House of Parliament, and declared to be so by each House. And when that declaration had, for all time past, been left uncontested by the Upper House, that fact gives it the authority of an admitted right and invests it with the character of a law. In this way the Common Law of Parliament had been declared, and its declarations had been admitted, to the effect that no peer of the realm has the right to concern himself in the election of persons to serve as members of the House of Commons. By this Common Law of Parliament a ' legal incapacity ' was created in a peer of the realm which prevented him from being entitled to be put on the register of voters for electing Members of Parliament.\" On appeal, the case was heard, with others of similar nature, in the Court of Common Pleas ; when, the counsel for the appeUants having admitted that they could quote neither precedent nor authority in support of the claim, the Court dismissed the appeals, without calling upon the other side. A Peerage Inalienable. \u2014 In the 15th year of the reign of Charles I. (1640), Roger Stafford, by fine levied at Westminster, surrendered the barony of Stafford into the King's hands, in considera tion of 800?. paid to him by the King. But in the case of tho barony of Grey of Rnthyn it was resolved by the House of Lords, \" That no peer of this realm can drown or extinguish his honour, neither by surrender, grant, fine, nor any other conveyance to the King, but that it descends to his descendants.\" And some yrears after (in the Purbeck case), the validity of a surrender by fine to the King being questioned, it was resolved by the House of Lords, upon great deliberation, and after hearing the Attorney-General, that such a surrender was void. The Relations of Members and Political Clubs. \u2014 In June, 1876, Sir W. Fraser brought under the notice of the House of Commons a letter sent to one of its members, Mr. Ripley, by the political committee of the Reform Club, calling his attention to his recent votes in Parlia ment. The letter amounted, he said, to a menace, and, according to the rules of the House, the menacing of a member was a breach of privilege. He moved (amid some laughter) that the writer of the letter be ordered to atteud at the bar. \u2014 Sir George Bowyer said he also had received a similar letter. \u2014 Mr. Disraeli said that technically such a letter, if intended to influence the votes of a member, was an interference with privilege, as many things were which were prudently passed over. But he thought it"], [569, "PRIVILEGE. 549 would be wise not to pursue the discussion. A very great indiscretion had been committed, in his opinion, by the committee in question, and he thought that pubUc notice of it might prevent its repetition, or, if repeated, it would probably be harmless. He advised that the motion should be withdrawn, or be should meet it by moving the previous question. \u2014 The motion was withdrawn accordingly. A \" Reprehensible \" Practice. \u2014 In the session of 1877, one of the metropolitan members (Mr. Forsyth) asked a question of the Speaker with reference to the privilege of members. He said he had received several circulars headed \" Laymen's Association,\" and would read one of them : \" Sir, \u2014 As one of your constituents, I beg to address you as to the Public Worship Regulation Act, 1874. The passing of that Act was so notoriously partisan, and the confusion and injustice consequent on its working have been so prejudicial to the work of the Church in many parishes, that I am compelled as a matter of duty to ask you whether you wUl vote for its repeal. I beg very courteously, but still firmly, to inform you that at the next election I shall, apart from all questions of politics, feel it my duty to withhold my vote from any candidate who will not pledge himself to the repeal of this Act.\" He said he had no objection to any one of his constituents expressing his opinion ; but he did object to a body of men banding themselves together to manufacture printed papers asking his constituents not to support him if he did not give his vote in a particular way. That seemed little less than intimidation, and he wished to know whether a breach of privilege had been committed. The Speaker (Mr. Brand) replied : \" Tho honourable member for Maryle bone has handed to me a copy of the circular which he has now read. I cannot say that it constitutes a breach of privilege ; but at the same time I am bound to observe that expressions such as those contained in that circular are calculated to influence the independent judgment of members, and as such are highly reprehensible.\" \u2014 The House signified its assent to this by cheers. Mr. Grissell's Case. \u2014 In July, 1879, Lord Henry Lennox, as chairman of a committee of tho House of Commons on the Tower High Level Bridge Bill, called attention to a special report made by the com mittee, which stated that Mr. Charles E. Grissell had represented to the agents conducting the opposition to the bill that he could control the decision of the committee, and would procure the withdrawal or rejection of the biU for the sum of 2000?. A debate ensued, and after much dis cussion it was agreed, at the instance of Sir Stafford Northcote (Chan ceUor of the Exchequer), that the matter should be referred to a select committee for investigation. This committee reported that a breach of the privileges of the House had been committed by Mr. Grissell, and that Mr. John S. Ward, the solicitor who had introduced him to the agents for tho opposition to the bill, was cognisant of Mr. Grissell's offence, and had assisted him in its commission. A few days later, on July 22, it was agreed that both the offenders shoidd be ordered to attend the House on the following day. Mr. Ward appeared, and, having been ordered into the \u25a0custody of th s Serjeant-at-Arms, was confined in a room in the Clock"], [570, "550 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Tower, and a week afterwards was released on a motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the effect that \" he had entirely submitted himself to the House, and expressed his sorrow and regret for his offence, and had already suffered in his health.\" The fees paid by the offender amounted to 14?. ; the fee for arrest or \"caption money \" being 5?., the orders for committal and release 1?. each, and 1?. per day during the imprisonment. Mr. GrisseU had betaken himself to Boulogne before the Speaker's warrant could be executed, and a messenger of the Serjeant-at-Arms found him staying at an hotel there under the name of Graham. Knowing that the power of the House to commit an offender or retain him in custody determined with the session, GrisseU came to London and surrendered himself to the Serjeant-at-Arms on August. 13. On August 14 he was committed to Newgate, to be released the next day, when Parliament was prorogued ; but the Speaker explained that, although the prisoner would be released on the prorogation of Parliament, he would be liable to further imprisonment in another session at the pleasure of the House. Two days before the Parliament again met, in February, 1880, Mr. GrisseU for warded to Mr. Walpole, for presentation to the House, a petition praying for its forgiveness. Mr. Walpole did not consider the petition submissive enough, and the matter dropped until the ChanceUor of the Exchequer gave notice of a motion referring to the case. Mr. Grissell then forwarded to Mr. Walpole a petition, described by that gentleman as completely sub missive, which was presented on the 2nd of March. But the House of Commons was not content with a mere verbal submission. The Chan ceUor of the Exchequer moved that Mr. Grissell be sent for in the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, and reprimanded at the bar of the House. A strong feeling was expressed, however, that the House should reserve its discretion of dealing with Mr. Grissell as it thought best, untU it had him in its custody; the motion, with Sir Stafford Northcote's consent, was amended by the omission of the last clause, and Mr. GrisseU was ordered to attend on the foUowing day on the Speaker's warrant in the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. When he had been brought to the bar, the Speaker addressed him, recapitulating the circumstances of the case, but adding that the House was wiUing to hear any explanation he might think fit to offer. Mr. Grissell then expressed his \" deep regret for bis grave offence,\" and threw himself upon the merciful consideration of the House ; after which he was ordered to withdraw. On the motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, seconded by a leading member of the Opposition (Mr. Forster), a resolution was passed to the effect that Mr. GrisseU, having previously evaded punishment for his offence, be committed to Newgate ; and he was accordingly removed thither. His imprisonment was terminated by the dissolution of Parliament a few days later. EXCLUSION OF STRANGEKS. \" Among the privileges of Parliament,\" says Sir Erskine May, \" none had been more frequently exercised (down to 1782) by both Houses than the exclusion of strangers from their deliberations. Precautions were"], [571, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS. 551 necessary to prevent confusion ; for even so late as 1771 a stranger was counted in a division. When the debates in Parliament began to excite the interest of the public, and to attract an eager audience, the presence of strangers was connived at. They could be dismissed in a moment, at the instance of any member j but the Speaker was not often caUed upon to enforce the orders of the House.\" The foUowing are some of the occasions on which this privUege has been exercised : \u2014 The Unreported Parliament. \u2014 Mr. Wright, in his advertisement to \" Cavendish's Debates,\" referring to the Parliament commonly known by the designation of the \" Unreported Parliament,\" says .- \" Much regret has often been expressed that the proceedings of the House of Commons during the thirteenth ParUament of Great Britain, which met in May, 1768, and was dissolved in June, 1774, should, in consequence of the strict enforcement of the standing order for the exclusion of strangers from the gaUery of the House, have remained nearly a blank in the history of the country.\" It was known that Sir Henry Cavendish had taken, in short hand, an account of the debates during that period; and Mr. Wright suc ceeded in finding it among the Egerton manuscripts. It consists of forty-nine small quarto volumes, and contains notes of aU the principal debates which took place during the six sessions of the above-mentioned Parliament. Mutual Exclusion of the Lords and the Commons. \u2014 On tho 10th of December, 1770, the Duke of Manchester rose in the House of Lords to make a motion relative to preparations for the war with Spain, then believed to be impending, when he was interrupted by Lord Gower, who desired that the house might be cleared. Tho messengers were already proceeding to clear the house, when several members of the House of Commons, who had been waiting at the bar to bring up a bill, desired to stay for that purpose, but were turned out with the crowd \u2014 several peers having gone down to the bar to hasten their withdrawal. They were presently called in again ; but the moment they had delivered their message, and before time had been aUowed them to withdraw from tho bar, an outcry arose, and they were literaUy hooted out of the house. Furious at their indecent treatment, the members hastened back to their own house. The first result of their anger was sufficiently ridiculous. Mr. George Onslow desired the house to be cleared, \" peers and aU.\" The only peers below the bar were the very lords who had in vain resisted the exclusion of strangers from their own house, which they had just left in indignation ; and now the resentment of the Commons, provoked by others, was first expended upon them. . . Lord Chatham happUy expressed his contempt for a senate debating with closed doors. Writing to Colonel Barre on the 22nd of January, 1771, he says, \" I take it for granted that the same declaration wiU be laid before the tapestry on Friday, which wiU be offered to the live figures in St. Stephen's; \" and again on the 25th he writes to Lady Chatham, \" Just returned from the tapestry.\" The mutual exclusion of tho members of the two Houses con tinued to be enforced in a spirit of vindictive retaliation for several years. Way's \" Constitutional History.\""], [572, "552 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Garrick Hiding Himself in the GaUery.\u2014 Mr. Peter Burke relates that in the spring of 1777, Garrick chanced to be present in the gaUery of the House of Commons during a debate which produced an altercation between two members, that became so warm as to obUge the Speaker and the House to interpose to prevent a duel. WhUst the assembly was in this agitation, a Shropshire member observed Mr. Garrick sitting in the gallery, and immediately moved to clear the house. Roseius contrived to keep himself concealed, and avoided the consequence of the illiberal motion. But when the same gentleman, the day after, harangued the House on the impropriety of suffering players to hear the de bates, Mr. Burke arose and appealed to the honourable assembly whether it could possibly be consistent with the rules of decency and liberality to exclude from the hearing of their debates a man to whom they were all obliged \u2014 one who was the great master of eloquence \u2014 in whose school they had aU imbibed the art of speaking, and been taught the elements of rhetoric. For his part, he owned that he had been greatly indebted to his instructions. Much more he said in commendation of Mr. Garrick, and was warmly seconded by Mr. Fox and Mr. Thomas Townsend. Motion by Mr. John O'ConneU. \u2014 The questions of privilege and the presence of strangers in the house were raised on the 18th May, 1849, by the member for Limerick, Mr. John O'ConneU, who spoke as foUows : \" Having seen in the Times newspaper another breach of the privileges of this House, by a report of the last discussion upon the Parliamentary Oaths Bill, in which report not only were the rules of the House violated, but the arguments of some Catholic members were entirely omitted, whilst the arguments against them were duly reported, I shall to-night, when the discussion upon the Parliamentary Oaths BiU comes before the House, endeavour to ascertain if there be strangers present, and if I find that to be the case, I shall draw the attention of the House to that fact.\" Later on the same night, when the House went into committee on the bUl referred to, Mr. J. O'ConneU, in pursuance of his notice, directed the attention of the chairman (Mr. Bernal) towards the reporters' gaUery, and said, \" Sir, I perceive that there are strangers in that gaUery.\" The chairman having given the order, aU strangers present were ex cluded. Motion by Colonel Thompson to Alter the Rule. \u2014 In con- sequence of the exclusion of strangers by the member for Limerick, Colonel Thompson, on the 24th May, 1849, moved \" That this House wUl take into its consideration the rule or practice whereby strangers have been excluded on the motion of any single member, with a view to alter the same ; so that a motion for the exclusion of strangers shaU be made and seconded, and question thereupon be put, as is the practice with other motions.\" The motion was, however, negatived. Mr. J. O'ConneU, on the 8th of June, again caused the galleries to be cleared of strangers. The circumstance is thus given in \" Hansard \" : \u2014 The Poor Relief (Ireland) BiU was about to be considered in committee when Mr. O'ConneU said; \"Sir, after the specimen of fairness which I experienced when I was going to express my opinion on the Poor Law just before tho last"], [573, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS. 553 division, there is but one course left me, \u2014 either to insist on the House enforcing justice to its members, or by doing away with an absurd practice ; and therefore, Sir, I see strangers present \" (waving his hat towards the reporters' gallery). Strangers were immediately ordered to withdraw. Motion hy Mr. Crawfurd.\u2014 On the 24th of April, 1870, Mr. W. Fowler, the member for Cambridge, asked leave to bring in a biU for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. Mr. Crawrfurd, member for the Ayr Burghs, then caUed the attention of the Speaker to the fact that there were strangers in the house. The Times gives the foUowing report of what took place thereupon : \u2014 \" This unusual proceeding caused some commotion. Honourable members turned towards Mr. Crawfurd, inquiring whether he intended to insist on the point of order he had raised ; others looked to the Speaker, awaiting his order to the officers to clear the gaUeries ; and in this interval of suspense Mr. Bouverie rose and said, if the honourable member persisted in caUing attention to the presence of strangers, they must be ordered to leave. The Speaker was understood to suggest that on reconsideration the honourable member might not wish to insist on excluding strangers. He then said, very slowly, ' Does the honourable member persist ? Strangers must ' Several honourable members exclaimed ' Withdraw ! withdraw ! ' Mr. Bouverie : ' There is no motion.' The Speaker : ' Does the honourable member persist ? ' Mr. Crawfurd : 'I do, sir.' The Speaker : ' The gaUeries must be cleared.' The officers proceeded to clear the Speaker's and the strangers' galleries, and the reporters withdrew from their gaUery.\" It is deserving of remark, and perhaps may be considered as a sort of apology to the reporters for their share in the general exclusion, that on being re-admitted to their gaUery they were greeted with a burst of cheering from the House. On the 20th of July, 1870, it is recorded in \" Hansard,\" the debate on the Contagious Diseases Acts was resumed, and, as on the previous discus sion, Mr. Crawfurd caUed the attention of the Speaker to the presence of strangers, whereupon they were ordered to withdraw. Alteration of the Rule.\u2014 On the 27th of April, 1875, the gal leries were crowded with members and visitors anxious to hear a debate on the export of horses, brought on by Mr. Chaplin; but before this gentleman could rise to propose his motion, Mr. Biggar, member for Cavan, caUed the Speaker's attention to the presence of strangers. In the peers' gallery at the time, the Prince of Wales was seated, with many members of the Upper House (Mr. Biggar, however, afterwards dis claimed knowledge of this fact), and amongst other distinguished per sonages was the German ambassador. The Speaker pointedly asked the honourable gentleman whether he intended to take notice of the strangers, and receiving an affirmative answer, immediately ordered the gaUeries to be cleared, which was done, the ladies only being allowed to remain. Then ensued a scene of much excitement. The Prime Minister (Mr. DisraeU) rose and said, \" I regret that the House is caUed upon by the act of the honourable gentleman to take a step which brings discredit upon the House. The honourable gentleman should remember that this"], [574, "554 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. House is an assembly of gentlemen* and it has not been the practice of gentlemen to take the step which he has adopted, unless there has been some strong and imperious public necessity to justify it. No reason has been assigned for the extraordinary course be has adopted ; a course cal- culated to discredit the House, and I think I am justified in saying that it is repugnant to the general \u2014 I might almost say the unanimous \u2014 feeling of the House. (General cheering.) Under these circumstances I feel it necessary to move that the standing order relative to the admission of strangers be suspended during the sitting of the House.\" The motion was seconded by the leader of the Opposition (the Marquis of Hartington), and Mr. Biggar, having been called upon by other members to state bis reasons for his extraordinary proceeding, declared that he desired to amend the unsatisfactory relations of the Press in regard to the House,-f aud should pursue a similar course every evening untU an alteration was made in the rules relating to strangers and reporters. Other Irish members warmly repudiated his action, as tending to bring discredit upon themselves, and one (Mr. Bryan) told the honourable gentleman that he should remember it was the duty of a representative to be first a gentle- man and next a patriot. The motion for suspension of the standing order was carried unanimously, and, strangers being re-admitted, the first who took his seat was the Prince of Wales. A week afterwards the Marquis of Hartington brought forward resolutions intended to recognise formally the reporting of debates, Sue., unless such reports were expressly forbidden, and also the presence of strangers under ordinary circum- stances ; but during the debate on this motion, the gaUeries were again cleared on the demand of Mr. SuUivan. The debate was adjourned untU the 31st of May, wheu the Marquis of Harrington's resolutions were re jected, and the foUowing, proposed by Mr. Disraeli, was eventually adopted : \" That if at any sitting of the House or of a Committee any member shaU take notice of the presence of strangers, Mr. Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, shaU forthwith put the question without debate or amendment ; provided that Mr. Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, may, whenever he thinks fit, order the withdrawal oi strangers from any part of the house.\" First Application of the New Rule. \u2014 In April, 1878, the rule thus passed was applied under peculiar circumstances. Mr. O'Donnell rose to propose a resolution censuring the action of the Government in Donegal, consequent upon the recent murder of Lord Leitrim ; and his remarks gave rise to much interruption. Mr. King-Harman \" spied strangers,\" and the question that they be ordered to withdraw was then put by the Speaker without debate, and carried by 57 to 12. The reporters' and other gaUeries were cleared about half-past nine, and not reopened until half -past twelve, the proceedings within the House meanwhile, it was understood, having been of a turbulent character. * \" St. Stephen takes not from St. Gile3 his art, But is a true good gentleman at heart.\" \u2014 Lytton' s \"St. Stephen's.\" f See \" The Commons and the Press in 1875,\" page 567."], [575, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS. 555 An Intruder in the House. \u2014 During the session of 1642, one Mr. Shepherd, a stranger, came into the house, and stood behind the serjeant. So divers espied him out, and caUed him to the bar. There he would not teU his name, but said he was a Bedfordshire man. As divers knew him he was dismissed. \u2014 Harl. MSS. Intruders in 1875. \u2014 In the month of March, 1875, an incident occurred, the particulars of which are gathered from the Times : \u2014 During the debate two strangers entered the house by the members' doorway, and took seats in the body of the house, close by the chair of the Serjeant-at- Arms. There they sat, according to their own story, for over half an hour. At length a division was caUed. The Speaker's wonted emphatic warning, \" Strangers must withdraw,\" feU upon deaf ears, for the two strangers did not understand the summons, and remained in the places they had taken. By this time the Serjeant's attention had been caUed to them, and the first order they received was, \" Take off your hats.\" As the doors were locked the intruders could not be turned out; and it would have been against aU parliamentary precedent to unlock tho doors for any purpose. They were therefore led upstairs into the gallery reserved for distin guished strangers, and after the division was over were severely taken to task by the officials of the House. Their explanation was simple. They had orders for the strangers' gaUery ; they were told by a policeman in the central hall to walk \" straight on,\" and had done so only too literaUy. It was thought, on the whole, inexpedient to make too much of this inci dent by taking the delinquents into custody, as they really appeared to have erred through ignorance, and therefore no notice was taken by the House of their intrusion. But they were severely admonished, and, pro bably, were duly scared by the representation of the penalties they might have incurred, and the serious breach they had committed of tho staucUng orders. A Stranger Counted in a Division. \u2014 A division took place in the House of Commons, February 11th, 1771, on the bill to repeal a clause of the Niriluni Tempus Act, when it happened, says the \" Parliamentary History,\" that among the members coming in on the division, a stranger, who had continued in the lobby after it was cleared, had come in and was told as one of the \"noes.\" The stranger was brought to the bar, and, by general consent of the House, dismissed, with a caution from Mr. Speaker not to be guilty of tho like offence again. It appeared that the intruder was a merchant of Bermuda, and that he was personally known to several of the members. The Strangers' Gallery. \u2014 The question of admitting the public to the strangers' gallery of the House of Commons without a member's order was raised, February 1st, 1837, by Mr. Ewart, who considered that the existing system was a great injury to the unrepresented class. His proposition was opposed by Lord John Russell, on the ground that on aU great occasions the gallery would be inconveniently crowded, and that pickpockets were likely to put in an appearance among the respectable visitors. A division gavo the result of eleven for the opening, and one hundred and seventy-three against it."], [576, "556 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Applause in the Strangers' Gallery.\u2014 There is a strict rule in the House of Commons forbidding any demonstration of feeling by strangers admitted to the gaUeries. A gentleman who occupied a seat in the Speaker's Gallery in April, 1888, so far disregarded the order as to clap his hands enthusiastically at the close of a speech by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, in reply to Mr. Gladstone on the death duties. The offender was promptly compelled to quit the House. \u2014 It must be noted that the \" Strangers' GaUery \" and the \" Speaker's GaUery \" were amalgamated in June, 1888. In the latter year the daily average of attendance in these galleries was 219. Applause in the Ladies' GaUery. \u2014 On the 5th of June, 1888, a subject of delicate nature (the working of the Contagious Diseases Act in in India) came before the House of Commons. Ladies presenting them selves for admission to the gallery aUotted to them were, by direction of the Speaker, advised of the exceptional nature of the business before the House ; but nearly all elected to remain, about twenty being present throughout the discussion. At the close of one member's speech a loud clapping of hands was heard, the Speaker immediately crying \" Order,\" while the leader of the House (Mr. W. H. Smith) was observed pointing out to the right honourable gentleman the ladies' gallery as the quarter from which the disturbance had proceeded. Dynamiters in the House of Commons. \u2014 On the meeting of the House for a new session, February 9, 1888, Lord Ebringtou asked tho Home Secretary whether he could give any information as to how a person who was recently convicted and sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude for dynamite conspiracy gained admission to the gaUery and precincts of the House, and whether he proposed to take any steps to inquire into tho circumstances. \u2014 Mr. Matthews, in reply, said : \" I have inquired into the circumstances mentioned. The convict Harkins, who was sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude, gained admission to the Speaker's Gallery on August 5, under the name of M'Linn. In connection with him was admitted another person, named MelvUle. whose real name is Moroney. He was concerned in the same conspiracy, and there is a warrant out against him not executed. These two persons were admitted by an order obtained by an honourable member of this House. It is not clear that they were introduced to the House by him. Melville was known to be a suspicious character, and was weU watched. He not only entered the Speaker's GaUery, but both persons spent some time on the terrace of the House. This seems to show that the order for admission requires to be accom panied by some better safeguards than exist at present.\" A select com mittee was shortly after appointed to inquire into the regulations as to the admission of strangers, and, in consequence of its report, more stringent rules were adopted. \u2014 A dynamite explosion took place in the immediate precincts of the Houses of Parliament on Jan. 24, 1885, and did much damage in Westminster HaU. Another infernal machine had been laid in the Commons' chamber, and also exploded with damage. The day was a Saturday, when the public are admitted to the buildings, the Houses not sitting."], [577, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS. 557 The Peeresses' Gallery. \u2014 The peeresses' galleries of the House of Lords are set apart for the unmarried daughters of peers ; and if the daughter of a peer marries a commoner, she loses her privilege. Horace Walpole teUs the story of the struggle of the peeresses for admission into the house, and their ultimate triumph over every obstacle. They had been admitted, but made such a noise that orders were issued that their presence could no longer be tolerated. But they came again. The Lord ChanceUor swore they should not enter, and a noble duchess, with equal warmth, swore they would. The doors were shut on them, and they tried what rapping would do ; but, though this stopped the debate, it faUed to open the doors. Then silence was called for half an hour, when the peers, confident that the enemy must be gone, and thirsting for fresh air, ordered the doors to be re-opened, and in rushed the victorious band. Waiting to Conquer. \u2014 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu gives tho story of the triumph of the ladies over the Lords, in entertaining detail. She writes to Lady Pomfret (1738) : \" The ladies have shown their zeal and appetite for knowledge in a most glorious manner. At the last warm debate in the House of Lords, it was unanimously resolved that there should be no crowd of unnecessary auditors ; consequently the fair sex were excluded, and the gaUery destined to the solo use of the House of Commons. Notwithstanding which determination, a tribe of dames resolved to show on this occasion that neither men nor laws could resist them. These heroines were Lady Huntingdon, the Duchess of Queens berry, the Duchess of Ancastcr, Lady Westmorland, Lady Cobham, Lady Charlotte Edwin, Lady Archibald Hamilton and her daughter, Mrs. Scott, Mrs. Pendarvis, and Lady Francis Saimderson. I am thus particular in their names, since I look upon them to be the boldest assertors and most resigned sufferers for liberty I ever heard of. They presented them selves at the door at nine o'clock in the morning, where Sir William Saunderson respectfuUy informed them that the ChanceUor had made an order against their admittance. The Duchess of Quecnsberry, as head of the squadron, pished at the Ul-breediug of a mere lawyer, and desired him to let them up the stairs privately. After some modest refusals, he swore by G \u2014 he would not let them in. Her grace, with a noble warmth, answered by G \u2014 they would come in, in spite of the Clian ceUor and the whole House. This being reported, the peers resolved to starve them out ; an order was made that the doors should not be opened tiU they had raised their siege. These amazons now showed themselves qualified for the duty even of foot soldiers ; they stood there tiU five in the afternoon, without either sustenance or intermission, every now and then playing volleys of thumps, kicks, and raps against the door, with so much violence that the speakers in the house were scarce heard. When the Lords were not to be conquered by this, the two duchesses (very well apprised of the use of stratagems in war) commanded a dead sUenco of half an hour ; aud the ChanceUor, who thought this a certain proof of absence (the Commons also being very impatient to enter), gave order for the opening of the door ; upon which they all rushed in, pushed aside their competitors, and placed themselves in the front rows of the gaUery."], [578, "558 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. They stayed there till after eleven, when the House rose, and during the debate gave applause, and showed marks of dislike, not only by smiles and winks (which have always been aUowed in these cases), but by noisy laughs and apparent contempts ; which is supposed the true reason why Lord Hcrvey spoke miserably. I beg your pardon, dear madam, for this long narration, but it is impossible to be short on so copious a subject ; and you must own this action to be very weU worthy of record, and I think not to be paraUeled in any history, ancient or modern.\" Taking Possession of the Throne. \u2014 Mr. GreviUe writes : \" April 4, 1829. \u2014 The House of Lords was very fuU (to hear the Catholic Relief debates), particularly of women ; every fool in London thinks it necessary to be there. It is only since last year that tbe steps of the throne have been crowded with ladies ; formerly one or two got in, who skulked behind the throne, or were hid in Tyrwhitt's * box, but now they fill the whole space, and put themselves in front with their large bonnets, without either fear or shame. . . Lady Jersey is in a fury with Lord Anglesey, and goes about saying he insulted her in the House of Lords the other night. She was sitting on one of the steps of the throne, and the Duchess of Richmond on the step above. After Lord Anglesey had spoken he came to talk to the duchess, who said, ' How weU you did speak ; ' on which he said, ' Hush ! you must take care what you say, for here is Lady Jersey, and she reports for the newspapers ; ' on which Lady Jersey said very angrily, ' Lady Jersey is here for her own amusement ; what do you mean by reporting for newspapers ? ' to which he replied with a profound bow, ' I beg your ladyship's pardon ; I did not mean to offend you, and if I did I beg to make the most ample apology.' This is his version ; hers, of course, is different.\" Presence of Ladies in the Commons. \u2014 It was the practice in olden times for ladies to be present among other strangers in the gaUery of the House of Commons. It appears from \" Grey's Debates \" that on the 1st of June, 1675, some ladies were in the gallery peeping over the gentlemen's shoulders. The Speaker, spying them, cried out, \" What borough do those ladies serve for ? \" to which Mr. Wm. Coventry repUed, \" They serve for the Speaker's Chamber.\" Sir Thomas Littleton said, \" The Speaker might mistake them for gentlemen with fine sleeves dressed like ladies.\" Says the Speaker, \" I am sure I saw petticoats.\" \u2014 Mrs. Montagu wrote as foUows to one of her friends in February, 1762 : \" In the House of Commons every boy who can articulate is a speaker, to the great dispatch of business and solidity of councils. They sit late every night, as every youug gentleman who has a handsome person, a fine coat, a well-shaped leg, or a clear voice, is to exhibit these advantages. To this kind of beau-oratory and tea-table talk, the ladies, as is reasonable, resort very constantly. At first they attended in such numbers as to fill the body of the house on great political questions, but . . a o-kostf started up in a dirty obscure alley in the city, and diverted the attention of the female politicians.\" \u2014 In 1778, on the 2nd of February, a lar^e * The Usher of the Black Eod. t The Cock-lane ghost."], [579, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 PUBLICATION OF DEBATES. 559 number of ladies were present to hear a great debate on the state of the nation ; we are told that they fiUed the whole gaUeiy and the seats under the front gaUery. Captain Johnstone, of the navy (commonly caUed Governor Johnstone), being angry that the house was cleared of aU the \" men strangers,\" amongst whom were some friends he had introduced, insisted that aU strangers should withdraw, but so much opposition was shown by the fair audience that it took two hours to enforce the order. After this, ladies were excluded from the house, and, untU 1834, could only obtain a glimpse of its proceedings by peeping down the \" lantern \" over the largest chandelier. The Ladies' Gallery in the Commons. \u2014 An amusing discussion on this subject took place in the House of Commons in July, 1869. Mr. H. Herbert moved, \" That in the opinion of this House the grating in front of the ladies' gallery should bo removed.\" He said the gaUery was not such a place as ladies ought to occupy. It had been weU remarked that it would be a chamber of horrors but for those who occupied it. There was no escape from the vitiated atmosphere, and the ladies were obliged to be confined \u2014 (great laughter) \u2014 were kept for hours in that con- fined space. In this age of civilisation it was absurd to have the ladies placed behind a grating. \u2014 Mr. Beresford Hope said, on behalf of the ladies themselves, he thought it would be a cruel kindness to take away the barrier. What the ladies desired was one or two hours' rational amuse- ment \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and for that purpose it was best for them to come there in morning dress and in then- bonnets, aud to be placed in a position where they could not be molested by impertinent glances. He deprecated any change which might tend to establish a flirting place there. \u2014 Mr. Layard (First Commissioner of Works) said he had asked at least two hundred ladies, and they were, almost without exception, in favour of retain- ing the grating. He read a letter from a lady, pointing out the advantages the grUle or grating conferred on all parties. One was, that it enabled a lady to leave when a bore was speaking, even though that bore happened to be the friend who had obtained her seat for her. Ho thought there was a good deal of truth in that letter, and that the House would take the ladies' view of the matter. The House did, and the motion was withdrawn. \u2014 Another discussion on the subject arose in March, 1885, when Mr. Sydney Buxton moved \" that the accommodation of the ladies' gallery should be improved,\" but the proposal was rejected by 121 to 75. PUBLICATION OF DEBATES. Members Punished for Divulging Debates.\u2014 In the reign of Henry VII. (says Oldfield) a member of the House of Commons was committed to the Tower for acquainting the King with the debates in Parliament, and both he and his posterity were by an Act disabled from ever sitting or serving as representatives for any place whatever. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth there was a similar case, when Arthur HaU, Esq., was committed to the Tower for six months, fined five hundred pounds, and expeUed the House, for having published the debates."], [580, "560 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Dislike of the House to Note-taking.\u2014 In March, 1641-2, a special instance occurred of the jealousy very frequently exhibited by members of the House in regard to the practice of note-taking. Sir Edward Alford, member for Arundel, had been observed taking notes of a proposed declaration moved by Pym. Sir Walter Earle, member for Weymouth, upon this objected that he had seen \" some at the lower end comparing their notes, and one of them had gone out.\" Alford was thereupon called back, and his notes required to be given up to the Speaker. D'Ewes, who gives these particulars, continues : \" Sir Henry Vane, sen., sitting at that time next me, said he could remember when no man was allowed to take notes, and wished it to be now forbidden. Which occasioned me, being the principal note-taker in the House, to say that the practice existed before he was born ; for I had a journal, 13th Elizabeth. For my part I shaU not communicate my journal (by which I meant the entire copy of it) to any man living. If you wiU not permit us to write, we must go to sleep, as some among us do, or go to plays, as others have done.\" Note-taking Cannot be Stopped. \u2014 Sir Simonds D'Ewes also relates that when the clerk of the House was questioned as to who did sometimes write out of his journal-book, or were present, \" he said Mr. Moore and Mr. BodreU did often write out of the same, and that myself was sometimes present. But I, mistaking him and conceiving that he ranked me amongst the transcribers (who scarcely wrote three words out of his journal-book in three months), was very angry with him, and stood up and said that I was, indeed, often present when others transcribed out of the said journal, but did myself write not out of that, but out of my head.\" A delicate matter coming under debate next day, some members arose in much excitement to suggest that the debate be adjourned for a day, and that no one meanwhUe be permitted to take notes. \" Stop note taking ! \" cried D'Ewes, \" you cannot ; or, if you can, make men hold their tongues, then, as weU ! \" Manufacture of Fictitious Speeches and Petitions. \u2014 One of the natural consequences of the jealousy as to note-taking in Parliament was the manufacture of fictitious and garbled accounts of its proceedings. Sir Simonds D'Ewes has the foUowing in his Notes on the discussions in the Long Parliament: \"After prayers I said that much wrong was offered of late to several members by publishing speeches in their names which they never spake. I had yesternight a speech brought me by a stationer to whom one John Benuet, a poet lodging in Shoe Lane, sold it for half-a crown to be printed. He gives it as my speech at a conference, when there was no conference.\" Fictitious petitions were got up in the same way. On the 25th of January, 1641-2, the matter of a Royalist petition from Hertfordshire was before the House, and the subjoined entry is made by D'Ewes : \" Thomas Hulbert, one of the framers of the Hertfordshire petition, sent for as a delinquent, also Martin Eldred, one of the penners of the same. The said Martin Eldred, being called into the house, did acknowledge that Thomas Hulbert, a young scholar of Cambridge, did draw the said false petition of Hertfordshire in his presence, and that they"], [581, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 PUBLICATION OF DEBATES. 561 sold it to the said John Greensmith, a stationer, for half-a-erown, which the said Greensmith, being caUed on, did likewise confess, and that he printed it. I said there were now abiding in and about London certain loose beggarly scholars who did in alehouses invent speeches, and make speeches of members in ParUament, and of other passages supposed to be hancUed in or presented unto this House. That the licence of printing these scandalous pamphlets is grown to a very great height,\" &c. Wherefore the indignant Sir Simonds would have Mr. Thomas Hulbert, and Mr. Martin Eldred, and Mr. John Greensmith forthwith conveyed to the Gatehouse. The Father of Parliamentary Reporting. \u2014 This title would appear fairly to belong to Rushworth, that assistant clerk of the House of Commons to whom aU later writers have been so largely indebted for the \" Historical CoUections.\" Rushworth displayed in perfection the quaUties of his reporting successors in later days, when he steadUy went on taking his shorthand notes amid the excitement attending Charles's entry to arrest the five members (p. 32). But it is curious to find members of the House of Commons objecting to the use of shorthand by its own servant at the table. Such, however, was the disUke to elaborate note-taking, and so keen the recoUection of the punishment which had faUen on Eliot and others for words uttered in the House, that this objection was made in the earlier days of the Long Parliament. In the \" Note-book of Sir John Northcote,\" lately pubUshed, occurs the foUowing entry, under December 1, 1640 : \u2014 \" Sir Jo. Hotham (spoke) against Mr. Rushworth taking notes by shorthand. \u2014 A committee (appointed) to view clerk's book every Saturday, to aUow of what they think fit to be preserved, and no copies of argu ments. Ordered, \u2014 And to examine what copies have been given out, and to whom.\" Reporting in the Last Century. \u2014 The very imperfect manner in which accounts of parliamentary debates were communicated to the pubUc in the last century, is thus described by Lord Brougham, in his sketch of the Earl of Chatham ; \u2014 \" At one period they were given under feigned names as if held in the Senate of Rome by the ancient orators and statesmen ; at another they were conveyed under the initials only of the names borne by the real speakers. Even when, somewhat later, these disguises were thrown aside, the speeches were composed by persons who had not been present at the debates, but gleaned a few heads of each speaker's topics from some one who had heard him ; and the fvdlest and most authentic of all those accounts are merely the meagre outline of the subjects touched upon, preserved in the diaries or correspondence of some contemporary politicians, and presenting not even an approximation to the execution of the orators. Thus many of Lord Chatham's earUer speeches in the House of Commons, as now preserved, were avowedly the composition of Dr. Johnson, whose measured style, formal periods, balanced antitheses, and total want of pure racy English, betray their author at every line, while each debater is made to speak exactly in the same manner. For some years after he ceased to report, or rather to manufacture \u2014 that is, from 1751 downwards \u2014 a Dr. Gordon furnished the newspapers with reports, consistiug of much more accurate accounts O o"], [582, "562 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. of what had passed in debate, but without pretending to give more than the substance of the several speeches. The debates upon the American Stamp Act, in 1764, are the first that can be said to have been preserved at aU, through the happy accident of Lord Charlemont, assisted by Sir Robert Deane, taking an extraordinary interest in the subject, as bearing upon the grievances of Ireland ; and accordingly they have handed down to us some notes, from internal evidence plainly authentic, of Lord Chatham's celebrated speeches upon that question. A few remains of his great displays in the House of Lords have in like manner been preserved, chiefly in the two speeches reported by Mr. Hugh Boyd ; the second of which, the most celebrated of all, upon the employment of the Indians in the American war, there is reason to believe was revised and corrected by Lord Chatham himself ; and if so, it was certainly the only one that ever underwent his revision.\" Dr. Johnson and the Debates. \u2014 The foUowing facts are given hi BosweU's \" Life of Johnson \": \u2014 \" In 1738 Johnson was enlisted by Cave as a regular coadjutor in the Gentleman's Magazine. What we certainly know to have been done by him was the debates in both Houses of ParUa ment under the name of ' The Senate of LiUiput,' sometimes with feigned denominations of the several speakers, sometimes with denominations formed of the letters of their real names, in the manner of what is called anagram, so that they might easily be deciphered. ParUament then kept the press in a kind of mysterious awe, which made it necessary to have recourse to such devices. . . This important article of the Gentle man's Magazine was for several years executed by Mr. WiUiam Gnthrie \u2014 a man who deserves to be recorded in the literary annals of this country. The debates in Parliament, which were brought home and digested by Guthrie \u2014 whose memory, though surpassed by others who have since followed him in the same department, was yet very quick and tenacious \u2014 were sent by Cave to Johnson for his revision ; and, after some time, when Guthrie had attained to greater variety of employment, and the speeches were more and more enriched by the accession of Johnson's genius, it was resolved that he should do the whole himself, from the scanty notes furnished by persons employed to attend in both Houses of ParUament. Sometimes, however, as he himself told me, he had nothing more communicated to him than the names of the several speakers, and the part which they had taken in the debate. . . Johnson told me that as soon as he found that the speeches were thought genuine, he deter mined that he would write no more of them, ' for he would not be acces sory to the propagation of falsehood.' And such was the tenderness of his conscience that a short time before his death he expressed his regret for his having been the author of fictions which had passed for reaUties.\" \u2014 Johnson having been praised for his impartiality in these debates, in dealing out reason and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties, re plied, \" That is not quite true. I saved appearances tolerably weU, but I took care that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it.\" First Publication of Debates in the Irish ParUament. \u2014 It was in the time of Lord Chancellor Bowes, in the years 1763 and 1764,"], [583, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 PUBLICATION OF DEBATES. 563 that the first printed reports of the speeches delivered in the Irish ParUa ment were published. They can hardly (says O 'Flanagan) be considered very reliable, as they were given from the recollection of Sir James CaldweU, and few have memories so accurate as to recoUect what falls from several speakers on the same, or on different subjects. The Commons and the City Printers. \u2014 In 1771, a contest between the House of Commons and the authorities of the City of London arose out of the publication by several printers of reports of parUa mentary debates. The time was one of great political excitement, owing to the proceedings of the House in the case of Wilkes and the Middlesex elections, the Falkland Island question, &c. Colonel Onslow, a Lord of the Treasury, moved the reading of the resolutions of the 26th of February, 1728, which ran as foUows : \" That it is an indignity to, and a breach of privilege of, this House, for any person to presume to give in written or printed newspapers any account or minutes of debate, or other proceedings of this House, or any part thereof ; and that, upon discovery of the authors, printers, or publishers of any such written or printed newspaper, this House wiU proceed against the offenders with the utmost severity.\" The order having been read, some of the printers were sum moned to the bar for infringing it. They took no notice of the summons, and the Serjeant-at-Arms in vain sought to find them. A proclamation was issued offering a reward for their apprehension, and two of them were arrested in the City, and carried before Aldermen Wilkes aud Oliver, who immediately discharged them. A messenger from the House attempting to arrest a third, was himself taken into custody for assault, and com mitted by Lord Mayor Crosby and the two aldermen to the Compter, but released on bail. The ground of committal was that, by the City charters, no citizen could be arrested east of Temple Bar without the Lord Mayor'6 authority. The House of Commons was furious, and sent Crosby and OUver, who were both members, to the Tower. Wilkes was also called to tho bar, but refused to obey, claiming his right to be summoned to his place as member for Middlesex. The other two remained in the Tower from March untd Parliament was prorogued in May. Fox on the Publication of Debates. \u2014 Soon after the meeting of ParUament in 1778, Colonel LuttreU, complaining that in a certain morning paper he had been grossly misrepresented, informed the House that, for his future safety and protection, he was determined to move that the standing order of the House for excluding strangers from the gaUery should be strictly enforced. Mr. Fox (writes Earl Russell) laid down the true doctrine of publicity on this occasion. He said that \" he was con vinced the true and only method of preventing misrepresentation was by throwing open the gaUery, and making the debates and decisions of the House as public as possible. There was less danger of misrepresentation in a fuU company than in a thin one, as there would be a greater number of persons to give evidence against the misrepresentation. The shutting of the gaUery could not prevent the proceedings of the House from finding their way to public view ; for, during a certain period when the gaUery was kept empty, the debates were printed, let the manner of obtaining O O 2"], [584, "564 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. them be what it might ; and, in fact, the pubUc had a right to know what passed in Parliament.\" The Fourth Estate.\u2014 In contrast with the restrictions imposed upon reports of debates in former times, the foUowing may be noted. Macaulay writes in 1828 (\" Essay on HaUam's History \"), \" The gaUery in which the reporters sit has become a fourth estate of the realm.\" And in 1871 we find Mr. Disraeli alluding, in the House of Commons, to a news paper as being \" tbe classical authority \" for reports of parUamentary proceedings. Communication of Parliamentary Proceedings to the Sovereign. \u2014 It is mentioned in other parts of this book (p. 573, &c.) that it has been the custom in recent times for the Minister leading in the House of Commons to send brief notes of its proceedings to the Queen. The taking of notes for such a purpose was brought before the House of Commons on the 13th of May, 1879. Mr. DUlwyn then moved a resolu- tion, \" That, to prevent the growing abuse by her Majesty's Ministers of the prerogative and influence of the Crown, . . it is necessary that the mode and limits of the action of the prerogative should be more strictly observed.\" In the course of the discussion a member (Mr. Courtney) aUuded to the fact that an officer of the Royal household (Lord Barrington) was taking notes, and said, \" He saw before him at that moment a noble lord who was very busUy engaged in what was an un- doubted breach of the Constitution. They would aU be sorry if anything serious should happen to that noble lord, but without knowing it he was exposing himself to the very gravest censure. (' Oh,' and laughter.) For the benefit of those honourable members who laughed, he would read a passage from Sir Erskine May bearing on the point : \u2014 ' The pririleges of Parliament,' said Sir Erskine, ' were systematicaUy violated by the King (George III.). In order to guard against the arbitrary inters erence of the Crown in its proceedings, Parliament had established, for centuries, the constitutional doctrine that the King should not hear or give credit to reports of its debates, . . yet during the proceedings of the Commons against Wilkes the King obtained from Mr. GrenvUle the most minute and circumstantial reports.' It was a true and sound constitutional prin- ciple that the Crown should know only of the coUective action of Parlia- ment \u2014 that it should know nothing of the action of individual members of that House to guide it in the distribution of its favours. (' Oh.') Of course it might not be true that the noble lord he referred to took notes of the proceedings of that House for transmission elsewhere ; but such was the rumour.\" Mr. Gladstone (then in Opposition) decUned to support the motion, and said: \"The lore of the Constitution has been searched, even including resources which, though they are not those of a member of this House, yet, we rejoice to think, are in one and in a very important sense the resources of this House. The doctrine of the time of Mr. Gren viUe in regard to the communication of the debates of this House to the Sovereign has been gravely and seriously adduced, in a great debate on a vote of censure on the Government, as a doctrine applicable to the present time, and some notes of my noble friend opposite, which, it is presumed,"], [585, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 PUBLICATION OF DEBATES. 565 he was making for the purpose of a very effective reply, were referred to. I can conceive that this House might object to the communication of the detaUs of its procedure to the Crown, at a period when it objected to the \u2022communication of the details of its procedure to the nation. That was the doctrine of those times, and the practice was consistent. It would have been a false position for this House to have tho details of its debates made known in private to the Sovereign while the nation was kept in ignorance ; but can the honourable member for Liskeard really think that it should now be made an offence to communicate to the Sovereign the detaUs of debates in the House of Commons, which are made known to aU persons throughout the country, from the Sovereign to her subjects, not only with the knowledge, but with the virtual approval of this House, by eveiy news paper in the kingdom? I therefore must reaUy decline to enter upon these high constitutional matters on the present occasion.\" Origin of the Reporters' Gallery. \u2014 Mr. Spencer Walpole mentions that the destruction of the old Houses of Parliament was memorable for one great change. Up to that time the reporters in the House of Commons had always carried on their labours in the strangers' gallery. A separate gallery was provided for their use in the temporaiy house which was constructed in 1834. The Peers had preceded the Commons in this act of common sense. They provided accommodation for reporters from the 15th of October, 1831. But it must not be sup posed (Mr. Walpole remarks) that this exceptional act of liberality on their Lordships' part in any way proved them to be in advance of the Commons. They were the first to provide accommodation for the press, not because they were more liberal than the Commons, but because they had more room. Accommodation in the Reporters' GaUery. \u2014 Major Gosset, the Serjeant-at-Arms, gave evidence before the select committee of the House of Commons on parUamentary reporting in 1878, from which it appeared that numerous applications for seats in the reporters' gaUery, on behalf of organs of the press, could not be acceded to. An enlarge- ment of the gallery could only be effected by encroachment on the side galleries, and there was scarcely room for members. There were 19 front seats, and those were the only seats in which it was possible to report properly. Fifteen of these were devoted to the London daily press, three to the Press Associations, and one to Mr. Hansard. The total number of reporters was as foUows : \u2014 The Central News and the Press Association, 10; Globe, 6; Hansard, 4; Morning Post, 11; Standard, 17; Morning Advertiser, 15 ; Daily Telegraph, 12; Times, 16; Daily Neics, 10; Pall Mall Gazette, 2; Daily Chronicle, 7; Echo, 2; Central Press, 3; Reuter's, 1 ; and the latter's representative could only occupy a back seat. (It wiU be understood that only one or two representatives from any of tho above organs can be present in the gaUery at the same time. The numbers given by Major Gosset showed the total of each reporting staff, the members of which enter the gaUery in turn to discharge their duties.) Shorthand Systems in the GaUery.\u2014 In 1888, memorials were presented to the Oxford aud Cambridge local examination boards and"], [586, "566 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to the council of the Society of Arts, praying them not to limit the study of shorthand, or examinations therein, to any one system, or to recommend the study of any one in preference to any other, because the progress of shorthand improvement would be thereby arrested. In the ParUamentary reporters' gallery these memorials received 93 signatures, representing the foUowing systems of shorthand : \u2014 Pitman's, 63 ; Taylor's, 12 ; Gurney's, six; Lewis's, three; Gurney- Taylor, one; Lowe's, one; Byrom's, one; Peachey's, one ; Everett's, one ; Melville BeU's, one ; Mavor's, one ; Gra ham's, one ; Janes's, one. Rates of Parliamentary Speaking. \u2014 In a Shorthand Congress presided over by Lord Rosebery in September, 1887, the subject of Parliamentary reporting naturally came forward. It was stated inciden taUy that Mr. Bright when speaking rarely exceeded 120 words a minute, bis usual rate being 100 words ; while Mr. Gladstone was thought to reach occasionally 160, or even more. Reports in \" Hansard.\" \u2014 In May, 1878, a discussion took place on the vote of \u00a33,000 for Hansard's reports of the debates, to which Mr. ParneU took exception, as not an accurate record of what had been actu ally spoken, but practically reports which members altered as they pleased. To this Mr. MitcheU Henry observed that, if the honourable member for Meath had read \" Hansard \" more carefully, he would have seen that when the report of a particular speech had been supplied by the speaker himself, that fact was indicated to the reader by an asterisk. Members, he believed, only made such necessary alterations in the reports as were within fair and reasonable bounds. Mr. Hansard felt himself under a moral responsibility to the House of Commons, and would not permit such extensive alterations in the reports as the honourable member for Meath had described. The speakers who were most careful for the character and also for the time of that House were, he understood, those who took most pains to correct their speeches. Lord Beaconsfield, he believed, bad always done so ; and honourable gentlemen would recol lect that the right honourable member for Greenwich (Mr. Gladstone) had spoken in the House of the hard task he had found it to correct Hansard's reports of his speeches. He would therefore suggest that it would be better, in the interests both of that House and of posterity, if the honour able member for Meath foUowed the example of those high authorities, and took more pains with his speeches. (\" Hear,\" and a laugh.) \u2014 The long-continued association of the name of \" Hansard \" with the reports terminated in 1891, when a new contract was entered into between the Controller of the Stationery Office and Reuter's Telegram Company for the future publication of the debates. Lady Reporters. \u2014 In the session of 1890, Mr. Bradlaugh asked the Speaker whether, if a vacancy occurred in the reporters' gallery, there was any order of the House which would prevent the entertainment of an application from a lady for a place in the reporters' gallery. \u2014 The Speaker. in reply, said : \" There is no order of the House against a lady being admitted as a reporter to the reporters' gaUery. Within the last two or three days an appUeation has been made to the Sergeant -at -Arms by a"], [587, "PRIVILEGE\u2014 PUBLICATION OF DEBATES. 567 lady, stating that she was the representative of a journal which advocated the political and social rights of women. The Sergeant-at-Arms, as I think very properly, replied that he had no authority to depart from the existing practice ; nor would it be right for me to intervene in any way unless I have the direct and express sanction of the House, in a matter possibly leading to consequences which it would be difficult at this moment for the House to foresee.\" (Great laughter.) The Commons and the Press in 1875. \u2014 In April, 1875, a member (Mr. C. Lewis) brought before the House a complaint that the Times and the Daily News had published evidence and documents laid before its Committee on Foreign Loans, then sitting. He referred to a resolution passed in 1827, to the effect that the publication of any such evidence, not reported to the House, was a breach of its undoubted privUeges, and moved that the printers of the papers in question should be called to tbe bar. This was agreed to, aud three days afterwards the printers attended to the summons. By this time, however, opportunity had been given to all parties in the House for reflection, and the Prime Minister (Mr. Disraeli) met the proposal of Mr. Lewis that the printers should be caUed in, by an amendment that the Foreign Loans Committee should report speciaUy upon tho matter. After some discussion, in the course of which Sir W. V. Harcourt (Attorney-General under Mr. Glad stone's Government) declared that the House had been got into an '\u2022 undignified mess,\" Mr. Disraeli's resolution was carried, and also another, that the printers should be discharged from further attendance. Power of the Reporters. \u2014 On the subject of reporting, Lord Lyttelton, in a letter to the Birmingham Post in 1871, wrote : \" I do not complain of the reporters. To do so would be unjust in my case \u2014 foolish in any case ; for we are absolutely at the mercy of those exceUent and formidable personages, and to complain would make matters very much worse. I will tell two anecdotes. Mr. Cobbett, dnring the short rime he was in Parliament, incessantly abused the reporters (whom he always caUed ' reporthers ') for not fully reporting him. The consequence was that they ended by not reporting him at all. The late Lord Monteagle, when Mr. Spring Rice, in the House of Commons, once said something the reporters did not like. They sent him a formal warning that, unless he publicly apologised, reported he should not be. He did not apologise, and reported he was not for two years. At last the spell was broken by Mr. Murray, the bookseller, starting a new paper, called the Constitution. To ingratiate himself with Mr. Rice he reported his speeches, whereupon the others gave in.\" Reporting Freaks. \u2014 Although members of Parliament are indebted in the main to the reporters for the generally faithful, and sometimes improved, versions of their speeches given to the public, yet it must be admitted that the reporters of a past generation occasionally com mitted freaks at the expense of members, either in retaliation for such a step as clearing the galleries by drawing attention to \" strangers,\" or merely by way of indulging their own sense of humour. An instance of the latter kind occurred in the case of Mr. WUberforce. He was short in"], [588, "568 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. stature, and having alluded to potatoes in a debate, the reporter (probably Hibernian) put the following ludicrous passage into his speech : \" For potatoes, Mr. Speaker, potatoes, Sir, make men healthy ; potatoes make men tall. More especially do I feel this, because, being under the common size, I must ever lament that I was not fostered under that genial vegetable, the potato.\" The worthy member complained of this to the House, as an indignity offered to the representative of a large constituency ; but the House would see only the humorous side of the question, and greeted his statement with shouts of laughter. Emphasizing a Speech. \u2014 Mr. Martin, of Galway, once made a speech in which some very peculiar passages occurred, and the reporter underlined them. The printer of the paper, in which the report appeared as written, was caUed to the bar, but offered to prove that the report was an exact transcript of the member's words. \"That may be,\" said Mr. Martin, \" but did I spake them in italics ? \" A Newspaper Inadvertence. \u2014 It is customary on the daily news papers for the notes of each parliamentary reporter, when set up for press, to be headed by his name and that of his predecessor, and concluded by a simUar reference to the person next in turn in the \" gaUery,\" in order that all the parts, when put together, may follow in their proper place. The lines in which these clues are given to the printer are of course removed before the report is sent to press. On one occasion, however, a late debate having arisen, there were (as usual under such circumstances) short turns in the gaUery, and some hurry in the newspaper office, during which the presence of one of these indicating Unes escaped attention. The result was ludicrous. Mr. Disraeli had been addressing the House, and, in his customary way, emphasizing his remarks towards the peroration \u2014 \" And what foUows, Mr. Speaker ? \" The readers of the particular journal (a prominent London daily) must have been astonished at the line they found immediately after this inquiry, for it announced the remarkable fact that \" Murphy follows Jones.\""], [589, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 569 PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, &c. Presence of the Sovereign in the Early Parliaments. \u2014 The foUowing is extracted, with abbreviation, from the learned work of Professor (afterwards Bishop) Stubbs : \" The King's presence was deemed necessary at the opening and generaUy at the close of the session, but most frequently his duty was discharged when he had directed the ChanceUor to state the causes of summons, and to thank the estates for their attendance. The Chancellor was his spokesman in most cases when he approved the election of the Speaker. His decision on petitions was expressed by an indorsement which the clerk of the ParUament read on the last day of the session as the King's answer. It was very seldom that he spoke, or was recorded to have spoken ; and when it is recorded it is with exceptional solemnity. It is in 1363, after Edward III. has been more than thirty years on the throne, that we find him first distinctly making his wiU known to the Commons by his own mouth ; they thank him for having done this in the last ParUament, from which we infer that he had spoken on the occasion of the dissolution. The Parliament of 1362 was that in which the use of EngUsh in legal transactions was ordered ; that of 1365 was opened with an EngUsh speech, and it may be inferred that in giving the estates leave to depart, Edward himself had spoken in English, and that where in other cases the address of thanks is not said to have been spoken by the Chancellor, it was spoken by the King. In the last inter view which he had with bis ParUament, at Sheen in 1377, the parting words are put in his mouth. The days of serene supremacy passed away with Edward III. Richard II. is more than once said to have uttered haughty words in Parliament. He discussed in a long speech to the Commons the foreign policy which he had adopted, and acted as his own minister. The succeeding kings took a still more prominent part in Parliament. Henry TV., whose claim to the crown, spoken in EngUsh, made the occasion an era of constitutional progress, not only signified his wishes to the Parliament, but deigned to argue with the Commons ; he laid himself open to the good advice of the Speaker, and condescended on various occasions both to defend himself and to sUence his interlocutor ; he soon learned that his dignity would not survive too great familiarity, and had to reprove tho loquacity of the Speaker. Edward IV., who imitated the more popular usages of the rival House, likewise made speeches to both Lords and Commons ; and in particular, in dissolving his first Parliament, addressed the Speaker in simple and touching language of gratitude and promise. All these speeches were made by the King either in full Parliament \u2014 that is, in the presence of both Houses \u2014 or in the House of Lords to the lords who were then and there in attendance upon him.\" The Opening Speech to Parliament.\u2014 The opening speech, declaring to a Parliament the cause of its summons, in early times was usually, but not necessarily, delivered by the ChanceUor. Professor Stubbs notes that \"from 1347 to 1363 the Chief Justice made it; the"], [590, "570 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1401 ; the Archbishop of Canter bury in 1344, 1368, 1377, 1399, and 1422 ; the ChanceUor in 1343, 1363 (in English), and generally after 1368. The Bishop of Winchester in 1410, the Bishop of Lincoln in 1453 and 1467, the Bishop of Rochester in 1472, and the Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1431, supplied the place of the absent ChanceUor.\" At the opening of a new Parliament in January, 1886, the Bishop of Southwell, as junior bishop, acted as chaplain of the House. \" Nothing in \" the Royal Speech. \u2014 This expression has become almost proverbial, but it is of no recent date, and has royal authority. Lord Eldon relates that on one occasion George III., when he came out of the House of Lords after opening the session of Parliament, said to him, \"Lord Chancellor, did I deliver the speech weU?\" \"Very well indeed, Sir,\" was the answer. \" I am glad of that,\" repUed the King, \" for there was nothing in it.\" A King Reading his Speech under Difficulties. \u2014 Mr. James Grant relates that, at the opening of the session of Parliament in 1836, King WiUiam IV. gave a proof of his good nature and simpUcity of manners. The day was uncommonly gloomy, which, added to an imper fection in the King's visual organs consequent upon his advanced years, and to the darkness of the old House of Lords, rendered it impossible for him to read the speech with faciUty. Most patiently did he struggle with the task, often hesitating, sometimes mistaking, and at others correcting himself. On one occasion he stuck altogether, when, after two or three attempts to make out the word, he was obliged to give it up, and turning to Lord Melbourne, who stood on his right hand, he said, in a tone sufficiently loud to be audible in all parts of the house, \" Eh! what is it?\" Lord Melbourne having whispered the obstructing word, the King pro ceeded to toU through the speech; but by the time he had got to the middle the librarian brought him two wax tapers. The King then suddenly paused, and, raising his head, he addressed the Lords and Commons on the spur of the moment, in a perfectly distinct voice, in these terms : \" My Lords and Gentlemen, \u2014 I have hitherto not been able, from want of Ught, to read this speech in the way its importance deserves ; but, as Ughts are now brought me, I wiU read it again from the commence ment, and in a way which, I trust, wUl command your attention.\" He then again began at the beginning, and read through the speech in a manner which would have done credit to any professor of elocution. Queen Victoria's First Speech. \u2014 In the \"Records of Later Life \" by Frances Anne Kemble, the writer (who may be considered a competent judge of elocution) gives the following recollection : \" I was indebted to my kind friend, Lord Lansdowne, for the memorable pleasure of being present at the first meeting between Queen Victoria and her Houses of Parliament. The occasion, which is always one of interest when a new Sovereign performs the solemnity, was rendered pecuUarly so by the age and sex of the Sovereign. . . The Queen's voice was exquisite ; nor have I ever heard any spoken words more musical in their gentle distinctness, than the ' My Lords and Gentlemen ' which broke the"], [591, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 571 breathless sdence of the iUustrious assembly, whose gaze was riveted upon that fair flower of royalty. The enunciation was as perfect as the into nation was melodious ; and I think it is impossible to hear a more exceUent utterance than that of the Queen's English by the English Queen.\" Recent Speeches from the Throne. \u2014 FoUowing the example of her immediate predecessors, Queen Victoria from her first accession read from the throne the speeches prepared by her Ministers for Parliamentary occasion. The death of the Prince Consort led to the absence of her Majesty from state ceremonial for some years, and Parliament was opened and prorogued by Royal Commission ; but in 1866, when the Queen again met the Houses, she reverted to ancient practice by deputing the reading of the speech to the Lord Chancellor. On several occasions in later years (between 1878 and 1880, for instance) the Lord ChanceUor, when acting as chief of the Royal Commission, has prefaced the reading of the speech by the declaration, \" My Lords and Gentlemen, \u2014 We are commanded to deliver to you her Majesty's speech in her Majesty's own words.\" The Speaker of the Lords. \u2014 It is singular (writes Sir T. E. May) that the president of this deliberative body is not necessarily a member. It has frequently happened that the Lord Keeper has officiated for years as Speaker, without having been raised to the peerage ; and on the 22nd November, 1830, Mr. Brougham sat on the woolsack as Speaker, being at that time Lord ChanceUor, although his creation as a peer had not yet been made out. The woolsack, indeed, is not strictly within the House, for the Lords may not speak from that part of the chamber, and if there on a division, their votes are not reckoned. The Lord ChanceUor in a Strait. \u2014 The Daily News noted, in May, 1882 : \" The House of Lords yesterday narrowly escaped an all night sitting. After a somewhat exciting debate on the release of the ' suspects,' the members of the Ministry present walked out, forgetting to make the usual motion for the adjournment of the House. After a painful pause, one of the clerks made au excursion to the lobby and brought back a noble lord, who moved the adjournment, and the Lord ChanceUor was enabled to leave the woolsack.\" Prayers. \u2014 The following announcement appeared in the journal of the House of Lords for Monday, January 17, 1881 : \" Prayers\u2014 Read by the Lord Chancellor, no Bishop being present.\" Prayers by the Speaker. \u2014 When Mr. Christopher Wray was elected Speaker in 1570, a resolution was passed \" that the Litany be read every day as in the last Parliament, and also a prayer be said by Mr. Speaker (as he should think fittest for the time), the said prayer to be begun every morning at half-past eight, and every member making default to forfeit fourpence to the poorman's box.\" Mr. Wray signaUsed himself, on his appointment, by addressing the House for two hours. The Speaker of the Commons. \u2014 The House of Commons (says Sir G. C. Lewis) were at first a set of delegates summoned by the Crown to negotiate with it concerning the payment of taxes. They might take advantage of the position of superiority which they temporarily ipied, to remonstrate with the Crown about certain grievances upon wh ii they"], [592, "572 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. were generally agreed. In this state of things, it was important that they should have an organ or spokesman with sufficient ability and knowledge to state their views, and with sufficient courage to contend against the displeasure of the Crown. Since the revolution of 1688, and the increased power of the House of Commons, the functions of the Speaker have under gone a change. His chief function has been no longer to speak on behalf of the House. That which was previously his accessory has become his principal duty. He has been simply chairman of the House, with the function of regulating its proceedings, of putting the question, and of maintaining order; but, as their debates have become more important, his office of moderator of these debates has acquired additional importance. The Deputy Speaker. \u2014 A Deputy Speaker of the House of Com mons was first appointed in 1853, the Chairman of Committee on Ways and Means being nominated to act in the capacity. This officer is appointed in Committee of Supply on the assembling of a new Parliament, and he takes his seat (as chairman) at the table, in the position occupied by the chief clerk of the House when the Speaker is sitting. \u2014 In the session of 1884, it happened that the newly-elected Speaker (Mr. Arthur Peel) was taken unwell, at a time when the Chairman of Committees (Sir Arthur Otway) was in a simUar predicament. The latter, however, had sufficiently recovered to take the Speaker's place when called upon. Right of the Speaker to Vote. \u2014 In the course of the debate on the Closure resolution (October 25, 1882), a motion having been made to limit to the Speaker the powers conferred, aud to withhold them from the Chairman of Committees, who was more immediately under party influence, Mr. Gladstone said that, while it was quite true that a gentleman did not, by becoming Chairman of Ways and Means, forfeit his title to serve his country in other ways as a political officer, it was also true that very distinguished men, and two of the most distinguished men who had held the high office of Speaker \u2014 he referred to Mr. Grenville, afterwards Lord GrenviUe, and to Mr. Addington, afterwards Lord Sidmouth \u2014 became members of the Cabinet. In the one case he became Secretary of State, and in the other case Prime Minister.* . . He was by no means pre pared to allow it to be tacitly assumed that the Chairman of Ways and Means forfeited his right to vote by sitting in the chair. The Speaker did not forfeit his right to vote ; he had heard the Speaker assert from the chair his right to vote, if he thought fit, in respect of his opinions, and not merely in respect of the form of the House, when he came to give a casting vote. He recollected Mr. Manners Sutton, when Speaker, voting in committee, and the same thing had been done by Mr. Denison and by Mr. Shaw Lefevre. Mr. Manners Sutton made a speech in his hearing, in which he distinctly asserted, as Speaker, his right to vote in committee. A Critical Casting Vote. \u2014 The casting vote of the Speaker has at times exercised an important influence on public affairs. For instance, the resolutions which led to the impeachment of Lord MelvUle were carried (in AprU, 1805) only by the casting vote of Mr. Speaker Abbot. * See p. 574."], [593, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 573 Mr. Mark Boyd in his \" Reminiscences \" gives the following particulars : \u2014 \" Mr. Pitt, the Prime Minister, was strong on the side of MelviUe, his friend and coUeague, but the opposing party was zealous and powerful. The fierce debate ended with an even vote \u2014 216 members declared for Lord MelviUe, 216 voted for his guilt. Lord Melville's fate was thus placed in the Speaker's hands, to be decided by that one vote. Vet it was long before the Speaker could give his vote ; agitation overcame him , his face grew white as a sheet. Terrible as was the distress to aU who awaited the decision from the chair, terrible as was the Speaker's distress, this moment of suspense lasted ten long minutes. There the Speaker sat in silence ; aU were silent. At length his voice was heard ; he gave his vote, and he condemned Lord MelviUe. One man, at least, that evening was overcome. Mr. Pitt was overcome ; his friend was ruined. At the sound of the Speaker's voice, the Prime Minister crushed his hat over his brows to hide the tears that poured over his cheeks ; he pushed in haste out of the House. Some of his opponents, I am ashamed to say, thrust themselves near, ' to see how BiUy looked.' His friends gathered in defence around, and screened him from rude glances. During a quarter of a century \u2014 indeed, almost ever since he had been a boy \u2014 Mr. Pitt had battled it in Parliament. His experience there was not victory only, but often defeat. This defeat, however, he sank under ; it was his last \u2014 he died ere many months had passed. The death of that great man was hastened by Speaker Abbot's casting vote.\" Speaker Deprecating the Position. \u2014 Serjeant Telverton, on his election as Speaker in 1596, made a piteous but ineffectual appeal to the House not to thrust this greatness upon him. He said : \" WeU known is it to a great number in this place now assembled that my estate is nothing correspondent for the maintenance of this dignity ; for my father, dying, left me a younger brother, and nothing to me but my bar\u00a9 annuity. Then, growing to man's estate and some small practice of the law, I took a wife, by whom I have had many children, the keeping of us all being a great impoverishment to my estate, and tbe daily living of us aU nothing but my daily industry.\" A Proposed Censure on the Speaker.* \u2014 Sir Fletcher Norton (afterwards Lord Grautly), who had fdled the office of Attorney-General, was elected to the chair in 1770, and occupied it for ten years. Soon after his election he was exposed to a motion of censure by Mr. Dowdes well, ex-ChanceUor of the Exchequer, on the ground \" That the words spoken by Mr. Speaker from the chair [in reference to Sir WiUiam Meredith] are disorderly, importing an improper reflection on a member of this House, and dangerous to the freedom of this House.\" A long debate ensued, but the Speaker was supported by Ministers, and tho motion was negatived without a division. A Sympathetic Speaker.\u2014 Writing to the Queen (as it was the custom for the leader of the House of Commons to do) on the 13th of August, 1860, Lord Palmerston said: \" Members are leaving town, but * For a vote of censure actually passed, see p. 44."], [594, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 574 the tiresome ones, who have no occupation of their own, and no chance of seeing their names in the newspaper when Parliament is up, remain to obstruct and delay by talking. The Speaker, who has not been quite weU, grows as impatient as any official who has hired a grousing moor and cannot get to it, and a few nights ago, when a tiresome orator got up to speak just as an end to the debate had been expected, the Speaker cried ' Oh ' oh ! ' in chorus with the rest of the House.\" The Speaker and Party Relations. \u2014 It was remarked of the Speaker by the Quarterly Review, in 1878, \" So anxious is he to appear absolutely impartial, that, though necessarily chosen from one of the great parties in the State, we believe we are accurate in saying that no one of the three most recent occupants of the chair has ever entered the political club of his party after accepting his high office.\" Mr. Arthur Peel, in 1884, responding at a provincial gathering to the toast of the House of Commons, said he knew no poUtics or party. He was no longer a partisan, and, so long as he had the honour to preside over the councils of the House of Commons, his desire would be to act impartiaUy between the two great parties which govern this country. Speakers Afterwards Prime Ministers. \u2014 Four Speakers of the House of Commons have afterwards occupied the position of Premier. Robert Harley, elected Speaker in 1700, was advanced to the peerage as Earl of Oxford, and filled the leading Ministerial position. Mr. Spencer Compton, Speaker of the House from 1715 to 1727, and created Earl of Wilmington, was First Lord of the Treasury in 1742-43. WiUiam Wynd ham GrenvUle, Speaker in 1789 and created Lord GrenvUle, took the lead in the Ministry of \" All the Talents,\" in 1806-7. Henry Addington, Speaker from 1789 to 1801, and afterwards Lord Sidmouth, was Prime Minister from 1801 to 1804. Decorations to the Speaker. \u2014 The only instances of decorations bestowed on the Speaker for services rendered in the House are those of Mr. Charles Manners Sutton, created G.C.B. in 1832, and Mr. Henry Brand, who received the same distinction in 1881. The Mace of the Commons. \u2014 There is a more intimate relation between the Speaker's mace and our legislative proceedings than most persons are aware of. HatseU says : \" When the mace lies upon the table, it is a House ; when under, it is a Committee. When the mace is out of the House, no business can be done ; when from the table and upon the Serjeant's shoulder, the Speaker alone manages.\" The mace is held in the custody of the Crown when Parliament is prorogued, and returned to the Speaker when it meets again. The present mace dates from the time of the Restoration, and bears the initials C.R. It was said that the \" bauble \" of the Cromwellian period had been discovered in Kingston, Jamaica; but, from inquiries made on the subject by Mr. Speaker Peel in 1890, it was ascertained that two maces there existing were both of the Georgian era. The Mace SUghted by the Black Rod. \u2014 Mr. Arthur Onslow (afterwards third Speaker of that name) makes the foUowing note in HatseU respecting an incident which occurred in the time of his uncle :"], [595, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 575 \"When the Speaker, Sir Richard Onslow, went up with the House to demand justice against Dr. Sacheverell (1710), as the mace was going into the House of Lords before the Speaker, the Black Rod endeavoured to hinder it by putting his black rod across the door ; on which the Speaker said, ' If he did not immediately take away the black rod, he would return to the House of Commons.' The Black Rod desired him to stay a Uttle, and he would acquaint the lords. The door was shut, and Mr. Speaker and the House stayed without. After a Uttle time the door was opened, and Mr. Speaker with the mace went in. As Mr. Speaker was going to the bar, the Black Rod attempted to interpose himself between the Speaker and the mace ; upon which the Speaker said aloud, ' My lords, if you do not immediately order your Black Rod to go away, I wiU immediately return to the House of Commons.' Then Lord Chancellor Cowper directed the Black Rod to go from thence. Then Mr. Speaker, with the mace, went up to the bar. The Black Rod was then ordered to bring the prisoner, and was going to put him on the right hand of Mr. Speaker, who upon that said, ' If you don't order the Black Rod to go with the prisoner on the left hand of me, at some distance, I will return to the House of Commons.' Upon which the Lord Chancellor directed the Black Rod so to do, and then Mr. Speaker demanded the judgment, and the Lord Chancellor accordingly pronounced sentence upon the prisoner, kneeling at the bar.\" The Intervention of Black Rod. \u2014 In June, 1891, Mr. Labou chere asked the Speaker a question as to the interruption of the business of the House by the entrance of Black Rod. He said that on a previous occasion that session there was some discussion respecting the time when messages should be received from the House of Lords, and it was hoped some arrangement would be come to by which these \" invasions \" would take place at opportune moments. The Speaker replied that immediately after the House objected to what the honourable gentleman caUed \" in vasions \" of the House by an officer of the other House, he communicated with the officers of the House of Lords, saying that he hoped some arrangement would be made by which the House of Commons would in future be put to the least possible inconvenience and interruption in regard to its proceedings. That day, however, owing to tho way in which the time of the Lord ChanceUor had been occupied, a message from the other House had arrived at a later hour than was anticipated. He had hoped that Black Rod would have arrived before half past three o'clock, when the consideration of questions was entered upon. He would endea vour, for the convenience of the House, to see whether an arrangement of that kind could be made. CalUng the RoU. \u2014 Elsynge, clerk to the Parliament in the early part of the seventeenth century, writes: \"At this day the knights and burgesses are called by their names by the clerk of the Crown in the presence of the Lord Steward. Since the fifth year of Queen Elizabeth the Commons take the oath of supremacy, and since the third year of King James they take the oath of allegiance also, which the Lord Steward administers unto some, and appoints certain of them his deputies,"], [596, "576 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to give the same unto the rest* The Lords are not caUed the first day, but have used to deliver their writs only to the clerk of the Parliament. The second day the Lords are caUed by the clerk of the Parliament, beginning with the lowest baron, and so ascending to the highest, and the proxies and other excuses (if any) of the absent Lords registered. Here I must confess one of my own erratas; for being suddenly commanded to caU the House (anno 21 Jac), and unprovided of a catalogue of their names, I made use of one then delivered me by the Earl Marshal, and began at the upper end with the Prince, and so descended. I quickly found my own error, but none else perceived it. I proceeded ; which I observe here lest my successors mistake also by that precedent.\" Taking Opposite Sides. \u2014 The modern practice is for the leaders of the Government and of the Opposition to occupy, respectively, the front seats to the right and left of the Speaker, with their supporters behind them ; but in ancient times members sat indiscriminately in the House, and the leading antagonists sometimes side by side. (Townsend's \" Memoirs.\") After the present usage was adopted, a bold member (Mr. Rigby), who constantly supported the Ministry of Lord North, used to delight in placing himself in the ranks of the Opposition, as if to assert his independence, and there deUvered himself of his opinions, amid storms of disapprobation from the occupants of the seats around him. Changing Sides in the House. \u2014 In committee on the BaUot Bill in July, 1871, a curious scene occurred. Mr. George Bentinck (member for West Norfolk, and an \"independent Conservative \") made some very free remarks on the leaders of both parties. Of the leader of the Opposi tion (Mr. Disraeli) he said that many years ago the right honourable gentleman spoke of the Government of that day as an \" organised hypocrisy,\" and that suggested that the proper description of the late Government would be that it was a disorganised hypocrisy. \u2014 Being now caUed to order by the Chairman for aUuding to past events, he turned to the Prime Minister (Mr. Gladstone), and said that he had complained of time being wasted, but no one had for years delayed business by speeches so much as he had done. He had commented upon the bad habit of imputing motives, but he himself was guilty of that offence when he said that speeches were made solely for the purpose of creating delay. \u2014 Mr. Newdegate next rose to speak against the bill, and move an adjournment, when the bulk of the members on the Ministerial side rose and quitted the house. This course, it appeared, had been resolved upon by the members of the Liberal party at a conference the same afternoon. A number of the Conservatives then crossed over, and, amid general laughter, several of them in turn addressed the House, denouncing the Ballot, from the usual seats of their opponents, the supporters of the bill. No one repUed to their arguments, and a division was eventually taken on Mr. Newdegate's motion, which was rejected by 154 to 63. \" Another Place.\" \u2014 The rule that aUusions to debates in the other House are out of order is mainly founded (says May) upon the under- * In modern times the oath has been administered by the clerk at the table."], [597, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 577 standing that those debates are not known, and that the House can take no notice of them. The rule has been so frequently enforced that most members in both Houses have learned a dexterous mode of evading it by transparent ambiguities of speech ; and, although there are few orders more important than this for the conduct of debate, and for observing courtesy between the two Houses, none, perhaps, are more generaUy transgressed. (\" Law, &c, of Parliament.\") \u2014 This subject was discussed in the House of Commons on the 9th of June, 1876, when Earl Percy caUed attention to the practice of referring in that House to debates in the House of Lords. Mr. Disraeli said he thought that of late years there had been an excess of licence in alluding to proceedings in the other House. \" It is,\" said he, \" a proceeding which every one feels must be full of inconvenience and unfairness. It is not merely that we criticise the words of those who are absent, but that unfortunately we may criticise words which were never spoken.\" The discussion was closed by the foUowing observations from the Speaker (Mr. Brand) : \" It is part of the unwritten law of Parliament that no allusion should be made in this House to the debates in the other House during the current session. There is no standing order on the subject, but the unwritten law of Parliament is of equal, if not greater, force than any standing order. I coUect from the discussion which has now taken place that it is the desire of this House that the law of Parliament in this respect should be strictly observed and enforced. (Hear.) As the House is aware, this law is occasionally evaded in a manner which, with every desire to be strict, I am not always able to correct. At the same time, it will be my duty on all occasions, as far as I can, to enforce that rule strictly. I am persuaded that it is of great importance to our debates in this House, especially with regard to our relations with the other House, that no allusion should be made to debates in the other House ; and that the unwritten law of Parliament herein should be strictly observed.\" Addressing the Chair. \u2014 While it is the rule in the Lower House to address \" the Chair,\" and not to do so is a breach of order, the contrary is the case in the Upper Chamber, where a speaker is expected to make his observations to \" my lords.\" This was illustrated in a discussion in the House of Lords in June, 1880. Earl Beauchamp called attention to the report of a select committee on reporting in that House, and proposed certain experimental alterations in the arrangements of the house, by which better facilities might be given for an accurate representation of their lordships' speeches. He said, noble lords who had contracted the habit of addressing the Chair in the House of Commons frequently retained it in their lordships' house, and turned away from the gallery to the Lord Chancellor, thereby very much diminishing the chances which the reporters had of hearing accurately. If the noble and learned lord's position were changed to that part of the house in which the reporters were placed, he could not but think that there would be a greater uniformity than at present in the direction of the voices of speakers, and that a habit would grow up of speaking with tha^ij^turned towards the gallery, instead of away from it.\u2014 The^^k\u00bb.Cf Somerset said he was"], [598, "578 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. much surprised to hear that noble lords were in the habit of addressing the Lord Chancellor. He had never seen them doing so. As a rule, speeches were addressed to the other side of the House. If speeches were not fully reported, it might be that the public were not much interested in what was said in that House. Indeed, it sometimes appeared as if even the Government did not much care for the speeches delivered, or even the votes given, in their lordships' house. He could not support the plan for turning the house topsy-turvy. \u2014 The Duke of Argyll said he agreed with the noble duke that there was no practice among their lord ships of addressing the Lord ChanceUor. The evidence did not show that the acoustic properties of the house were bad, but that speakers addressing themselves to the Lord ChanceUor were inaudible to the reporters. The reason their lordships were not heard was because noble lords carried on private conversation while business was going on. \u2014 The Earl of Redesdale (Chairman of Committees) said the recommendation of the committee, to remove the woolsack, would place the Lord Chancellor in a wrong position with regard to the business of the House. \u2014 The principal portions of the motion were withdrawn, but a proposal to construct two or three addi tional seats to the gallery was agreed to, and afterwards it was decided to give the reporters temporary accommodation in the side gaUeries of the house. Conference between the Two Houses. \u2014 The following standing order of the House of Lords for the regulation of conferences with the Commons was drawn up in days when the deference of the Commons was looked for as a matter of course, but it has never been rescinded : \" The place of our meeting with the Lower House upon conference is usuaUy the Painted Chamber, where they are commonly before we come, and expect our leisure. We are to come thither in a whole body, and not some lords scattering before the rest, which both takes from the gravity of the lords, and besides may hinder the lords from taking their proper places. We are to sit there, and be covered ; but they are not at any committee or conference either to be covered or sit down in our presence, unless it be some infirm person, and that by connivance in a corner out of sight, to sit, but not to be covered.\" Lord Lansdowne mentioned to the poet Moore that the custom of the Lords wearing their hats when in conference with the Commons, and the latter taking theirs off, was once contested between the Houses, and public business was a good deal obstructed by their dissensions. But Speaker Onslow had the merit of settling the matter. He said, as the Lords sit with their backs to the throne, they are not supposed to see it, and therefore are not expected to uncover; whereas the Commons, with the throne before their eyes, could not in decency keep their hats on their heads. This reconciled the pride of the Lower House, and got over the difficulty. Lord J. RusseU observed, however, that there was some obscurity in this narrative, for a conference never takes place in the House of Lords, but in the Painted Chamber, where there is no throne ; although there may formerly have been a throne there. \"Required\" or \" Desired ? \"\u2014At a sitting in March, 1880,"], [599, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 579 General Sir W. Knollys, the gentleman usher of the black rod, entered the House of Commons and summoned the Speaker and the House to the House of Peers, to hear the royal assent given by commission to certain biUs. On the Speaker's return, Sir G. Bowyer rose to a point of order. He called the attention of the Speaker to the language just used by the gentleman usher, which he considered unusual, and which he thought they ought to prevent being made a precedent of. The message as delivered was that the Lords Commissioners \"required\" the presence of that House to the House of Lords to hear the royal assent given by commission to certain bills. He appealed to the right honourable gentleman whether the word should not have been \" desired,\" and not \" required.\" \u2014 The Speaker said that the customary word on such occasions was certainly \" desired,\" but he apprehended that the word \" required\" was only another form of the word \" desired.\" He was not aware that it was an improper expression. \u2014 After a few words from Sir G. Bowyer in reply, the subject dropped. Etiquette concerning Crown Messages. \u2014 In October, 1884, Mr Childers (Chancellor of the Exchequer) requested permission to ask the Speaker a question on a point of order. \" When (he said) you commenced, on Thursday last, to read her Majesty's gracious Speech, I happened to be sitting with my hat on, and I did not remove it, but remained covered. The suggestion has been made that I did not act in that respect in accordance with the rules of the House. But since I have been in ParUament I have always understood that the rule was that when a messenger appears at the bar and states that he has a message from her Majesty, signed by herself, he is desired to bring it up; and when that message is deUvered to you, and read by you from the chair, aU members are uncovered, and that the fact appears on the votes in the journals of the House. Those, I believe, are the only occasions on which members are expected to be uncovered.\" He asked whether he had been right in his belief, and if not, expressed his readiness to apologise. \u2014 The Speaker in reply said, the right honourable gentleman had correctly drawn the distinction between messages direct from the Crown under the sign manual and read from the chair, and messages read under the circum stances Mr. Childers had mentioned. \" With reference to the Speech from the throne, what is read by the Speaker from this chair is only the copy of a speech read in another place before both Houses of Parliament. It is therefore not regarded as directly emanating from the Sovereign, and neither by the rules nor custom of the House is it obligatory upon any honourable member to remain uncovered.\" The \" Right to he Heard.\" \u2014 It is reported of Sir Spencer Compton that, when he was Speaker, he used to answer to a member who called upon him to make the House quiet, for that he had a right to be heard: \"No. sir; you have a right to speak, but the House have a right to judge whether they will hear you.\" In this (says HatseU) the Speaker certainly erred ; the member has a right to speak, and it is the Speaker's duty for that purpose to endeavour to keep them quiet.* * See p. 17, \" Hemming a Member Down.\" p p 2"], [600, "580 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Motion that a Member \"be Not Heard.\"\u2014 This was made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Gladstone) on the 14th of June, 1880 ; for the first time, according to an observation of the Speaker, for 200 years. The following were the circumstances : Mr. O'DonneU asked a question of the Government respecting the antecedents of the newly appointed ambassador from France to Great Britain (M. Challemel Lacour), and, having received a reply from the Under-Secretary of State, was proceed ing to comment upon it, when he was checked by the Speaker, but resumed his comments by a notice of motion. At this point Mr. Glad stone said he rose to order. He believed he was correct in saying that he was entitled to raise the question of order on the continuance of the honourable member's speech. He felt it his duty to give the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion on the subject by moving that Mr. O'DonneU be not heard. \u2014 The motion caused some excitement and discussion, and the leader of the Opposition (Sir Stafford Northcote) put a question to the Speaker as to the practice of the House in such a case. In reply, the Speaker said : \" It appears to me that I should not be doing my duty to the House if I did not point out the special impropriety of proceeding with a motion for adjournment after an answer given by a Minister of the Crown, and under the cover of that motion to make charges against a foreign ambassador. Upon my making observations of this character as regards the conduct of the honourable member for Dungarvan, the right honourable gentleman the First Minister of the Crown rose to a point of order, and moved that Mr. O'DonneU be not heard. Now, I am bound to say that a motion of that kind has not been made in this House for 200 years. At the same time, I doubt whether such a proceeding as that which took place before the motion was made to-night has occurred for a similar period.\" \u2014 The adjournment of the debate was now proposed as an amendment to Mr. Gladstone's motion, and, having been negatived on a division, was moved again and again, members on both sides urging that Mr. Gladstone's motion, if carried, would form a dangerous precedent, and put the rights of the minority at the mercy of any leader of the House who might, command a majority for the time being. Eventually, Mr. O'DonneU said he would be content to give notice of a motion on a future day ; and Mr. Gladstone's motion as weU as the amendment was then withdrawn. \u2014 In the foUowing session, two of the Irish members interrupted an important speech of Mr. Gladstone's by morions that he be no longer heard ; but the proceeding led to their own suspension. (See under \" Varieties.\") Reading Speeches in the House. \u2014 The foUowing entry occurs in the \"Diary of Lord Colchester\" (Mr. Speaker Abbot): \"May 14, 1806. Mr. Jeffery having read a long written speech without inter ruption, I mentioned it to Mr. Fox, towards the end of it, and also to Mr. Canning, that I should take notice of this impropriety, which they severaUy agreed to bo highly proper to do ; and, accordingly, before putting the question, I caUed the attention of the House to it, and stated this to be a practice contrary to the received and established usage of debate, and necessary to be remarked upon, lest it should grow into a pre-"], [601, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 581 cedent. To which interposition the House entirely assented. At the close of the debate, Mr. Jeffery again reading arguments in reply, I was caUed upon to interfere ; and it seemed to be agreed that this was not to be done at all, except so far as resorting to notes or figures. I had in my mind the reprobation of this very practice of reading written arguments, as men tioned in vol. ii. of Grey's ' Debates.'\" Reading from Newspapers. \u2014 A question arose in 1840 on this subject, when the Speaker (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) said : \" I understand the rule of the House to be that, unless a member gets up iu his place to com plain of a breach of privUege, he is not entitled to read a newspaper. It appears to me that the honourable member for Belfast (Mr. E. Tennent) cannot be in order when he reads to the House, as he proposes to do, the extract in question.\" \u2014 Sir Robert Peel said he had never heard that the reading of extracts was contrary to order. \u2014 Lord J. RusseU quoted a pre cedent in favour of the extract being read. \u2014 Mr. E. Tennent proceeded to read the extract referred to. (Mr. Bourke, in his work on \" Parliamentary Precedents, being decisions of the Right Hon. C. S. Lefevre,\" remarks here : \" It had been the practice for members, when they desired to read extracts from newspapers, to have them pasted on foolscap paper, that it might appear to the House that they were reading from a manuscript. This was the first time that newspapers or slips of newspapers were aUowed to be read in the House without any disguise.\") \u2014 Iu 1856 Sir John SheUey was about to read an extract from a newspaper, when he was called to order by the House ; and Sir Frederic Thesiger appealed to the same Speaker on the subject, complaining that the honourable barouet bad first said that he would read from a newspaper, and on being ehecked by the House had called it a document, and proceeded to read the same thing. \u2014 Mr. Speaker : \" The honourable and learned gentleman is correct as to what used to be the rule of the House ; but a few years ago, when I decided that it was out of order to read an extract in the manner iu which the honourable member proposes to read one now, my decision was over ruled by the House.\" \u2014 It has, however, been ruled to lie out of order to quote from a newspaper the speech of another member in the same session. (P. 410.) Consequences of Naming a Member. \u2014 A story (says HatseU) used to be told of Mr. Speaker Onslow, which those who ridiculed his strict observance of forms were fond of repeating : that he often, upon a member's not attending to him, but persisting in any disorder, threatened to name him : \" Sir, sir, I must name you.\" On being asked what would be the consequence of putting that threat into execution, and naming a member, he answered, \" The Lord in heaven knows ! \" \u2014 Mr. Speaker Abbot, however, had a clearer view on the matter. A member entering the house after dinner, in too merry a mood, made a disparaging remark respecting its chairman, and, some say, called upon him for a song. He was thereupon \"named,\" and handed over to the Serjeant-at-Arms. The Speaker next day gave him a solemn rebuke for bis levity, aud it is to be presumed he had to pay the Serjeant the customary fees on his release. The penalty incurred by \"naming \" in fact rests upon a rule of the House"], [602, "582 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. recorded in its Journal, Jan. 23, 1693, as follows : \" That if Mr. Speaker do call upon a member by name, such person shall thereby incur the dis pleasure and censure of the House.\" Under a rule passed in February, 1880, the displeasure of the House on such occasions is shown by the sus pension of the member for the remainder of the sitting, or longer, if the offence be repeated. Mr. Feargus O'Connor Named. \u2014 Mr. Feargus O'Connor gave occasion for a later Speaker (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) to threaten simUar action to that of Speaker Abbot. Sir Benjamin Hall complained that he had received a blow on the side from Mr. O'Connor, whereupon the Speaker thus addressed the House : \" I am sorry to say that the honour able member for Nottingham has so habituaUy violated the rules of the House, that if he further persists in this course I shaU feel it my painful duty to call the attention of the House to the honourable member by name, and it wiU then be for the House to take such ulterior steps as may prevent the repetition of such conduct.\" \u2014 Mr. O'Connor immediately rose, and addressed the Speaker in a most excited and insolent manner. \u2014 Mr. Speaker : \" I must now caU on the honourable member by name. Mr. O'Connor, you are now called upon to apologise to the House,- and if you have any apology to offer to the House, now is your time to do so.\" \u2014 Mr. O'Connor : \" I beg the pardon of the honourable gentleman, and now I apologise to the House. I beg pardon.\" \u2014 Mr. O'Connor at this time was considered partially insane. (See p. 501.) Censure on a Member. \u2014 In June, 1882, the following passage occurred. Baron Henry de Worms put a question to the Prime Minister respecting the harbour of Assab Bay, and a projected convention between the Italian and the Egyptian Governments. Sir Charles Dilke (Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs! replied : \" The honourable member has, without a moment's notice, asked the Prime Minister a long question. I must say that anything more remarkable I have never seen in the whole course of my experience.\" (Cries of \"Order.\") \u2014 Baron H. de Worms contended he was in order in putting the question. \u2014 Sir C. DUke said: \"The honourable member has given no reason whatever for not having placed the question upon the paper. He has not given even the shadow of a reason.\" \u2014 Baron H. de Worms : \" I must appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, whether it is in order for the honourable baronet to make any such state ment.\" \u2014 The Speaker : \" If I understand correctly, the honourable baronet desires that the question should be put on the paper. If that is so, he is within his right.\" \u2014 Baron H. de Worms : \" I was alluding, not to the question not being put on the paper, but to the censure which the honour able baronet passed on me.\" \u2014 Sir C. Dilke : \" I must not only maintain that censure, but I must increase it.\" (Cries of \" Order,\" and laughter.) \u2014 The Speaker : \" I am bound to say that I did not interfere with the honourable member for Greenwich, because I did not consider him out of order. In so far as the question was not upon the paper, the honourable baronet is quite within his right in demanding notice.\" \u2014 Lord J. Manners : \" What my honourable friend the member for Greenwich deshes to call your attention to, is not that the honourable baronet, and very properly,"], [603, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 583 declines to answer a question not on the paper, but to the terms of censure he used.\" \u2014 Sir C. Dilke : \" I said, Sir, I had never known anything more extraordinary than the course taken by the honourable member with regard to this question; and then I was going on to say, when inter rupted, that I not only maintained the censure I gave first in giving my answer, but \" (Cries of \" Order,\" and \" Withdraw.\") \u2014 The Speaker : \" I am bound to say that if any honourable member in putting a question, as the honourable member for Greenwich did, entirely in his own right, is subject to censure, that censure must come from the Chair.\" (Cheers.) Questions in the House of Commons. \u2014 A writer in the Edinburgh Review (Jan. 1890) says, \"The daily issue of the orders of the day (for the House of Commons) in something like the present form was inaugurated in 1841. In 1846, after the notice paper had been printed and circulated six years, the number of questions asked with notice during the whole session had only crept up to 69. In 1847 the number was 89. But in 1849, the year in which they were placed first on the paper, they more than doubled, and were about 200. Between 1850 and 1860 they increased steadily, and in the latter year some 600 were printed. By 1870 they exceeded 1000, and in 1888 were about 5000. . . On March 21, 1889, there were 85 printed questions, or about as many as in the whole session of 1847. But these included 232 separate interrogatories, which were supplemented by 95 others, making a total of 327 iu a single evening before the House could proceed to legislative business.\" Names in Questions. \u2014 In July, 1880, a member had put upon the notice paper of the House of Commons a question respecting some con victions by Flintshire magistrates for poaching in Hawarden Park, \" the property of tbe Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone,\" and on rising to ask the question ho wished to know by whose authority the words within quotation marks had been omitted from the printed list. The Speaker thereupon said : \" Tho alteration referred to has been made by the clerk at the table under my general authority. According to the uniform practice of the House, when the names of persons are introduced in a question, they wUl not appear in the paper unless they are necessary in order to make the question plain. That was the case in the present instance. The introduction of the name was not necessary to make the question plain, its insertion was regarded as invidious, and therefore it was omitted.\" A Squinting Speaker. \u2014 Lord Campbell says, the unfortunate obliquity of Sir John Trevor's vision is perceptible in the portraits and prints we have of him. While in the chair, as Speaker, two members in different parts of the House were often equally confident of having \" caught his eye.\" A Quarrel with the Speaker. \u2014 Horace Walpole, in \" Short Notes on my Life,\" prefixed to the edition of his Letters edited by Cunningham, relates that on the discussion of a measure in the House of Commons in 1747, to transfer the assizes from Aylesbury to Buckingham, he had a remarkable quarrel with the Speaker, Mr. Onslow. \" The biU,\""], [604, "584 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. he says, \"was returned from the Lords with amendments. The friends of the Chief Justice resolved to oppose it again. Mr. Potter desired me to second him. He rose, but entering on the merits of the biU, Mr. T. Townshend and my uncle, Horace Walpole (to prevent me), insisted that nothing could be spoken to but the amendments. The Speaker supporting this, I said, ' I had intended to second Mr. Potter, but should submit to his oracular decision, though I would not to the complaisant peevishness of anybody else.' The Speaker was in a great rage, and complained to the House. I said, ' I begged his pardon, but had not thought that sub mitting to him was the way to offend him.'\" Old \"Women. \u2014 The debates on the Swiss Regiment Bill occupied the House of Commons in the month of February, 1756. \" Old Horace Walpole (writes his nephew) terminated this tedious affair with the lowest buffoonery, telling a long story of an old man and his wife; that the hus band said to her, ' Goody Barrington, for that was her name \u2014 I must not falsify my story ; if it had been Onslow I must have said it,' continued he, addressing himseU' to the Speaker ; who replied very properly, ' Sir, one old woman may make as free as she pleases with another.' \" Insulting the Chairman of Committees. \u2014 In one of the old Parliamentary collections \u2014 \"Memorials &c. by R. S. E.\" [Elsynge], 1670 \u2014 we find: \"13th May, 12 Jacobi, Upon report of the amendments to the bill for the due observation of the Sabbath day, complaint was made that some indignity was offered to Sir R. Owen, when he was in the chair at the committee, by Sir W. H., that told him he was partial ; and by Sir R. K., who took him by the hand, and told him he would pull him out of the chair, that he should put no more tricks upon the House. Sir W. H., being present, made an acknowledgment of bis error, which upon the question was taken for a good satisfaction. Sir R. K. was ordered by the House to acknowledge his error at the bar.\" \u2014 In 1882, a member was suspended for fourteen days for denouncing certain conduct on the part of the Chairman as \" an infamy.\" (See under \" Suspension.\") Short Sittings and Good Debates. \u2014 Iu 1848, a select committee of the House of Commons was appointed to consider the best means of promoting the despatch of public business. Among the persons called to give evidence were M. Gnizot, upon the usages of the French Chambers, and a Mr. Curtis, upon those of the United States Congress. The Speaker of the House (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) was also examined, and in the course of his evidence thus alluded to the short sittiugs of Wednesday, when it is the rule of the House to rise at six o'clock : \" I have frequently observed that debates on Wednesdays, when there happens to be an important question under discussion, are remarkably good. Some of the best debates I have ever heard in the House have taken place on Wednesday's sittings, when every member was obliged to speak very shortly, to enable the House to come to a decision upon the question.\" The committee came to no conclusion of importance in their report. Speakers' Lists and \" Smouldering Emotions.\" \u2014 In February, 1872, Mr. G. Bentinck called attention, as a matter of privilege, to a statement which had been made in one of the pubUc journals, to the effect"], [605, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 585 that the Speaker of the House, on the occasion of important discussions, was furnished by the whip on each side with a list of members who were desirous of taking part in the debate ; and that these lists were used in such a way as to deprive independent members of a hearing. Mr. Brand, who had recently been elected Speaker, said he had never seen such a Ust ; but Mr. Glyn and Mr. Noel, the Government and Opposition whips, admitted that they had been in the habit of supplying Mr. Speaker Denison with such lists for his assistance, but denied that there was any intention that they should be used \" to gag \" independent members. The feeling of the House, however, was evidently against the practice, and it was understood that it should be discontinued. Mr. Disraeli said, amid much laughter, that he had always been anxious to develope the oratorical powers of young members of his party, and he had thought it good tactics to give members below the gangway an opportunity of speaking, because he had felt that there were smouldering emotions which would be relieved by the expression of opinion, and that after such a process they would get on in debate with better temper than was sometimes the case. Securing Seats in the House. \u2014 The accommodation for members in the House of Commons built by Sir Charles Barry has proved from the first singularly inadequate. For some reason it was considered that sitting room for three-fourths of the members would suffice, but this was not nearly attained by the arrangement for the Commons in the \" New Houses.\" It is considered that in the present House of Commons not more than 300 members can obtain places in which they may conveniently see, hear, and speak; and hence a resort to undignified practices for the securing of seats. In January, 18S0, Mr. MitcheU Henry (who was compelled to address the Speaker from the gallery) asked if that functionary would be good enough to give an instruction to the House upon a matter of some importance, viz., as to members keeping their seats \u2014 whether the rule as to putting a hat on the seat, in order to retain it, did not mean the member's real working hat, and not a colourable substitute (laughter), or whether a member might deposit one hat on tho seat, and walk away doing his business with another hat. Also, whether it was not against the rule of the House for a member to endeavour to keep a seat by putting on it a piece of paper or a card instead of a hat. \u2014 The Speaker said: \"The usual practice of the House has been that a member may retain a seat by placing his hat upon the seat before prayers. That practice has prevailed now for a considerable number of years. The idea has always been that in so doing an honourable member was in immediate attendance upon the House, or in a committee. With regard to retaining a seat with papers or gloves, that has never been allowed for the night. No member can retain a seat for the night by placing papers or gloves before prayers.\" Payment of Members.\u2014 The last formal payment of wages to a member occurred in 1681, when Thomas King, who had been member for Harwich, obtained from the Lord Chancellor a writ de expensis bergensiwm levandi, after notice to the corporation of Harwich. Lord CampbeU, in his life' of Lord ChanceUor Nottingham, cites this case, and expresses an"], [606, "586 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. opinion that the writ might still be claimed, without a new enactment to revive the former usage. In 1870, however, Mr. Peter Taylor moved in the House of Commons for leave to introduce a bill \" to restore the ancient constitutional practice of payment of members,\" and the motion was rejected by 211 to 24. A similar motion, by Mr. Fenwick, was lost in the session of 1888 by 192 to 135.\u2014 It must be remarked that Mr. Thomas Burt, returned for Morpeth by a working men's constituency in 1874 and 1880, and himself formerly a coal-miner, was believed to receive a salary from his constituents for his parliamentary services. The same was the case with Mr. Henry Broadhurst, a journeyman stonemason, who was elected for Stoke-on-Trent in 1880. The members for Wexford received sums of money from their constituents in 1885. Unsworn Members Serving on Committee. \u2014 The consti- tutional doctrine enforced by Sir Joseph Jekyll's case in 1715, that a member is capable of sitting on a committee although he has not been sworn at the clerk's table, received confirmation in Baron Lionel de Rothschild's case. On the 11th of May, 1858, the House called Baron de Rothschild, who had continued to be one of the members for the City of London for eleven years without taking the oaths, to the committee appointed to draw up reasons, to be offered to the Lords at a conference, for disagreeing to the Lords' Amendments on the Oaths BiU, intended to remove Jewish disabilities; and on the 18th he was appointed to be one of the managers of the conference. A compromise was eventually arranged, under which either House was at liberty to modify the form of oath, and Baron de Rothschild formally took his seat on the 26th of July following.* Referees Voting on Private Bills. \u2014 In February, 1876, Mr. Anderson (member for Glasgow) called the attention of the House to the position of certain of its officers styled referees, who it appeared were gentlemen possessing special knowledge on particular subjects, called in to assist the deliberations of select committees of the House on private biUs relating to railways, gas, water, &e. It appeared that the practice had grown up of allowing these gentlemen not only to aid such com mittees by their experience and advice, but also to share in the votino by which the members of a committee determined their report. While thus they took part in what virtuaUy was legislation, they were not responsible either to any constituency or to the House. In the discussion which ensued, some members expressed the opinion that the system worked well, and others thought that it was clearly unconstitutional. Mr. Gathorne Hardy (the Home Secretary) said he had heard with some surprise, about a year before, that the referees did vote, and it was absolutely necessary that the question now raised should be settled. Eventually the House agreed to Mr Anderson's motion for a committee to inquire into and report upon the subject ; and, the committee having reported, it was ordered (March 27, 1876): \"That it be an instruction to committees on private bills that referees, appointed to such committees, may take part in aU the proceedings thereof, but without the power of voting.\" * See \" Bemoval of Jewish Disabilities,\" p. 60."], [607, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 587 The Opening Scene. \u2014 The disorderly scene that ensues upon the summons of the House of Commons to attend in the Lords' chamber to bear the Royal speech on the opening of Parliament, has frequently been subject of comment. It was well described in an article in House hold Words in March, 1851 : \" The Speaker of the House of Commons answers the summons of his liege lady the Queen, as if he were a school master with a mob of unmannerly boys at his heels ; and is propeUed to the bar of the House with the frantic fear of being knocked down and trampled upon by the rush of M.P.'s. A transient cloud passes over the royal countenance, but is rapidly succeeded by a prolonged smile at the ludicrous efforts of a couple of hundred of eager Commons to squeeze themselves into a space only ample enough for a hundred. The account of a sufferer in the scramble is amusing : ' I happened,' said Mr. Joseph Hume, in his place in Parliament on the following evening, ' to be the twenty-fifth from the Speaker ; but both sides of the bar were so fiUed, that I neither saw the Queen nor heard her voice. I was knocked against a comer ; my head was knocked against a post, and I might have been much injured if a stout member, to whom I am much obliged, had not come to my assistance. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) It was no laughing matter.' Mr. Hume recollected, moreover, that on a similar occasion the coat of a member of the House, who now (1851) fiUs a high office abroad, had been torn, and that his shoulder was dislocated.\" A City Privilege. \u2014 At the first meeting of a new Parliament, the members for the City of London, in court dress or uniform, take seats on the Treasury bench, which are afterwards vacated for the Ministers of the day. The privilege is accorded to them in commemoration of the part taken by the City in 1642, in defence of the privileges of Parliament, and the protection given to the five members who took refuge in the City when their arrest had been attempted by King Charles. The usage has been duly observed at the meetings of recent Parliaments. Introduction of New Members. \u2014 An unusual incident arose on the 18th of February, 1875. Dr. Kenealy, who had just been returned for Stoke-upon- Trent, presented himself, unattended, at the table of tho House to be sworn, and handed to the clerk a copy of the writ and return for the election. The Speaker informed him that it was the practice for a new representative to be introduced by two other members of the House ; to which Dr. Kenealy replied that he was aware of the practice, but not cognisant of any law or rule depriving the House of the right to administer the oath under such circumstances as his own. He was proceeding to argue the matter, when the Speaker caUed him to order, remarking that he was not at present qualified to address the House, and the Speaker went on to say : \" I must point out to the House that this practice dates from the year 1668. ' On the 23rd of February, 1668 ' \u2014 I am quoting to the House from the journals \u2014 ' the House being informed that it is the ancient form and custom that a new member coming to the House is introduced to the table between two members, each making his obeisance, in order that he may be the better known to the House\u2014 it was. ruled that such order should be for the future observed.' That order and"], [608, "588 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. custom has been observed by the House from that day to this. The House will observe that this rule has been made because it appears to identify the member. It is my duty to see that the resolutions of this House are carried out ; but should the House see fit upon this occasion to dispense with the ordinary resolutions \" (Cries of \" No, no.\") \u2014 Dr. Kenealy : Am I to understand that the House will not hear me upon this matter ? \u2014 The Speaker : I must point out that when any action is taken by this House with regard to any member, it is in accordance with the ordinary practice for that member to withdraw. \u2014 Dr. Kenealy bowed, and withdrew ; after which Mr. Disraeli said, as the identity of the member was not on this occasion in question (laughter), he thought the ordinary rule should not be carried out, and he moved that it be dispensed with. \u2014 It was understood that Dr. Kenealy had not been able to obtain two members to introduce him ; but Mr. Bright, addressing the House for the first time for many sessions, observed that, although he had no acquaint ance with the honourable gentleman, yet, out of deference to the wiU and return of a large constituency, he was willing to accompany Dr. Kenealy to the table, if he would accept his companionship. Some discussion followed, many members not being disposed to dispense with the rule ; but, as it appeared Dr. Kenealy had not been acting contuma ciously, Mr. Disraeli's motion was agreed to. Dr. Kenealy was then called in, advanced unaccompanied to the table, and took the oath in the usual way. \" Boycotting \" a Member. \u2014 In the debate on the Irish Protection Bill, in February, 1881, Mr. Cowen, member for Newcastle, opposing the measure, made some remarks respecting the system of \" Boycotting \" in Ireland, in the course of which he thus referred to Dr. Kenealy : \" In ordinary circumstances the most generous assembly in the world was the British Parliament, and yet they had recently Boycotted a man. In the last Parliament an honourable member sat behind the front Opposition bench who was a poet, a scholar, and a lawyer. That gentleman sat for five years in the House. He was in the House, but not of it. He was effectually and completely Boycotted. He had committed himself to an agitation in which he had been foolish. He had said and done things which were grossly offensive to honourable members of that House, and which they rebeUed against.* And when he came there he was practically shut out from contact with almost everybody. The forlorn position of the unfortunate man led him (Mr. Cowen) often to speak to him, and seldom had ho been more impressed than when an incident occurred before the dissolution. The honourable member came from a bed of sickness to propose a resolution. No sooner did his turn approach, than almost every member left, He did not go on with his resolution. He (Mr. Cowen) met him in the passage, and saw the * The antagonistic feeling against Dr. Kenealy arose in great measure from his behaviour towards the judges, when counsel for \" the Claimant \" in the celebrated Tichborne ease ; and also from the character of his writings in a newspaper called The Englishman."], [609, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 589 position in which he was \u2014 beaten, broken, bankrupt. 'I did not think.' said Dr. Kenealy, 'but that I could have stood against the combined feeling of the House of Commons. Now I feel that I cannot.' He staggered into a cab, and he (Mr. Cowen) felt that the hand of death was upon him. He (Mr. Cowen) would not say, he did not think, that the House's treatment of that man led to this result ; but he would say this, that the attitude of the House of Commons towards the unfortunate individual was not much different from the attitude adopted towards some of the landlords and agents of Ireland.\" (Cries of \" Oh, oh.\") Oath or Affirmation? \u2014 At the general election in AprU, 1880, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh was returned as one of the members for North- ampton, and, on presenting himself at the table of the House, claimed to be allowed to affirm instead of taking an oath. Being asked the grounds of his claim, he referred to the Evidence Amendments Acts, 1869 and 1870, and declared that he came within the provisions of those Acts, inasmuch as \" he had repeatedly for nine years past made affirmation in the highest courts of jurisdiction in the realm, and was now ready to make such declaration or affirmation.\" The Speaker referred the matter to the judgment of the House. A select committee was appointed to report whether persons entitled, under the Acts specified, to make a solemn declaration in courts of justice might be admitted to make affirma- tion in the House ; and it reported in the negative. On the day after receipt of its report by the House, Mr. Bradlaugh again presented lumself at the table, this time to make and subscribe the oath ; and was proceeding to do so, when Sir H. D. Wolff objected, on the ground that Mr. Bradlaugh had already declared the oath was not binding on his conscience. Mr. Bradlaugh was then ordered to withdraw, and Sir H. D. Wolff moved that he \"ought not to be allowed to take the oath which he then required to be administered to him, in consequence of his having previously claimed to make an affirmation or declaration instead of the oath,\" &c. An amendment was adopted, to the effect that the matter be again referred to a committee, which should inquire and report as to \" the right and jurisdiction of the House to refuse to allow the form of the said oath to be administered \" in the case. This second committee reported that under the circumstances the House could, and in its opinion ought to, prevent Mr. Bradlaugh \" going through the form \" of taking the oath ; but it added a recommendation that, \" should Mr. Bradlaugh again seek to make and subscribe the affirmation, he be not prevented from doing so.\" A few days after, the House considered a motion by Mr. Labouchere (the other representative of Northampton) that Mr. Bradlaugh be admitted to make an affirmation ; and an amend- ment by Sir Hardinge Giffard, that, having regard to the reports of the two committees, he be not permitted to take the oath or make an affirmation, was carried (against the influence of the Government), after two nights' debate, by 275 to 230. Next day (June 23) Mr. Bradlaugh presented himself again at the table, and was informed by the Speaker of the resolution the House had come to, and requested to withdraw. He desired, however, to bo heard upon his claim, and was so heard at the bar"], [610, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 590 of the House. After this, it was proposed that the previous resolution be rescinded; but the motion was withdrawn, and Mr. Bradlaugh, being again called in, was informed by the Speaker that the House had not altered its previous decision. Being again requested to withdraw, he refused, and was committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, but released on the following day. EventuaUy (on the 1st of July, 1880) the House adopted, by 303 to 249, the following resolution, proposed by Mr. Gladstone : \" That every person returned as a member of this House, who may claim to be a person for the time being by law permitted to make a solemn affirmation or declaration instead of taking an oath, shall henceforth (notwithstanding so much of the resolution adopted by this House on the 22nd day of June last as relates to affirmation) be permitted, without question, to make and subscribe a solemn affirmation in the form prescribed by 'The Parliamentary Oaths Act, 1866,' as altered by ' The Promissory Oaths Act, 1868,' subject to any liability by statute.\" In accordance with the opportunity afforded by this resolution, Mr. Bradlaugh on the following day walked to the table (unaccompanied by any other member) and made the affirmation, the Speaker afterwards presenting his hand to him in the usual way. A Prolonged Difficulty. \u2014 The difficulty arising from Mr. Brad laugh's election was far from being concluded by the circumstances just narrated. The reservation in Mr. Gladstone's resolution, as to \" liability by statute,\" was tried at law, when it was decided (March, 1881) that Mr. Bradlaugh was not qualified to make affirmation in the House of Commons in lieu of taking an oath, the Evidence Amendment Acts having no relation to Parliament ; and the resolution by which he had been admitted was therefore invalid. Mr. Bradlaugh, thus losing his seat, was re-elected for Northampton, and again offered to take the oath at the table. But a resolution proposed by Sir Stafford Northcote (April 26), that, in view of the knowledge possessed by the House as to Mr. Bradlaugh's opinions, he \"be not permitted to go through the form of repeating the words of the oath,\" was carried, against the Government, by 208 to 175. Mr. Bradlaugh again attempting to take his seat, in spite of this resolution, another was passed on the 10th of May, ordering his exclusion from the House until he shoidd engage not to disturb its proceedings. (A bill dealing with the general subject of Parlia mentary oaths had meanwhile been introduced by the Government, but withdrawn owing to the pressure of other business.) On the 3rd of August, 1881, Mr. Bradlaugh, having previously sent the Speaker notice of his intention, attempted to force his way into the chamber, but was prevented from entering by the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms and his assistants, and, persisting, was forcibly removed by police constables from the precincts of the House. At the opening of the session in February, 1882, the member for Northampton again presented him self to subscribe the oath, and having been heard at the bar, a resolution to the same effect as that of the previous April was carried, on Sir S. Northcote's motion, by 286 to 228 ; fifty-six of the usual supporters of the Government voting with the majority."], [611, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 591 Member Administering the Oath to Himself.\u2014 A fortnight after this division (Feb. 21, 1882), Mr. Labouchere, at the instigation of his colleague in the representation of Northampton, moved a new writ for the borough in the room of Mr. Bradlaugh, \" who by the resolution of the House had been prevented from taking the oath.\" The terms of this motion were negatived by a large majority; and an incident followed which was thus described in the official notes of the House : \" Upon the numbers being declared, Mr. Bradlaugh suddenly advanced to the table, and read from a paper in his hand the words of the oath, and having kissed a copy of the New Testament which he had brought with him, signed the said paper. Mr. Speaker forthwith directed Mr. Brad- laugh to withdraw, in pursuance of the resolution of the House of the 7th of February last. Mr. Bradlaugh thereupon withdrew below the bar, leaving the said paper and copy of the New Testament upon the table, but immediately re-entered the House, and took a seat within the bar. Mr. Speaker again directed Mr. Bradlaugh to withdraw below the bar; and Mr. Bradlaugh, after stating that he had now taken the oath required by law, and had also taken his seat, again withdrew below the bar.\" Mr. Gladstone, remarking that the House had never been more taken by surprise, proposed the adjournment of the debate until the following day ; wheu the Prime Minister, although condemning Mr. Brad- laugh as guilty of \" disobedience, repeated disobedience, and flagrant disobedience,\" left the matter to the judgment of the House, as it had already been at issue with the recommendations of the Government in the case. Sir Stafford Northcote thereupon said he thought the House had great reason to complain of the conduct of its leader, and moved that \" the Serjeant-at-Arms do take steps to prevent Mr. Bradlaugh from coming within tho precincts of the House.\" While this and alternative proposals were under discussion, Mr. Bradlaugh again presented himself, on the same seat within the bar which he had occupied for a moment on the previous day. The Speaker, after drawing the attention of the House to his repeated disobedience, caUed upon the member for North- ampton to withdraw, which he forthwith did, claiming, however, his right to sit. Sir Stafford Northcote now proposed to withdraw his amendment, which he said he had brought forward as \"the narrowest possible proposal for the preservation of peace and order in the House,\" and to substitute the following: \"That Charles Bradlaugh, Esq., one of the members for Northampton, having disobeyed the orders of this House, and having, in contempt of the authority of this House, irregularly and contumaciously pretended to take the oath prescribed by law, be expeUed this House.\" The substitution was agreed to by 291 against 83, the teUers reporting that Mr. Bradlaugh himself had voted with the \" Noes.\" The motion was then put as the main question, and carried by 297 to 80, Mr. Gladstone and several other occupants of the Ministerial benches leaving the House amid ironical cheers. A new writ was then moved for and agreed to, in pursuance of which Mr. Bradlaugh was once more returned for Northampton ; but, before he presented himself at the table to be sworn, Sir Stafford Northcote moved (March 6, 1882) that the"], [612, "592 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. House reaffirm the sessional resolution of the 7th of February. An amendment was proposed, in favour of such an alteration in the law as should enable every duly elected member either to take the oath or make affirmation ; but Sir S. Northcote's motion was carried, notwithstanding Mr. Gladstone's opposition, by 257 to 242. During the remainder of the session Mr. Bradlaugh was frequent in attendance, occupying a seat under the gallery, but below the bar. Action to Recover Penalties. \u2014 After the incidents just recited, an action, \" Clarke v. Bradlaugh,\" was brought to recover \u00a3500 from the latter, as penalty for having sat and voted without having taken the oath. It was dismissed on appeal to the House of Lords (April 9, 1883), tho court deciding that a common informer could not sue in the matter, but that the Crown alone could take the initiative. A counter-action, \" Bradlaugh v. Newdegate,\" against the member for North Warwickshire for unlawfully maintaining or assisting Clarke in the above suit, by giving a bond to idemnify him against the costs, was decided April 23, 1883, the Lord Chief Justice giving judgment against the defendant, and awarding the plaintiff indemnity for everything he had suffered in costs. Action against the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms. \u2014 On the 6th of May, 1882, Captain Gosset, Serjeant-at-Arms, informed the House that a writ had been issued in the Court of Queen's Bench, at the suit of Mr. Bradlaugh, against Mr. Erskine, the Deputy-Serjeant, for an assault committed against the member for Northampton, in removing him from the precincts of the House in the previous August. A letter to that effect from Mr. Bradlaugh's soUcitors having been read at the table, the Attorney- General moved that it be taken into consideration at the foUowing sitting, which was agreed to. The House then resolved that leave be given to the Deputy-Serjeant to appear and plead in the action ; and also that the Attorney-General be directed to defend the action on behalf of the Deputy-Serjeant ; but it was made understood that the House reserved its rights to govern its own procedure, and also to take pro ceedings against persons infringing its privileges, by bringing actions in courts of law. The case came before the courts the foUowing year. Mr. Erskine pleaded that the force of which Mr. Bradlaugh complained was used in order to give effect to the order of the House. The courts held accordingly that they had no jurisdiction, the House of Commons being judge of its own privileges in the matter. Introduction of an Affirmation BiU. \u2014 On the first day of the session of 1883, a letter was read by Mr. Labouchere, stating that his colleague in the representation of Northampton would present himself to take the oath. The Government, however, announced that an Affirmation Bill would be immediately brought in ; and it was promised that no step should bo taken by Mr. Bradlaugh until the fate of this bill was decided. The second reading of the bill \u2014 which proposed to allow any member who objected to the oath to substitute for it a simple affirmation \u2014 was moved on the 23rd of April, and, after five nights' debate, was refused by 292 to 289. On the foUowing day Mr. Bradlaugh wrote to the Speaker, again claiming his right to take the oath, and demanding to be heard at the bar"], [613, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 593 if there were any doubt on the matter. The Speaker asked instructions from the House ; when Sir Stafford Northcote moved that, having regard to what had previously transpired, Mr. BracUaugh \" be not permitted to go through the form of repeating the words of the oath.\" The \" previous question \" was proposed, as an amendment, by Mr. Labouchere, and supported by the Government ; but Sir Stafford's motion was carried by 271 against 165. On the 9th of July, Mr. Gladstone read a letter from Mr. Bradlaugh stating his intention to take his seat, disregarding the resolution of the House as invalid ; and the Prime Minister said he would leave the responsibility of any steps to those under whose advice the House had previously acted. Sir Stafford Northcote then moved that tho order instructing the Serjeant-at-Arms to exclude Mr. Bradlaugh be revived, which was carried by 232 to 65. The Serjeant was then ordered to enforce this decision ; whereupon Mr. Bradlaugh brought an action against the Serjeant-at-Arms, leave was given to him to plead, and the Attorney-General was instructed to undertake the defence. The Action against the Serjeant-at-Arms. \u2014 Judgment was given in the case of \" Bradlaugh v. Gosset \" by the Court of Queen's Bench in February, 1884. The plaintiff, by his action, asked the court to declare the order of the House nuU and void, and to restrain the Serjeant at-Arins from enforcing it. On the part of the Serjeant-at-Arms the Crown filed a demurrer that the action disclosed no actionable wrong. Lord Chief Justice Coleridge (with whom were Justices Mathew and Stephen) in delivering judgment said the question was whether, on the assumption that a resolution of the House of Commons forbad a member of that House, within the walls of the House itself, from doing something which by the law of the land he was obliged to do, such resolution was one which the House of Commons had a right to pass ; and whether, if it were not, the court could enable a member of the House to maintain an action against an officer of the House, charged by resolution of the House itself with the execution of its orders. It had been laid down that the House of Commons \u2014 and of course the other House of Parliament too \u2014 was absolute judge of its own internal proceedings, and that its resolutions could not be called in question ; but it had also been laid down, in the case of \" Stockdale and Hansard,\" that the House of Commons could not, by mere resolution, change the law of the land. It was obvious, there fore, that the House of Commons could, in relation to what occurred within its own walls, and with regard to its own privileges, practically supersede the law by resolution. Another proposition of equal truth, and decisive of the case before the court, was that whatever was said or done within the walls of Parliament could not be inquired into by the courts. On that point all the judges in the cases bearing on the question were most emphatic in their decision. It had been authoritatively laid down that the House had absolute jurisdiction over its own members aud over its own right to enforce discipline among them ; indeed, if it had not such authority it would sink into insignificance and contempt. The House of Commons ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to do what they had a right to do themselves ; and that officer had merely obeyed orders. It Q Q"], [614, "594 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. had been said that the House of Commons had exceeded its legal powers, because they resolved that Mr. Bradlaugh should not be permitted to take the oath, which that gentleman had alleged he was bound to take by statute. There was, however, nothing in the facts before the court that would justify them in coming to the conclusion that such was the case. It was consistent with the facts that Mr. Bradlaugh had insisted upon taking the oath in a manner to which the House had a right to object. It was not for the court even to inquire whether an injustice had or had not been done. If one had been done, it was an injustice for which the law had provided no remedy, and the aggrieved person must apply for that to the constituencies which the House of Commons repre sented. As Mr. Bradlaugh's action was not supported by any authority, the demurrer must be allowed. Repeatedly Voting in the House. \u2014 Early in the session of 1884 (Feb. 11), Mr. Bradlaugh presented himself at the table accompanied by Mr. Labouchere and Mr. Burt, and, as on a previous occasion, took a paper and a book from his pocket. The Speaker, rising, called \" Order, order,\" which was loudly re-echoed from the Opposition side. Mr. Bradlaugh nevertheless continued, and apparently repeated the words of the oath, kissed the book, subscribed a paper which he left on the table, and returned to the bar. The Speaker then directed him to withdraw, while the House considered his conduct in endeavouring to administer the oath to himself without any of the forms prescribed by law ; whereupon Mr. Bradlaugh bowed, and withdrew to the seats under the gaUery. \u2014 Sir S. Northcote then rose, and, assuming that the Prime Minister had no intention of taking the initiative, pointed out that the ceremony which Mr. Bradlaugh had gone through was not in accordance with the statute. He moved that, having reference to the resolutions already passed, and the reports of the committees, Mr. Bradlaugh be not permitted to go through the form of repeating the words of the oath. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone admitted the consistency of this motion, but thought no responsibility rested on the Government to give effect to a decision of which they disapproved, especially as it might be their duty to direct the Attorney-General to test the legality of Mr. Bradlaugh's conduct by an action at law ; and he urged the House to accept the motion without a division. A long dis cussion ensued before the House divided, and when the voting had taken place, one of the tellers reported that Mr. Bradlaugh had voted with the Noes. It was moved that his vote be expunged, which gave rise to another discussion, before the motion was carried by 258 to 161. The numbers on the main question were then announced as 280 for Sir S. Northcote's resolution, and 167 against it. Sir S. Northcote then moved that Mr. Bradlaugh be excluded from the precincts of the House until he engage not further to disturb the proceedings, which, after some opposition, was carried by 228 to 120. Mr. Bradlaugh voted in both these divisions. Again Returned by his Constituency. \u2014 Shortly after this incident Mr. Bradlaugh applied for the Chiltern Hundreds, and again offered himself to his constituents, when he was once more returned. On"], [615, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 595 the 21st of February a letter was read by the Speaker, in which Mr. Bradlaugh informed him that, as the Crown had commenced an action to test the legality of his proceedings on the 11th of February, he would not present himself to take his seat under his new return until judgment had been given on it. Sir S. Northcote, reminding the House of tho grounds on which it had acted aU along, maintained that it was still incumbent on the House to protect itself against Mr. Bradlaugh's intru sion, and that the decision in the action could in no way affect his position with regard to the House. He urged also the inconvenience of leaving it uncertain when Mr. Bradlaugh might make his appearance, and concluded by moving the reaffirmation of the two resolutions passed on Feb. 11. \u25a0 \u2014 Mr. Gladstone pointed out that there was a change in the circumstances of the case, as Mr. Bradlaugh now presented himself under a new com mission. Sooner or later, he said, the House would have to retire from the contest, as on former occasions when it had got iuto conflict with constituencies ; but, after the engagement which Mr. Bradlaugh had given, he thought tho House ought to refrain from taking any further step untU judgment had been given in the action raised by the Attorney- General. Eventually the previous question was moved, but negatived by 226 to 173, and Sir S. Northcotc's resolutions were agreed to without a division. Mr. Bradlaugh, who was standing at the bar, was then directed to withdraw, which he did, protesting against the action of the House. Crown Action for Penalties. \u2014 An action to recover from Mr. Bradlaugh three penalties of 500?. each, for voting in the House of Commons on tho 11th of February, without having taken the oath as prescribed by statute, was brought in tho Court of Queen's Bench by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Crown. The trial \"at bar\" took place in May, 1884, before tho Lord Chief Justice (Lord Coleridge), Mr. Barou Huddleston, and Mr. Justice Grove, with a special jury. Judgment was delivered on tho 30th of June, when the Lord Chief Justice summed up the arguments, and put several questions to the jury, who found that the defendant was not a person upon whose conscience an oath had binding force, and that he had not subscribed the oath according to the full practice of ParUament. Upon these findings the verdict was entered for the plaintiff ; but Mr. Bradlaugh was aUowed time to move in arrest of judgment. Renewed Application to Sit. \u2014 After the formation of Lord Salisbury's Goverumeut in June, 1885, when the new Ministers who were members of the House of Commons had presented themselves to take the oath upon re-election, Mr. Bradlaugh also appeared at the table; but before he could make any claim, the ChanceUor of the Exchequer (Sir Michael Hicks-Beach) rose, and reminded the House of the resolutions passed in the preceding February, which he proposed to re-affirm. Mr. Hopwood moved an amendment committing the House to early legislation on the subject, and this was supported by Mr. Gladstone aud other prominent members of tho Liberal party, but negatived by 263 to 219. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer's resolution, then being put, was carried without a division; and Mr. Bradlaugh, who had remained standing at <4 Q 2"], [616, "596 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the bar, addressing the Speaker said that he would obey tho order to withdraw, but leave his case to the constituencies. The Oath at Last Taken. \u2014 On the assembling of the new Par liament in January, 1886, Mr. Speaker Peel, immediately after he had been himself sworn, said, before honourable members camo to the table to take the oath, it was his duty to refer to letters he had received from the leader of the House (Sir M. Hicks-Beach) and others as regards the case of the junior member for Northampton (Mr. Bradlaugh). After reading portions of these letters, the Speaker went on to say : \" It will be observed that the statements made allude to proceedings in a former Parliament. We are assembled in a new Parliament. I know nothing of the resolutions of the past. They have lapsed \u2014 they are void \u2014 they are of no effect with reference to this case. (Cheers.) It is the right \u2014 the legal and statutable obligation\u2014 of an honourable member, when returned to this House, to come to this table and take the oath prescribed by the statute. I have no authority, I have no right, original or delegated, to intervene between an honourable member and his taking of the oath. I have been asked whether, when the House is completed, and after a quorum has been constituted, it would be competent for a morion to be niado intervening between the honourable member for Northampton and his taking of the oath. I have come clearly and without hesitation to the conclusion that it would neither be my duty to prohibit the honourable gentleman from coming, nor would it be my duty to permit a motion to be made which would stand between him and the oath. (Cheers.) The honourable member takes that oath under whatever risks may attach to> him in a court of law ; but it is not for me \u2014 I respectfully say it is not for the House \u2014 to enter into any inquisition as to what may be tho opinions of an honourable member when he comes to the table to take the oath. I am bound, and tho House is bound, by the forms of this House, and by the legal obligations and rights of members.\" After this, many members were sworn before Mr. Bradlaugh presented himself. He had for some few minutes been holding in his hand a copy of the New Testament, but this ho presently deposited upon the Treasury bench, to make some inquiry of the clerk at the table before going throngh tho formal ceremony. After exchanging a few words with Sir Erskine May, he again took up tho Testament, and, having repeated the words of the oath from the printed form placed before him, kissed the book. There was no demonstration of any kind while the formality was bein<\u00bb- gone through. Subsequently Mr. Bradlaugh signed the roll of Parliament as one of the members for the borough of Northampton, and, in accordance with custom, shook hands with the Speaker. He afterwards exchanged greetings with several mombers, who congratulated him upon bavin\" at length been allowed to take tho oath and his seat without let or hindrance. It was announced some months after, at a meeting in Northampton, \" that Mr. Bradlaugh had been informed that her Majesty's Government did not propose pursuing any further the suit instituted by the late Government to recover fines and penalties from the junior member for Northampton for sitting and voting iu the House of Commons before taking the oath.\""], [617, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 597 The Original Resolution Expunged.\u2014 On the 8th of March, 1889, on the motion to go into Committee of Supply, Mr. Bradlaugh moved that the resolutiou of the House of June 22, 1880, preventing his taking the oath or making the affirmation, be expunged from the journals of the House. He argued that his expulsion unlawfully deprived his constituents of half their right of representation, and he appealed to the Bouse as a matter of justice to rescind its resolution, and so bring to an end the struggle which had arisen in regard to his case. \u2014 Sir M. Hicks-Beach denied the right of the House to expunge from its journals a resolution of a previ.us Parliament which was legal and constitutional. The resolution was merely an act of the House in carrying out the law as regarded the admission of a member, and to rescind it would be an admission that it had acted illegally, \u2014 Sir H. James urged that, whatever might have been the legality of Mr. Bradlaugh's exclusion, the House had no constitutional right to interfere with the free choice of a constitu- ency, and that the resolution, therefore, was unconstitutional. \u2014 The Solicitor-General (Sir E. Clarke) argued that it would be useless aud absurd to rescind the resolution and tamper with the records, unless some stronger necessity were shown. He denied that the resolutiou was unconstitutional, for it was based on the reports of two committees, and the legality of its action had been vindicated by the courts of law. \u2014 Sir W. Harcourt strongly supported the motiou ; but, on a division, it was negatived by 112 to 79. \u2014 The matter was not set at rest until shortly after the meeting of Parliament in January. 1891, when Mr. Hunter drew attention to a notice of motion to the effect above mentioned, then standing on the papers in Mr. Bradlaugh's name; and (in his absence through serious illness) moved to expunge the resolution from the journals. The motion was supported by Mr. Gladstone and others, among them Sir Stafford Northcote, son of the late Lord Iddesleigh. Mr. Hunter had moved that the resolution of 1880 was \" subversive of the rights of the whole body of electors in this kingdom.\" Mr. W. H. Smith (First Lord of the Treasury) objected to these words, and after they had been with- drawn, the proposal was agreed to. Words of respect were used by members on both sides as regards Mr. Bradlaugh's conduct aud character since he had been in the House ; to which, however, he was not destined to return, his death occurring shortly after. Forward New Members. \u2014 Mr. Lechmere (afterwards Lord Lech mere), a member of tho legal profession, being returned to Parliament for Appleby in the year 1708, turned round and addressed the House imme diately after he had taken tho oaths. A country gentleman, however, interrupted his speech, objecting to his right to be heard, inasmuch as he could not be considered a \" sitting member,\" not having sat down since he had entered the house. \u2014 Mr. Cowper (afterwards Lord Chancellor. 1707) addressed the House three times on the day of taking his seat. He was cxceUed, however, by \" Orator Hunt,\" who spoke (says Townsend) on six different questions the very first night. \" Calling the House.\" \u2014 When there is \" a call \" of the Honse of Lords, a notice is sent to every peer informing him \" that aU the lords are"], [618, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 598 summoned to attend the service of the House \" on a certain day. Although the lords may usually remain away with impunity, there have been occasions when both fines and imprisonment have been imposed upon absent peers. During the time when the biU for the degradation of Queen Caroline was before the Legislature, in the year 1820, the House of Lords was caUed over, and it was resolved, \" That no lord do absent himself on pain of incurring a fine of 100?. for each day's absence, pending the three first days of such proceedings, aud of 50?. for each subsequent day's absence from the same ; aud in default of payment of being taken iuto custody.\" The only excuses aUowed were those of sickness, being abroad, or out of the country upon public service, old age (seventy and upwards), or the death of a pareut, wife, or chUd. At the \"call \" the clerk first reads the name of the junior baron, according to ancient custom. \u2014 As regards calls of the Houso of Commons, it is usual to give at least a week or ten days' notice, and (according to May's \" Parliamentary Practice \") the order for the House to be called over is accompanied by a resolution \" that such members as shall not then attend be sent for in the custody of the Serjeant at-Arms.\" On the call day, after the first order of the day has been disposed of, the names of members are caUed \u2014 the county representatives first, and then the city and borough members. The English and Welsh counties precede those of Scotland and Ireland. The clerk takes down the names of those members who are present, and during the evening they are again called. Members not present are summoned to attend on a future day ; if they are not on that occasion in the House, and fail to make some valid excuse, they are \" liable to be committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, and to the payment of the fees incident to that commit ment.\" \" No Houss.\" \u2014 On the 19th of May, 1876, a circumstance occurred which had not transpired before during an interval of fourteen years, namely, a \" no house.\" When the Speaker took the chair at four o'clock, he proceeded to count the members present, and, reporting that there were only 36, the House stood adjourned, according to its rule that 40 must be present to constitute a sitting. \u2014 On the adjournment of the House at the close of the session in August, 1882, a quorum not being present, the Speaker took a seat at the table, until Black Rod was announced ; and the presence of this functionary being sufficient to constitute a House, the Speaker then took the chair, and received the summons to attend the Lords, to hear the Royal assent given by commission to Acts passed by the two Houses. Preventing the Formation of a House. \u2014 Towards the close of the session of 1883, shortly after the Speaker had taken the chair at a Wednesday sitting, he was asked by Mr. Agnew whether it was in order and respectful to the Chair for an honourable member to stand at the door in the lobby, and use his influence to prevent members entering the House to assist in making a quorum. \u2014 The Speaker said he had never had such a case reported to him, and he should be surprised if any honourable member took the course described. \u2014 It was said in the House that tho gentleman whose conduct was complained of was Mr. Warton, member"], [619, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 599 for Bridport.* But it was also noted at the time as no exceptional proceeding for one member to attempt to induce others to refrain from making a quorum, and that the man\u0153uvre was sometimes employed by members in responsible positions. Grand Committees. \u2014 The experiment of the \" devolution \" of bills to Grand Committees was tried in the session of 1883, in pursuance of provisions under Rules of Procedure passed in the autumn session of 1882. Two bills were referred to a Standing Committee on Trade, and two to a similar Committee on Law. Of these biUs, three were sent back to the House of Commons after full consideration, but only two \u2014 the Bankruptcy Bill and the Patents Bill \u2014 became law. It was too late in the session for the House to take up two measures sent back from the Legal Committee. The business of the Committees was conducted in the same form as that in the House itself, the committee-room having rows of benches on each side, and the members rising to address the Chair. Each committee consisted of sixty-four members \u2014 48 English, 10 Irish, and six Scotch. The resolutions relating to the constitution and proceedings of these committees were revived in March, 1884, on the motion of the Government ; an amendment proposed by Sir Baldwin Leighton \u2014 that no bill reported from such committee be first taken into consideration at any date later than August 1 \u2014 being agreed to. A proposal by Mr. ParneU, in favour of appointing a similar tribunal for Irish bills, was negatived by 160 to 40. Making a House from Committees. \u2014 In tho House of Commons on May 1, 1879, Sir J. Goldsmid asked a question of the Speaker on this subject. On the previous day (a Wednesday) he was acting as chairman of a select committee on a private bill, and shortly after twelve o'clock he was, with other members of the committee, asked by the Serjeant-at-Arms to leave the committee-room and assist in making a House. He thought this unfair alike to the members and to the persons interested in the bills, inasmuch as there were many members who had no committee work to do who might, if they would, attend at noon on Wednesdays to make a House. When the Serjeant-at-Arms appeared, he had not the mace with him ; but he stated that in the event of non-compliance he should have to produce the mace, and he (Sir J. Goldsmid) did not know what the consequences of such an appearance might have been. (Laughter.) The Speaker, in reply, said the practice of sending the Serjeant-at-Arms under such circumstances was founded upon ancient custom. He had in his posses sion a book, prepared on the authority of Mr. Speaker Abbot in 1805, and handed down to his successors, from which he would read an extract. It ran as follows : \" After prayers, the Speaker generally retires to his own chamber, or sits in the House in the clerk's chair. When he says he wishes to take the chair and there are not forty members in the house, the Serjeant must go to the committees upstairs, and, addressing himself to tho chairman, must say, ' Sir, the Speaker wants to take the chair,' and desire the members of such committees to go down to help to make a \u2022 See p. 501."], [620, "600 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. House ; if they don't comply with this summons, the Speaker can send, and frequently has sent, up the Serjeant with the mace; and on the appearance of the mace at any committee, that committee is dissolved of course. But it is convenient and usual first to inform the committee that the Speaker intends or threatens to send the mace if they do not come, and for the messenger, when the mace is coming, to inform the committee of it, that they may adjourn, and nos be dissolved.\" He remarked, further, that the Speaker had no authority to compel the attendance of honourable members who were serving on committees. The attendance of members at the request of the Speaker must, under the circumstances, be left to their own good sense and judgment. Whips' Circulars for Attendance. \u2014 In allusion to the absence of party questions in the session of 1877, Sir Wilfrid Lawson told some of his constituents that it was the custom for the \" whip \" of the Liberal party in Parliament to caU his political hounds together by means of a little circular \" earnestly requesting \" their attendance. If the circular came without a dash or stroke under the word earnestly, it meant there was some business which might or might not come on that night. If there was one dash under the word \"earnestly,\" it meant you ought to come. If there were two, it meant you shoidd come. If there were three, it meant you must come. If there were four, it meant, \"come, or stay away at your peril.\" Whips by Private Members. \u2014 In April, 1884, Mr. J. Lowther called the attention of the House to the fact that a circular, signed by Mr. Dodds, member for Stockton, had been sent to several members, asking them to support a railway bill then before the House, and for which his son was solicitor. Mr. Lowther said, one of the standing orders laid down that no member was entitled to take action on a measure in which he was personally interested. \u2014 The Speaker (Mr. Arthur Peel, recently elected) said the question had better be raised when the bill was taken. It was a novel point, and he would like time to consider it. \u2014 Lord Randolph Churchill, however, moved \" That the issue of this circular is a gross breach of the privileges of this House.\" Mr Dodds expressed his regret if he had in the slightest degree contravened the rules and privileges of the House ; and Sir William Harcourt (Home Secretary) said, the conduct of the honourable member for Stockton would be a breach of privilege if it could be shown that he had used his position for his own personal interest, but private whips, signed by members of both parties, were often sent out. He thought there was no ground for the motion. \u2014 Sir Stafford Northcote thought the matter one of importance, aud that the step taken by Mr. Dodds was in excess of anything yet known in the way of inviting gentlemen down to the House to take part in a bill. \u2014 Mr. Raikes agreed in this, especially as the honour able member for Stockton had assisted the gentleman (Sir Charles Forster) who had under his special charge the private legislation of the House. \u2014 Sir W. Lawson moved an amendment, that, Mr. Dodds having apologised (he had also withdrawn from the House during the discussion), the House do now proceed with other business ; aud this was carried by 139 to 99."], [621, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 601 An XJnusuaUy Full House. \u2014 Evelyn writes in October, 1705 : \u25a0\" The Parliament chose one Mr. Smith Speaker. There had never ben so greate an assembly of members on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.\" The full number of members at this time was about 500. Non-Attendance of Members. \u2014 In debates of the highest con sequence during the reign of Charles I. (says Clarendon) there were not usually present in the House of Commons the fifth part of their just numbers, and very often not above a dozen or thirteen in the House of Peers. Fines on Absent Members. \u2014 A correspondent putting a qnestion on this subject to Notes and Queries, the editor replied as follows : \" The personal service of every member of the Commons House has been compulsory from time immemorial. By 5 Rich. II. c. 14 it is enacted that, ' if any person summoned to Parliament do absent himself, anil come not at the said summons (except he may reasonably and honestly excuse himself to our lord the King), he shall be amerced, or otherwise punished, according as of old times hath been used to be done, within the said realm in the said case.' And by 6th Henry VIII. c. 16 it is declared that no member shall absent himself ' without the licence of the Speaker and the Commons.' The penalties imposed upon members so offending have varied with the times and the temper of the House. Sometimes absentees have been committed to prison, but more frequently punished by fines, or the forfeiture of their ' wages.' In the latter Parliaments of Charles I. and those of the Commonwealth, the fine for disobeying a call of the House was not less than ten or more than twenty pounds ; and most probably the last-mentioned sum was the maximum in aU times. Taking the value of money into consideration, as weU as the loss of the parliamentary allowance, the cost of absenteeism at the period referred to certainly was not to be ' lightlie esteemed.' The infliction of finos seems to have ceased towards the close of the seventeenth century. The power of inflicting them rested with the House ; the Speaker, in virtue of his office, merely executed its orders.\" Fines for Late Arrival. \u2014 Many efforts (says Mr. Forster, in his *' Arrest \") had been made to compel early and full attendance at the House. Under the form of fines for being late at prayers, these attempts were frequently renewed. The practice originated at the memorable time of May, 1641 ; but, owing to the confusion caused by the calls of \" Pay ! Pay !\" wdiich greeted dilatory members on their entrance, it was for the time abandoned. Ten months later it was renewed. \" A motion made,\" says D'Ewes, \"as I came in, that such members as should not come up by eight, and bo at prayers, should pay a shiUing. I said, when that was tried twelve months ago it was laid aside from its inconvenience, after one day's practice ; and that the best way would be to rise at twelve, and not at two or three, to ensure members coming at eight. Divers others spake against it ; but the greater number being for it, it passed.\" Very little, hewever, as it would seem, to the benefit of Mr. Speaker, seeing that next morning he did not make his appearance until a quarter to nine. \" The House by this time,\" D'Ewes remarks, \" was very full at prayers,"], [622, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 602 by reason of the order made yesterday. Sir H. MUdmay, after prayers, stood up and said he was glad to see this good effect of yesterday's order, and said to the Speaker that he did hope that hereafter he would come in time ; which made the Speaker throw down twelvepence upon the table. Divers spake after him, and others as they came in did each pay his shilling to the Serjeant. I spake to the orders of the House : That the order made yesterday was to fine ' after ' prayers, and therefore you (I spake to the Speaker) cannot be subject to pay ; and for coming a little after eight, that was no great difference. Although I spake truly, the Speaker,. having cast down his shilling, would not take it up again.\" Early Hours in Parliament. \u2014 The sittings (says May) were formerly held at an early hour in the morning, generally at eight o'clock, but often even at six or seven o'clock, and continued till eleven, the com mittee being appointed to sit in the afternoon. In the time of Charles II. , nine o'clock was the usual hour for commencing public business, and four o'clock for the House rising. At a later period, ten o'clock was the ordinary time of meeting; and the practice of nominaUy adjourning the House until that hour continued untU 1806, though so early a meeting had long been discontinued. According to the present practice, no hour is named by the House for its next meeting, but it is announced in the \" Votes \" at what hour Mr. Speaker will take the chair. Occasionally the House has adjourned to a later hour than four, as on the opening of the Great Exhibition, 1st May, 1851, to six o'clock, and on the Naval Review at Spithead, 11th August, 1853, to ten o'clock at night. A Speaker's Lament. \u2014 Speaker Arthur Onslow, in 1759, wrote as foUows respecting the late hour of commencing Parliamentary sittings : \" This is shamefully grown of late, even to two of the clock. I have done all in my power to prevent it, and it has been one of the griefs and burdens of my life. It has iimumerable inconveniences attending it. The Prince of Wales that now is (afterwards George III.) has mentioned it to me several times with concern, and did it again this very day ; and it gives me hopes, that in King William's time those of his Ministers who had the care of the government business in the House of Commons were dismissed by him to be there by eleven o'clock. But it is not the fault of the present King ; his hours are early. It is the bad practice of the higher offices, and the members fall into it, as suiting their late hours of pleasure, exercise, or other private avocations. The modern practice, too, of long adjournments at Christmas and Easter, and the almost constant adjournment over Saturdays, are a great delay of business and of the sessions. This last was begun by Sir Robert Walpole for the sake of his hunting, but now everybody is for it.\" Effect of AU-Night Sittings.\u2014 In June, 1837, the Speaker of the House of Commons (Mr. Peel) attended the reopening of tho pump rooms and baths at Leamington. At a luncheon which followed, re* sponding to the toast of \" The House of Commons,\" ho said, the more the constituencies were interested in the proceedings of that branch of the Legislature, the better it would be for the House of Commons and for the transaction of public business. The House had passed something likes"], [623, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 603 four months (up to that time) in the most laborious session it had ever been his lot to undertake. They had spent days, and sometimes nights, in what might euphemisticaUy be called business, but he could assure them that during tho small hours the business of the country was not done with that rapidity and despatch that it should be. All-night sittings, such as they had of late experienced, destroyed life, shattered the nerves, and soured the temper. Motion for Candles. \u2014 In the House of Commons an interruption was sometimes caused by moving that candles be brought in ; but by a standing order of the 6th of February, 1717, it was ordered, \" That when the House, or any committee of the whole House, shaU be sitting, and daylight be shut in, the Serjeant-at-Arms attending this House do take care that candles be brought in, without any particular order for that purpose.\" A Long Sitting in the Last Century. \u2014 Walpole relates, in his \" Memoirs of the Reign of George III.,\" that on the discussion of the Westminster election, in 1742, the Speaker sat in the chair for seventeen hours. Prolonged Sittings. \u2014 A sitting of twenty-six hours occurred on the 31st of July and the 1st of August, 1877. The House met at four o'clock in the afternoon of the 31st (Tuesday), and continued Bitting until six the foUowing evening, the leaders of the Government and tho Opposi tion agreeing to continue the business of the House by relays of members and by a succession of Chairmen ; the officers of the House being also relieved by arrangement. The biU before the House was one relating to- South Africa, which had been obstinately contested (apparently for the mere sake of obstructing business) by a section of tho Irish party.* \u2014 A sitting of twenty-one hours took place on Thursday, August 26, 1880, and the following day. The subject beforo the House was the Irish Constabulary Estimates, which were opposed by the Irish members ; and nine alternate motions were made, to report progress, and that the- Chairman do leave the chair. The largest number who voted for any of these motions was 29, and the smallest 10 ; the majority on the other side varying from 142 to 76. \u2014 On Tuesday, Jan. 25, 1881, a twenty-two hours' sitting followed Mr. Gladstone's proposal that the Irish Protection Bill have precedence of all other subjects from day to day. Several motions for adjournment, from the Irish benches, having been defeated, Mr. Gladstone's proposal was evontually carried by 251 to 33, and he then (at two o'clock ou Wednesday afternoon) moved the adjournment of the- House until Thursday, after a sitting of twenty-two hours and a quarter. The Speaker had occupied tho chair fourteen hours, with the exception of twenty minutes during the dinner rime. The week foUowing, a sitting that commenced on the Monday (the same measure being before the House) was prolonged till half -past nine on the Wednesday morning. The circumstances attending this extraordinary sitting are detailed hereafter. On Friday, June 30, 1882, the House met at two o'clock, to further See under \" Obstruction.\""], [624, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 604 the Prevention of Crime (Ireland) BiU, then in committee; and, after adjourning for two hours' interval in the evening, resumed its sitting, which wtfs protracted throughout the next day until eight p.m. \u2014 in aU, twenty-eight hours. Twenty-five of the Irish members were suspended during this sitting.* The Longest Recorded Sitting of the House.\u2014 Action cf the Speaker. \u2014 This memorable sitting, which was at length terminated only by the action of the Speaker, commenced at four o'clock on Monday, Jan. 31, 1881, and continued until the Wednesday morning at half-past nine, lasting forty-one hours and a half. The question before the House was the Government motion for leave to bring in a Bill for the Protection of Person and Property in Ireland. Four divisions bad been taken on motions for adjournment, the minorities being composed almost exclu sively of \" Home Rulers,\" and the Irish members had been speaking alter nately to prolong the sitting; when, at six o'clock on the Wednesday morning, very few members being present, Mr. Biggar moved that the House be counted. This farther ruse to postpone proceedings was defeated by an inrush of members from the lobbies. At this time (wrote an observer) \" the chamber looked as if it had been the scene of a severe conflict. The floor was covered with a litter of torn paper. The servi tors were limp and sleepy, and even the higher officials seemed to be in a state of abject misery.\" Dr. Lyon Playfair (Deputy Speaker) had been in the chair all night ; and at nine o'clock Mr. Biggar had surrounded himself with blue-books and papers, with the apparent intention of pro longing indefinitely an harangue which he had lately commenced ; when Mr. Gladstone and other Ministers entered the House, as weU as the leaders of the Opposition. The Speaker then resumed the chair amid much cheering, and, reading from a paper, thus addressed the House : \" The motion for leave to bring in the Protection of Person and Property (Ireland) Bill has now been under discussion for about five days. The present sitting, having commenced on Monday last at four o'clock, has continued until this morning \u2014 a period of no less than forty-one hours \u2014 the House having been occupied with discussions upon repeated motions for adjournment. However tedious these discussions, the motions have been supported by small minorities, in opposition to the general sense of the House. A crisis has thus arisen, which demands the prompt inter position of the Chair and the House. The usual rules have been proved powerless to ensure orderly and effective debate. An important measure recommended in her Majesty's gracious speech nearly a month since, and declared to be urgent in the interests of the State by a decisive majority, is being arrested by the action of an inconsiderable minority, the members of which have resorted to those modes of obstruction which have been recognised by the House as a Parliamentary offence. The dignity, the credit, and the authority of this House are seriously threatened, and it is necessary that they should be vindicated. Under the operation of the accustomed rules and methods of procedure, the legislative powers of * See under \" Suspension.\""], [625, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 605 the House are paralysed. A new and exceptional course is imperatively demanded ; and I am satisfied I shall best carry out the wiU of tbe House, and may rely on its support, if I decline to call upon any more members to speak, and at once proceed to put the several questions to the House. I feel assured that the House will be prepared to exercise all its powers in giving effect to these proceedings. Future measures for ensuring orderly debate I must leave to the judgment of the House ; but I may add that it will be necessary either for the House itself to assume more effectual control over its debates, or to invest greater authority in the Chair.\" The reading of this document was interrupted by great cheering. as weU as cries of \"No, no,\" from the troublesome section of L-ish members, among whom it created evident consternation. The Speaker then proceeded to state the question before the House, and put the amendment which had originally been moved by Dr. Lyons, member for Dublin city, to the effect that \" remedial legislation take precedence over coercive measures.\" This was rejected by 164 to 19. The main question was then put, some of the Irish members walking out of the house ; leave was agreed to, and Mr. Forster brought up the bill, which was read a first time, the second reading being fixed for that day at twelve. Mr. Gladstone, before moving the adjournment of the House, gave notice of his \" urgency \" resolution * for the foUowing day. The House Powerless to Close Debate. \u2014 Iu February, 1882. Sir Henry Brand, the Speaker of the House of Commons, addressing his constituents in Cambridgeshire, referred to his actiou in closing the debate on the occasion just mentioned, and said: \" In a statement which lie made to the House on the eventful sitting referred to, he thought it his duty to put before the House the necessity of assuming more effectual control over its debates. That opinion was deliberately founded on obser vations on the course of debates in tho House of Commons during the present and past Parliaments. It might not be generally known that the House of Commons had no power whatever to close a debate, so that it was actually left at the mercy of small minorities, who on various grounds might desire to obstruct the busiuess of the House. The will of the House of Commons was expressed by its votes ; every vote involved the putting of a question from the chair, and upon such question every member might speak once and as long as he pleased, provided he spoke to the question; but, by an artifice of debate commonly practised, by moving adjournments members actually spoko as often as they pleased upon every question. In committee of tho whole House there was no limit to the number of times which a member might speak to each question, and at every sitting of the House the Speaker put from the chair questions by the score \u2014 some more or less formally, but all of which might become tho subject of debate without limit. Neither the House nor the Speaker could close a debate, and, as long as members rose and presented them selves to speak, the debate must go on. He knew of no power whatever that coidd close a debate in tho House, except the sovereign power the * See pp. 374, &e."], [626, "606 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Queen exercised when she prorogued ParUament. Face to face with a grave crisis, he took upon himself to close a debate. But the House had not as yet signified its pleasure as to the action of the Speaker, should a similar crisis occur. It was said that freedom of speech was endangered if the House should assume the power to close a debate. Now, freedom of speech was the breath of the life of the House of Commons, and if freedom of speech was put in peril, he should be no party to a procedure of that kind ; but he was persuaded that the House, in its wisdom, might find a way of safeguarding liberty of speech, and of combining order with freedom of debate.\" New Rule for the Closure of Debate.\u2014 In February, 1882, Mr. Gladstone brought forward a series of rules to regulate the future procedure of the House, the first of which provided for the application of a closing power by the majority, under certain conditions, The debate upon this proposal, having been adjourned from time to time, was not ended until the 30th of March; when Mr. Gladstone, in a con cluding speech, enforced the proposal of the Government by the remark : \u25a0\" We see the House exhausted with its labours, failing in the performance of them, beginning to lose the esteem of the country, lapsing by degrees into a slavery to its own system. This House has conquered its external foes, and now it runs the risk of being vanquished by those who, perhaps, are not the noblest of its own children.\" A division was taken on an amendment moved by Mr. Marriott (member for Brighton), \"That no rules of procedure will be satisfactory to this House which confer the power of closing a debate upon a majority of members.\" As originally proposed, the amendment contained the words \" bare majority,\" but tho first expression was removed before the amendment was finally put to tho House. There then appeared \u2014 For Mr. Gladstone's proposal, 318; for the amendment, 279 ; majority, 39. The normal majority of the Govern ment being considerably larger, and the vote having been given under strong party pressure, this was considered a very doubts id victory on such an important point. The Procedure Resolutions were not again taken up until the autumn session of 1882, which was caUed for the express purpose of dealing with them, the ordinary session having been, said Mr. Gladstone, one of \"utter ruin and discomfiture\" as regards legislative matters. In the renewed discussion in the autumn, tho Government announced ils intention to adhere to the Closure resolution as first proposed. The first division of importance took place on an amendment proposed by Mr. Gibson (member for Dublin University), in favour of substituting a two-thirds majority for the Ministerial proposal. This amendment was defeated by 322 to 238 (majority, 84), the Irish party voting with the Government, after a preliminary meeting in which the course to bo taken by that section was determined only by the castmg vote of the chairman (Mr. ParneU). A few nights later {Nov. 10, 1882) a division was taken on a motion, by Sir Stafford Northcote, meeting the proposed new rule by a direct negative; and there then appeared \u2014 For the Closure resolution, 304 ; against, 260 ; majority for the new rule, 44. On this occasion the ParneUite section"], [627, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 607 -voted against the Government. The following is the form in which the resolution passed, the words italicised showing the modifications introduced by consent of the Government into the original wording : \"That when it shall appear to Mr. Speaker, or to the Chairman of Ways and Means in a committee of the whole House, during any debate, that the subject has been adequately discussed, and that it is the evident sense of the House, or of the committee, that the question be now put, he may so inform the House or the committee ; and, if a motion be made ' That the question be now put,' Mr. Speaker, or the Chairman, shall forthwith put such question ; and, if the same be decided in the affirmative, the question under discussion shaU be put forthwith, provided that the question, 'that the question be now put,' shall not be decided in the affirmative, if a division be taken, unless it shall appear to have been supported by more than 200 members, or unless it shall appear to have been opposed by less than 40 members and supported by more than 100 members.\" In the course of the discus sion, the Speaker (Sir H. Brand), having been appealed to by a member to state what he would consider to be \" the evident sense of the House \" in such a case, created a marked impression by the reply, \" I have no hesita tion in stating that, according to my construction of the resolution, it would be the duty of the Speaker to ascertain, as far as he was able, the evident sense of the House at large.\" Sir Stafford Northcote remarked that this was so important a statement, that he would ask the Prime Minister whether he would introduce some words into the resolution to make the point clear. Mr. Gladstone replied, that if gentlemen were satisfied with the definition given from the Chair, by aU meaus let them note it as having been given ; but he was not disposed to insert definitions by the Speaker into a rule. Anything, however, said by himself, or anyone else in the Government, could have no effect whatever in com petition with what had fallen from the Chair. (Cheers.) First Application of the Closure. \u2014 This took place on the 24th of February, 1885. Mr. Gladstone had moved that the ordinary motions for the day bo postponed until after an adjourned debate on the affairs of the Soudan; but an Irish member having the first motion on the paper, an amendment in his favour was proposed by some of his colleagues. Several other members of the same section of the House having spoken, the Speaker said, \" It is my duty to inform the House that in my opinion tho question has now been adequately discussed, and I gather that it is the evident sense of the House that the question be now put,\" Mr. Gladstone moved to that effect, amid much uproar from the Irish members, one of them (Mr. O'Brien) being named by the Speaker, and his suspen sion carried by 244 to 20. Mr. Gladstone's motion for putting the question was passed by 207 to 46 ; and his original motion to proceed with the adjourned debate was then carried by 222 to 19. Several of the English members helped the Irish division to make up the 46 ; and had the Ayes been seven fewer, the Closure would not have passed, as over two hundred votes are required to carry that measure if it be opposed by forty members. The matter was brought before the House, during the following week, by Mr. Sexton, member for Sligo, who moved the adjournment in order to"], [628, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 608 call attention to the action of the Chair; but the Speaker said a vital blow would be struck at the authority of tho Chair if its ridings were to be challeng-ed in this indirect manner. In common with other members, he had rights, and one of them was that, if his conduct was impugned, it should be in a form which would permit the opinion of the House to be tested. He therefore took upon himself to rule the proposed motion out of order. \u2014 Mr. Sexton thereupon asked the Prime Minister to give him a day, but Mr. Gladstone declined, not recognising any urgency in tho matter. Comparative Failure of the New Rules. \u2014 Notwithstanding all that had been done in the autumn session speciaUy caUed for the purpose in 1882, we find Mr. Gladstone making the following remarks on laying the foundation stone of the National Liberal Club, Nov. 4, 1884: \"Believe me, the House of Commons at this moment has connected with it, not a single, but a double work of reform. There is a reform without, in the vast extension of the constituency ; but, not less important, there is also to be performed a great work of reform within. For that noble assembly, the first deliberative assembly in the world, is now doomed to see its efficiency impaired and its dignity destroyed by the advantage which its own too generous rules have enabled individuals and sections to take, so that the House itself has become the slave of those individuals and sections, and nothing can relieve it from that slavery except a great and drastic change in the forms of its procedure. To every one of you, hardly less than the great question of the franchise and what is immediately connected with it, I commend the consideration of that subject, which I assure you is not less pressing and not less important than any constitutional question that has ever been brought before the people of this country.\" \u2014 The whole subject had to be taken up by the Government next in power, and further rules and modifications were adopted. The New Rules of 1887. \u2014 The first of these new rules, esta blishing an amended form of the Closure, was carried in the House of Commons on tho 18th of March, 1887, by a majority of 262 against 41. It ran as foUows : \" That, after a question has been proposed, a member rising in his place may claim to move ' That the question be now put,'' and, unless it shall appear to the Chair that such motion is an abuse of the rules of the House, or an infringement of the rights of the minority, the question, ' That the question be now put,' shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. . . Provided always that ques tions for the closure of debate shall not be decided in the affirmative, if a division be taken, unless it shall appear, by the numbers declared from the Chair, that such motion was supported by more than 200 members, or was opposed by less than forty members and supported by more than 100 members. Provided always that this rule shaU be put in force only when the Speaker or the Chairman of Ways and Means is in the chair.\" On the morion of Mr. W. H. Smith, the rule was at once made a standing order of the House. At a protracted sitting which commenced three days after (March 21) it was enforced for the first time, by a majority of 207\" against 54."], [629, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 609 Vacation of a Seat. \u2014 The Chiltern Hundreds. \u2014 By ancient law, a member of ParUament cannot voluntarily vacate his seat ; but on acceptance of an office under the Crown his seat is vacated as a matter of course, the rule being that he must return to his constituents for them to express their approval of such a step, by re-electing him. The steward ship of the Chiltern Hundreds is an ancient office, entaUing, now, neither duty nor emolument ; but its acceptance affords to a member of Parlia ment a ready means of resigning his position, and the office is retained for the convenience of members of the House. It is in the gift of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and it has sometimes been applied for and resigned by different persons three or four times within a week. An interesting question respecting application for the office arose in July, 1880. At the general election in the previous AprU, Mr. Dodson (for merly Chairman of Committees in the House) had been returned for Chester, but, accepting office in Mr. Gladstone's Ministry formed soon after, he had gone back to his constituents, and was re-elected. A petition, however, was presented against his first return, and, on hearing, the judges pronounced such return null and void on the ground of bribery and treating, but that no corrupt practice had been proved against the candidate. The question as to the legality of the second election was not raised, Mr. Dodson applying for the Chiltern Hundreds, and being returned for Scarborough soon after. It was remarked in the House that there was no former instance, in the history of tho British Parliament, of a Cabinet Minister having accepted so humble an office as the steward ship in question. With regard to the practice of bestowing it, Mr. Gladstone said that the rule was \" to consider whether the gentleman who asks for the office can by possibility be escaping from any duty he owes to Parliament, or any law under, which he has come by his election to Parliament; and, unless there is some ground or colour of positive objec tion of this nature, to grant the office without making further inquiry.\" The Stewardship Refused. \u2014 An instance of this kind occurred in 1842. Mr. Goulburn, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, declined granting the office to Viscount Chelsea, on account of a suspected arrangement for the purpose of avoiding investigation into bribery ; but he said in his letter that \" under ordinary circumstances I should not feel justified in availing myself of the discretion vested in me to refuse or delay the appointment for which you have applied, when sought for with a view to the resignation of a seat in Parliament.\" New Writs. \u2014 Under an Act of George III., five members are appointed for the purpose of issuing writs, in the event of the illness or death of the Speaker. The appointments are made at the opening of each Parliament. The House of Commons at St. Margaret's Church.\u2014 On Sunday, March 22, 1887, in accordance with a resolution passed in the previous week, the House of Commons attended a special service at St. Margaret's, Westminster, to celebrate the jubilee of her Majesty's reign. The Speaker was attended by two ex-Speakers and about 450 members of the House. The last occasion of such an attendance was on Sunday, B R"], [630, "610 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. May 4, 1856, which day had been appointed for thanksgiving in respect of the treaty of peace with Russia at the close of the Crimean War. Formerly the Speaker and the House used to attend St. Margaret's on the days of what were known as the State services, namely : January 30 (King Charles's \" Martyrdom \"), November 5 (Gunpowder Plot), the day of the King's or Queen's accession, and May 29 (restoration of King Charles IL). These services were abolished in 1858. Adjournment of Parliament over the Derby Day. \u2014 Lord Palmerston, in moving the customary adjournment over the Derby day in 1857, aUuded to it as \"the day on which our Isthmian games are celebrated.\" An interesting discussion on the motion arose in 1872. On the evening before the Derby day in that year, the Prime Minister (Mr. Gladstone) moved the adjournment. The motion was opposed by Mr. Thomas Hughes, who remarked that the House had recently waived its former observance of Ascension Day, and it would be stultifying itself now to sacrifice a whole day to the festival of the turf. The turf, he said, whatever it might have done for the breed of horses, had given the British nation a system of gambling the most corrupt, the most insidious, and the most mischievous that had ever cursed any country in the world. \u2014 Mr. Locke charged the honourable member with inconsistency, and said Mr. Hughes would probably go to the Derby himself. \u2014 Col. Beresford hoped the honourable member would divide the House, as he threatened, for the result would probably be to prevent his ever interfering in the matter again. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone, in reply, said : \" The House agreed with his honourable friend in his denunciation of the fooUsh, vicious, and even ruinously vicious practices in many cases associated with what they never theless believed to be in itself a noble, manly, distinguished, and he might almost say historically national sport. The House would act on the principle that it was not bound, and that it was not expedient, to take cognisance, in connection with such a motion as this, of abuses which, after aU, were not essential to the sport itself. Moreover, were it to take cognisance of those abuses, and to take its stand on the extremely detri mental character of some of those practices, it ought to do something a little more decided than declining to adjourn over the morrow, and should in its legislative capacity make them the object of some aggressive action.\" On a division there appeared, for the adjournment, 212 ; against it, 58; majority, 154. \u2014 In 1876 a division again took place on the subject, Mr DisraeU (the Premier) moving, and Sir Wilfrid Lawson and Mr. Bright opposing, the adjournment. The numbers then were, for the adjournment, 207 ; against, 118 ; majority, 89. \u2014 The House sat, without division on the subject, on the Derby day which fell May 24, 1882; the first time for thirty-six years. Tbe measure before the House was the Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Bill. It was understood that the sitting should not be taken as a precedent for future occasions. In 1891 the adjournment was carried by 137 to 109. The Ministerial Whitebait Dinner. \u2014 This annual festivity at the end of the Parliamentary session is believed to have originated towards the close of the last century, when Sir Robert Preston, a wealthy"], [631, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 611 merchant residing at Dagenham in Essex, and representing Dover in Parliament, was accustomed to invite his friend Mr. George Rose, Secre tary to the Treasury, to partake of his hospitality. By Mr. Rose's suggestion, Mr. Pitt was asked to participate, and made his visit yearly. The locality being inconvenient, it was decided to change it for Greenwich, and by degrees other Ministers were invited, untU in time the dinner assumed an exclusively Ministerial character. It was continued annuaUy until Mr. Gladstone's Administration came into office in 1868, when it was discontinued ; but it was revived by Mr. Disraeli in 1874, and Mr. Glad stone afterwards resumed its annual celebration. Smoking in Parliament. \u2014 Members appear occasionaUy to have indulged themselves in the House by the use of the fragrant weed. The standing orders issued about the middle of the seventeenth century contain the following : \" Ordered, that no member of the House do presume to smoke tobacco in the gaUery, or at the table of the House, sitting as Committees.\" The Rush to Dinner. \u2014 As it has been (says Forster) with many a modem Mr. Speaker between the hours of seven and eight in the evening, so fared it with Mr. Speaker Lenthal, between twelve and one mid-day. One day the rush of members out of the house at that hour, during a debate on supply, had been such that he was fain flatly to tell them \" they were unworthy to sit in this great and wise assembly in a parliament, that would so run forth for their dinners.\" Ministers and the Dinner Hour. \u2014 In the debate on the Address in February, 1884, the proposers of an amendment adverse to the Govern ment, respecting affairs in Egypt, were allowed to remain unanswered from the Treasury bench ; and, a division being taken during the usual dinner hour, it was negatived by a considerable majority. Mr. Gladstone was taken to task the foUowing evening, for not having secured the con tinuance of the debate, on an urgent public question ; and, in defending the conduct of the Government, he said : \" As my Parliamentary Use com menced almost immediately after my non-age disappeared, I am in a position to speak with some experience. So far as my knowledge goes, when it has happened that the motion made has occupied the House until half -past seven or eight o'clock, it has not been usual for the Minister replying on the part of the Government to rise at that hour. Of course, I speak from recollection. The only case which happens to be in my memory is but partial in its application. But I remember perfectly well that in, I think, 1863, the right honourable gentleman who was then leader of the Opposition (Mr Disraeli) moved a vote of want of confidence against her Majesty's Government, and it was my duty to reply. When the clock reached the hour of seven, Lord Palmerston began to remonstrate with me on the question whether I should foUow at a time so near the dinner hour. Mr Disraeli spoke till a quarter or half past seven; and I \u2014 probably desirous of getting rid of my speech \u2014 rose and followed him ; but I was very much remonstrated with by members of the House, and particularly on our own side of the House, for having delivered a defence of tho Government to empty benches. That, be it remembered, was not a case e E 2"], [632, "612 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. when the debate had reached eight o'clock; and it was perfectly under stood between us, on the authority of Lord Palmerston, that if Mr Disraeli had spoken a quarter of an hour longer, I was to postpone my reply. That, I venture to affirm, is Parliamentary usage.\" The \" Dinner-bell \" of the House. \u2014 I am indebted to a friend (says Professor Pryme) for the following: \"An anecdote is told of David Hartley, the dinner-bell of the House, getting up to speak. Sir Robert Walpole took the opportunity of taking his ride, and went home, changed his clress for riding costume, rode to Hampstead, returned, put on fuU dress and came down to the House, when he found D. Hartley stiU on his legs, not having finished his speech.\" Shabby Peers. \u2014 In the Parliament which assembled at Drogheda Dec. 1, 1494 (relates O'Flanagan), the lords spiritual and temporal were enjoined to appear in eVery Parliament in their robes, as the lords of England. The reason assigned for this was \" that during the space of twenty years the English lords of Ireland had, through penuriousness, done away the said robes, to their own great dishonour, and the rebuke of aU the whole land.\" Wearing of Spurs in the House. \u2014 In the 39th year of Elizabeth, the House was cautioned by one of the Ministers that \" none should enter with their spurs ; \" and a little later, we are told, \" Mr. Speaker showed to the House that some particular members found themselves aggrieved that the ancient order for putting off their spurs, before they came into the Parliament House, was not observed, which he prayed might be done. Others suggested that boots and rapiers be taken away ; but nothing was done thereon.\" Swords Forbidden. \u2014 Lord Strafford (says Townsend), when Viceroy of Ireland, issued a proclamation to regulate Parliamentary sittings, and expressly forbade tho entrance of any member of either House with his sword. All obeyed except the young Earl of Ormond, who told the usher of the black rod, on demanding his sword, that he should have no sword of his except through his (the usher's) body. Equally concise and determined was the rejoinder of the spirited Irish nobleman when, in reply to the irritated inquiry of the Lord Deputy himself, what were his reasons for such insolent behaviour, he laid on the table his Majesty's writ which had summoned him to Parliament, \" cinc tum cum gladio,\" or \" per cincturam gladii.\" \"Tottenham in his Boots.\" \u2014 A very trifling circumstance marks the exactness and gravity of the dress insisted on about 1730 in the Irish House of Commons. Colonel Tottenham was called \"Tottenham in his Boots;\" because, having just come to town, and hearing of the important business then under discussion, he hurried down to the House without giving himself time to take his boots off. The members stared; and the older ones, as I have been well assured, muttered sadly and loudly at this crying innovation, as they termed it. \u2014 Hardy's \"Memoirs of Charlemont.\" Going to Court in Top-Boots \u2014 When the resolution for an address to the King to make peace with America, in 1782, was carried by"], [633, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 613 the Opposition by a very small majority, it was decided that the address be taken up to the Throne by the whole House. In order (says Professor Pryme) to mark their sense of the treatment they had been receiving from the Court, the county members went up to the Throne, according to their privilege, in leather breeches and top-boots, instead of court dress \u2014 a privilege, of course, very seldom exercised. The Court was not behind hand with them ; for, as a marked and well understood insult to the Opposition, General Arnold (just returned from America) was placed conspicuously on the King's right hand, where he was visible to the whole body of the members. The Last of an Old School. \u2014 Mr. George Byng (says Lord DaUing) was the last M.P. who was seen in the House of Commons with \"the top-boots that formed part of the costume of the Pitt and Fox epoch. He represented Middlesex in Parliament for fifty-six years \u2014 from 1790 till his death in 1846. It was also noted by the Quarterly Review that there was one pair of breeches with gaiters in the House of Commons as late as 1862, on the person of Sir Charles Burrell, who sat for Shoreham in fourteen consecutive Parliaments, from 1806 till his death iu the year above mentioned.* Correct Costume. \u2014 Professor Pryme tells the following : The mover and seconder of the address in answer to the King's speech always appeared in court dress, but the rest stood in a semicircle before the throne, in their ordinary morning dress. On the presentation of the address in 1835, one honourable member chose to appear in court dress, and seeing himself, when we were assembled previously, differently habited from the others, inquired if he were correct ; to which the Speaker (Abercromby) answered, \" Singularly correct, sir.\" Tall Members. \u2014 An incident which attracted attention occurred in the House in March, 1883. Mr. Brewster had been returned for Portarlington in tho Conservative interest, and was noticed as one of the taUest members in the assembly, his height being 6 feet 4j inches. He was introduced by two other Irish members, also on the Conservative side, who were nearly as taU \u2014 Mr. Tottenham, member for Leitrim, and Colonel King-Harman, for the Isle of Thanet, respectively measuring 6 feet 3 inches. The Times remarked, \"As the three stalwart Irish representatives walked up the floor of the House, they were received with loud cheers and some good-humoured laughter.\" But the two tallest representatives in Parliament at the time exceeded either of these in stature, measuring 6 feet 5 inches each, and were found on the opposite side. They were Mr. Cotes, who sat for Shrewsbury, and Mr. Whitbread, member for Bedford. Physical Infirmity in Members. \u2014 Mr. Arthur M'Murrough Kavanagh, a gentleman who had the misfortune to be without legs and with truncated arms, was elected for Wexford in 1866, and afterwards for Carlow county. He sat for the latter constituency for several years, and on more than one occasion, being Ufted on to a bench, spoke remarkably * See \" Long Eetention,\" p. 68."], [634, "614 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. weU. Mr. Henry Fawcett, who had lost his sight by an accident in shooting, was returned for Brighton in 1865, and afterwards for Hackney. He will be remembered as an efficient Postmaster- General in Mr. Glad stone's second Administration. Another blind member was returned by Brighton in 1886, in the person of Mr. W. T. Robertson. He was ap pointed a member of the Royal Commission for inquiring into the condition of the Blind, Deaf, and Dumb in 1888, and was knighted for his services in connection with it. Mr. W. A. Macdonald, who was returned unopposed for the Ossory division of Queen's county in 1886, was also blind, having lost his sight at the age of thirteen ; notwith standing which he obtained honours at Trinity CoUege, Dublin. A Member Counting Himself Out. \u2014 The following incident is mentioned by Mr. R. F. Palgrave : \" About a score of representatives were being addressed on a very important subject by a very serious brother member. Vexed by the scanty attendance that Ustened to him, he joked about the crowded benches, the packed house, that he pretended to see around. The jest was fatal ; he had referred to the number present. 'Order! order!' from the chair silenced the debater. Amazed he sat down, quite ignorant of the effect of his wit. Then the Speaker, in due custom, began the regular ' One, two, three .' Soon aU was over ; the two miuutes elapsed; only twenty heads were counted, and the House broke up, much in laughter at the luckless orator, who bad counted himself out.\" A Miscount. \u2014 A division took place in the House of Commons, May 17th, 1871, on the second reading of the Permissive Prohibitory Liquor BiU, moved by Sir Wilfrid Lawson, when the numbers were declared to be, for the second reading, 124 ; against, 206 \u2014 82. The teUers for the \"ayes\" on this occasion were Sir W. Lawson and Lord C. Hamilton; for the \" noes,\" Mr. Wheelhouse and Mr. Amphlett. On the following day Sir W. Lawson, addressing the Speaker, said : \" Yesterday, when the division took place on the second reading of the Permissive BiU, the honourable member for Leeds (Mr. Wheelhouse) gave in the numbers of the majority as 206, whereas it appears from the votes that only 196 members voted against the bill.\" At a later period of the sitting, Lord C. Hamilton (who stood before the table with Mr. Wheelhouse, addressing the Speaker) said he wished to state that the number of \" noes \" in the division was erroneously announced to be 206 instead of 196 \u2014 the latter being the number which corresponded with the division list. Alone in the Lobby. \u2014 Mr. Fawcett was incorrectly stated to have been the first member who ever appeared alone in the division lobby of the House of Commons. Mr. James Grant, however, mentions the case of a Mr. Halcomb, during the Speakership of Sir Charles Manners Sutton. The occasion on which Mr. Fawcett thus appeared was the motion for a grant of \u00a330,000 for the marriage portion of the Princess Louise, February 16, 1871. The \" ayes \" were 350 against one \" no ; \" Mr. Fawcett had for bis tellers Mr. Taylor and Sir C. Dilke. In April, 1875, Dr. Kenealy also found himself alone, on a motion concerning \"the"], [635, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 615 Claimant,\" the numbers being 1 to 433. Another case occurred in the session of 1886. A \" Glorious Minority.\" \u2014 In the House of Lords, towards the close of the last century, there was a peculiar instance of voting alone. A motion being before the House on the question of the country going to war with France, the Duke of Somerset called for a division, when he appeared alone in opposition to the motion. To commemorate his course of action, he caused a medal to be struck in honour of \" The Glorious Minority of One.\" Vote by Proxy in the Lords. \u2014 A select committee of the House of Lords having recommended that the custom of voting by proxy be abandoned, a standing order was passed (March 31, 1868), \"that the practice of caUing for proxies on a division be discontinued, and that two days' notice be given of any motion for the suspension of the order.\" Lord Malmesbury gives in his \" Memoirs\" the following letter written to him by Mr. Disraeli when this subject was under discussion : \" July 10, 1867. \u2014 My dear Malmesbury, \u2014 The Constitution of this country is a Monarchy, modified in its action by the co-ordinate authority of Estates of the Realm. An Estate is a political order invested with privilege for a public purpose. There are three Estates \u2014 the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, and the Commons. The Estates of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal being very limited in number, their members can easUy meet in their own chamber. The Estate of tho Commons being, on the contrary, very numerous, choose, for convenience, representatives instead of holding general meetings, like the Polish Diets. The House of Com mons is not an Estate of the Realm ; its members are only the proxies of an Estate. The Lords, in using proxies, possess and exercise tho same privilege as the Commons, and no more ; and if it is not convenient for them to attend the meetings of their orders, they have the right to choose their representatives.\" Lord Malmesbury adds in a note : \" This letter from Lord Beaconsfield was elicited, at my request, by the motion of the late Lord Stanhope in the House of Lords, abolishing the use of proxies. It never was debated on really constitutional grounds, but merely on that of convenience ; and the Peers appeared to have no idea of their origin, and that the custom was not a peculiar privUege or an anomaly in the Constitution.\" The House of Lords and the Ministry.\u2014 The House of Lords has many times during the present century voted adversely to the Govern ment of the day, but no division in that Chamber for upwards of a century has had the direct result of turning out one Ministry and putting in another. The last occasion on which such effect was produced by the action of the Lords was in December, 1783. Fox's East India BUI, transferring the government of British India from the Company to Com missioners to be named by the House of Commons, had passed that House in its last stages by majorities of more than two to one ; and Ministers were confident, for a whUe, of being able to carry the measure through the Lords. They were nevertheless beaten on the second reading by 95 votes to 76. \" We are not yet out,\" wrote Fox immediately after, \" but I"], [636, "616 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. suppose we shaU be to-morrow. However, we are so strong that nobody else can undertake the government without madness ; and if they do I think we shall destroy them almost as soon as they are formed.\" In this, however, he was mistaken. The King, finding Ministers slow to resign, dismissed them. The Administration which succeeded lasted for seventeen years. An Empty Lobby. \u2014 At the sitting of July 31, 1882, a resolution respecting increase of pay to certain officers of the Irish Constabulary was brought forward at a late hour. A division was challenged by Mr. Biggar, and Mr. O'Connor was named with him as second teller. The numbers were reported, 25 for the resolution, and none against ; whereupon, the necessary quorum of forty members being palpably absent, the House stood adjourned. The Voice Overrides the Vote. \u2014 On the report of the Holyrood Park Bill, in 1843, a member called out with the \"noes,\" \"The noes have it,\" and thus forced that party to a division, although he was about to vote with the \" ayes.\" On his return, his vote was claimed for the \" noes,\" and the Speaker ordered that it should be counted with them, as the member had declared himself with them in the House. Divisions in FuU Houses. \u2014 The division which overthrew Lord Derby's second Administration in June, 1859, by a majority of 13, drew together the greatest number of members ever recorded to have assembled in the House of Commons. There voted (including teUers) 637, to whom must be added the Speaker. \u2014 On the occasion of the second reading of the Reform Bill of the Russell Administration in May, 1866, the total numbers present were 636, 318 voting with the Government and 313 against. The House was this time only eleven members short of its possible number, for eleven seats were vacant; and of the absentees, two members had paired. \u2014 The division in 1864 on Mr. Disraeli's motion of censure upon Lord Palmerston's Government for his policy respecting Danish affairs, brought together 613 ; and the second reading of the Irish Church Bill iu 1S69 was decided by a House (including the Speaker) of 618. In former times, before the present facilities for travelling were brought into existence, the numbers were naturally much smaller ; but the principal divisions on the Reform Bills of 1831-32 called up respectively 608, 603, and 599 members. (See also p. 358.) Repeated Divisions in the House of Commons. \u2014 In March, 1771, the Opposition, led by Burke, divided the House twenty-four times (until four o'clock in the morning) on a proposition to caU to the bar some printers, for having published reports of Parliamentary proceedings. \u2014 In 1839, nine voters against 127 compelled sixteen divisions on the Copyright BiU. \u2014 On the 3rd of August, 1876, repeated divisions to adjourn an edu cational debate were forced by members of the Liberal party, untU at past four in the morning the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir S. Northcote) declared that he thought it was now more consistent with the dignity of the House to give way than to persevere, and himself moved the adjourn ment of the debate, in opposition to the wishes of some of his own party. While the motion for adjournment was being persisted in, a member (Mr."], [637, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 617 Sullivan) remarked that the example of this mode of Parliamentary pro cedure would not be lost on the Irish party. (See under \" Obstruction.\") Divisions in the House of Lords. \u2014 The greatest number of votes recorded in the House of Lords in the present century were given on the 4th of August, 1880. The measure before the House was the Compensa tion for Disturbance (Ireland) BiU, the second reading of which was refused by 282 against 51 ; majority 231, out of a total of 333. It was pointed out that, while only 51 Liberal members voted for the bill, 63 of the usual supporters of Mr. Gladstone's Government were found in the majority against it. \u2014 On the second reading of the Irish Church Bill, in June, 1869, the number of lords voting was 325, and the biU was carried by 179 to 146. In the latter case the pairs were eighteen, and in the former fonrteen. Ties in the House of Lords. \u2014 In August, 1883, a division took place in the House of Lords, on certain amendments by the House of Commons to the Agricultural Holdings (England) Bill. A motion to agree with these amendments was proposed by Lord Carlingford, repre senting the Government, and opposed by the Marquis of SaUsbury. There appeared \u2014 Contents, 48 ; non-contents, the same number. The Lord Chancellor hereupon said that, according to the rule of the House, he declared the non-contents had it ; but when the next motion was put \u2014 viz., to amend the amendment, as proposed by the Marquis of Salisbury \u2014 the same rule would lead to exactly the opposite result. (Laughter.) \u2014 The Duke of Buccleuch said he did not understand that. \u2014 The Lord Chancellor explained that when the numbers were equal, the House acted on the maxim, semper presumitur pro negante ; and the question was always decided in the negative. After consultation with the clerk at the table (Sir William Rose) he found that, if the House was equally divided on the next motion, it would then be his duty to put the question that the House do insist on its amendment. \u2014 The House then divided on the motion that the amendment be amended, as proposed by the Marquis of Salisbury. There appeared: Contents, 49; nou-contents, 48; majority, 1. One noble lord, who had abstained from voting in the first division, came to the support of the Marquis of Salisbury on the second. Small Audiences in the Lords.\u2014 In June, 1884, the Earl of Rosebery, in moving for a select committee to consider the best means of promoting the efficiency of the House of Lords, alluded, among other matters, to the quorum of the House, which three peers were sufficient to constitute. Their lordships, he said, could compare that somewhat inadequate number with the quorum of the House of Commons, namely, 40. He remembered a noble lord [Leitrim] addressing for four hours the noble and learned lord on the woolsack and the noble lord who had to reply. There was a still stronger case which might be legendary, but which was alleged to have occurred when Lord Lyndhurst was on the woolsack. A noble and learned lord was addressing the House on a point of no great public interest, and Lord Lyndhurst, who was anxious to go to dinner, became most impatient as the hands of the clock pointed nearer and nearer to eight. He kept looking at his"], [638, "618 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. watch, and perhaps feigned sleep, but to no purpose. At last he said, \" This is too bad ; cannot you stop ? By Jove, if you don't stop I wiU count you out \" \u2014 which was a threat well within the competency of the noble and learned lord, because he and the speaker were the only peers present at the time. Measures Passed by Small Majorities. \u2014 In advocating the first of his Procedure Resolutions, which provided for the closure of debate on tbe vote of a bare majority (see p. 606), Mr. Gladstone adduced the following facts in support of his argument : \" There is but one sound prin ciple in this House, and that is that the majority of the House shaU prevail. The whole of our proceedings are founded upon it ; and what consequences have followed? A majority of five threw out the Melbourne Government in 1839 ; a majority of five threw out Lord John RusseU's Government in 1866 ; a majority of three threw out the Government of which I had the honour to be the head in 1873 ; a majority of two brought in the Public Education Act; a majority of one threw out the Government of Lord Melbourne, or at least caused the dissolution of Parliament in 1841. A majority of one carried the Reform Bill of 1832, when, if that majority had been the other way, unquestionably whatever bill was passed would have been of an entirely different character. A resolution even more important was that brought forward by Mr. Pitt in the Act of Union in 1799. An amendment adverse to that Act was proposed ; 105 voted for the amendment, and 106 voted for the Act of Union ; and thus by a majority of one was carried one of the largest, most important, and most remarkable changes ever accomplished by a legislative body.\" Ministry Voting with Opposition. \u2014 A very remarkable division occurred in the session of 1884. The Government had been asked by the Opposition to assign a day on which a vote of censure might be brought forward respecting Egyptian affairs ; and, as usual iu such cases, had done so. Accordingly, on the 30th of June Mr. Gladstone, as Prime Minister, rose to move \" that the orders of the day be postponed \" until the notice concerning Egypt had been disposed of. Mr. Forster (at the time out of office, and acting independently) hereupon interposed with the remark that the discussion would apparently be highly inconvenient at that par ticular time, although, said he, \"we have all collected together for a great party fight, and any gentleman who tried to prevent it would be in the position of one trying to prevent a prize-fight.\" Mr. Gladstone having admitted that he considered the proposed discussion \" most inopportune and dangerous,\" Mr. Goschen took the same line as Mr. Forster, and remarked that the House would best do its duty by refusing to postpone the orders of the day, although the Government had been bound to afford the desired opportunity. A division was taken, when there appeared \u2014 For Mr. Gladstone's motion, 148; against it, 190. The members of the Government voted in the same lobby with the Opposition, while most of their supporters were included in the majority which defeated tho Minis terial motion. \u2014 The matter was made a subject of comment by the Marquis of Salisbury a few nights after in the House of Lords. He said : \" It is curious that Mr. Gladstone's personal influence and example should not"], [639, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 619 have been able to draw any of his f oUowers after him into the lobby. The contagion of mad rebellion seems to have seized them all, and those who never rebelled before, on this occasion lifted up their heels against their master. It is very mysterious to those who only look on the reported circumstances of the case. I am told, on good authority, that the two gentlemen whose function it is to marshal the forces of the Government [the Junior Lords of the Treasury] were, during that division, at the door of the lobby into which the Government and the Opposition went, and that, when asked by Liberal members which way they were to go, instead of replying with enthusiasm, as might be expected, ' Of course you are to follow Mr. Gladstone,' they immediately replied, ' The bulk of the party is going the other way.' And it is remarkable that after that, the party voted against Mr. Gladstone in sufficient numbers to neutralise his formal vote, and to give effect to his expressed opinions.\" (Laughter.) \"Blocking\" Bills and Motions. \u2014 A standing order of the House of Commons (1879) forbade the bringing on of opposed bills and motions after half -past twelve at night ; and notice of opposition to such measures was therefore sufficient to limit the opportunity for their dis cussion to the earlier part of tho proceedings, frequently consumed by other business. Members antagonistic to a particular biU customarily placed such notice of opposition on the paper, and this was termed \" blocking.\" In the session of 1882 the practice became very frequent, and members adopted it in retaliatiSn for similar opposition given either to their own motions or those of their friends. Hence, sometimes, such cross-firing as that mentioned in the foUowing paragraph from a daily newspaper of July, 1882: \"Mr. Labouchere has put down for Tuesday next his motion that Mr. Salt's select committee on Canals be nominated, aud that Mr. Bradlaugh be on the committee. This having been blocked by Colonel Makins, Mr. Labouchere has countered by blocking every unopposed return moved by a Conservative, which has been responded to by Viscount Folkestone blocking every unopposed return moved for by a Liberal. As Mr. Labouchere refuses to withdraw his blocks unless Col. Makins takes off his, and as Viscount Folkestone refuses to take off his so long as those of Mr. Labouchere are maintained, no return wiU be moved for from either side of the House so long as Mr. Labouchere's committee is blocked by Colonel Makins.\" (See also p. 501.) An Ancient Usage Set Aside.\u2014 Mr. Trevelyan mentions (\" Early Life of Fox \") that the substitution of English for the ancient usage of Latin in the names of days on Parliamentary papers\u2014\" Thursday,\" for instance, for \" Die Jovis,\" &c\u2014 was the first act of the first House of Commons that was led by Mr. Gladstone. The change was made, by unanimous consent, in February, 1866. Proposed Alteration of the Session.\u2014 In the summer of 1883, Mr. Broadhurst asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether he would consider the desirability of dividing the session into two sittiugs, com mencing the first week in March aud the third week in October respectively; and whether, if he had any doubt as to the advisabiUty of advising this change, he would take steps to ascertain the general opinion"], [640, "620 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. of the House on the question. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone in reply said : \" I under stand this question in substance to be, whether it is deemed expedient that we should revert to the old practice which prevailed at the beginning of the present century and some time afterwards, that Parliament, should sit late in the autumn and take a considerable vacation at Christmas. That question has been a good deal discussed in private, but not very much in the House \u2014 at least not, I think, very recently. I think, however, it is plainly a question for the members of the House themselves in the main, and it will probably be the duty of the Government to consider any definite indication of their opinion on the subject ; but not to raise the question themselves, unless they feel satisfied that the desire of the House is in favour of the change.\" Prevention of Crowds at Westminster Hall. \u2014 To facilitate the attendance of members without interruption, both Houses order, at the commencement of each session, \" That the Commissioners of the Police of the metropolis do take care that, during the session of Parliament, the passages through tbe streets leading to the house be kept free and open, and that no obstruction be permitted to hinder the passage of the lords (or members) to and from this house ; and that no disorder be allowed in Westminster Hall, or in the passages leading to this house during the sitting of Parliament ; and that there be no annoyance therein or thereabouts ; and that the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod (or the Serjeant-at-Arms attending this House) do communicate this order to tho commissioners aforesaid.\"* Limitation of Privilege to Petition. \u2014 At the opening of the session in February, 1883, a demonstration was held in Trafalgar Square in favour of Mr. Bradlaugh being allowed to take his seat. On this occasion the customary privilege of ten voters of any constituency being aUowed to present a petition through their member was set aside by the Serjeant-at-Arms, and not more than three members of any delegate body were permitted to enter the precincts of the House. The Chartist Petition of 1848.\u2014 On the 10th of April the Houses of Parliament (says the Annual Register) were filled with police, and, for the preservation of the peace, the streets were guarded by 170,000 special constables. The petition, which was to have been carried in procession from Kennington Common to Westminster, was transported by the less ostentatious medium of several cabs. Feargus O'Connor, in presenting it to the House, stated that it bore 5,706,000 signatures ; but a strict scrutiny reduced these figures to the still very respectable total of 1,900,000. The Marquis of Lansdowne, in answer to a question in the House of Lords, said, \" The meeting which was attempted to be held to-day on Kennington Common was dispersed by the police only, without the assistance or even the presence of a single soldier.\" Lord Brouriiani held that \"those meetings that are called, whether in England or in Ireland, ' monster meetings,' are, in themselves, essentially illegal.\" (See p. 241.) * See also p. 407, \" Presenting Public Petitions.\""], [641, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 621 A Monster Petition. \u2014 On the assembling of the House of Com mons on the 26th of June, 1890, members were surprised to find almost the entire space between the table and the bar occupied by a monster petition, said to contain more than 600,000 signatures of inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland, in favour of the Local Taxation Bill then before the House, and which related to the brewers' interests. The document was presented by Mr. Wharton, the member for Ripon ; it was said to be eight miles in length, and was contained in three enormous wooden cylinders, each about 7ft. in diameter. These cases were ranged one after the other along the floor of tho House, and the contents were supplemented by two or three rolls of petitions, presumably too late to be included with the others, and lying on the floor just above the bar. The cylinders were of such a height that members below the gangway, even when standing up, were unable to see gentlemen on the opposite side of the floor ; and several complaints were made during the transaction of private business, which precedes the presentation of petitions. In answer to one, the Speaker said he would direct the officers of the House to remove the obstruction, and perhaps the House would be satisfied that the petition had been presented. (Laughter.) It would be properly examined by the Committee on Petitions. This being done some days after, the committee reported that \" in the petition presented on June 26 by Mr- Wharton from the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland, many of the signatures are in the same handwriting, some names are fictitious, and a very small number are obscene ; and they are of opinion that the orders of the House have not been complied with.\" Harsh Treatment of Petitioners. \u2014 The Kentish Petition. Mr. W. C. Townsend gives the following account of the incidents attending the presentation of this petition in 1701. A large portion of the nation were irritated against the House of Commons for their factious disputes with the Lords, some of whom they impeached without pro ceeding in the impeachment, and for their unreasonable jealousies of William III. The leading gentry of Kent discussed these grievances at the Maidstone Easter sessions, and drew up a petition expressing their hope \" that no pretence whatsoever shaU be ablo to create a misunder standing among ourselves, or the least distrust of his most sacred Majesty, whoso Teat actions for this nation are writ in the hearts of his subjects, and can never, without the blackest ingratitude, be forgotten ; \" with more to similar effect. The petition was drawn up by Mr. William Colepepper, the chairman, and signed by twenty-three of his brother magistrates, twenty-one of the grand jury, and a number of free holders, whose signatures in five hours completely covered tho parch ment. Five of the leading gentry of the county repaired to the House with the petition. As they were waiting in the lobby, Mr. Meredith, one of the county members, came out and informed them of the extra ordinary excitement into which its arrival had thrown the House ; Mr. How saying, if there were 100.000 hands to this petition, they should be all made examples of ; and Sir Edward Seymour threatening that the whole county should bo doubly taxed, and the estates of those who presented"], [642, "622 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the petition confiscated. The country gentlemen stood their ground undaunted. Their leader, Colepepper, applied to himself the saying of Luther to those who would have dissuaded him from entering Worms, that \" if every rile on the roof of the chapel of St. Stephen's were a devil he would present this petition \u2014 that if none of the members would do their country so much service as to present their grievances to Parliament, embodied in a legal petition, they would knock at the door of the House, and deliver it themselves.\" A member at length having ventured to rise with the obnoxious document, the Speaker declared that it was the usage of the House, when a petition was presented, that the persons who brought it ought to be ready with it to justify its contents. The little band of patriots were accordingly called to the bar and addressed by the Speaker, Mr. Harley, They were asked if they owned the petition, and having acknowledged it, were directed to withdraw and expect the order of the House. They were detained in the lobby five hours, and their fears played upon by a message from Sir Edward Seymour, that Mr. How was then speaking, and would continue to speak for some time, to give them time for repentance, and by a timely acknowledgment to save themselves from ruin. The House, finding at length that the petitioners were not to be subdued by menaces, \"resolved that their petition was scandalous, insolent, and seditious, tending to destroy the constitution of Parliament, and to subvert the established government of these realms.\" As a natural sequel to this fiery resolution, the House ordered that the petitioners be committed to Newgate, where they lingered tiU the prorogation on June 23rd \u2014 a period of two months. Fabrication of Signatures to Petitions. \u2014 On the 23rd of June, 1887, one Reginald Bidmead was brought to the bar of the House of Commons in the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and, in accordance with a resolution of the House, was reprimanded by the Speaker for having fabricated signatures to petitions on the Coal and Wine Duties payable in the City of London. The Speaker in conveying the reprimand said : \" The special select committee reported that the case against you, Reginald Bidmead, was complete. You have forged \u2014 by your own confession in a letter to me \u2014 1600 or 1700 signatures to petitions. You have done this with a cynical and reckless disregard of the discredit which by your action you were bringing upon the great right of petitioning the House of Commons. For similar offences to yours men have been committed to Newgate, not in ancient times, but in quite recent times, and in the memory of many honourable members now occupying seats in this House. . . The House has taken a lenient view of the punishment to be awarded. They have not committed you to prison, but they have ordered me, as Speaker of this House, to reprimand you; and I do accordingly reprimand you. You will leave this House under its severe censure, and under the stigma of its strong disapprobation.\" \u2014 Mr. W. H. Smith moved that what the Speaker had said be entered upon the journals of the House. \u2014 Mr. Childers seconded, and the motion was agreed to. Parliamentary Precedent. \u2014 An ex-Speaker Defending Himself at the Bar. \u2014 On the occasion of the Lord Keeper Finch"], [643, "PARLIAMENTARY USAGES, ETC. 623 being heard at the bar to answer the charges of treason preferred against him, in December, 1640, a discussion arose prior to his entrance, respecting the formalities that should be observed. The \" Note-book of Sir John Northcote \" shows the studious attention of the House on the occasion to form and precedent. The following are the entries : \" Clerk to take notes of Lord Keeper's speech. A chair to sit on, and stool to lay the purse. \u2014 Sir S. D'Ewes : De la Poole Duke of Suffolk came into the House without either, and came within the bar. \u2014 Sir R. Pye : That before he be condemned that honour is to be done to the seal. \u2014 Sir G. Gerard : That when Lord Southampton came they stood till Mr. Speaker gave order for stool, and that he might be covered by direction of House. \u2014 Mr. ControUer : That chair be set, and left to his discretion how to demean himself. \u2014 Sir J. Strangways and Mr. Hollis : That no chair be placed tUl he come in and desire to speak. \u2014 Mr. D. : To place a chair on left, and that the mace may stand on right.\" Sir Simon D'Ewes records what followed: \"The serjeant came in before him (Finch), and he brought the purse with the great seal in it himself, and, having made three reverences, he laid the purse on the chair, and stood by it, leaning his left hand on it, and so be made a long and well-composed speech. Before he began the Speaker said, ' Your lordship may sit down if you please.' But he spake standing, and so, having ended his speech, after a reverence made, took up the purse and departed.\" He departed secretly out of the countiy immediately after. Thanks of Parliament to Schomberg and Wellington.\u2014 Macaulay relates the following : \" The House of Commons (in 1689) had, with general approbation, compensated Schomberg's losses and rewarded his services by a grant of a hundred thousand pounds. Before he set out for Ireland, he requested permission to express his gratitude for this magni ficent present. A chair was set for him within the bar. He took his seat there with the mace at his right hand, rose, and in a few graceful words returned his thanks and took his leave. The Speaker replied that the Commons could never forget the obligation under which they already lay to his grace, that they saw him with pleasure at the head of an English army, that they felt entire confidence in his zeal and ability, and that, at whatever distance he might be, he would always be in a peculiar manner an object of their care. The precedent set on this interesting occasion was followed with the utmost minuteness, a hundred and twenty-five years later, on an occasion more interesting still. Exactly on the same spot on which, in July, 1689, Schomberg had acknowledged the liberality of the nation, a chair was set, in July, 1814, for a stiU more illustrious warrior, who came to return thanks for a stiU more splendid mark of public gratitude. Few things illustrate more strikingly the peculiar character of the English government and people than the circumstance that the House of Commons, a popular assembly, should, even in a moment of joyous enthusiasm, have adhered to ancient forms with the punctilious accuracy of a College of Heralds; that the sitting and rising, the covering and the uncovering, should have been regulated by exactly the same etiquette in the nineteenth century as in the seventeenth;"], [644, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 624 and that the same mace which had been held at the right hand of Schom berg should have been held in the same position at the right hand of Wellington.\" Thanks of the House to General Fairfax. \u2014 Speaker Lenthal, in the course of his speech giving the thanks of the House to General Fairfax in 1646, made use of the foUowing high-flown phrases : \" Here tofore, when I read the histories of the acts of famous princes and warriors in this or other nations, it was not without some jealousy that in them there was some mixture and glosses of oratory and art, the more to set off aud give lustre to their acts as arguments of emulation for others to follow the footsteps of their virtues ; but the actions of your excellency will add lustre aud belief to them, being all verified in you. And, indeed, here considering the swift marches, and the expedition of those grand and difficult attempts, which were prosecuted and effected by your excellency, I may say the Almighty came riding on the wings of the wind ; for these were nothing else but the Magnolia Dei, acted in and by you, his instrument.\" An Admiral on his Beam-ends. \u2014 Vice-Admiral Sir Alan, after- wards Lord Gardner, being at the time member for Plymouth, was to receive the thanks of the House, in his place in Parliament, for his share in the naval victory obtained over the French on the 1st of June, 1794. \" On the day appointed, before the commencement of business \" (says Dean Pellew in his \"Life of Sidmouth\"), \"he entered the Speaker's private room in great agitation, and expressed his apprehensions that ho should fail in properly acknowledging the honour which he was about to receive. ' I have often been to the cannon's mouth,' he said, ' but hang me if I ever felt as I do now ! I have not slept these three nights. Look at my tongue.' The Speaker rang for a bottle of Madeira, and Sir Alan took a glass. After a short rime he took a second, and then said he felt somewhat better ; but when the moment of trial arrived, and one of the bravest of a gaUant profession, whom no personal danger could appal, rose to reply to the Speaker, he could scarcely articulate. He was encouraged by enthusiastic cheers from all parts of the House ; but, after stammering out, with far more than the usual amount of truth, that ' he was overpowered by the honour that had been conferred upon him,' and vainly attempting to add a few more words, he relinquished the idea as hopeless, and abruptly resumed his seat amidst a renewed burst of cheers.\" The \" Garter \" in the Commons. \u2014 Horace Walpole writes in 1772: \"Lord North is likely to have tho Duke of Saxe-Gotha's vacant garter, the only one, except my father's, that has shone in the House of Commons since Queen Elizabeth's days.\" North had the garter, which has since but rarely been bestowed on statesmen sitting in the Lower House. A notable instance was that of Lord Palmerston. It was offered to the younger Pitt and to Sir Robert Peel, but declined by both."], [645, "VARIETIES. 625 VARIETIES. Cats and Parliaments. \u2014 Charles I. said that Parliaments are like cats ; they grow curst [sour-tempered] with age. \u2014 Hallam's \" Constitu tional History.\" Parliaments compared to Manna. \u2014 In a debate on the Triennial Bill in 1693, a speaker amused the House with the following argument in support of the measure: \"Parliaments resembled the manna which God bestowed on the chosen people. They were excellent while they were fresh ; but if kept too long they became noisome, and foul worms were engendered by the corruption of that which had been sweeter than honey.\" A Figurative and a Literal Dissolution. \u2014 Lord Chief Justice North dined with the Duke of Lauderdalo at Ham (says Roger North in his \"Life of Guilford\"), when \"both these counsellors were as blown deer, and would be glad to have the Parliament dissolved ; of which, to say the truth, the whole nation was weary. And at this time the frost was very sharp, and the company at dinner complained of cold. The duke turned round, and, looking back towards tho window, said, ' There wiU be a thaw soon.' None at the table but his lordship guessed at his meaning. And so he intended it ; for he knew that the Parliament would in a few days be dissolved, but his lordship did not, till he guessed so from that sentence of the duke's ; and it proved accordingly. And so the duke dis covered and at the same time kept the grand secret, which was a fine turn of a politician.\" Parliamentary Secession.* \u2014 At one period, under the Govern ment of Lord North (1777), Fox and his friends, findingthemselves unable to take effectual action against the Ministry, seceded from the parlia mentary discussion of public measures. On this subject Earl Russell remarks (\" Life of Fox \") : \" The general question of parliamentary secession is one of considerable importance and no slight difficulty. It is sanctioned by the precedents of Pulteney in the time of Sir Robert Walpole, of Burke in the period of which we are treating, and of Fox and Grey during the French revolutionary war. The principle of secession, indeed, is not easily defended ; for to what end are men chosen representatives of the people if they refrain from voting on the interests of the people, irrespective of the views of other representa tives ? On the other hand, it must be admitted that practically a Minister gains strength from the repetition of fruitless attempts to overthrow his policy. The publicity of debate gives appearance of fairness to the contest, and the country is apt to rest satisfied with a verdict pronounced after argument heard, evidence weighed, and authority examined. It may, therefore, be practically expedient to retire for a season from opposition to a policy which is deliberately approved, though in error, by tho Crown, the Parliament, and the nation. But however advisable a * See also page 14, \"Secession of Members from the Commons.\" S S"], [646, "626 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. total secession may be, there could be no greater mistake than a partial, fitful, and capricious withdrawal from public business. It has the air of a loss of temper rather than the silent reserve of dignity or the calm patience of wisdom. This was, however, the course which the Rocking ham Whigs pursued. The suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act being announced, Lord Rockingham held a meeting to consider whether tho Whigs should return to oppose it. Lord Rockingham himself, Burke, aud the Cavendishes acUiered to secession, but Charles Fox would not agree ; and he accordingly, on the second reading, attended to oppose the suspension.\" Parliamentary Obstruction. \u2014 In the House of Commons on the 2nd of July, 1877, the tactics of obstruction were developed to a large extent, In committee a vote for the Army Reserve force was met by Mr. O'Connor Power, member for Mayo, with a motion to report progress ; and, although only eight voted with the Irish member and 128 against, the motions that progress be reported, and that the Chair - mau do leave the chair, were together repeated seventeen times ; after which the House was counted out, at a quarter-past seven in the morning. \u2014 On the 25th of the same month, the Chancellor of the Ex chequer (Sir Stafford Northcote) moved the suspension for two day3 of Mr. ParneU, then member for Meath, for having \" wilfully and persis tently obstructed public business ; \" and on the 27th Sir S. Northcote moved a new rule, that \" When a member has been declared out of order, and is pronounced to be disregarding the authority of the Chair, a motion that he be not heard during the remainder of the debate or the committee may be put without debate, after the member complained of has been heard in explanation.\" This was carried by a large majority, as well as another rule, that no member shall twice move in the same committee that the Chairman report progress or leave the chair. \u2014 On the 31st of the month, when a twenty-six hours' sitting occurred (p. 603), it was in contemplation between the leaders of both sides of the House to support a proposal for the suspension of certain Irish members from participation in the debates, when they suddenly ceased the opposition they had been pursuing, and the business was finally got through. The \"Barricade\" of Obstruction.\u2014 Speaking at the Cutlers' Feast at Sheffield in September, 1879, Lord George Hamilton (Vice- President of the Committee of Council on Education) said: \"During the past session we have had exceptional difficulties to contend with. No matter in what direction the Government attempted to move, they were invariably met by a barricade of Parliamentary obstruction. It is quite true that those barricades were only manned by a very few gentlemen ; but it is obvious that they were planned and designed by a considerable number more, who took very good care to keep in the background. Now, I must do the gentlemen from Ireland the justice to say that they are per fectly frank as to their intentions, and these intentions are to make such a use of the forms of the House of Commons as will enable them to extort something from the majority which they otherwise could not get ; and tho something which they want to attain is the repeal of the union between England and Ireland. . . I think Parliamentary government is dear"], [647, "VARIETIES. 627 to every Englishman ; but it is perfectly clear that if the practices of the past session increase in subsequent sessions, it wiU be almost impossible to carry on the present system of government.\" Measures Against Obstruction.\u2014 Further rules designed to check obstruction were passed in February, 1880. The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir S. Northcote) then moved, \" That, whenever any member shall have been named by the Speaker, or by the Chairman of a Committee of the whole House, as disregarding the authority of the Chair, or abusing the rules of the House by persistently and wilfuUy obstructing the business of the House or otherwise, then, if the offence has been committed in the House, the Speaker shall forthwith put the question on a motion being made, no amendment, adjournment, or debate being allowed, ' That such member be suspended from the service of the House during the remainder of that day's sitting ; ' and if the offence has been committed in a Committee of the whole House, the Chairman shall, ou a motion being made, put the same question in a similar way, and, if the motion is carried, shall forthwith suspend the proceedings of the Com mittee, and report the circumsiance to the House ; and the Speaker shall thereupon put the same question, without amendment, adjournmeut, or debate, as if the offence had been committed in the House itself. If any member be suspended three times in one session under this order, his suspension on the third occasion shaU continue for one week, and untU a motion has been made, upon which it shall be decided at one sitting by the House whether the suspension shall then cease, or for what longer period it shall continue ; and on the occasion of such motion the member may, if he desires it, be heard in his place.\" After long debate, this was agreed to, without division, as a standing order ; but au alteration of the rule, in the direction of greater stringency, was included among the Procedure Resolutions proposed by Mr. Gladstone in 1882. Suspension of Irish Members.\u2014 On the 3rd of February, 1881, when Mr. Gladstone's resolution respecting \" urgency \" was about to be brought forward, Mr. ParneU rose to ask whether Mr. Michael Davitt had been arrested that day, and was informed by Sir W. V. Harcourt that the person named had been arrested for breach of the conditions of his ticket-of-leave. The Speaker then called upon Mr. Gladstone, who commenced his address ; when Mr. DiUon (M.P. for Tipperary) interrupted, aud was named by the Speaker, according to the rule of February, 1880, for disregarding the authority of the Chair. His suspension for the sitting was then voted by 395 to 33; but Mr. Dillon declined to leave the House at the summons of the Serjeant-at-Arms, nntil that official had been joined by five messengers, when the member for Tipperary left, declaring that he yielded to force only. Mr. Gladstone again commenced his address, when Mr. ParneU moved \"that the right honourable gentleman be no further heard,\" and insisted upon his motion being put ; until he was at length named by tho Speaker, and suspended by 405 to 7, the Home Rule members refusing to join in the division. Mr. Parnell was then removed, as Mr. Dillon had been before him ; and Mr. Gladstone was about to resume what he termed \" the unfortunate s s 2"], [648, "628 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. sentence that had been bisectod and trisected,\" when Mr. Finigan rose to move that he be no longer heard, and was suspended after the same formalities as before. The Home Rule members again declining to take part in the division, after being cautioned by the Speaker, were then named as disregarding his authority, and their suspension was voted by 410 to 6. The names being read from a list furnished by one of the teUers (Lord R. Grosvenor), twenty-eight members were successively removed from the house; and Mr. Gladstone being still interrupted as before, four more members were suspended, making, with the three origi nally removed, a total of thirty-five. Mr. Gladstone's resolution was then proceeded with. \u2014 Sixteen of the Irish members were collectively named by the Chairman of Committees (Dr. Lyon Pbryfair) for continued obstruc tion, on the 1st of July, 1882, during a prolonged sitting which began on the previous day. They were suspended, according to the rule of February, 1880 (p. 627^) ; and nine more afterwards incurred the same penalty for further obstructive proceedings. The House had before it the Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Bill. When the sixteen were named, Mr. O'Dounell, one of the number, characterised tho proceeding as \" an infamy,\" for which he was called to account at the following sitting, and suspended for fourteen days. A motion to erase the record of suspension as to four of the sixteen , on the ground that they were not in the House at the time, was brought forward by Mr. Cowen (member for Newcastle) some weeks afterwards, and gave rise to an adjourned debate, the resumption of which was neg-atived without a division. Smallness of the Obstructive Party. \u2014 In his speech on the Urgency Resolution,* Mr. Gladstone alluded to it as a mode of \" meeting the resources of that new art \u2014 the latest invention of the nineteenth century \u2014 known as Obstruction,\" and pointed out that this obstruction arose from a small section of the House. He said : \" I object to the prac tice into which we have fallen, of speaking of ' the Irish members.' When we examine into figures, we find that this has not been done even by the Irish members, unless by the term you mean a minority of Irish members. The party which is responsible for these things cannot, by any licence of calculation, be extended beyond the number of forty-six. These forty-six members alone have brought about a position of affairs fatal to the honour, the duties, and the efficiency of Parliament.\" (See Mr. Disraeli's remarks. on the possibilities of Obstruction, p. 325.) Mr. Gladstone's Resolution on Urgency. \u2014 In the official record of votes and proceedings of the House of Commons for the 3rd of February, 1881, the following appeared as the amended text of Mr. Glad stone's resolution, passed at that sitting-: \" Resolved, that if, upon notice given, a motion be made by a Minister of the Crown that the state of public business is urgent, upon which motion such Minister shaU declare in his place that any bill, motion, or other question then before tho House is urgent, and that it is of importance to the public interest that the same should be proceeded with without delay, the Speaker shall forthwith put * See p. 374, &e."], [649, "VARIETIES. 629 the question, no debate, amendment, or adjournment being allowed ; and if, on the voices being given, he shall without doubt perceive that the Noes have it, his decision shall not be challenged, but if otherwise, a division may be forthwith taken, and if the question be resolved in the affirmative by a majority of not less than three to one in a House of not less than 300 members, the powers of the House for the regulation of its business upon tho several stages of bills, and upon motions and all other \u25a0matters, shall be and remain with the Speaker, for the purpose of proceed- ing with such bill, motion, or other question, until the Speaker shaU \u25a0 declare that the state of public business is no longer urgent, or until the House shall so determine, upon a motion which, after notice given, may be made by any member, put without amendment, adjournment, or debate, and decided by a majority.\" As this resolution was only a sessional order, it ceased to take effect at the end of the session in which it was passed ; but was revived on the motion of Mr. Gladstone, in July of the foUowing year, for the passage of the Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Bill, which had long been deferred by the obstructive tactics of Irish members. Mr. Speaker Brand's New Rules. \u2014 In consequence of the passage \u25a0of Mr. Gladstone's Urgency Resolution in 1881, the Speaker, on taking the chair the following afternoon, thus addressed tho House : \" By a \u25a0resolution passed this day, the House has entrusted to me great and unpre- cedented powers. I accept them with a grave sense of the responsibility imposed upon me. . . In a few days I propose to lay before tho House certain rules for the regulation of its business while the state of public business continues to bo urgent. In the meantime I have thought proper at once to frame a rule which is necessary to insure the uninter- rupted progress of the urgent measure now before us.* That rule is in the following- terms : ' That no motion for tho adjournment of the House shall bo made, except by leave of the House, before the orders of the day or notices of motion have been dealt with.' \" \u2014 In accordance -with tho intimation here given, the Speaker laid on the table, during the following week, a series of rules for the regulation of business during \"urgency.\" Among the most important of these rides was tho fifth, reviving an ancient power (Rule of April 14, &c, 1604) which had long fallen into disuse: \"That Mr. Speaker may call the attention of tho House to continued irrelevance or tedious repetition on the part of a member, and may direct the member to discontinue his speech.\" Another rule placed the same power in the hands of the Chairman of Committees. It was also provided that where twenty members did not rise in their place to support a motion, the House should not be called on to divide upon it. At tho sitting of Friday, March 11, the Peace Preservation (Ireland) Act having been passed, the Speaker, in pursuance of the resolution of February, declared that tho state of public business was no longer urgent, and the new rules consequently fell into abeyance for the time. They were brought forward again on the 3rd of July, 1882, when \" urgency \" was again voted, as above mentioned. * The Protection of Person and Property (Ireland) Bill."], [650, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 630 \" Urgency \" Refused.\u2014 At the sitting of March 14, 1881, Mr. Gladstone rose to propose \" urgency \" for sittings of Supply, but was met with loud cries of \" No ! \" The question being put to the vote, it was found there were 296 for Mr. Gladstone's proposal, and 212 against. The Government, therefore, failing to gain the necessary majority of three to one, were beaten for the first time that session in the House of Commons, and the result was loudly cheered by their opponents. Mr. Gladstone remarked that the House would now be ruled by the minority \u2014 (\" Oh, oh ! \") \u2014 but the Government would accept the vote with acquiescence, and, now that urgency had been refused, he hoped there woidd not be obstruction to Supply. \u2014 Sir Richard Cross and Mr. O'DonneU withdrew motions standing in their names, rather, as they said, than embarrass her Majesty's Government at this juncture ; and, presently, the little that remained of the previously crowded House went into Committee of Supply. A \" Degradation.\" \u2014 In committee on the Irish Land Bill, July 14, 1881, after many obstructive proceedings on the part of Irish members, Mr. Gladstone said, he had sat there patiently, night after night, witnessing, with a pain which could not be described, the degradation which had been inflicted by a small handful of members upon that noble assembly \u2014 (loud cheers) \u2014 which, for generations, had had for its main study the adapting of every one of its arrangements to defending the rights of minorities, to securing the liberty of speech, and to preventing oppression by numbers against those who might think they had reason on their side. They had seen every one of those admirable rules systematically perverted, for the sake of intercepting, by mere persistence and by words multiplied without reason or attempt at persuasion, the deliberate convictions of the House, and of taking its legislative functions out of the hands of the great mass of its members in order to place them within the power of a minority. That was the state of things in which the House bad to determine whether it would succumb to the attempts which had been made from such a quarter, in such a spirit, and with such unblushing openness, or whether it would that night assert and vindicate those lawful rights against the unworthy efforts by which they were sought to be defeated and destroyed. \u2014 Sir Richard Cross, rising soon after, said, for his own part he felt bound to endorse every word that had fallen from the Prime Minister in regard to the course which had been taken by that small fraction of the Irish Party \u2014 for it was the greatest possible mistake to say that it represented the Irish Party as a whole. If conduct like that of which he now complained went on, he should hold, in the terms of the standing order of the House, that it amounted to wilful obstruction. (Cheers.) Pertinacity. \u2014 In the session of 1881, which lasted altogether 154 days, among the Irish members Mr. Healy attracted the attention of the Speaker or of the Chairman of Committees on 591 occasions ; Mr. Biggar, 456 ; Mr. T. P. O'Connor, 390 ; Mr. ParneU, 380 ; Mr. A. O'Connor ; Mr. CaUan, 348; Mr. A. M. Sullivan, 224; Mr. O'DonneU, 207; Mr. Leaniy, 193 ; Major Nolan, 166 ; Mr. Dawson, 155 ; Sir J. M'Kenna, 125 ; Mr. Mitchell Henry, 119 ; and Mr. Finigan, 116. Thus 3828 speeches^"], [651, "VARIETIES. \u00a331 to which separate paragraphs are devoted in the pages of \"Hansard,\" were delivered by fourteen Irish members. Strong Words. \u2014 An extraordinary scene occurred in that sitting of extraordinary incidents, Jan. 31 to Feb. 2, 1881. At two o'clock on the second morning, a Home Rule motion for the adjournment of the House had been defeated by 197 to 22, when Mr. Biggar rose to bring forward what he termed a question of privilege. Another member (Mr. Milbank) had, he remarked, crossed the floor and informed him that he was \" an impudent scoundrel.\" What followed was thus described in the Standard report : \" So far from being shocked at this, the House broke out into roars of laughter. These matured into approving cries of ' Hear, hear ; ' where upon Mr. Biggar, in a compassionate tone, pitied Mr. Milbank and his friends for being proud of inflicting on him a Parliamentary outrage. Mr. Milbank, he explained, laboured under the hallucination that he (Mr. Biggar) had applied to him an offensive expression\u2014 had, in fact, as it afterwards turned out, called him a ' fool.' Mr. Biggar assured the House that he had not even had time to form an opinion as to whether Mr. Milbank was or was not what he was alleged to have called him. As is always the case when personality is introduced, the House quickened into a state of feverish excitement. Dr. Playfair (Chairman of Committee) met the emergency by saying that if the expression was used it was contrary to rule. Mr. Milbank admitted that he did call Mr. Biggar an ' impudent scoundrel ' \u2014 an admission which was again greeted with sympathetic laughter by the House \u2014 but, argued Mr. JY] ilbank, there was provocation, for he distinctly heard Mr. Biggar designate him by tho opprobrious epithet alluded to. Dr. Playfair stilled the uproar, and pointed out that, as Mr. Milbank admitted that he had used bad words, he must apologise ; and Mr. Milbank did apologise, but asked whether Mr. Biggar ought not also to be dealt with. The latter, however, had not put in a plea of guilty, and Dr. Playfair declared the incident at an end.\" Suspensions for Unseemly Language. \u2014 In the session of 18S7, Mr Timothy Healy, member for North Longford, was twice suspended for violent language, on the first occasion (in April) for a week, for calling Colonel Saunderson a liar. In the following July, the House being iu committee on the Irish Land Bill, circumstances arose which led the Chairman (Mr. Courtney) to send for the Speaker, to whom he reported that, when leaving the House for a division, Mr. De Lisle, member for Loughborough, had remonstrated with the Chairman that he had not been allowed to make a certain explanation. While doing so, the member for North Longford approached from the back, and, addressing the member for Loughborough, said, \"Come out, if you are a man. If you interrupt me again I wiU break your neck.\" The Chairman then referred it to the Speaker to deal with the matter. \u2014 Mr. Healy, being called upon for an explanation, declined to express regret for what had occurred ; he was consequently named by the Speaker, and, ou the motion of Mr. W. H- Smith, was suspended from the service of the House for a fortnight, in accordance with the rule relating to suspensions. The penalty for a thud or subsequent offence, under the same rule, was one month."], [652, "632 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Abusive Language in the Commons. \u2014 The following is the text of an entry that appeared in the \" Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons,\" respecting an incident which occurred in the course of a debate on Privilege (Mr. Dillon v. the Times newspaper) on the 6th of May, 1887: \" Mr. De Lisle, member for Mid-Leicestershire, rose to order, and stated that Dr. Tanner, member for Mid-Cork, standing below the bar, had caUed the members sitting near Mr. De Lisle on the right side of the House ' a damned set of cads.' \u2014 Mr. Speaker directed the words to be taken down by the clerk, and called on the honourable member for Mid- Cork to resume his place. The words were taken down accordingly. \u2014 Mr. Speaker caUed on Dr. Tanner to offer an explanation regarding the words taken down. \u2014 Dr. Tanner stated that he had not used the word ' damned,' but, in the course of his explanation, repeated the rest of the words complained of. \u2014 Mr. Speaker called upon Dr. Tanner to withdraw the words, and to apologise to the House for having used them. Where upon Dr. Tanner withdrew the words and made his apology to the House.\" An Unparliamentary Word. \u2014 Early in the session of 1887, some remarks of the Irish Secretary (Sir M. Hicks-Beach) on recent evictions were interrupted by Mr. T. Harrington and other of the Irish members, the former repeatedly crying \" Shame ! \" amid the cheers of his friends. He was several times called to order by the Speaker, who at length said : \"I must call the attention of the honourable gentleman to the fact that the honourable member has just called out a word which is not Parliamen tary, and that is the word ' Shame.' It is quite new of late years, and it ought to be rigorously put down. (Cheers.) With the authority and sanction of the House, I shall in future take notice of it.\" Questions, and Parliamentary Loquacity. \u2014 The serious growth of questions in the House of Commons may be judged by the fact that in the session of 1881 (the year of the Irish Land Act) about 4200 were put and answered, occupying ono volume and a quarter of \" Hansard's Debates,\" as against about oue-third of a volume in previous years. The whole of the reports of the session required nine volumes, as compared with four or five in former years. At the sitting of the House of Commons on the 24th of November, 1884, the question list assumed unprecedented proportions, the number of inquiries of which notice had been given amounting to eighty-seven, sixty-two being from Irish members. In the foUowing Parliament on one occasion (Feb. 18, 1886) over seventv questions were put, the time consumed by them being an hour and a half. It has been suggested that, to prevent the loss of time consequent upon the answering of questions in the House, the answers as weU as the questions should in most cases be printed in the daily notice papers ; but the idea has not yet been adopted. Motions for Adjournment. \u2014 A former respected member of the House, who had fiUed the office of Chairman of Committees (Mr. E. Pleydell Bouverie), writing to the Times in February, 1882, in a letter signed only by his initials, made the following remarks : \" There can be no doubt that there has been a real change of manners in the"], [653, "VARIETIES. 633 House, which has materially favoured unintentional obstruction. I need not touch on the causes of this change. There has also been another change of practice, trifling in itself, but which has, without being observed, contributed largely to obstruction. Some thirty years ago there existed a practical cloture of a debate in the loudly-proclaimed unwillingness of the House to listen to unwelcome speakers and speeches. The inarticulate noises of a fuU House were irregular, no doubt, in form, but were very efficient in practice to close a debate. A very ingenious and learned member, who was apt to try the patience of the House far beyond what it could endure, invented the method of moving the adjourn ment of the debate in the middle of his unheard speech, and thus compelled the House to let him finish his remarks, or run the risk of a debate still further protracted. To Mr. Chisholm Anstey must be attributed the glory of this innovation, which has since been used without stint or mercy.\" The liberty of members to move the adjournment of the House was restricted by one of Mr. Gladstone's Procedure Resolutions, 1882. A Prediction and a Threat.\u2014 Whatever may be thought of the prejudice done to the business of Parliament by the band of Irish members, who have employed their energies in observing what one of them (Mr. ParneU) caUed the \" sacred right of obstruction,\" the contribu tion of Ireland to the Parliament House of the United Kingdom has hitherto faUeu far short of Grattan's anticipation. Mr. Lecky, in his \" Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland,\" records a prediction of the greatest among them. Grattan is said to have remarked to some English gentlemen after the Union, \" You have swept away our constitution, . . have destroyed our Parliament, but we shall have our revenge. We wiU send into the ranks of your Parliament, and into the very heart of your constitution, a hundred of the greatest scoundrels in the kingdom ! \" Parliament \"Collared.\" \u2014 The House of Lords having, in February, 1882, agreed to nominate a committee to inquire into the working of the Irish Land Act of the previous year, Mr. Gladstone gave notice in the House of Commons of a motion that such an inquiry must be injurious ; and announced that tho consideration of this motion would precede the continued discussion of tho Procedure Resolutions. Sir Walter Barttelot (member for West Sussex) thereupon elicited much cheering from the Opposition benches by the foUowing remarks : \" I think the House ought to know some better reason than has been given, why the Prime Minister proposes to interfere with business which he has said is of the utmost importance. I think it is an unfair and unreasonable demand. If Parliament is to be collared aU round\u2014 if we are to be gagged and the other House is to be threatened by the Prime Minister, I for one think it is high time the right honourable gentleman should declare what his intentions are at the present moment.\" \u2014 Mr. Gladstone replied, it would be highly irregular then to discuss the reasons which had led the Govern ment to resolve on the course proposed, but they woidd be duly set forth when he brought forward the motion."], [654, "634 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Too Much of a Good Thing.\u2014 Mr. Bright, speaking of the House of Commons, once repeated a story which his friend Mr. Cobden had narrated to him. \" He told me that at the end of a session a member of the House who had a yacht, and who spent the autumn in the Mediter ranean, invited him to go with him, saying that he would invite three or four other members of the House, and that they would all have a nice time of it. Mr. Cobden replied that he had seen so much of honourable mem bers during the session, that he did not wish to see another for six months to come.\" Fighting and Fasting. \u2014 On the 30th January, 1629, both Houses joined in petitioning the King (Charles I.) for a fast, to seek at the hands of Almighty God a happy success in the affairs of Church and State, and diversion of the miseries of the Reformed Church abroad. The King answered that the deplorable condition of the Reformed Churches abroad was too true, and they ought to give them all possible help. But fighting would do them more good than fasting. This custom of fasting every session was but lately begun, and he was not satisfied with the necessity of it at this time ; yet he willingly granted them their request, but it should not hereafter be brought iuto precedent, except on great occasions. Sunday Observance Bills. \u2014 February 15th, 1621, a member, Mr. Shepard, is discharged from the House for his speech on the Bill for Keeping the Sabbath, otherwise called Sunday. \" The House doth remove him from the service of this House, as unworthy to be a member thereof.\" Sir George Moore said, \" In every Parliament I have served have been bills for observing the Sabbath.\" \u2014 Parry's Parliaments of England. Sunday Sittings of the Houses. \u2014 In the \" DiurnaU Occurrences or Dayly Proceedings of this Great and Happy Parliament,\" 1641 (a companion volume to the \" Speeches and Passages \" of the same year, frequently quoted in the earlier pages of this book), the following is entered under August 8 : \" Resolved upon the question in both Houses of Parliament, nemine contradicente, that this ensuing declaration shall be printed : ' Whereas both Houses of Parliament found it fit to sit in Parliament upon the 8. day of August, being the Lord's day, for many urgent and unexpected occasions concerning the safety of the Kingdome, and being so straitned in time by reason of his Majesties resolution to begin his journey towards Scotland on Munday following early in the morning, it was not possible for to settle and order the affairs of the Kingdome, either for the government thereof in the King's absence, or for the present safety as was requisite : Upon these present necessities, though the Houses thought it necessary to sit, yet the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament think it meet to declare that they woidd not have done this but for inevitable necessity, the Peace and Safety both of Church aud State being so deeply concerned ; which they do hereby declare, to the end that neither any other inferiour Court or CounceU, or any other person, may draw this into example, or make use of it for their encouragement in neglecting the due observation of the Lord's day.' \" Recent Sunday Sittings. \u2014 It was noted as very unusual that a Saturday sitting in July, 1879, was prolonged until a quarter past twelve"], [655, "VARIETIES. 635 on the Sunday morning ; but this was several times exceeded in foUowing sessions. Not to mention other instances, in August, 1883, the House, assembling at a quarter past twelve on the Saturday, sat till twenty minutes past two on the Sunday morning. The following notice appeared in the Times a few days after : \" The sitting of the House of Commons last Sunday morning has been discussed at a meeting of the Presbytery of Perth aud Aberdeen Original Seceders, held at Cupar Angus. It was unanimously resolved to send a memorial to Mr. Gladstone protesting against ' the late violation of the Sabbath day by the House of Commons encroaching upon the hours of that day for the despatch of Parliamentary business.' \" The protest did not appear to have much influence, for in the following session (March 15, 1884) the House, meeting shortly after noon on Saturday, sat till a quarter to six the next morning, the business being Committee of Supply, aud sundry votes on the Irish Estimates being taken at a late hour. Sittings on Sundays and Holy-days in Ancient Times.\u2014 Elsynge notes that \" Parliaments have been summoned to be held on tho Sunday; viz., anno 23 Edward I., 30 Sept. ; and the same was prorogued by a new7 summons of Novemb. following, to be held Die Dominico,\" &c. He notes several other instances in the reigns of the early Edwards, and, per contra, that a Parliament summoned in the 5th year of Richard II. for a day which fell out to be Sunday, was therefore adjourned until Monday. He also says, \" I find no Parliament summoned to be held on All Saints' Day, All Souls', or St. John Baptist's.\" But concerning Christmas day, \" Anno 3 Edward VI., the Parliament did sit on Christmas Day, and read two bills; and on St. Stephen's Day, and read one bill; and on St. John's Day, but this is singular, and occasioned through the troublesome business of the Duke of Somerset.\" Ash Wednesday in the Upper House. \u2014 The House of Lords does not ordinarily meet on Wednesdays, and an Ash Wednesday meeting is very rare. One took place Feb. 26, 1884, when the Royal assent was to be given, by commission, to the choice of Mr. Arthur Peel by the House of Commons as Speaker. On this occasion, according to ancient custom, the members of the House who were present attended Divine service at Westminster Abbey in state, accompanied by mace -bearers, &c. Pious and Patient. \u2014 In the \" Diurnall Occurrences\" recently re ferred to we find, under date Nov. 17, 1640 : \" Tewsday, was the fast day, which was kept piously and devoutly. Dr. Burgesse aud Master Marshall preached before the House of Commons at least seven hours betwixt them, upon Jere. 50, 5, and 2 Chron. 2, 3.\" The Act for Licensing Plays. \u2014 In the course of the session 1737, Giffard (the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre) brought to Sir Robert Walpole a farce caUed the \" Golden Rump,\" which had been proposed for exhibition; \" but it is uncertain,\" says Coxe in his \" Life of Walpole,\" from whose narrative the foUowing particulars are taken, \" whether the intentions of the manager were to request his advice on this occasion, or to extort a sum of money to prevent its representation.\" The Minister, however, paid the profits which it was supposed might have"], [656, "636 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. accrued from the performance, and detained the copy. He then made extracts of the most exceptionable passages, abounding in profaneness, sedition, aud blasphemy, which he read in the House. Leave was accord ingly given to bring in a Licensing Bill, which was introduced on the 20th May, read the 21th, a second time on the 25th, and finally passed on the 1st of June. With equal despatch the measure passed through its various stages in the Upper House, and received the royal assent on the 21st. The House of Commons and the Theatre. \u2014 Iu 1734, Sir John Harnard baring brought in a bill to check the increase of playhouses, a comedian named Tony Aston was allowed to address the House against the measure. \u2014 Horace Walpole mentions in his \"Memoirs\" that in March, 1751, the House adjourned to attend at Drury-lane, where Othello was to be acted by a Mr. Delaval and his family. And again in his \"Journals,\" Feb. 1781, he says, \"Mr. Burke's bill for retrenching places on the Civil List was read for the first time ; the second reading deferred till that day fortnight, because the 21st was to be the Fast Day, and the 22nd the benefit of Vestris, a favourite French dancer of the opera.\" \u2014 Dr. Doran mentions that, one evening in 1804, when the young actor Betty was to play Hamlet, \"the House of Commons, on a motion by Pitt, adjourned and went down to the theatre to see him.\" Mere Novelties. \u2014 Lord Brougham writes of Sir William Scott (Lord Stowell) : Of every change he was the enemy. As he could imagine nothing better than the existing state of any given thing, he could see only peril and hazard in the search for anything new; and with him it was quite enough to characterise a measure as \" a mere novelty,\" to deter him at once from entertaining it \u2014 a phrase of which Mr. Speaker Abbot, with some humour, once took advantage to say, when asked by his friend what that mass of papers might be, pointing to the huge bundle of the Acts of a single session, \" Mere novelties, Sir Willtam \u2014 mere novelties.\" Ill-worded Acts of Parliament. \u2014 The negligence displayed in drawing bills is frequently the subject of comment, but sometimes, escaping detection, has given rise to ludicrous passages in Acts of ParUa ment. The same effect has resulted from the striking out of clauses without due attention to the connection of the remainder. A good instance was cited by Lord Stanhope in the House of Lords in 1816. A statute enacted the punishment of fourteen years' transportation for a particular offence, and upon conviction one half thereof should go to the King and one half to the informer. \u2014 Mr. Serjeant Robinson, in his \" Reminiscences of Bench and Bar,\" alludes to \" the celebrated instance of the statute for the rebuilding of Chelmsford gaol. An early clause prescribed that prisoners should be confined in the old gaol until the new one was built ; but, at the last moment, a section was added to the effect that the new prison should be constructed out of the materials of the old one, and so the bill passed for the time without the glaring inconsistency being detected.\" Sleep by Act of Parliament. \u2014 In the days of the old watchmen, a bill for the better regulation of the metropolitan watch was brought"], [657, "VARIETIES. 637 into the House of Commons. Among other provisions was a clause that the watchmen should be compeUed to sleep during the day. When this was read in committee, a gouty old baronet stood up and expressed his wish that it could be made to extend to members of the House of Commons, as he should be glad to come under the operation of the cnactment. The Shortest Act of Parliament. \u2014 Lord Coke said the shortest statute he ever met with was one passed in the 5th Henry IV. : \" None from henceforth shall use to multiply gold or silver, or use the craft of multiplications, and if any do the same, he shaU incur the pain of felony.\" The Longest Bill. \u2014 The longest bUl ever introduced, according to the memory of the time, was put before the House of Commons in June, 1883, and consisted of 400 printed pages. It was the Electric Lighting BUI, brought in by Mr. Chamberlain, President of the Board of Trade, and Mr. Holms, Parliamentary Secretary to that Board. It was eventu aUy withdrawn, owing to the pressure of other business. An Act Passed in Three Days. \u2014 A bill was introduced in 1779, by Attorney- General Wedderburn, \" to suspend aU exemptions from impressment into the navy, together with the right of those impressed to sue out a writ of habeas corpus for their liberation.\" The bill was read a first and second time on introduction, was passed to the Lords on the following day, and on the third it received the Royal assent. Acts Passed in One Day. \u2014 The bid suspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, in 1866, wont through aU its stages in both Houses on the same day, and received the Royal assent shortly after midnight. A similar thing occurred with regard to the Explosives Bill, introduced in the House of Commons by the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, April 9, 1883, after an attempt to injure one of the Government offices in Whitehall. On this occasion, however, while the bill passed through both Houses the same evening, the Royal assent could not be communicated until the foUowing day. Royal Assent Speedily Given.\u2014 In tho sitting of the House of Lords on the 31st of May, 1889, the Royal assent was given by commis sion to tho Naval Defence Act, within about two hours of the measure having been read a third time by their lordships. In order to effect this, the Queen being at Windsor, Queen's messengers, special trains, aud the telegraph wire had to be put in requisition.\u2014 At the end of the session of 1891, the House of Commons met at ten o'clock on the morning of the 5th of August to read the Appropriation Bill a third time ; and the House of Lords assembled half-au-hour later to allow the measure to pass all its stages immediately. This result being communicated by telegraph to the Queen at Osborne, a courier was despatched thence with the customary official documents, arriving in London in time to enable the prorogatiou to be effected by commission at half-past six in the evening. Introduction of Bills in the Upper House.\u2014 In the House of Lords in April, 1884, Lord Waveney inquired whether, in consideration"], [658, "638 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. of the present system of transacting public business, it might not be expedient to introduce such bills as did not interfere with the privileges of the House of Commons, or touch the imposition of taxation, more frequently in the first instance into the House of Lords. \u2014 In reply, Earl GranviUe said he did not think his answer would be quite satisfactory to the noble lord, although he sincerely sympathised with the object contem plated ; but the fact was that during the last twenty-five years, whenever he had been in office, he had bad once or twice in every session to answer questions of a precisely similar nature, and had never omitted any oppor tunity of pressing upon his coUeagues the suggestion whether certain biUs might not with advantage be introduced into that House. He did not believe there was any disinclination on the part of his colleagues to accede to such a course ; but, somehow or other, there were always reasons given why it was more advantageous that such and such a biU should be intro duced into the other House. He was certain that this could not be attributed to any particular prejudice on the part of the present Adminis tration, for he remembered that Lord Aberdeen, some thirty years ago, in answer to a question identical with the present, said he had heard the self -same query put fifty years before. That being so, it seemed to him (Earl Granville) that there must be some idea that important measures were not so weU received when they came down from their lordships' House as when they emanated from the House of Commons. Too Much Legislation. \u2014 At a social gathering in 1884, Mr. Joseph Cowen, member for Newcastle-on-Tyne, replying to the toast of \"The House of Commons,\" said : \"Members were told that they talked too long and too often, and seldom to the point ; but that was a failing not confined within the walls of Parliament. The complaint of excessive loquacity was not of modern origin ; it was prevalent 300, 200, 100 years ago, and was made with as much persistency then as now. In the times of the Tudors and the Stuarts the same censure was passed upon the House of Commons for its garrulity, and everybody knew what Cromwell did when Parliament became too talkative. Mr. Carlyle had satirised its debates as the twaddle of the national palaver. M. Montalembert lamented that with the death of Sir Robert Peel the glory and fame of the House had departed, and that its last orator disappeared when Canning died, leaving its speaking to descend to drivel. General Thompson stated that the House of Commons had lost its influence in consequence of its incessant talk ; and in the speeches made by Sir R. Peel, during his Premiership, between 1841 and 1847, there were as many lachrymose complaints about the deadlock into which public business had fallen as were made by the Prime Minister at the present day. The same thing was found in the life and letters of Lord Althorp, as well as descriptions of scenes of violence and records of offensive remarks such as had never been seen or heard in the present House of Commons. The men who passed censure on that assembly now, were either ignorant of the past or had forgotten what they had learned. The House of Commons was as effective an instrument for legislation as ever it had been. The tendency of the time was vastly too much in favour of making laws. Since ho had been in the"], [659, "VARIETIES. 639 House of Commons (1874) there had been something like 3000 Acts of Parliament passed. One-third of them were utterly inoperative, burthening the statute book without even being referred to ; one -third had only a transitory influence, very often the exact opposite to what was intended ; and only about one-third had exercised any direction upon the life of the nation. If this thing went on they would shortly have legis lation for the toothache.\" Use of Ecclesiastical Dignities. \u2014 Forster relates that Sir Edward Dering, member for Kent, who spoke in the debate on the Remonstrance, taking up the closing averments in the declaration, as to the desire of its promoters for the advancement of learning by a more general and equal distribution of its rewards, avowed his opinion that this object would be defeated if the great prizes in the Church were abolished. \" Great rewards,\" he said, \" do beget great endeavours ; and certainly, Sir, when the great basin and ewer are taken out of the lottery, you shaU have few adventurers for small plate and spoons only. If any man coidd cut the moon out all into little stars, although we might still have the same moon, or as much in small pieces, yet we should want both light and influence.\" Sydney Smith's famous argument in defence of the \" prizes in the Church \" was almost literally reproduced from this speech of Sir Edward Dering, made nearly two centuries before. The Bishops in Parliament. \u2014 In June, 1870, a motion was made in the House of Commons by Mr. S. Beaumont, for leave to introduce a bill relieving lords spiritual, thereafter consecrated, from attendance in Parliament. The motion was defeated by 158 to 102. \u2014 A motion in favour of taking away \" the legislative power of bishops in the House of Peers \" was also brought forward by Mr. W. Willis in 1884, and negatived by 148 to 137. Balaam and his Ass. \u2014 Dr. King relates that Atterbury, the cele brated Bishop of Rochester, happened to say in the House of Lords, whde speaking on a certain BiU then under discussion, that \" he had prophesied last winter this bill would be attempted in the present session, and he was sorry to find he had proved a true prophet.\" My Lord Coningsby, who spoke after the bishop, and always spoke in a passion, \"desired the House to remark that one of the right reverend had set himself forth as a prophet; but, for his part, he did not know what prophet to liken him to, unless to that furious prophet Balaam, who was reproved by his own ass.\" Atterbury, in reply, with great wit and calm ness, exposed this rude attack, concluding thus : \" Since the noble lord has discovered in our manners such a similitude, I am weU content to be compared to the prophet Balaam ; but, my lords, I am at a loss how to make out the other part of the paraUel. I am sure that I have been reproved by nobody but his lordship.\" An Archbishop's Wrath. \u2014 Horace Walpole writes in May, 1777 : \" The Duke of Grafton took notice of the despotic spirit preached up by the clergy, particularly of a late sermon of the Archbishop of York (Markham) before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. That sermon had been printed, but not publicly sold ; it was a base instance of"], [660, "640 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. servility, hoping to recover favour in the closet, and a libel on the Oppo sition. The Archbishop declared himself ready to defend every position in his sermon. . . Lord Shelburne was stiU more severe on the Arch bishop of York, who rose with most intemperate pride and fury, and said that though, as a Christian and bishop, he ought to bear wrongs, there were injuries that would provoke any patience, and that he, if insulted, should know how to chastise any petulance.\" Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy. \u2014 A trite saying on this subject originated in a debate in the House of Lords on the Test Laws. Lord Sandwich said, \" I have heard frequent use of the words orthodoxy and heterodoxy, but I confess myself at a loss to know what they mean.\" Bishop Warburton interposed in a whisper, \" Orthodoxy, my lord, is my doxy ; heterodoxy is another man's doxy.\" A Bed-ridden Law. \u2014 Old Sir Benjamin Rudyard in the Long Parliament said, \" he should like to see that good, old, decrepit law, Magna Charta, which hath been kept so long bed-rid, as it were, walk abroad again, with new vigour and lustre.\" Piety and Ability. \u2014 Lord Commissioner Maynard, in the Parlia ment of 1689, was particularly severe against the administration of the navy. \" I hear,\" said he, \" there are young men put to command ships that never were at sea before, because they are weU affected to the present settlement. The question used to be, ' Is he a godly man ? ' and he was employed. I ask them, Can a godly man, because he is godly, make a watch or a pair of boots ? \" The House of Commons Denounced by a Member. \u2014 When Alderman OUver was sent to the Tower by the House of Commons in 1771 (see pp. 49, 425), some of the members strongly disapproved of the course taken by the majority. Horace Walpole writes : \" Sir George Savile left the House, protesting against their proceedings, and was fol lowed by some of his friends. Colonel Barre went farther \u2014 said in his place that the conduct of the House was infamous, that no honest man could sit amongst them, and walked away \u2014 and the House was forced to swaUow so ungrateful a bolus.\" An Odious Comparison. \u2014 A debate took place in the House of Commons, December 12th, 1770, on a motion for deferring the Land Tax until after the Christmas recess, \"when,\" says the Public Advertiser, \" the riot which had recently taken place in the House of Lords * so shocked the delicacy of Sir Fletcher Norton, the Speaker, that upon occa sion of some clamour this day he called to the members, with all the soft ness of a bassoon, ' Pray, gentlemen, be orderly ; you are almost as bad as the other House.' \" Mutual Forbearance in Debate. \u2014 \" We have great reason,\" said Sir WiUiam Coventry (1676), \" in cases of disputes in Parliament, to give grains of allowance to one another. In ancient times but a few persons spoke in the House, and their speeches were ready penned. The powder and shot was ready made up in cartridges, ready cut and dried, * See p. 551, \" Mutual Exclusion of the Lords and the Commons.\""], [661, "641 VARIETIES. and a man had then time to think ; but now we speak on a sudden, and therefore would have some grains of allowance given.\" A Convenient Conscience. \u2014 Clarendon relates that HoUis one day, upon a very hot debate in the House (1647), and some rude expressions which fell from Ireton, persuaded him to walk out of the house with him, aud then told him that he should presently go over the water and fight with him. Ireton told him his conscience would not suffer him to fight a duel; upon which Hollis, in choler, pulled him by the nose; teUing him, if his conscience would keep him from giving men satisfaction, it should keep him from provoking them. A Member Striking Another. \u2014 In the \" Memorials and Orders of the House, gathered by H. S. E. [Elsynge], Clerk to the Parliament\" (1670), we find: \"19th Jaeobi, some speeches passing in the House privately between two of the members, and some offence taken, which seems was not intended to be given, one of them in going down the Parliament stairs struck the other, who thereupon catched at a sword then in his man's hand, to strike with it. Upon complaint made of it to the House, they were both of them ordered to attend the House. Being come, he who gave the blow was caUed in, and standing (not at the bar, but) by the bar, was examined by Mr. Speaker, confessed the giving the blow, insisted on the provocation, and withdrew. The other was also called in, to relate the truth. After he had made the relation and was likewise withdrawn, and testimony given by a member of the House who heard the words, the House proceeded to sentence against Mr. O, who struck the blow : he being brought to the bar, there on his knees he received judgment, which was pronounced by the Speaker \u2014 that he should be committed to the Tower during the pleasure of the House.\" Abusive Language in Parliament. \u2014 Boswcll writes (1784) : \" I censured the coarse invectives which were become fashionable in the House of Commons, and said that if members of Parliament must attack each other personaUy in the heat of debate, it should be dono more genteelly. Johnson : ' No, sir ; that would be much worse. Abuse is not so dangerous when there is no vehicle of wit or delicacy \u2014 no subtle conveyance. The difference between, coarse aud refined abuse is as the difference between being bruised by a club, and wounded by a poisoned arrow.' \" Censure, &c, without Personal Offence. \u2014 Mr. James Grant wrote in his \" Random Recollections \" (1837) : \" Persons unacquainted with the secrets of the prison-house would naturally infer that those members of opposite politics whom they see night after night so heartily abusing each other, were not on friendly terms together. There are some cases in which the conclusion would be just ; in the great majority it would not. Before and after the dissolution of Sir Robert Peel's Govern ment, the right honourable baronet and Lord John RusseU were often seen in most friendly conversation together. Some weeks after the meeting of the present Parliament, Mr. Hughes Hughes, the member for Oxford. made a most violent attack on Mr. O'ConneU, pointedly referring, among other things, to his ordering death's-heads and cross-bones to be painted T T"], [662, "642 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. over the doors of those electors who would not vote for his nominee in the county of Cork. Mr. O'ConneU repelled the attack with equal violence, and retorted \u2014 as he did to Mr. Shaw, the member for the University of Dublin, on another occasion \u2014 that Mr. Hughes's head was a calf's-head. Some nights afterwards both gentlemen were seen walking arm-in-arm up Parliament-street, on their way home from the House.\" The same writer gives another instance, in which Lord Brougham and O'ConneU were con cerned. In the session of 1834 the former had denounced O'ConneU in the House of Lords as a great national mendicant, and contrasted him with distinguished men who would not be dependent upon the bounty of others. In the following year they met at a public dinner, there being only one person seated between them ; when Brougham proposed to take wine with O'ConneU, and they drank to each other, Brougham saying, ' ' We have not drunk wine together since we sat tete a, tete at a public dinner in 1823.\" Scenes in the House of Lords. \u2014 Several disorderly scenes have been referred to in the foregoing pages (see pp. 35, 58, &c). Mr. James Grant depicts one that occurred on the 2nd of August, 1835. The fol lowing is a summary of his account : Counsel had been heard at the bar of the House against the Municipal Corporations Bill, and a question arose as to the examination of witnesses, when the Earl of WinchUsea, with great warmth, said : \" We are arrived at a most fearful crisis. Never did there exist such a state of things as the present. This House was never in such a situation. (\" Hear, hear !\" from the Duke of Cumber land and other noble lords.) And I do not see, after what has passed at the bar of this House \u2014 after the able exposure of the certain consequences of this measure which has been made \u2014 -how any noble lord can lay Iris hand on his heart and vote for this bill. 1 implore your lordships, from the bottom of my heart, not for one moment to entertain this most atro cious measure. I would scorn to belong to a House which could entertain it. In God's name let it be rejected now.\" (Here the vehemence of the noble lord's manner was so great as to impede his utterance.) \u2014 Lord Melbourne, who appeared perfectly calm and dispassionate, moved the adjournment of the further consideration of the question till Monday, when he would propose that the House resolve itself into a committee on the biU. \u2014 The Duke of Newcastle : 1 wish to understand the noble viscount correctly. Do you (addressing Lord Melbourne) mean to refuse hearing the offered evidence ? \u2014 Lord Melbourne : Certainly. \u2014 The Duke of Newcastle (with much energy) : Then I have no hesitation in saying that the conduct of the noble viscount is contrary to what ought to be the conduct of a man, of a Minister of the Crown, of a British peer, and of a British subject. He is taking from the people of this country their property, by the most unconstitutional and most arbitrary means. I have no hesitation in saying I do think that the measure before your lordships is so atrocious as to render the noblo viscount liable to impeachment ; and, if no other person brings forward a motion for his impeachment, I myself wiU do it. \u2014 Lord Brougham : I beg to remind the noble duke that, in his zeal for the impeachment of my noble friend, he has overlooked the im-"], [663, "VARIETIES. 643 portant circumstance, that as he himself wiU have to act as a judge when my noble friend is impeached, he cannot also be his prosecutor. The impeachment must come from the Commons ; and when the other House does impeach my noble friend, I shad give the case unbiassed and impartial consideration. \u2014 The Duke of Cumberland (who had been so much excited as to be unable to remain in his seat) : We are too warm at present for considering the question before the House. We had better adjourn the House till Monday. \u2014 Lord Brougham said they must first adjourn the consideration of the question, adding, in a peculiarly sarcastic manner, \" I do not think that we are at all too warm.\" The question was then adjourned, as proposed. A Royal Quarrel in the Lords. \u2014 Mr. GreviUe writes as follows, Feb. 26, 1829 : \" The debate on Monday night in the House of Lords [on the Catholic Relief Bill] was very amusing. It was understood the Duke of Clarence was to speak, and there was a good deal of curiosity to hear him. He made a very tolerable speech, of course with a good deal of stuff in it, but such as it was it has exceedingly disconcerted the other party [against the bill]. The three royal dukes \u2014 Clarence, Cumberland, and Sussex \u2014 got up one after another, and attacked each other\u2014 that is, Clarence and Sussex attacked Cumberland, and he them \u2014 very vehemently, and they used towards each other language that nobody else could have ventured to employ ; so it was a very droU scene. The Duke of Clarence said the attacks on the Duke of WeUington had been infamous ; the Duke of Cumberland took this to himself, but when he began to answer it could not recoUect the expression, which the Duke of Clareuce directly supplied \u2014 ' I said, infamous.' The Duke of Sussex said that the Duke of Clarence nad not intended to apply the word to the Duke of Cumberland, but if he chose to take it to himself he might. Then the Duke of Clarence said that the Duke of Cumberland had lived so long abroad that he had forgotten there was such a thing as freedom of debate.\" A Conflict between the Woolsack and the Episcopal Bench, \u2014 Convocation. \u2014 A remarkable passage of words took place in 1864 between Lord Chancellor Westbury and some of the occupants of the episcopal bench. Lord Houghton had called attention in the House of Lords to the recent judgment of Convocation in the case of \" Essays and Reviews,\" and asked the Government whether tho law officers had been consulted as to the powers of Convocation to pass such a judgment, and the immunity of members of that body from proceedings at common law in consequence. The Lord ChanceUor replied in a speech full of sarcasm, and undisguised contempt for both Convocation and the episcopacy. As to the first he said : \" There are three modes of dealing with Con vocation when it is permitted to come into action and transact real business. The first is, while they are harmlessly busy to take no notice of the proceedings. The second is, when they seem likely to get into mischief to prorogue and put an end to their proceedings. The third, when they have done something clearly beyond their powers, is to bring them before a court of justice and punish them.\" He went on to show that no action of Convocation, and nothing it might pro- T T 2"], [664, "644 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. nounce, had validity without the sanction of the Crown, and any attempt to enforce its unsanctioned decrees would involve the penalties of prce munire. He then referred to the judgment itself: \"Assuming that the report of the judgment which I have read is a correct one, I am happy to tell your lordships that what is caUed a synodical judgment is simply a series of weU-lubricated terms \u2014 a sentence so oily and so saponaceous* that no one could grasp it. Like an eel it slips through your fingers, \u2014 it is simply nothing, and I am glad to tell my noble friend that it is literally no sentence at all.\" He called upon the bishops to pause before they entered npon proceedings which, under certain circum stances, might entail the penalties he had before alluded to, and then continued : \" Those who concur with me may probably think that by protesting against such a course they may save themselves from conse quences ; but if there be any attempt to carry Convocation beyond its proper limits, their best plan after protesting will be to gather up their garments and leave the place, remembering the piUar of salt, and resolving not to cast a look behind.\" (Laughter). \u2014 The Archbishop of Canterbury (Longley) mildly defended the course taken by Convocation, as a necessary vindication of the doctrine of the Church of England ; but the Bishop of Oxford (Wilberforce), who had been referred to pointedly by Lord West bury, denounced him warmly. He said : \" If a man has no respect for himself, he ought at all events to respect the audience before which he speaks ; and when the highest representative of the law in England in your lordships' court, upon a matter involving the liberties of the subject and the religion of the realm, and all those high truths concerning which this discussion has arisen, can think it fit to descend to ribaldry \u2014 in which he knows that he can safely indulge, because those to whom he addresses it wiU have too much respect for their characters to answer him in like sort \u2014 I say that this House has ground to complain of having its character unnecessarily injured in the sight of the people of this land, by one occu pying so high a position within it. . . I would rather subject myself, in the presence of my countrymen and of your noble House, to any amount of that invective and insinuation, and all those arts of, I wiU not say what part of the bar of England, of which we have seen something to-night \u2014 I would, I repeat, rather a thousand times incur it aU, than have to look back on my deathbed upon myself as one of those who had not striven for the truth of our Established Church, and had not encountered, because I was afraid pcrsonaUy of the consequences, anything which the maintenance of that truth might entail.\" Inapt Quotation. \u2014 It has not unfrequently happened that quota tions introduced in debate, from poetry especially, have been misunder stood or interpreted too literally, and occasionaUy stormy scenes have occurred from this cause. Two or three may be mentioned. On one occasion, while Lord Brougham was Chancellor, the Duke of Buckingham * This epithet derived personal point from the fact that Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who was reputed to have drawn up the judgment, had long before been nicknamed by his opponents \" Soapy Sam.\""], [665, "VARIETIES. 645 was addressing the House of Lords, and brought his harangue to a con elusion in the following terms : \" The noble and learned lord on the wool sack and his colleagues think they have buried the noble earl [Grey, who had just retired from office] in his political sepulchre, and that he wiU no more disturb them ; but they will find themselves mistaken. The spirit of the noble earl will burst its cerements and wiU haunt them in their festivities, and disturb the noble and learned lord on the woolsack in the midst of his ' potations pottle deep.' \" Lord Brougham, in great agita tion, rose from the woolsack and replied, \" As to the concluding observa tions of the noble duke, aU I shaU say is that I do not frequent the same cabaret or ale-house as he does.\" (Loud cries of \" Order ! \") \" At all events, I do not recoUect having met the noble earl referred to at the noble duke's ale-house potations. My lords, I have not a slaug dictionary at hand .\" Most of those present here rose to order, and amid the uproar the Chancellor's voice was lost, but he persisted for some time, until the Duke of Buckingham (who apparently had been enjoying the scene) rose to explain that he had merely intended a pleasantry, and that he had only borrowed for the purpose a quotation from Shakespeare \u2014 a fact which the House at first did not seem to recognise. Unintentional Offence. \u2014 Another instance of unfortunate quota tion occurred in 1853. The Earl of Derby had moved an amendment to the Canada Clergy Reserves Bill, which measure was supported by the Bishop of Oxford (Wilberforce), who read an extract from Burke to en force the remark that the American people woidd resist any attempt to \" wrest freedom from them by force or shuffle it from them by chicane,\" which he inferred would be the effect of the amendment. Tho Earl of Derby objected to the words just used, as an application of terms which could not be made without giving offence. The Bishop of Oxford ex plained that he had made the allusion with a smile and in a playful way, without intention to offend, and that the noble earl himself had erred in speaking of the promoters of the bill as adopting a shuffling aud shifting policy. The Earl of Derby thereupon said : \" My lords, I accept at onco the explanation which has been offered by the right reverend prelate ; but when he tells me that it is impossible for him to say anything offensive because ho has a smiling face, he wiU forgive me if I quote in his presence from a weU-known author, without intending in the least to apply the words to him \u2014 ' A man may smile, and smile, and be a villain.' Interruption here took place, and some laughter, but more indications of disapproval among the noble lords present. The Earl of Derby resumed : \" I am at a loss to conceive to whom what I say can be offensive.\" \u2014 The Earl of Clarendon started excitedly to his feet, aud said with much emphasis, \" It is to me. (Loud cheers.) It is to me, I say. I and my noble friends near me were offended by that expression. We are not accustomed to hear such expressions. (Prolonged cheers.) We are not accustomed, even in the language of poetiy, to hear such a word as * viUain ' applied to any noble lord in this house.\" \u2014 The noble lord sat"], [666, "646 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. down amid renewed cheering, after which the Earl of Derby declared that he thought such interference quite uncalled for, and again that he had meant nothing personally offensive. The incident, while it lasted, caused unusual excitement. Offensive Speech Forbidden.\u2014 One of the standing orders of tho House of Lords runs as follows : \" To prevent misunderstandings, and for avoiding offensive speeches, when matters are debating either in the House or Committees, it is for honour's sake thought fit and so ordered, that aU personal, sharp, or taxing speeches be forborne ; aud whosoever answereth another man's speech, shaU apply his answer to the matter without wrong to the person ; and as nothing offensive is to be spoken, so nothing is to be ill-takeu, if the party that speaks it shaU presently make a fair exposi tion or clear denial of the words that might bear any ill construction ; and if any offence of that kiud be given, as the House itself will be very sen sible thereof, so it wiU sharply censure the offenders, and give the party offended a fit reparation and full satisfaction.\" Scenes in the House of Commons. \u2014 A Disturbance Quelled by the Speaker. \u2014 In the reign of Charles II., a scene occurred which is thus reported in \" Grey's Debates : \" \u2014 \" The question being put, whether a further address should be made to the King for recall of his subjects now in the service of the French king, the grand committee divided, and the tellers, Trevor Williams and Sir John Hanmer, differing in their account of the yeas and noes, some called ' Tell again,' others ' Report ; * on which great disorder began, gentlemen rising from their places and mingling in the pit : hot and provoking discourses and gestures passed on both sides, especially betwixt Lord Cavendish and Sir John Hanmer. Some said that Lord Cavendish's sword was half drawn out, but prevented by Mr. Russell, who kept close to him ; others said that Lord Cavendish spat in Sir John Hanmer's face, but that was only eagerness of speech ; but it was visible to aU that Sir James Smith, setting his arms on his side, did in a rude manner make through the crowd, and jostled several, and came to the table, where yet more hot discourses passed between him and Lord Cavendish, Mr. Sacheverell, and several others ; Mr. Stockdale and some others setting their feet upon the mace, which lay below the table, in the usual place at grand committees. The disorder continuing near half an hour, the standers-by on the upper benches expected very fatal consequences might have foUowed, especially when the young gallants as Mr. Thynne, Mr. Newport, and several others leaped over the seats to join Lord Cavendish. But the Speaker [Sir Edward Seymour] very opportunely and prudently rising for his seat near the bar, in a resolute and slow pace, made his three respects through the crowd, and took the chair. The mace was stiU retained by the said gentlemen ; but at last being forcibly laid upon tho table, all the disorder ceased, and the gentlemen went to their places. The Speaker said that, to bring the House into order again, he took the chair, though not according to order. His act was generally approved. Sir Thomas Lee moved that there might be an engagement passed, on the honour of every member, standing up in his place, to proceed no further in anything that had happened.\""], [667, "VARIETIES. 647 The House Compared to a Menagerie. \u2014 Mr. James Grant remarks, respecting scenes which have occasionaUy occurred in later days, that Lord Brougham once compared the House to a menagerie, and the application of tho term would have been most appropriate to a scene he himself witnessed in July, 1835. Had a blind person been that night conducted into the house, and not told what the place was, he would assuredly have supposed he was in some zoological establishment. The question before the House was the re-committal of the Municipal Corpo rations BiU ; and a member (Mr. Hughes Hughes) rising to address the House was assailed with tremendous uproar. The Morning Post of the foUowing day thus described the scene : \" The most confused sounds, mysteriously blended, issued from all corners of the house. One honour able member near the bar repeatedly caUed out ' Read ' (to the member endeavouring to address the House), in an exceedingly bass and hoarse voice. At repeated intervals a sort of drone-like humming, haviug almost the sound of a distant band-organ or bagpipes, issued from the back benches ; \u2014 coughing, sneezing, and ingeniously extended yawning blended with the other sounds, and produced a tout ensemble which we have never heard excelled in the house. A single voice from the ministerial benches imitated very accurately the yelp of a kennelled hound.\" The most graphic description (continues Mr. Grant) would fall short of the scene itself. One honourable member imitated the crowing of a cock so admir ably, that you coidd not have distinguished it from the performance of a real chanticleer. Nor far from the same spot issued sounds marvellously resembling the bleating of a sheep, blended occasionally with the like imitation of the braying of an ass, by an honourable member a few yards distant. There were yelpings worthy of any canine animal, and exceUent imitations of the sounds of sundry instruments not mentioned by the Morning Post. The deafening uproar was completed by the cries of \" Chair, chair ! \" \" Order ! \" groans, laughter, &c, which proceeded from all parts of the house. The House had determined on a division, and a division on the question had the effect of restoring order. A Scene in the Commons in 1872.\u2014 On the 19th of March, 1872, Sir Charles Dilke rose in the House of Commons according to notice, \"to caU attention to the Civil List,\" and to move for certain returns. There was a very fuU house to hear him, much excitement having been produced by Sir Charles's lectures in various parts of the country on royal expenditure, &c. He was received with groans, but listened to attentively, and Mr. Gladstone foUowed him with a forcible reply. Mr. Auberon Herbert then rose to second Sir Charles's motion, and the pent-up wrath of the House was showered upon him. Groans, hisses, and other interruptions assailed him, but he persisted in the attempt to make himself heard, upon which hundreds of members rose and left their seats in a body, many remaining below the bar. Presently the honourable member was heard to avow himself an advocate of republican principles, and the declaration was received with a shout of indignation. As he went on, other tactics were adopted. A member moved that the House be counted, and the motion was repeated until that"], [668, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 648 ceremony had been performed three times in about ten minutes, but without the expected result. A young nobleman then declared he \" espied strangers in the gallery,\" and the house was consequently cleared of the reporters, &c, but it happened that the occupants of the ladies' gallery were allowed to remain. The scene that ensued was described in the Daily News, from \" a trustworthy source:\" \u2014 \" The interruptions which had taken place during the earlier portion of Mr. Herbert's speech were now redoubled. From the less prominent parts of the house, to which the Conservative members had retired, an incessant clamour arose. Cockcrowing in every variety, from the hoarse cry of the cochin to the shrill note of the bantam, and other farmyard sounds, together with repeated imitations of the rise and fall of Mr. Herbert's voice, prevented a single sentence of the speaker from reaching the ears of those who were assumed to be the auditors. When the clamour was at its height, Mr. Dodson (Chairman of Committees) made an earnest appeal to the Chair, asking whether the sounds which issued from behind the Speaker's chair and from below the bar were not gross violations of order. The Speaker, in reply, stated that the sounds were undoubtedly out of order in that house, and he could not refrain from expressing the extreme pain with which he had witnessed the scene that had taken place. In tho slight lull which followed, Mr. Herbert announced that if the House would listen to him for five minutes he would undertake to finish his observations. Amid considerable interruptions, Mr. Herbert was aUowed to proceed; but when, on the expiration of the five minutes, he manifested a desire to continue his speech, the clamour burst forth afresh. Mr. Herbert said that the interruptions had deprived him of a minute and a half of the time granted him, and that if the House would give him that minute and a half he would be content. The Speaker hereupon called Mr. Herbert to order, stating that it was irregular and improper to appeal to the House, and that he ought to address himself to the Chair. Mr. Herbert then resumed his seat amid the greatest excitement and confusion.\" Mr. Mundella followed him with a speech against the motion, and the gaUeries were re-opened after about an hour had elapsed. EventuaUy a division was taken on the motion, and there were found supporting it only Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Herbert, the numbers against them being 276. Defying the House. \u2014 Lord Palmerston wrote to a relative, Feb. 27, 1810 : \" We had last night a most extraordinary display of folly, coarseness, and vulgarity from Fuller, who, because Sir John Anstruther, Chairman of the Committee, would not take notice of him, when he several times attempted to rise, in order to put some very gross and absurd questions to Lord Chatham, flew out into such a passion, and swore, and abused the Chairman and the House to such a degree that it became at last necessary to commit him to custody. As he went out he shook his fist at the Speaker, and said he was a d insignificant little puppy, and, snapping his fingers at him, said he did not care that for him or the House either. He is now amusing himself with the Serjeant at-Arms, and I think was very lucky in not being sent to Newgate or the Tower.\""], [669, "VARIETIES. 649 The Plimsoll Episode.\u2014 On the 22nd of July, 1875, Mr. Disraeli, in announcing the intentions of the Government with respect to certain bUls before the House, named the Merchant Shipping BiU as one that would be withdrawn. Mr. Plimsoll, member for Derby, who had long been zealous in the advocacy of a measure of the kind, and who had understood that the Government was pledged to proceed with the biU, spoke with an air of great agitation. \"Sir,\" said he, \"I earnestly entreat the right hon. gentleman at the head of the Government not to consign some thousands of living human beings to a miserable death. . . . Continually, every winter, hundreds and hundreds of brave men are sent to death, and their wives are made widows and their chU dren are made fatherless, so that a few speculative scoundrels, in whose hearts there is neither the love of God nor the fear of man, may make unhaUowed gain. (Cheers.) There are shipowners in this country of ours who never build a ship and who never buy a new one, but are simply what are called ' ship-knackers,' and I heard an ex- Secretary of the Treasury, in the lobby, call one of my colleagues in this House a ' ship-knacker.' \"\u2014CaUed to order now by the Speaker for making observations on a biU not immediately before the House, the honourable gentleman gave notice that on a future evening he would ask whether a certain member (whom he named) was the owner of several vessels which had recently been abandoned at sea, and would put similar questions respecting other members also. \" I am determined (added the honourable member in a lond voice, and raising his clenched fist) to unmask the vUlains who send these sailors to death.\" \u2014 The Speaker : The honourable member made use of the word \" villain.\" I hope he did not use it with reference to any member of this House ? \u2014 Mr. Plimsoll (in an excited tone, and advancing to the front of the table) : I did, Sir, and I don't mean to withdraw it. (Loud cries of \" Order.\") \u2014 The Speaker : The observation of the honourable member is altogether unparliamentary, and I must again ask him whether he persists in using it.\u2014 Mr. Plimsoll : And I must again decline to retract. \u2014 The Speaker, after another ineffectual appeal, said he must leave the matter to the judgment of the House ; and Mr. PlimsoU resumed his seat, still manifesting great excitement. \u2014 Mr. Disraeli there- upon rose, and, remarking that the member for Derby had conducted himself in a manner almost unparaUeled, moved that the Speaker do reprimand him for his disorderly and violent conduct. \u2014 The Speaker : In accordance with the practice of the House, the honourable member for Derby wiU be heard in his place, and wiU then withdraw. \u2014 Mr. PUmsoU at once left the house, two or three of his friends trying to persuade him to offer an explanation. The question having been put from the chah-. the Marquis of Hartington suggested that it woidd be better that action upon the matter should be postponed for a short time, in the hope that the honourable member might be induced to set himself right with the House. Several friends of Mr. PlimsoU spoke apologetically on his behalf, declar- ing that he had been over-wrought by his efforts in connection with the subject, and that he was, in fact, extremely iU ; and the subject was then adjourned for a week. When it again came before the House, Mr."], [670, "650 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. PUmsoll read a carefuUy -written apology, withdrawing every expression contrary to parliamentary usage, but adding that he did not withdraw any statement of fact. The House was disposed to be generous, and readUy accepted Mr. Disraeli's suggestion to treat the apology as satis factory and complete. The order was consequently discharged. A Parallel to the PlimsoU Case. \u2014 In 1778, an attack was made in the House of Commons on Lord North, in reference to a contract for rum. In the course of the debate a scene occurred which is thus described by Horace Walpole in bis \" Journal : \" \u2014 \" Lord George Gordon,* a younger brother of the duke, started up and said Lord North was the contractor for aU contractors, and he could prove had attempted to make a villanous contract \u2014 he offered his brother the duke \u00a31000 a year if he would get him, Lord George, out of Parliament, but the duke had rejected the villanous offer. Such unparliamentary language created great hubbub. Many tried to convince the young lord of the unparliamentary indecency of the term viUanous. Lord North was exceedingly confounded, but did not deny the charge ; he only pleaded that there was nothing villanous iu the offer. Lord George was at last persuaded to retract the term, but he said the fact was true, and the House might caU it by what name they pleased.\" A Duel Prevented. \u2014 Horace Walpole writes, May 26, 1778 : \u2014 General Burgoyne appeared in the House of Commons (to defend him self, on his return from America). . . Temple Luttrell compared the conduct of Burgoyne with that of Lord George Germain, who, he said, had been promoted for disobedience and timidity. Lord George started up iu the most violent rage, and, clapping his hand on his sword, said, though he was an old man, he would not hear such an insult from a young man, who was an assassin and of the most wretched character. This produced the highest warmth and clamour. LuttreU went out of the house that they might not be prevented fighting ; but they forced him back by order of the House, when he would not retract a syllable, said he had said nothing but what was on record, and declared he would be sent to prison rather than retract. Lord North said a few faint words for Lord George, though he owned he had been disorderly. Mr. BuUer was for committing LuttreU, but most condemning Lord George ; the latter made apologies, and called LuttreU his noble friend, which the latter re jected with great indignation. The confusion lasted above two hours, when Luttrell was forced to disclaim any further resentment. Duel between Lord George Germain and Governor Johnstone. \u2014 On December 14th, 1770, Lord George Germain moved, in the House of Commons, \" That the Speaker do write to such eldest sons and heirs apparent of peers, King's serjeants, and masters in Chancery, as are members of this House, and to the Attorney and Solicitor General, and to request them to attend in their places every day, at two of the clock, and to assist in carrying bills to the Lords.\" The honour of the nation, he said, was concerned in this. \u2014 Governor Johnstone won- * The Lord George of the Gordon Eiots."], [671, "VARIETIES. 651 dered that the noble lord should interest himself so deeply in the honour of the nation, when he had been hitherto so regardless of his own. \u2014 These words occasioned a duel, the particulars of which are given in the \" Par liamentary History.\" On the 17th, while Governor Johnstone was attending a committee, he received a message from Lord George, when it was arranged that they should meet in the Ring, in Hyde Park, an hour afterwards \u2014 the weapons to be pistols, as the governor was suffering from a wouud in his arm. The antagonists having prepared their pistols, Lord George caUed on the governor to fire, which the governor refused, saying that, as his lordship brought him there, he must fire first. Shots were then exchanged, neither of which took effect. Lord George then fired his second pistol, and as he was taking down his arm, the governor's second ball hit his lordship's pistol, broke some part of it, and one of the splinters grazed his hand. The seconds immediately interposed, and the affair was ended. Political Duelling Clubs. \u2014 A singular story is told by Sir Jonah Barrington, of the duelling clubs proposed respectively by the Unionists and their opponents, during the debates in the Irish Parliament in 1799. Sir Jonah describes a dinner given by Lord Castlereagh, at his house in Merrion-street, at which were entertained above eighty of his most staunch friends, consisting of \" tried men,\" and men of \" fighting families,\" who might feel an individual pride in resenting every per sonality of the Opposition, and in identifying their own honour with that of the Government. When the wine had been sufficiently circulated, the great question of the evening was skilfully introduced by Sir John Blaquiere (afterwards Lord Blaquiere), who of all men was best calcu lated to promote a gentlemanly, convivial, fighting conspiracy. Having sent round many loyal, mingled with joyous and exhilarating toasts, he stated that he understood the Opposition were disposed to personal nnkiudness, or even incivilities, towards his Majesty's best friends\u2014 tho Unionists of Ireland. He was determined that no man should advance upon him, by degrading the party he had adopted and the measure he was pledged to support. A fuU bumper proved his sincerity ; the subject was discussed with great glee, and some of the company began to feel zeal for \" active service.\" It was also proposed, before they broke up, that there should be a dinner for twenty or thirty every day in one of the committee chambers, where they could be always at hand to make up a House, or for any emergency which should call for an unexpected reinforcement during any part of the discussion. The -novel idea of such a detachment of legislators was considered whimsical and humorous, aud, of course, was not rejected. After much wit, and many flashes of convivial bravery, tho meeting separated after midnight, fully resolved to eat, driuk, speak, and fight for Lord Castlereagh. They so far kept their word that the sup porters of the Union indisputably showed more personal spirit than their opponents during the session. Sir Jonah professes to have had this stoiy on the morning after the dinner, from one of the company, and he goes on to describe the opposition meeting which was held at Charlemont House on the following day. He assures us that when the plan reported"], [672, "652 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. to have been resolved on by the Castle party was explained, it was hotly contended by some that the partisans of Government should be taken at their word, and that the measure of the legislative Union should be submitted to the ordeal of battle, and discussed, not in speeches in the Parliament House, but with pistols in the \" fifteen acres \"\u2014a name given to a portion of the Ph\u0153nix Park, near Dublin, a favourite resort of duellists. Amenities of the Irish Parliament. \u2014 The personalities which took place in the Irish Parliament, frequently leading to duels, far eclipsed anything of a similar kind recorded of the English House of Commons. Two or three examples may be given, in addition to those which are to be found in other portions of this volume. In the passage which occurred between Fitzgibbon (Attorney-General) and Curran in 1789, the former remarked, \" A mountebank with but one half the honourable gentleman's theatrical talent for rant would undoubtedly make his fortune. However, I am somewhat surprised he should entertain such a particular asperity against me, as I never did him any favour. But perhaps the- honourable gentleman imagines he may talk himself into consequence ; if so, I should be sorry to obstruct his promotion ; he is heartily welcome to attack me. One thing, however, I wiU assure him, that I hold him in so small a degree of estimation, either as a man or a lawyer, that I shall never here after deign to make him any answer.\" Curran replying in similar terms, a challenge from Fitzgibbon foUowed (p. 196).: \u2014 Mr. George Ponsonby (afterwards Lord Chancellor of Ireland) was for a time leader of the Opposition in the Irish House, and was once thus answered by Toler (Lord Norbury) : \" What ! was it come to this \u2014 that iu the Irish House of Commons they should listen to one of their own members degrading the character of au Irish gentleman by language that was but fit for hallooing on a mob ? Had he heard a man out of doors using such lan guage as that by which the honourable gentleman had violated the decorum of Parliament, he would have seized the ruffian by the throat and dragged him to the dust.\" \u2014 But the most striking specimen of this class of oratory was once given by Mr. Martin of Galway. Ponsonby's sister was seated with other ladies in tho gallery of the house, when Martin thus broke forth : \" These Ponsonbys are the curse of my country. They are pro stitutes, personally and politically \u2014 from that toothless old hag who is now grinning in the gaUery, to the white-livered scoundrel who is now shiver ing on the floor.\" Short Temper and Long Sword. \u2014 Hutchinson, having taken offence at something said by Lucas in the Irish Parliament, concluded a severe reply by saying of him, \" Ready to wound, but yet afraid to strike; a shattered understanding, a warm head, and a cold heart.\" Lucas could not gain self-possession enough to answer this, and he had recourse to fighting instead. He selected as his second Mr. Adderly, who had no idea of danger, and was determined that Lucas should have none either. Accordingly, he kept Lucas with him, and would not aUow him to return to his wife. Lucas, however, who had lost the use of his legs, determmed to fight with a very long sword, which he chose for the occasion. Mr."], [673, "VARIETIES. 653 Adderly also provided him with a case of pistols, and thus doubly prepared him for the encounter. The matter, however, was adjusted by the seconds, to the satisfaction of all parties. \u2014 Grattan's Life and Times. Swearing the Peace against a Member.\u2014 A story is told of a member of the Irish Parliament, who regularly commenced the session by swearing the peace against General A . The friendly magistrate before whom this was usually done having died, a stranger succeeded, who, after the ceremony had been gone through as usual, thought it only equal justice to bind over the civilian also. \" Sir, I have no bail here,\" observed the latter. \" Oh ! don't lock him up,\" said the general; \" I'll be his bail that he'll never break the peace to myself or any other of his Majesty's subjects.\" Members and the Mob. \u2014 Mr. Bramston, the son of the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, relates what he saw on the 27th December, 1641, as members were entering the house. \" I was witness to a lane,\" he says, \" made in both the Palace Yards, and no man could pass but whom the rabble gave leave to, crying, A good lord ! or A good man ! Let him pass ! I did see the Bishop of Lincoln's gown torne as he passed from the stair-head into the entry that leads to the Lords' house.\" Hissing a Minister. \u2014 The division on the first reading of Couway's motion for the repeal of the Stamp Act took place February 22, 1766, when it was carried by a majority of 275 against 167. Conway, as he left the house, was greeted by three loud cheers. On the other hand, hisses and revUings assailed Grenville. Horace Walpole, in his \" Memoirs,\" says : \" The crowd pressed on GrenvUle with scom and hisses. He, sweUing with rage aud mortification, seized the nearest man to him by the coUar. ProvidentiaUy the feUow had more humour than spleen. ' Well, if I may not hiss,' said he, ' at least I may laugh '\u2014and laughed in Grenvillc's face. The jest caught \u2014 had the fellow been surly and resisted, a tragedy had probably ensued.\" A Mob in the Irish House of Parliament.\u2014 Mr. O'Flanagan describes the popular ferment that broke out in Dublin, December 3, 1759, when the rumour got abroad of a contemplated union between Great Britain and Ireland. Having beset the passages of the Houses of Parlia ment, the mob proceeded to all the lengths that vulgar and depraved tastes could suggest. To show their contempt for the House, they brought a feeble old woman and seated her on the throne, where, Uke King Artaxemanes in \" Bombastes Furioso,\" they placed a pipe in her mouth, and insisted on her smoking. They made a sudden irruption into the House of Commons, and were about to make a bonfire of the Journals, when, by way of diversion, they proposed to hang Rigby, who on November 21 previously had been made Master of the Rolls. Rigby most likely got a hint of these lawless proceedings, and he prudently went into the country, so that when they went to his house with the determination of executing him on a gallows which they prepared for his use, be was not to be found. Exclusion of Scotch Judges from the Commons.\u2014 Dr. King relates :\u2014 I knew Mr. Erskine, my Lord Marr's brother; he was one of"], [674, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. \u25a0654 the judges in Scotland. However, he was by no means satisfied with this office, and determined to get a seat in the House of Commons, though to effect this he was previously obUged to resign his judgeship. For the Duke of Argyle, as soon as he was informed that my Lord Grange (Erskine's official title) had taken his measures so weU as to be sure of being elected uito Parliament, brought a biU into the House of Lords, which easily passed both Houses, to disqualify any judge of Scotland to \u25a0sit in the House of Commons. A Qualification for Office. \u2014 Lord Sidmouth used occasionally to amuse his friends with stories of a weU-knowrn humorist, Mr. Ferguson of Pitfour, who held a seat in the House when his lordship was Speaker. That gentleman used to insist that the Government ought always to select a tall man to fiU the office of Lord Advocate. \" We Scotch members,\" he said, \" always vote with the Lord Advocate, and we require, therefore, to see him in a division. Now, I can see Mr. Pitt, and I can see Mr. Addington ; but I cannot see the Lord Advocate.\" Buried in Office. \u2014 On one occasion in the Irish Parliament, Mr. Denis Daly attacked Hussey Burgh, who had voted against a motion condemning the Embargo, having on a former occasion opposed it. Burgh at that time held office, and, alluding to him, Daly said, \" The Treasury bench resembles the grave ; it levels aU distinctions.\" A \" Broad-bottomed \" Administration. \u2014 On the formation of a Cabinet by Pulteney in 1742, discontent was excited by the omission of some of the leaders in the combination of the Whig and Tory parties which had overthrown Walpole, and a meeting was held on the subject at the Fountain Tavern in the Strand, at which the Duke of Argyle made the observation that the Administration should be founded upon the broad bottom of both parties. Horace Walpole wrote to Mann, \" One now hears of nothing but the broad bottom ; it is the reigning cant word, and means the taking of all parties and people indifferently into the Ministry.\" \" Subscription Ministries.\" \u2014 A hundred years after Horace Walpole, Mr. J. Croker wrote to a friend, under simUar circumstances : \" I think that it is part of our well understood, though unwritten, consti tution that a party which aspires to g-overn this country ought to have within itself the means of filling aU the offices, and I therefore disapprove of making a Subscription Ministry, to which every man may belong, without reference to his undisputed principles or practices.\" Party Names and Coalition Governments. \u2014 It appears from the privately-printed correspondence of the Earl of Aberdeen that, prior to the formation of his \" Coalition \" Ministry in 1853, some negotiation took place as to the basis on which it should be founded. Tho Duke of Newcastle suggested that the name of Whig as well as that of Peelite should be abandoned as far as possible, and merged in the general term \"Liberal,\" as the Tories had become \" Conservatives.\" But to this Lord John RusseU replied : \" As to the name of Whig \u2014 a name of which Mr. Pitt was as tenacious as Mr. Fox \u2014 it does not belong to me to give it up. If people do not continue to use that name, well and good. I shan't insist"], [675, "VARIETIES. 655 upon being called a Whig rather than a Liberal. We have no Whig Club \u2014 no other use of the word than ' quern vult usus.' I do not see the advantage of making any formal agreement on the subject.\" Lord Aberdeen thereupon remarked to the Duke of Newcastle : \" I have no doubt Mr. Pitt called himself a Whig \u2014 indeed, I know that he did so ; but, be this as it may, there is no public man on whom the Tory stamp is more indelibly placed. Lord John may do as he pleases, but he wiU be called a Whig to the end of his life. This is a title of which some persons are proud, but which at the present day reaUy means nothing at all. At all events, whatever it may mean, we do not become Whigs by acting with Lord John, nor does he become a Tory by acting with us. For my own part I have always repeated the lines of Pope as applicable to myself \u2014 ' In moderation placing all my glory, Tbe Tories call me Whig, the Whigs a Tory.' ': Ministerial Profligacy in the last Century. \u2014 The open pro- fligacy which tho public tolerated on the part of its leading statesmen, in the earlier years of George III., is thus referred to by Mr. Massey : \" The Duke of Grafton, some time at the head of his Majesty's Govern ment, was in the habit of appearing in public with his mistress, a common woman of the town. Lord Sandwich and Sir Francis Dashwood \u2014 the one successively Secretary of State and First Lord of the Admiralty, the other Chancellor of the Exchequer \u2014 were the most notoriously profligate men of their day. They were the founders of the Franciscan Club, an association of a few audacious men of fashion, for the purpose of cele brating a blasphemous burlesque upon the monastic system and the rites of the Church of Rome. They took a ruinous building in Buckingham shire, called Medmenham Abbey, which, as its name implies, had once been a religious house ; here they fitted up cells, assumed the habit of tbe order of St. Francis, and with grave mockery performed the ceremonies and observances of the conventual service. I need not describe the quality of the nuns who were admitted to participation in these solem nities, nor of the choruses which were chanted, nor of the images which represented the Virgin and the saints. Nor was this the passing freak of a few thoughtless young men of wit and fashion. The Franciscan Club was for some time the wonder and scandal of the town. It assembled several times, and comprised, besides Sandwich and Dashwood. such men as Wilkes, Potter, and Selwyn, most of whom were men of mature age.\" Ministers in their Cups. \u2014 The deep drinking which was a social custom in the time of the younger Pitt had its influence occasionaUy on the minister, whose habit it was to indulge liberaUy with his friends, when free from the occupations of state. An epigram of the time gave the following dialogue between Pitt and his colleague and boon companion Henry Dundas, afterwards Viscount MelviUe : Pitt. \u2014 \" I cannot see the Speaker, Hal ; can you ? \" Dundas. \u2014 \" Not see the Speaker, Billy ? I see two.\""], [676, "656 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Spoiling a Patriot. \u2014 Scott, the Irish Attorney-General (afterwards Earl of Clonmel), at one of the early coUege elections had taken a very active part on the popular side ; but after the accession of George III. he went round to the Government, and yielded to the solicitations of Lord Townshend, to whom he observed, with much humour and little regret, \" My lord, you have spoiled a good patriot.\" \u2014 Grattan's \" Life and Times.\" Jackdaws after Cheese. \u2014 Lord Treasurer Danby said of those who received Government pay, iu the Pensionary Parliament of Charles H., that \" they came about him like so many jackdaws for cheese, at the end of every session.\" A Cheap Supporter. \u2014 The foUowing is given in \" Anecdotes of the Earl of Chatham \" : \u2014 Towards the end of the session 1767, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Bradshaw, one day accosted Mr. Lowndes, member for Bucks, with, \" Sir, you have voted with us all the winter ; some return is usually expected on these occasions ; and, as we are much obliged to you for your constant support, if you choose to accept of two hundred lottery tickets, at ten pounds each, they are at your service.\" Mr. Lowndes bowed, expressed his great friendship for the secretary, and accepted the offer ; adding only that as the session was just at a close, he should, as soon as it was finished, go into the country on his private affairs, and begged the tickets might be sent to such a one, his banker ; which the secretary having promised to comply with, they parted. Mr. Lowndes, hearing nothing of the tickets, wrote to his banker, who re turned for answer that he had not received nor heard of any. Mr. Lowndes next wrote to Mr. Bradshaw, who, in his answer, \" begged a thousand pardons ; the matter had quite slipped his memory ; and the tickets were aU disposed of except five-and-twenty, which were at his service.\" Mr. Lowndes accepted the twenty -five, and they were sent to his banker's. By these tickets he probably cleared about one hundred pounds. A Charge of Corruption against Ministers.\u2014 In the course of a debate in committee on the 5th of May, 1853, the subject being the ex tension of the income tax to Ireland, Mr. Gavan Duffy opposed the measure, and said, \"No doubt some few Irish members have voted con scientiously. But, short as my experience in this House has been, I must say I do not believe that, in the worst days of Walpole or the Pelhams, more scandalous corruption existed than I have seen practised under my own eyes upon Irish members.\" This announcement produced great uproar, and Mr. J. Ball moved \" that the words be taken down.\" \u2014 Lord John RusseU observed that if Mr. Duffy meant to refer to any members he ought to name them ; to which Mr. Duffy replied that he would if the chairman of the committee called on him to do so. \u2014 Lord Palmerston, however, suggested that the honourable member shoidd withdraw the words, which were uttered in the heat of debate ; a proposal which Mr. Duffy declined to adopt, stating that he had spoken the truth, and would not unsay it. An exciting debate followed, after which the words were taken down, and the chairman being ordered to report progress, the House"], [677, "VARIETIES. 657 resumed, when the occurrence was reported to the Speaker, who asked Mr. Duffy whether he had any explanation to offer, or would retract. \u2014 Mr. Duffy declined either alternative, but said that if the House would give him a committee, he would lay before them the facts upon which his conclusions were founded. He then withdrew. \u2014 Lord John Russell thought that, under the circumstances, ulterior proceedings ought not to be suggested by a member of the Government, whereupon Mr. Disraeli proposed that Mr. Duffy should bo called in and desired to state the names of the members upon whom he considered the Government had acted in a corrupt manner. \u2014 On the motion of Mr. Wortley the debate was adjourned till next day. The House was then crowded by persons anxious to -witness the sequel of the affair. The Speaker having caUed on Mr. Duffy to explain his words, the honourable member said that he did not wish to avoid the responsibility of proving them ; that he had not intended to convey the meaning of money having been paid, but that certain Irish members had been induced to abandon solemn and circumstantial pledges in order to accept place. This he considered had been done for their own personal advantage, and he could only regard it as political corrup tion. If he had broken the rules of the House he regretted it.' \u2014 Lord John Russell thought that as Mr. Gavan Duffy did not mean to impute pecuniary corruption, there was no reason to induce the House to carry the matter further, and so the affair dropped. Secret Service Money to Members. \u2014 In a discussion in the House of Lords on a bill for the extension of Owens College, Manchester (March 8, 1870), Lord Romilly, Master of the RoUs, made some remarks on the legislation of Parliament on private bills, which he thought was very unsatisfactory. \" A great objection to private legislation was that it only assisted those who could produce a very large sum of money \u2014 for he did not believe any private biU, if opposed, could pass at a less expense than 1000?. These were judicial functions, and should bo treated as such ; but no body of persons wrere so incompetent to perform judicial functions properly as committees of the House of Commons. He might mention a very serious fact that had come under his consideration. Shortly after he had the honour of a seat on the bench, an eminent raUway company having got into a dispute with one of its directors, he had to take the accounts between them in the Court of Chancery. In going over these accounts he found the item of 10.000?. for secret service money paid to members of Parliament. The director stated in his affidavit that the money had been paid; he disbelieved him, aud be disallowed the item; and he only mentioned the circumstance then, in order to show the scandal that arose from the present system of private legislation.\" The Ballot Question brought Home. \u2014 On going into committee on the BaUot Bill in February, 1872, Mi-. C. Bentinck moved that it be an instruction to the committee that they had power to provide that votes in divisions of the House of Commons be taken by ballot. He argued that it would protect members from the dictation of the Treasury Bench, as well as of the constituencies; and said there were precedents for his motion in the occasional practice of foreign Assemblies. Mr. Forster, on u u"], [678, "658 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. behalf of the Government, said the honourable gentleman bad been amusing the House with a political jeu d'esprit, while it had serious business before it ; but Mr. G. Bentinck came to the defence of his relative with the assertion that \" more corruption, more bribery, and more intimidation were practised within the walls of that House than in all the con stituencies of England put together.\" The Speaker, in response to the cries of the House, called on him to withdraw the statement ; when Mr. Bentinck said that if he had used an unparliamentary expression he begged to withdraw it, but he begged to repeat (laughter) that there had been habitually practised within the walls of every other House of Commons except the present (laughter) intimidation and corruption. He regretted the House had not the courage to discuss the proposition. \u2014 The motion was then put and negatived. A Bashful Member. \u2014 Sir Simonds D'Ewes relates that a bill was brought in \" to avoid double payment of debts,\" and to this bdl Mr. Zacharias Locke began to speak, \" but for very fear shook so that he could not proceed, but stood still a while, aud at length sat down.\" A First and Last Speech. \u2014 Lord North's son, Frederick, after wards Lord Guilford, said, \" I once attempted to speak in Parliament, and it was not unnatural when I rose that my family name should at once fix every eye upon me. I brought out two or three sentences, when a mist seemed to rise before my eyes ; I then lost my reeoUection, and could see nothing but the Speaker's wig, which swelled, and swelled, and swelled till it covered the whole House. I then sank back on my seat, and never attempted another speech, but quickly accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, assured that Parliament was not my vocation.\" Turning a Failure to Account.\u2014 The third Earl of Shaftesbury (author of the \" Characteristics \") sat in the House of Commons as Lord Ashley at the end of the seventeeth century. Speaking there on a bill for granting counsel to prisoners in cases of high treason, he broke down, and we are told in the \" Parliamentary History \" : \u2014 \"The House, after giving him a little time to recover his confusion, called loudly upon him to go on, when ho proceeded to this effect : ' If, sir (addressing himself to the Speaker), I, who rise only to give my opinion on the bill now depending, am so confounded that I am unable to express the least of what I proposed to say, what must the condition of that man be, who, without any assistance, is pleading for his life, and under apprehension of being deprived of it ? \" The Inspiration of Claret. \u2014 On a debate in the House of Lords on the impeachment of Lord Treasurer Danby, in 1678, the Earl of Carnar von made what is recorded as \" a very peculiar speech.\" (Parliamentary Debates, 1668-1741.) \" Ho is said never to have spoken before in that House ; but having been eased with wine, and more excited to display his abilities by the Duke of Buckingham (who meant no favour to the Treasurer, but only ridicule), wras resolved before he went up to speak upon any subject that would offer itself. Accordingly he stood up. and delivered himself to this effect : ' My lords, I understand but little of Latin, but a good deal of English, and not a little of the English history;"], [679, "VARIETIES. 659 from which I have learnt the mischiefs of such kind of prosecutions as these, and the iU fate of the prosecutors. I could bring many instances, and those very ancient ; but, my lords, I shaU go no further back than the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign : At which time the Earl of Essex was run down by Sir Walter Rawleigh, and your lordships very well know what became of Sir Walter Rawleigh. My Lord Bacon, he ran down Sir Walter Rawleigh, and your lordships know what became of my Lord Bacon. The Duke of Buckingham, he ran down my Lord Bacon, and your lordships know what happened to the Duke of Buckingham, Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, ran down the Duke of Buckingham, and you all know what became of him. Sir Hariy Vane, he ran down the Earl of Strafford, and your lordships know what became of Sir Harry Vaue. Chancellor Hyde, he ran dowu Sir Harry Vane, and your lordships known what became of the ChanceUor. Sir Thomas Osbourn, now Earl of Danby, ran down Chancellor Hyde ; but what wiU become of the Earl of Danby your lordships best can tell. But let me see that man that dare run the Earl of Danby down, and we shaU soon see what wiU become of him.' \u2014 This (says the report) being pronounced with a remarkable humour and tone, the Duke of Buckingham, both surprised and disappointed, after his way cried out, ' The man is inspired ! and claret has done the business.\"' Deep Waters. \u2014 In the old days (remarks Townsend) long intervals of sUence were not unusual. In the aucient reports we meet with these passages frequently : \" Alter silentium, a long while.\" \u2014 \" A pause for two or three minutes.\" \u2014 \" The House sat looking at each other.\" \u2014 \" We are,\" said an old county member, \" like deep waters, the deeper the silenter.\" A Twice-told Tale. \u2014 An amusing instance of loquacity is mentioned by the Rev. G. Garrard, in writing in 1633 to Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Lord Strafford, who was at that time the lord deputy in Ire land. \"I'll end,\" he says, \"fearing I have now, at the month's end, run into the same error which I condemned in old Sir George Moore in time of Parliament, who, as your lordship may remember, would about eleven of the clock rise up, and make repetition of all that bad been spoken that day.\" Long-winded Oratory. \u2014 Mr. Townsend mentions that an intermin able orator, haranguing to empty benches, whispered to a friend, \" I am speaking to posterity.\" \" If you go on at this rate,\" replied his friend, \"you will see your audience before you.\"\u2014 When Hartley, the most prosaic of orators (p. 451), had aU but cleared the House, and wished some clause of the Riot Act to be read, \" You have read it already,\" exclaimed Burke ; \" the mob is dispersed ! \" A Long Speech Cut Short.\u2014 Mr. Greville relates the following : A certain bishop in tho House of Lords rose to speak, and announced that he should divide what he had to say into twelve parts, when the Duke of Wharton interrupted him, and begged he might be indulged for a few minutes, as he had a story to tell which he could only introduce at that moment. A druuken fellow was passing by St. Paul's at night, and heard the clock slowly chiming twelve. He counted the strokes, and u u 2"], [680, "660 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. when it had finished looked towards the clock, and said, \"D you, why couldn't, you give us all that at once ? \" There was an end of the bishop's story. Two Words. \u2014 Malone relates that Sir WiUiam Baker, an alderman of London, had a strong attack made upon him either by Pitt or some other eminent member of the House, who charged him with having made an immense sum by a fraudulent contract. Baker got up very quietly, and gained the House to his side by this short reply : \" Tho honourable gentleman is a great orator, and has made a long and serious charge against me. I am no orator, aud therefore shah only answer him in two words \u2014 Prove it.\" Having thus spoken, he sat down ; but there was something in his manner and tone that satisfied the House tho charge was a calumny. A Talkative Member. \u2014 Of a member of Parliament who, after having harangued for some hours in the House of Commons, came into ai company where Dr. Johnson was, and endeavoured to talk him down, the doctor said, \" This man has a pulse in his tongue.\" Silent Members. \u2014 General Forester, who for forty-six years repre sented Much Wenlock, was said not to have addressed the House once during that period. Sir Charles Burrell, who for a time was \" father \" of the House, in wdiich he had sat for nearly sixty years, spoke but once in that period, when he introduced a bill providing that housemaids should not be compelled to clean windows from tho outside. A Possibly Good Speech, \u2014 In the Irish Protection Bill debate in January, 1881, Mr. Bright thus referred to a speech on the subject bv Mr. Cowen, member for Newcastle : \" Ho reminded me of tho late Lord Ribblesdale, who, when in this House, was a very fluent speaker. I recall one occasion when he made a speech, and when an honourable member sitting near me said, ' Ho makes a very good speech if you do not listen to what he says.' I thought of that when I was listening to the speech of the honourable member for Newcastle.\" A Terrible Threat. \u2014 Mr. Peter Borthwick, addressing tho House on one occasion amid great interruption, told them that if they did not allow him to finish his speech in his own way, he would not leave off at all. The House was so amused at this notion that the honourable member was permitted to go on, and bring his remarks to a conclusion. Limitation of Speeches.\u2014 In July, 18S0, Mr. Biddell (member for West Suffolk) asked whether, having regard to the little business done and the much talking there had been in tho House, the Primo Minister would consider tho propriety of limiting speeches to ten minutes ; such rule not to apply to members of the Government or of the late Govern ment, or to members making- motions, and to be adopted for that session only. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone, referring to tho substitution of ten minutes for seven in the question, remarked that the merciful qualities of the honourable member led him to progressive modifications. The honourable member woidd be prepared to hoar that the Government was not prepared to make any such recommendation. At the same time, he did not think that that was quite au adequate answer to the question. He regarded the question"], [681, "VARIETIES. 661 as an indication of a growing sentiment in the House (cheers) that there were obstacles, not to free discussion, but to the transaction of she business of the House, some of them of a general and some of them of a special and rather formidable character, and that matter, growing to greater aggravation, might be one to call for serious attention. (Cheers.) Criticism on Two Orators. \u2014 Sir John Lubbock, presiding over a meeting of the Greenwich Liberal Association in 1883, quoted two smart sayings respecting the oratory of Mr. Gladstone and that of his greatest opponent. He said, \" Mr. Gladstone had recently been accused of a want of common sense and conciseness. Well, his speeches might not be short, but few ever found them too long. When the same objection was made \u25a0once before, it was said that Mr. Gladstone seemed not to prepare his speeches beforehand, but to think them out while he was on his legs. The reply was, ' Well, you see, it is the only leisure time he has.' (Laughter.) Moreover, Mr. Gladstone's speeches were full of instruction and sound argument. This could not always be said of his opponents, however \u25a0eloquent. On another occasion a Tory was praising one of Lord Beaconsfield's speeches to Mr. Bright, especially on account of its wit. ' Oh, yes,' said Mr. Bright, ' his chaff is excellent, but his wheat is abominable.' \" Misplaced Cheers. \u2014 Mr. Lucy, in his \"Diary of Two Parlia ments,\" relates that, one evening in the session of 1884, Mr. Stansfeld (member for Halifax, and formerly a Minister under Mr. Gladstone) \"was showing how scurvily his personal loyalty had been treated when the Prime Minister had declined to imperil the Franchise Bill by tacking on to it a provision for the enfranchisement of women. ' I have,' he said, ' been among tho most sincere members of the party of the right honour able gentleman at the head of the Government,' Mr. Gladstone, with kindest intention, turned round and loudly expressed assent. ' I have never thwarted him in any of his great purposes.' 'Hear, hear!' Mr. Gladstone cried, turning round again and nodding with increased vigour. Affected almost to tears by this friendly and public recognition by his former chief, Mr. Stansfeld proceeded\u2014' I have given the Government ungrudging support.' 'Hear, hoar!' cried tho iudefatigable Premier. \u2022 Thouo-h,' Mr. Stansfeld continued, in a quivering voice, ' I have placed no value upon it.' ' Hear, hear, hear ! ' cried Mr. Gladstone, getting into the swing of tho thing, and not perceiving whither his generous fervour had led him. This was a welcome interlude for a House already depressed, and the laughter grew uproarious when the Premier rose and gravely explained that he had not meant that he placed no value upon Mr. Stans feld's services, but, on the contrary, estimated them at high value.\" Classical Quotations in the House.\u2014 Sir Stafford Northcote wrote in his diary in 1880, while on a visit to Lord Beaconsfield at Hughenden : \" We lamented tho disuse of classical quotations in the House of Commons. He said he had at one time tried to revert to them, but tho Speaker (Denison) had asked him not. ' Why ? Do you think they don't like it ? ' ' Oh no ! the House rather likes it ; but you are making John RusseU restless, and I am afraid of his taking to it too."], [682, "662 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. He gave us six or seven lines of Virgil the other night, which had not the smallest connection with his speech, or with the subject.' \" Parliamentary and Unparliamentary Language. \u2014 A daily paper remarked, during the session of 1884: \" Old-fashioned people would be inclined to describe 'Parliamentary language' as something especially dignified, courteous, and self-respecting ; but fashions change quickly nowa days, and modern Parliamentary language is quite another sort of thing. Irish members may flatter themselves that the example they have been setting for some years has at length spread even to the front benches. Yes terday (July 13), for want of a better term, Sir Stafford Northcote \u2014 who of all men is least given to the use of strong language, and whose language is, as a rule, Parliamentary in the old sense \u2014 distinctly charged the Prime Minister with ' misrepresentation.' * Mr. Gladstone was much hurt. ' A phrase of that kind spoken across the table is not usual between persons of his position and mine,' he said ; and he went on afterwards to speak of Lord Randolph Churchill's ' foul language.' The occupant of the chair, on being appealed to, ' did not think the Prime Minister would insist on using the term,' which was afterwards modified.\" \" Dirty Trick.\" \u2014 An expression used by Sir WiUiam Harcourt sotto voce to a colleague, with reference to a proceeding on the part of the Opposition in the session of 1884, was repeated in the House some time after by Sir Robert Peel (brother to the lately-elected Speaker). He complained that, in spite of the distinct pledge of the Prime Minister, tho report of a certain Irish vote had been taken after half-past eleven o'clock at night. He begged to ask the Solicitor-General for Ireland what he had to say about what t!ie Home Secretary would call this \" dirty trick.\" (Cries of \" Order.\") \u2014 The Speaker : I do not think that is an expression which ought to be used. (Cries of \" Withdraw.\") \u2014 Sir Robert Peel : The expression was used by the Home Secretary a short time ago, and I merely quoted it. \u2014 The Speaker: Tho expression is both unparliamentary and improper. The Homo Secretary withdrew it, and I hope it will not bo used again. \u2014 Sir Robert Peel : Certainly. I was not aware that the Home Secretary had withdrawn it. I withdraw it, and apologise for having used it. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone, replying, denied that he had given an absolute pledge in tho matter. Company Directors in Parliament. \u2014 On the 8th of March, 1892, Mr. MacNeill called the attention of the Committee (iu Supply) to an infraction of the rights of the House a few nights before by three honour able members, who, being directors of, or having a pecuniary interest in, the East Africa Company, voted in the division on a vote in aid of surveys for a railway from Mombasa to the Victoria Nyanza. After quoting numerous precedents, he moved that the votes of Mr. Burdett- Coutts, Sir L. PeUy, aud Sir J. Puleston be disallowed. \u2014 Sir J. Puleston said, if he had given the matter a moment's thought he would have * With reference to a remark he, at a gathering of the Liberal party, had attributed to Lord Salisbury, that the latter \" could not discuss redistribution with a rope round his neck.\""], [683, "VARIETIES. 663 abstained from taking part in the division. Nevertheless, he thought he was justified in the vote he gave. \u2014 Mr. Burdett-Coutts pointed out that the money voted would not be paid to the company. \u2014 Sir L. PoUy said, aU the company wanted was that a railway should pass through the territory in order that trade might be encouraged and slavery suppressed. \u2014 The Chairman : In accordance with the practice of the House, the three members will now retire. (Opposition cheers and laughter.) The members (all of whom sat on the Conservative side) then withdrew. \u2014 Mr. Morton was making some remarks on the subject when, by the rule applicable to morning sittings, the sitting was suspended. A few days after, Mr. MacNeiU renewed the motion he had made, that the votes of the three members be disallowed. \u2014 Mr. Balfour observed that this was not a discussion in which the Government wished to take part, as ques tions of this kind were always left for the decision of the House. But he referred to the case of Mr. Plunket, whose vote on a North- Western Railway Bill was allowed, although ho was a director of the company. \u2014 Mr. Gladstone said, the upshot of the right honourable gentleman's speech was that tho rule prohibiting members from voting upon questions in which they were personally interested ought to be abrogated. In Mr. Plunket's case he thought the vote was properly allowed, because that gentleman's interest in tho North- Western Company was remote and uncertain. \u2014 The ChanceUor of the Exchequer (Mr. Goschen) explained that the Government were of opinion that the existing rule should bo maintained. He thought, however, that in the present instance tho House would do well to adhere to the precedent in the case of the North- Westem Railway. \u2014 The Committee presently divided, and the resolution was carried by a majority of 5, the numbers being \u2014 Ayes, 154 ; Noes, 149. The announcement of the numbers was received by loud Opposition cheers. An Artist on a Canvass. \u2014 Dr. Doran, in a note to his edition of Walpole's \" Journals,\" relates the following mot of George Selwyn's : A report was circulated to the effect that Sir Joshua Reynolds was to stand for Plympton on the next occasion of an election. The maecaronies, club-men, and \" gentlemen \" generally laughed at the idea of an artist, or of a literary man, presuming or having a chance to get into the House of Commons. \" He is not to be laughed at, however,\" said Selwyn : \" he may very well succeed in being elected, for Sir Joshua is the ablest man I know on a canvas.\" PoUtics in the Pulpit.\u2014 In the \" Journals of Caroline Fox \" she writes, under date June 12, 1838 : \" Had tho pleasure of meeting the Buxton family. Fowell Buxtou described his non-election at Weymouth as a most pathetic time. When he made his parting speech he began in a jocose fashion, but soon saw that that would not do, as one old man after another turned aside to cry. On tho Sunday he went to church, and listened to a most violent sermon against himself, person and principle. He spoke afterwards to one of his party ou the bad taste of introducing politics into the pulpit. In this he quite agreed, but added 'You had better say nothing on the subject, as at all Dissenting chapels they are"], [684, "664 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. telling the people that they are sure to go to a very uncomfortable place if they don't vote for you.' \" Southey Vacating his Seat. \u2014 A singular method of vacating a seat (says Sir T. E. May) was that of Mr. Southey, who in 1826 had been elected for Downton, during his absence on the Continent. His return was not questioned, but he addressed a letter to the Speaker, in which he stated he had not the qualification of estate required by law. The House waited until after the expiration of the time limited for presenting election petitions, and then issued a new writ for the borough. \u2014 The property qualification was abolished in 1858. \"Once a Carrier.\" \u2014 Burnet says, Colonel Birch, who sat iu tho House of Commons in 1675, had a coarse but ready wit, with which he retorted without distinction on all assailants. A reflection having been made in the House upon his former occupation of a carrier, Birch replied, with justifiable contempt, \" It is very true, as that gentleman says, I once was a carrier, and let mo tell that gentleman it is very fortunate for him that he never was a carrier ; for if he had, he would have been a carrier still.\" A Disreputable Representative. \u2014 In the pension-list of Charles II. (writes Oldfield) the following paragraph appeared : \" Sir John Holmes, Sir Robert's brother, and member for Newton (Isle of Wight), a cowardly, baffled sea-captain, twice boxed and once whipped with a dog-whip, was chosen in the night without the head-officer of tho town, and but one burgess present; yet voted this last election, and will be re-elected.\" \"Avoiding Death\" and Avoiding Arrest. \u2014 A Mr. Asgill was expelled in 1707 for having published a \" Treatise on the Possibility of Avoiding Death,\" the same fate, on tho same ground, having previously befallen him iu tho Irish Parliament. He had been an attorney, and was bequeathed a considerable sum of money by Dr. Barbon (who built the New Square of Lincoln's Inn) on condition that he would pay none of the testator's debts. He called the creditors together in Lincoln's Inn Hall, read the will, and told them \" he would religiously fulfil the wishes of the dead.\" Barbon had purchased the borough of Bramber, consisting of a single street, and Asgill availed himself of this property to secure a seat in the House of Commons, and with it the privilege of freedom from arrest. Officers were in waiting to take him when his expulsion occurred, but he managed to make his escape. A Grateful Representative.\u2014 Mr. Ellice, who died in 1880, after having represented the St. Andrew's Burghs for upwards of forty years, bequeathed mourning rings, value 10?. each, to several gentlemen in recog nition of their support during his long political connection with tho borough ; and also, as a mark of remembrauce, 5?. each to any others who voted for him at his first election in 1837. An IUiterate Member.\u2014 Lord WiUiam Poulet, though often chair man of committees of the House of Commons, was a great dunce, and could scarcely read. Having to read a bill for naturalising Jemima, Duchess of Kent, he called her Jeremiah, Duchess of Kent. \u2014 Walpoliana."], [685, "VARIETIES. 665 Slow Perception. \u2014 Mr. Clayton, the husband of the Queen's favourite (temp. George IL), got into Parliament and made himself useful to the Ministry, for which he received ample recompense. He became one of the Lords of the Treasury, and, though remarkable for nothing but dulness, was eventually created an Irish baron, with the title of Sundon. Bubb Doddington was once reproved by a brother Commissioner of the Treasury for not doing justice to Lord Sundon's quickness of perception, as he had laughed at something Doddington had just uttered. \"No, no,\" exclaimed Doddington, \" my Lord Sundon is now only appreciating a jest I made last Treasury day.\" The Geese and the Oats. \u2014 Henry, youngest son of the second Viscount Falkland, was so thoughtlessly extravagant, that he sold his father's admirable library for a horse and a mare. He was not, however, without parts, as the following anecdote wUl show. Being brought early iuto the House of Commous, as member for Oxfordshire, and a grave senator objecting to his youth, and to his not looking as if he had sowed his wild oats, he replied, \" Then I am come to the properest place, where are so many geese to pick them up.\" The Mystery of the Hat. \u2014 Mr. John O'ConneU relates the following : One of the Irish members, a man of considerable wealth, was singularly negligent in his dress ; wearing habiliments, and especially a hat, of very ancient date. This gentleman had occasion several times to caU at the Irish office, and had always been received with the courtesy that marked the noble lord (Morpeth, afterwards Earl of Carlisle) then at the head of that office. About the middle of 1835, Mr. R. (the member in question) caUed, and after the usual courtesies Lord Morpeth looked inquiringly at his visitor. \" I am como to thank your lordship,\" said the latter, answering the look ; \" I am greatly obliged to your lordship ! \" \" Oh-h-h ! Mr. R.,\" said Lord Morpeth, not recollecting what he was thanked for, but supposing it must be some attention to one of Mr. R.'s recommendations, \" I shall be always happy to be of any service in my power.\" \" I am much obliged to your lordship ; I did not mistake your motive for a moment ; and I shall always be obliged to your lordship for such communications.\" The mystified secretary stared a little, but, seeing that his visitor appeared thorougldy in earnest, he made the best of it by again bowing, and expressing his desire always to give similar satisfaction. \"I am quite sure of it, and I am, I beg again to say, greatly obliged to your lordship ; and hero, my lord, is\u2014 my hat.\" \" Your hat, Mr. R. ! \" \u25a0\u2022 Yes, my lord. I hopo your lordship approves of it.\" \" Oh-h ! Cer tainly, Mr. R., it is a very nice hat indeed\u2014 very\u2014 but \" \"I am glad your lordship likes it. I assure you I took great pains to get ono which you would consider unobjectionable, and to prove what a value I place upon your advice\" \"My advice, Mr. R. ! \" (looking aghast, and half inclined to ring the bell)-\" My advice ! \" \" Yes, my lord, according to your own note here.\" And to Lord Morpetb's amazement he was handed a note, addressed as from himself to Mr. R., representing in the kindest manner that such was the writer's solicitude for the proper estimation of the Irish M.P.'s, that he was induced to step beyond"], [686, "666 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. the limits, not only of his office, but of the privileges of ordinary acquaintance, to suggest in strict confidence to Mr. R. \" that his hat was not exactly what a gentleman of his position and wealth ought to wear.\" An Apple-stall Question in Parliament. \u2014 In July, 1851, Mr. Bemal Osborne put a question to Lord Seymour, the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, respecting the eviction of Ann Hicks from Hyde Park, to which the noble lord replied in substance as follows : \u2014 In 1843, Ann Hicks had a little stall where she sold apples and ginger beer in the Park ; subsequently, on application to the Commissioners, she obtained permission to erect a wooden stand in which to lock up her commodities. Step by step, and in accordance with successive concessions made to the pertinacity of Mrs. Hicks, the stand of wood became a stand of brick \u2014 the stand of brick a small hut five feet in height \u2014 the roof of the hut, under pretence of repairing a leak, acquired further elevation, and was surmounted by a chimney. A bit of garden ground seems to have been the next object of Ann's cupidity, and this she took upon herself to appropriate, enclosing it with hurcUes. The hurdles were continuaUy advancing and encroaching upon the Park, in proportion to the forbear ance of the authorities and the acquisitiveness of Mrs. Ann Hicks. Such a state of things could not, of course, be permitted to continue. The Duke of Wellington, as Ranger of the Park, the Crown solicitors, and the Commissioners had to bring into exercise their combined powers, and a small sum of money had to be paid by way of compensatiou, before the intruder could be ejected. The woman, it appeared, made some pretence of holding a house in the Park by the gift of George II. , but this had no further foundation than her own delusion or invention. A Family Incident. \u2014 A peculiar circumstance was related by General Scott, afterwards Commander-in-Chief of the American army, as having occurred whde he occupied a seat in the gaUery of the House of Commons during the session of 1828 : \" On a sudden he was startled by the unexpected uprising of an aged member, who, not without many apologies for being out of order, averred that the assembly he was addressing was itself honoured by the announcement he was about to make. The purport of it was that the wife of Mr. Coke, who was nominaUy the ' father ' of the House, had just presented her husband with a fine boy \u2014 ' a circumstance,' continued the speaker, ' equally gratifying to the venerable member for Norfolk and to the House of which he has so long been a distinguished ornament.' \" Constituents Visiting the House. \u2014 A curious scene occurred at the House of Commons on a Monday in August, 1883. Mr. Arthur Peel, member for Warwick,* had engaged to take forty of his constituents over the House, to acquaint them with the arrangements. What followed was thus described in a daily newspaper : \" Yesterday morning Mr. Peel was surprised to learn that one train had left with 300 persons, and that * Youngest son of Sir Robert, the Prime Minister. He was elected Speaker in 1884."], [687, "VARIETIES. 667 another was leaving with an equaUy extensive freight. Upon their arrival at Westminster the impression for the moment was that they formed a provincial demonstration in favour of Mr. Bradlaugh. A little inquiry on the part of the police soon removed this misapprehension, and Mr. Peel and the police together proved equal to the emergency. The members of the party, including many women who carried children in their arms, were conducted in relays by Mr. Peel through the principal apartments of the House, and were much interested in what they saw. A similar scene, it is said, has never before been witnessed at tho House.\" A Parliamentary Application of Telegraphy. \u2014 On the 23rd of June, 1884, Mr. Gladstone had set before the House of Commons the preliminary understanding arrived at between England and France as to the Conference of European Powers, summoned to discuss the affairs of Egypt a few days later. Lord Randolph ChurchiU, rising shortly after, introduced a novel feature into the proceedings by an action which was thus described in an evening journal: \"Tho noble lord \u2014 who for some time before he rose had been busily engaged in unwinding a sort of thin paper serpent, which coiled about his feet on tho floor \u2014 created a slight sensation by quoting the language used by M. Ferry in tho French Chamber only an hour or two before Mr. Gladstone spoke ; for the paper serpent turned out to be a telegraph-tape containing a message from Paris supplied by some kind friend, and giving a summary of M. Ferry's speech. Lord Randolph produced a considerable effect when he read out the French Premier's admisssion that the Dual Control died at the bombard ment of Alexandria, and that it is ' impossible to revive it ; ' and the effect was not decreased when, later on, he read out another choice extract giving M. Ferry's further admission that Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet is the one with which the French Government ' have the best chanco of settling the question.' \" Women in Parliament.\u2014 The ladies of birth aud quality sat in council (says Gurdon) with the Saxon Witas. In Wightred's great council at Bcconceld, A.D. 694, the Abbesses sat and deliberated, and five of them signed the decrees of that council, along with the King, bishops, and nobles. In Henry III. and Edward I.'s time four Abbesses were summoued to Parliament, viz., of Shaftesbury, Berking, St. Mary of Winchester, and of Wilton. In the 35th of Edward III. were summoned by writ to Parliament, to appear there by their proxies, Countess of Norfolk, Countess of Ormond, Countess of March, Countess of Pembroke, Countess of Oxford, aud Countess of Athole. Theso. ladies were called \" ad colloquium et tractatum by their proxies.\" Women as Witnesses.\u2014 On the 12th of February, 1620 (HatseU relates), Mr. Lovell complains that one Dayrell had threatened his person. He is brought to the bar, and denies the words charged against him. He is ordered to attend next day with his witnesses, one of whom proved to bo a woman. Mr. Crewo and Sir Edward Coke gravely opposed her being called in to be examined ; objecting, on the authority of St. Bernard, \" That a womau ought not to speak in the congregation.\" A committee was therefore appointed to go out and examine her at the door."], [688, "668 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. Women Petitioners. \u2014 The \" Parliamentary History \" records that on the 4th of February, 1641, a singular petition was presented to tho Commons, from several gentlewomen and tradesmen's wives in the City. On the last day of sitting these female zealots were observed to crowd much about the door of the Commons, and Sergeant-major Skippon, the commander of the g-uard, had applied to the House to know what to do with them, the women telling him that where there was one now, there would bo five hundred the next day, and that it was as good for them to die there as at home. The House advised him to speak them fair and send them homo again. But this day they were as good as their word ; they came down in great numbers and presented a petition to the Commons, which was received and read. The prayer of the petition was for the \"putting down of Popery and Idolatry.\"* The petition was presented by- Mrs. Anne Stagg, a gentlew-oman and brewer's wife. Mr. Pym came to the door and thanked them for the petition, promising that it would receive due attention, and requested the petitioners to return home. Women and the Franchise. \u2014 In June, 1883, this subject was brought forward by Mr. Hugh Mason, member for Ashton-under-Lyne, who moved, on going into Committee of Supply, a resolution to the effect that the Parliamentary franchise should be extended to women. In the debate which foUowed, the Attorney-General (Sir H. James) opposed the motion, and on a division there appeared \u2014 For, 114; against, 130. This was the first occasion on which tho question was brought before tho Parliament elected in 1880. The attendance was comparatively small, owing to a Queen's ball being held the same evening ; but more than eighty members had paired. \u2014 Early in the following Parliament (Feb. 18, 1886) the second reading of a Woman's Suffrage BiU was -carried without a division, after a motion for adjournment of the debate had been rejected by 159 to 102. The advocates of the bill were in strong muster, while its opponents were off their guard. (See Mr. Bright's remarks, p. 395.) A Rehearsal. \u2014 The London correspondent of the Manchester Courier stated, in June, 1884, that \"last evening [a Wednesday], when the black gowned Speaker left the chair at six o'clock, a bevy of ladies began to play at Parliament on the floor of the House. One in white attire took the chair, and looked charming in it. The others either took the clerks' seats, or stood at the table, or sat on the Ministerial benches. Not one of them had a fancy to betake herself to the cold shade of Opposition, until it was suggested that we required an Opposition to carry out our system of government. The officials of the House seemed quite delighted with the pretty little comedy, and a few members still lingering about seemed to see in the incident a foretaste of times to come.\" A Strawberry Fete at the House of Commons. \u2014 In the month * Butler alludes, most probably, to this circumstance in the following \u25a0couplet : \u2014 \" The oyster-women looked their fish up, And trudged away to cry, No bishop ! \""], [689, "VARIETIES. 669 of July, 1890, an unusual spectacle was witnessed on the terrace of the House of Commons overlooking the Thames. It was thronged with ladies, the guests of members, who entertained their fair friends to strawberries and cream, and tea or claret cup. The summer day being very fine, the scene, with its display of elegaut costume, was a very pretty one. But it would have greatly astonished many of the sedate members and Ministers of past times could they have risen from their graves to witness it. Mr. Fumiss (of Punch) amusingly depicted the consequences that ensued when the division bed rang for the immediate attendance writhin the House of all its members. Tentative and Local Parliaments. \u2014 The rise of \"local Parlia- ments \" in many parts of the metropolis and elsewhere has been a notice able occurrence in recent years. Although merely debating societies, or discussion clubs in another shape, the formality of Parliamentary pro ceedings was imitated. Speakers were elected and Ministries formed, which gave place to members of the Opposition when outvoted. Extension of the Electoral Principle. \u2014 In the India Bill (No. 2) brought in by Mr. Disraeli in 1858, there was a proposal that a proportion of the new Indian Council should be elected by the con stituencies of five great commercial towns \u2014 Liverpool, Manchester, Bir mingham, Glasgow, and Belfast. This novel idea excited much opposition, to which Lord Palmerston gave the most effective point. Ho said that whenever he met a friend in the street he found him in an uncontroUable fit of laughter, and as soon as he was able to speak and explain himself, it was always found that he was laughing at India Bill No. 2, and this particular proviso. Elections a \" Penalty.\" \u2014 Speaking on the licensing system at Birmingham in August, 1883, Mr. Bright remarked : \" Some say, Let us have a licensing board elected for this specific purpose; and there is great force in the recommendation. I do not deny it at all. At the same time, if I were myself called upon to legislate, I should not adopt it. For one thing, I am against multiplying the cases of election. Our elections may be quite a necessary penalty, but they are a great penalty which we pay for free government and for Parliamentary authority; and I think, by increasing the number of your elections, whether for Parliament or whether for municipal government, you throw a good deal of burden upon the people, aud, unless there is approved advantage in it, and necessity for it, we had better rather limit our elections than extend them.\" \"Burning Questions.\"\u2014 This phrase, although not originated in Parliament, is so frequently in use as applied to Parliamentary affairs that it requires mention. It was first employed (iu a letter to political friends) by Mr. Edward Miall, the well-known promoter of the \" Society for the Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and Control \"\u2014an unwieldy title which it has since been found convenient to modify into the curtness of \" Liberation Society.\" (Mr. Miall had represented both Rochdale and Bradford, after having been repeatedly defeated in other constituencies.) Mr. Disraeli took up the phrase in a speech in the House in March 1873. He said : \" We are now emerging from a fiscal period in"], [690, "670 ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. which almost all the public men of this generation have been brought up. All the questions of trade and navigation, of the incidence of taxation and of public economy, are settled. But there are other questions not less important, and of deeper and higher reach and range, which must engage the attention of a Constitutional Minister. There is the question whether the aristocratic principle should be recognised in our Constitution, and if so, in what form ; whether the Commons of England shall remain an estate of the realm, numerous, but privileged and qualified, or whether they should degenerate into an indiscriminate multitude ; whether a National Church shall be maintained, and if so, what shall be its rights and duties ; the functions of corporations, the sacredness of endowments, the tenure of landed property, the free disposal and even the existence of any kind of property. AU these institutions and all these priuciples, which have made this country free and famous, and conspicuous for its union of order with liberty, are now impugned, and in due time will become great and ' burning ' questions.\" A Laudable Ambition. \u2014 In reference to his friend Mr. Thrale's seeking a seat in Parliament, Dr. Johnson said : \" It would be with great discontent that I should see Mr. Thrale decline the representation of the borough. To sit iu Parliament for Southwark is the highest honour that his station permits him to attain; and his ambition to attain it is rational aud laudable. I will not say that for an honest man to struggle for a vote in the Legislature, at a time when honest votes are so much wanted, is absolutely a duty; but it is surely an act of virtue. The expense, if it were more, I should wish him to despise. Money is made for such purposes as this.\" Appearances at the Bar. \u2014 Boswell writes in 1778: \"I told Dr. Johnson that I was engaged as counsel at the bar of the House of Commons to oppose a road bill in the county of Stirling, aud asked him what mode he would advise me to follow in addressing such an audience. Dr. Johnson : ' Why, sir, you must provide yourself with a good deal of extraneous matter, which you are to produce occasionally, so as to fill up the time ; for you must consider that they do not listen much. If you begin with the strength of your cause, it may be lost before they begin to listen. When you catch a moment of attention, press the merits of the question upon them.' \" Boswell adds that when he mentioned this observation next day to Mr. Wilkes, the latter's advice was not more respectful towards the senate than the doctor's : \" Be as impudent as you can, as merry as you can, and say whatever comes uppermost.\" \" The Best Club.\"\u2014 The House of Commons has frequently been designated by this phrase, and a witty remark on the subject was made by a member (Mr. Macfarlane) on the bringing forward of the votes for Parliamentary buildings in 1884. Ho said that before he became a member he had understood that the House of Commons was the best club iu London, but he supposed that was because it had the largest entrance fee. What the House of Commons Loves.\u2014 Sir T. F. Buxton wrote as follows to a friend (Mr. North) whom he wished to induce to enter tho House of Commous : \" I do not wonder why so many distinguished men"], [691, "VARIETIES. 671 have failed in it. The speaking required is of a very peculiar kind : the House loves good sense and joking, and nothing else; and the object of its utter aversion is that species of eloquence which is called Philippian. There are not three men from whom a fine simile or sentiment would be tolerated. All attempts of the kind are punished with general laughter. An easy flow of sterling plain sense is indispensable ; and this, combined with great powers of sarcasm, gives Brougham his station. Canning is an exception to this rule ; his reasoning is seldom above mediocrity ; but then it is recommended by language so wonders uUy happy, by a manner so exquisitely elegant, and by wit so clear, so pungent, and so unpremedi tated, that he contrives tobeguUe the House of its austerity. Tierney has never exerted himself much in my hearing. Wilberforce has more native eloquence than any of them ; but he takes no pains, and allows himself to wander from his subject : he holds a very high rank in the estimation of the House. And now let me tell you a secret. These great creatures turn out, when viewed closely, to be but men, and men with whom you need not fear competition.\" The House of Commons in Past and Present Times Mr. Bright, speaking at a Mansion House banquet in August, 1881, made some remarks on this subject. He said : \" We know that in times past the House of Commons had little to do except to engage in faction fights. The United Kingdom was much less populated then than it is now; its trade was much less, our colonies for the most part did not exist as such, and even our Indian Empire did not exist under the authority of the British Crown. The House itself was composed of not quite 500 members, and its position was very curious. I can give you an anecdote about that which may be somewhat amusing. A good many years ago now, Lord Palmerston made an extraordinary speech in tho House of Commons,* when a vote of censure had been passed against him by the House of Lords, in connection with one of those mistakes which he made in his forei\u00b0n policy. He spoke for four hours and forty minutes. The day after that great speech, I went to Mr. Leigh, who was then a clerk at the table of the House, and a very old man, and I said to him, ' How do you judge of that speech of Lord Palmerston's, as compared with the speeches of men whom we have been taught to believe were the giants of the past generation ? ' Mr. Leigh said, ' I think not one of them ever made a speech equal to that ; ' and after a pause he added, ' But iu those days there were only half a dozen men in the House who could make a good speech, and there were not more than a dozen or two who coidd understand them when they did so.' I will not say whether Mr. Leigh was accurate or generous in his estimate of our forefathers, but I mention this anecdote to you as indicating what the business of Parliament was then as compared with what it is now. Now, we have 650 members in the House I believe that we have in it more abUity by far than there was in ancient days, and that there is more intelligence in the present House of Commons than in any House which has preceded it.\" * See p. 287."], [692, "ANECDOTAL HISTORY OF PARLIAMENT. 672 Types in the House of Commons. \u2014 Mr. Chamberlain made the following remarks in replying to the toast \"The Houses of Parliament,\" at a dinner in Birmingham in March, 1892 : \" It is a very curious thing, the types in the House of Commons are constant, although the men change. In my time I have never known tho House of Commons without a funny man. There is always one, and when he dies, or when he ceases to be elected, or when, for some reason or other, he retires into the background, there is another immediately to take his place. I would not name the present occupant of the place for worlds (laughter), but if you ever go to the House of Commons you will find the funny man there iu all his glory, just as he was, I verily believe, in the Long Parliament 200 or more years ago. He is a man who has a natural taste for buffoonery, which he has cultivated with great art, who has a hatred of every Govern ment, and of all kinds of restraint, and especially, of course, of the Government which happens to be in office. Then there is the House of Commons bore \u2014 of course there is more than one, but there is always one par excellence. He is generally a man who is very clever, a man of encyclo p\u00e6dic information, which he has been unable to digest himself, and which, therefore, he is always ready to impart to everybody else. Then you have the weighty man ; and, gentlemen, the gravity of the weighty man of the House of Commons is a thing to which there is no parallel in the world. STou have the foolish man, you have the man with one idea, you have the independent man, you have the man who is a little cracked. All these men are there to-day, were there fifty years ago, and will be there fifty years hence. The House of Commons remains exactly the same in all essential characteristics, although, as I have said, the men and tho circum stances change. The only wonder to me is \u2014 where do these curiosities, these exceptional characters, these ' types ' of the House \u2014 where do they come from, and how do they find constituencies who are willing to be represented by them ? \" Working Men in Parliament. \u2014 At a festival of the Amal gamated Society of Engineers in 1881, Mr. Broadhurst, M.P. for Stoke upon-Trent, being called upon to respond to the toast, \" The Institutions of England,\" referred especially to the House of Commons, and said : \" He entered the House without wealth, influence, or friends other than of his own class, and no one could have been more courteously received and generously treated than he had been, even by his political opponents. In the House of Commons it mattered not what had been a man's position nor what was the sphere of life in which he moved \u2014 if he had anything to say worth listening to he was sure of an attentive hearing, aud in all rights and privileges he was the equal of the noblest and richest in the assembly. Therefore working men, if they chose to send to Parliament a represen tative from themselves, might know that he would be received with as much respect as if he were the son of a duke or a millionaire.\" \u2014 Another labour representative, Mr. T. Burt, wrote to similar effect in an article in the Contemporary Review, May, 1889. Influence of Character in Parliament. \u2014 Ou the death of Sir Robert Harry Inglis, who for a long period had represented the Univer-"], [693, "VARIETIES. 673 sity of Oxford, the foUowing tribute was paid to his memory by the Times: \" Sir R. H. Inglis has been for a whole generation one of the most con spicuous and honourable personages in the great couucU of the nation. Much more than any other living man, he illustrates the force of what English people are proud to call ' character.' People may or may not have valued his opinions, or respected his reasoning powers ; they may or may not have followed the lead of one who scarcely ever assumed to guide ; but all respected, admired, and even loved the honest, hearty, genial, courteous gentleman, who spoke the whole truth, as he held it, from his whole soul, with no respect either of persons or of circumstances, and apparently with no other object than to record a clear testimony and quiet his own conscience. Hence, while it would be difficult to say what Sir R. H. Inglis has done, what vote he has carried, what measure he has forwarded or delayed, he has undoubtedly possessed a great, though indefinite, weight in the Legislature. No one who ever heard him speak could fail to understand how it was that he won the respect and affection of men who, nevertheless, decUned to acquiesce in bis conclusions.\" \" Collective Character\" in Parliament. \u2014 It was an observation of Burke respecting the House of Commons, \" Besides the characters of the individuals that compose it, this House has a collective character of its own.\" The \" coUective wisdom \" of Parliament is also an oft quoted expression, apparently originating in Aristotle's doctrine, that the aggregate sense of any assembly is greater than the sum possessed by any of the individuals composing it. \" Great Wisdom \" in Parliament. \u2014 Old Thomas FuUer, writing the character of the \" true gentleman,\" says : \" If chosen a member of Parliament, he is willing to do his country service. If he be no rhetori cian to raise affections (yea, Mercury was a greater speaker than Jupiter himself !), he counts it great wisdom to be the good manager of ' Yea ' and ' Nay.' \" Note. \u2014 While these pages were passing through the press, the Duke of Argyll (p. 451) was elevated in the peerage to a dukedom of the United Kingdom, and therefore no longer sits and votes as Baron Sundridge.
