TT is much to be regretted that the dramatic masterpieces of Shakspere's contemporaries, in their entirety, are wholly unfitted for general reading. The reason is obvious ; the plays in ques tion abound in strong pictures of gross subjects, many passages being absolutely inconsistent with the delicacy of the present day, and some of the very finest scenes being polluted by occasional coarseness of language. Consequently they are totally unknown to the vast majority of readers, and are also necessarily excluded from all educational courses. The present volume is an attempt to obviate these objections, by expunging or altering slightly all those passages and expressions which have appeared to the editor to be objectionable in point of morality or otherwise. It may be placed in the hands of all with the utmost confidence. These necessary erasures are much fewer in number, and more trivial in nature, than a casual observer might imagine (as will appear from the synopsis at the foot of the various \" reading tables \" prefixed to the plays) ; and"], [10, "PREFACE. IV the six plays are given practically complete as con nected stories, retaining all their original spirit and interest. In the choice of plays a double aim has been kept in view : \u2014 first, to select those which contain very little that is exceptionable, having no radical evil in their plot ; avoiding all those (a numerous class, it is to be remarked) which in their very essence or groundwork are contaminating :\u2014 and, second, to select in each case a play which shall be among the best and most typical of the author's works, and thus combine in a single readable volume half-a-dozen masterpieces by various old English dramatists. It is hoped that this book may be found of service for educational purposes, opening up and rendering available one of the most valuable portions of English poetic and dramatic literature, which has hitherto of necessity been closed to all youthful students. With a view to this object, the obscurities and archaisms of the text are explained in short foot-notes, and each play is preceded by an intro duction dealing concisely with the life and works of the author. Dramatic reading clubs and societies will find the volume most useful ; each play is preceded by a \"reading table\" of the characters, showing the number of lines spoken by every character in each scene, pointing out what characters may be grouped together, so as to be undertaken by a single reader, and showing what portions (enclosed in thick brackets) may be omitted, in order to shorten the"], [11, "PREFACE.

Should the present volume meet with sufficient approval at the hands of the public, it is purposed to publish a second series of plays selected from the works of other great Elizabethan dramatists, and also a volume of Restoration plays similarly treated.

THOMAS DEKKER. CONCERNING the life of the \" gentle-hearted \" Thomas Dekker but little is known. Even the cor rect manner of spelling his very name is uncertain. He is thought to have been born in London about 1565, possibly of Dutch origin, and when a lad to have followed the gentle craft of a shoemaker, for which he shows a decided preference in several of his works. He married in 1594, and is not heard of after 1637. It has been well said that Dr. Johnson's celebrated enumeration of the scholar's experiences would stand for a biography of Dekker \u2014 \" Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail.\" In the course of his most miserable and unfortunate hand-to-mouth existence, this original and versatile writer undoubtedly had several ample opportunities of becoming intimately acquainted with the interior of the prisons of those days. He certainly did not possess Fortunatus' purse, being rightly classed by Mezieres among the necessitous poets. Dekker first appeared as a writer in 1597. His masterpiece, written along with Middleton in 1604, is a remarkable play B"], [16, "THOMAS DEKKER. 2 in two parts of five acts each, which \u2014 as Hazlitt, who overpraised it, says \u2014 is intended to establish the con verse of the proposition that a reformed rake makes the best husband. In addition to this and The Shoemaker's Holiday (1599), Dekker's principal plays are as under : \u2014 (1) The romantic play, Old Fortunatus (1600), founded on the old German story, somewhat resembling Marlowe's Faustus (to which latter play Dekker made additions). Hazlitt says of this play that it \" has the idle garrulity of age, with the freshness and gaiety of youth still upon its cheek and in its heart.\" Lamb has also bestowed the highest praise on the character of Orleans, who, he says, \" talks pure Biron and Romeo \u2014 he is almost as poetical as they;\" Swinburne adds that the word \"almost \" here should be \"fully.\" (2) Satiromastix, written, or more probably, as Swinburne conjectures, adapted, as a reply to Jonson's attack on Dekker and Marston in his Poetaster. (3) Alatch Ale in London (c. 1610), a good comedy on a Spanish subject. (4) Patient Grissill (1600), a romantic tragi-comedy. founded on the famous old tale of Chaucer, and written in conjunction with Chettle and Haughton ; it contains the most delightful of Dekker's many charming lyrics, i.e., that on Content, numbered by Swinburne amongst the outbreaks of bird -like or god like song. Dekker is also conjectured to have written, along with Day and Haughton, The Spanish Moor's Tragedy (1600), often attributed, under another title, to Marlowe : on which Mrs. Aphra Behn founded her Abdclazar and Young his Revenge. Dekker wrote plays in conjunction with almost every one of the best-known dramatists of the time : Chettle (one play, no longer extant, being on the story of Troilus and Cressidd), Day, Jonson, Middleton, Massinger (The Virgin Martyr), Webster (three plays), and Ford (The Sun's Darling and The Witch of Edmon ton). In many cases it is now quite impossible to assign with certainty their respective shares to each of the joint authors. In addition to these, Dekker"], [17, "THOMAS DEKKER. 3 wrote three or four less important plays and a num ber of City Pageants, including one for the reception of King James in the City of London in 1604. He was also a most prolific writer of serious and witty prose pamphlets, full of graphic painting of manners and characters. Of these the most important were The Gull's Horn-book (1609), and The Seven Deadly Sins of London (1606). Dekker, says Lamb, had poetry enough for any thing. As a song writer he has few equals. His most prominent characteristic is his gleeful and ten der light-heartedness. This cheery spirit enabled him to overcome Fortune's hard treatment. As a dramatist Ulrici compares him to Heywood, and classes him with the Greene-Marlowe school. In his freshness and sweetness he certainly resembles the former of these two writers. Although his serious plays contain occasional passages of tragic and, pathetic power, it is in his comedies that we have Dekker at his best. These are full of healthy life and sparkling humour, albeit the plots are often rude in form, and their simple directness of diction and homely realism sometimes degenerates into coarse ness. Hazlitt has compared the character of his genius to that of Chaucer, and has drawn an interest ing contrast between him and Webster. In many respects he resembles Goldsmith. His chief defect was his want of steady seriousness of purpose ; he lacked \" the infinite capacity for taking pains.\" (Swinburne.) The conclusions of his plays are generally feeble. . The Shoemaker's Holiday \u2014 which has sometimes been attributed to Barten Holiday, and in which Robert Wilson, the actor who took the low comedy part of Firk, is thought to have collaborated' \u2014 is Dekker's earliest comedy and also his best. \" It represents Dekker admirably on the side of his facile humour and bright dramatic realism, as Old Fortu natus represents him on the more purely poetical side.\" (Rhys.)

BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. Of all the literary partnerships known in the history of English literature that of these \" Dioscuri of our Zodiac\" is the most celebrated. The origin of their friendship is not known, but it is conjectured that it arose from their mutual intimacy with Jonson, whom Beaumont is supposed to have assisted in the com position of Scjanus. Of the fifty-two plays published under their joint names, three only \u2014 viz., The Scorn ful Lady (c. 1609), A King and No King (1619), and Philaster (1620) \u2014 were published during Fletcher's lifetime as the joint productions of himself and Beau mont, and some seventeen are conjectured to have been the work of both ; therefore were their names placed on the title-page of their collective works in the precedence to which their comparative shares entitled them, the present order would certainly be reversed. Massinger and other dramatists are sup posed to have aided Fletcher in many of the remain ing dramas. Francis Beaumont (1 586-1616) came of a noble and literary family. John, his second brother, was a poet, he wrote Bosworth Field, and several other G 2"], [98, "84 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. Beaumonts wrote verses. In addition to his share in the plays, Francis Beaumont wrote a number of pieces, principally elegies, of no particular merit. Salmacis and Hermaphroditus (1602), along Ovidian poem of 900 lines, is doubtfully attributed to his youthful pen. Aubrey tells us that Beaumont's main business was to correct the overflowings of Fletcher's wit. The Fletchers were also literary people. The dramatist's uncle Giles wrote travels and Latin verses, and his cousins Phineas and Giles both figure in the list of English poets. John Fletcher ( 1 579\u2014 1625) was thirty-seven years of age when Beaumont died, and after the latter's death wrote several (? 16) plays in conjunction with Massinger, who was after wards buried in the same grave as Fletcher. He wrote more or less of some fifty-five plays, sixteen entirely alone. He is conjectured to have written part of Henry Vlllth. He was probably never married. One of the most noteworthy of Fletcher's produc tions was The Faithful Shepherdess, published without a date about 1609. It is a rhymed pastoral drama or masque, abounding, like most of his plays, in choice lyrics, and founded on the Pastor Fido. It bears con siderable resemblance to Jonson's Sad Shepherd, and suggested to Milton his Comus. To the popularity of the dramas of Beaumont and Fletcher, Dryden bears witness : \u2014 \" Their plays are now the mosc pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage, two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shakspere's.\" This popularity was doubtless due to the ceaseless variety of their plots. Ulrici classes them along with Massinger as the principal exponents of the Ben Jonson school, whe-reas Mezieres, \u2014 perhaps more justly, having regard to Fletcher's poetical and lyric talent, \u2014 ranks them as Shakspereans. They have been rightly esteemed the founders of our comedy of intrigue, as distin guished from comedy of character; it is in bright, sportive comedy, in fertile humour, and in flashing"], [99, "BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. 85 wit that they excel. Of these the most esteemed are Rule a Wife and have a Wipe (Fletcher alone), The Spanish Curate (Fletcher and Massinger ?), The Elder Brother (do.), and The Knight of the Burning Pestle (c. 1610). This last, said to be the first mock-heroic play in English, is a kind of dramatic Don Quixote, a satire directed generally against chivalry, and par ticularly against an absurd play then recently written by Heywood, entitled The Four Prentices of London {see p. 147 infra), who by their gigantic valour con tribute to the conquest of Jerusalem. It is supposed to have been a joint composition written in eight days. This play adopts very successfully the then popular device of introducing a play within the play. It is the prototype of The Rehearsal and The Critic, and must have afforded man)' hints to the author of Hit di bras. Hallam considers that the burlesque, though very ludicrous, does not transgress all bounds of proba bility, and pronounces the piece very diverting. The characters of the London citizen and his wife give us a most genial and humorous picture of contemporary Elizabethan manners and character among Londoners. The notion of bringing these people on the stage re sembles Jonson's Staple of 'Hews. A portion of the play describing Ralph's adventure with the barber was subsequently acted as a droll, and is included in Kirkman's collection (1672) under the title of The Encounter. The tragedies, of which the best are Valentinian (Fletcher alone), The Alaids Tragedy, and A King and No King, are marked by a romantic, heroic spirit, but this is too often exaggerated till the speeches of the heroes become mere wordy declama tion, \"full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing.\" Though characterized by a strong moralizing ten dency, yet their dramas are not moral. In coarseness of language at times they have rarely been surpassed, and they are too fond (as Ulrici observes) of making low vices and crimes the main objects of their pieces. Their diction is truly poetical and pleasing. \" They"], [100, "86 BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. are lyrical and descriptive poets of the first order ; they are dramatic poets of the second class ; they are masters of style and versification in almost every variety of melting modulation or sounding pomp ; in comic wit and spirit they are scarcely surpassed by any writer of any age.\" (Hazlitt.) Their great de fects are badly constructed plots and the absence of creative imagination ; they are rich in language but poor in ideas ; they lack depth of thought ; they are marked by superficiality in everything. Although they have produced hundreds of names of characters they have not created a single living impersonation of an universal trait. As has been well said, \" Shak spere individualised classes ; Fletcher generalised individuals.\" (Whipple.) Their female characters and young men are their best. \" After all,\" says Lamb, \" Beaumont and Fletcher were but an inferior sort of Shaksperes and Sidneys.\""], [101, "Act 6 . I. II. III. IV. V.

BENJAMIN (or, as he himself abbreviated his name, Ben) JONSON was born in 1572-3, the posthumous son of a clergyman of Scottish descent. He received his education first at a private school near Charing Cross, and afterwards at Westminster School, at the expense of the antiquary Camden, who was a master there. He is next reported to have entered St. John's College, Cambridge, but although he afterwards became an M.A. of both Universities, he appears to have re mained there but a few weeks. His mother had, meanwhile, married a second time, a master-brick layer, and for a while Jonson appears to have followed his step-father's trade, which would explain contem porary and hostile allusions to him as the \" lime and mortar poet.\" Abandoning the hod for the sword, he served with considerable bravery in the army in the Low Countries, where doubtless he met with the prototypes of Captain Bobadil and his other military characters. On his return, about 1592, he married, and soon after began to turn his attention to the stage \u2014 at first as an actor at the Curtain Theatre. Having killed a brother-actor named Spencer, he was imprisoned in 1598, and narrowly escaped hanging. Whilst in prison he became a convert to Roman"], [188, "174 BEN fONSON. Catholicism, which faith he embraced for twelve years and then recanted. In 1605 Jonson voluntarily suffered a second imprisonment, along with Chapman and Marston, for his (trivial) share in Eastward Hoe, a play containing some passages reflecting on the Scotch, and causing umbrage to King James. Jon son was of a singularly combative temperament, and amongst the most marked incidents of his life were his quarrels with Inigo Jones, and with several of his brother-dramatists. Marston, in his Satires, had ridiculed Jonson as \" Tubrio \" and \" Jack of Paris Garden,\" and the latter replied in Cynthia's Revels (1600), and in his comical satire The Poetaster (1601), wherein Dekker and Marston figure under the names of Demetrius and Crespinus respectively. Next year appeared Dekker's answer, entitled Satiromastix; or, the Untrussing of the Humerous Poet ; after which Jonson published an Apologetic Dialogue, and put an end to his share of the quarrel. In 1613 Jonson went to France as governor of a son of Sir Walter Raleigh. Three years later he was created poet-laureate, and a pension of 100 marks was conferred upon him, sub sequently increased to .\u00a3100 and a tierce of canary wine. He took a walking-tour to Scotland in 161 8, where he was the guest of the Scottish poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden, who in his well-known but somewhat bitter Conversations has preserved for us many interesting particulars concerning Jonson. In the year 1625 he was attacked by disease in a double shape, palsy and dropsy. He lingered on, however, till August 6th, 1637. His tombstone in Westminster Abbey bears the simple inscription, \" O rare Ben Jonson.\" His wife had died years be fore, and he left no family surviving him. Jonson, as Minto says, \"bodily as well as mentally, belonged to the race of Anak.\" He was scorbutic and corpu lent, possessing \" a mountain belly and a rocky face.\" Rough in manner, and of a decidedly convivial turn, he took great delight in the famous \"wit-combats\" at the Mermaid Tavern in Bread Street, Cheapside,"], [189, "BEN fONSON. 175 a celebrated meeting-place for the authors of the day, and frequented by Shakspere himself. Here the high colloquial powers of the veteran chief of English letters shone their brightest. Fleay divides Jonson's life into four periods : \u2014 (i) Growth, 1 597-1603; (2) Manhood, 1603-1612 ; (3) Middle Age, 1612-1626; (4) Decadence, 1626-1637. Exclusive of his numerous Masques written as Court entertainments, his dramatic works comprise two complete historical tragedies, The Fall of Sejanus (1603) and Cataline his Conspiracy (161 1), and a fragment of a third, The Fall of Mortimer (his first play, says Fleay) ; fifteen comedies, and one un finished pastoral drama, The Sad Shepherd (his last work, but which Fleay considers to have been begun in 16 1 7 under the title of The May Lord). His non dramatic works include several collections of small poems, epigrams, and some translations from the Classics, an English Grammar, and a kind of prose common-place book entitled Discoveries. Notwith standing Hazlitt's opinion to the contrary, Jonson's comedies are his principal productions. The best are Every Man in his Humour (1598), his first play, Epic\u0153ne (1609), considered by Campbell his best comedy, The Alchemist (1610), and Volpone (1605). Jonson founded a distinct school of English comedy. Amongst his many characteristics, the most strongly marked is his frequently coarse humour. His power of comic characterization, especially of dupes and cheats, has seldom been approached. Possessed of a searching power of observation and a varied experi ence, his knowledge of human life in every phase from highest to lowest was very extensive. He re flects the manners of the time, with all its eccentrici ties and peculiarities of character, to the life. Still it must be confessed that he drew characteristics rather than characters. He was one of the most learned men of his day, and, gifted with a powerful memory, he has made ample \u2014 perhaps too ample\u2014 use of it in his plays. His laborious filling in of technical details"], [190, "176 BEN fONSON. amounts to pedantry. \" His plays were works, whilst others' works were but plays.\" His tragedies are frigid and rhetorical ; in pathos, in tragic passion, in creative imagination, Jonson was lacking. Though many beautiful occasional lyrics are scattered through out his plays, still, as Swinburne says, \" That singing power which answers in verse to the odour of a blos som, to the colouring of a picture, to the flavour of a fruit, \u2014 that quality without which they may be good, commendable, admirable, but cannot be delightful, \u2014 was not, it would seem, a natural gift of this great writer : hardly now and then could his industry attain to it by some exceptional touch of inspiration or of luck.\""], [191, "Act I.

Philip, son of Arthur Massinger, a gentleman in the service of the Earl of Pembroke, was born at Salisbury in 1584. He is conjectured to have acted as page to the celebrated Countess of Pembroke (of Sidney's Arcadia) ; possibly he may have been called after Sir Philip. In 1602 he entered St. Alban's Hall, Oxford, and whilst there, Gifford says, he be- came a Roman Catholic. Some four years later he suddenly left the University svithout taking his de- gree, and proceeded to London. From this date until 162 1 his life is shrouded in obscurity. He pro- bably svas engaged in svriting and adapting for the stage. The only facts sve knosv about him with cer- tainty are that in the year 1614, in conjunction svith Field and Daborne, he applied to Manager Henslowe for the loan of \u00a35 to relieve him and them from im- prisonment for debt, and that the next year Hens- lowe lent Massinger and Daborne Although leading a much more regular and correct life than most of his contemporaries, Massinger appears to have been perpetually in difficulties ; and probably to this circumstance we owe his vigorous embodiments of creditors like \" that original, masterly, and inimi table conception,\" Sir Giles Overreach, and Luke in T"], [288, "274 PHILIP MASSINGER. The City Madam. These tsvo villains are sufficient (says Hallam) to establish the rank of Massinger in this great province of dramatic art. Though appar ently a favourite svith his contemporaries, Massinger was a shy and unobtrusive man of melancholy temperament. He was a Liberal, and his plays abound in allusions to contemporary politics ; in one instance a passage of this nature svas struck out by King Charles' own hand. His death svas in keeping svith the loneliness of his life ; one evening he svent to bed apparently in good health and was found dead in the morning. In the parish register of St. Saviour's, Southwark, we find the entry, \" March 18, 1638, Buried, Philip Massinger, a stranger.\" He was laid in the same grave with his close friend and fellow dramatist, Fletcher, whom he had assisted in sixteen plays. In all, Massinger is thought to have had a hand in some forty-tsvo plays. Several, along with plays by others, svere destroyed as waste paper by an ignorant cook of the Somerset Herald, Mr. War burton. His published svorks comprise seventeen complete plays and a portion of another. Of these, five are tragedies. The best are The Virgin Martyr (c. 161 1), founded on an ecclesiastical legend, and \" nesv reformed \" by Dekker ; The Duke of Milan, \"his best tragedy\" (Hallam) ; and The Fatal Dowry, svritten svith Field. Critics have differed considerably as regards Mas singer's merits as a dramatist. Hazlitt is very severe on him, svhereas others have termed him the most celebrated of Shakspere's successors, ranking him above either Jonson or Beaumont and Fletcher. According to Hallam (his greatest admirer) and H. Coleridge, his chief excellence \u2014 a great and beautiful excellence it is \u2014 lay in the delineation and expression of virtue in its probation, its strife, its victory. All critics unite in praising the peculiar beauty, dignity, elegance, and correctness of his style and language. He was alsvays careful to render his versification harmonious. Minto considers that he had less original force than"], [289, "PHILIP MASSINGER. 275 any other great dramatist ; his muse was compara tively tame and even-paced ; he was the Gray of his generation. He is deficient in sublimity, in poetic fancy, in pathos, and is, says Swinburne, the svorst song-svriter of all the dramatists of his age. He often sacrifices action to rhetoric ; he repeats himself greatly ; his stock characters recur again and again ; nor does he shosv much posver in their delineation. His heroes want backbone. As has been pointed out, Massinger's characters act from single motives ; he endeavours to bring out the same individual trait in its most exaggerated state to the exclusion of every other feeling. I cannot agree svith H. Coleridge, ss'ho altogether denies him humour. Minto instances the scenes between Wellborn and Marrall in the selected play as being irresistibly laughable, and points out that there is often a certain serious motive underlying his humour. Ulrici, on the other hand, considers that Greedy and Marrall are gross carica tures. Though alsvays free from profanity, unfortu nately some of Massinger's passages \u2014 often those placed in the mouths of his purest female types \u2014 are remarkable chiefly for their coarseness. His skilfully constructed plots rarely include an underplot. I have chosen Massinger's masterpiece in comedy, A New Way to Pay Old Debts (c. 1625), svhich contains the notorious Sir Giles Overreach, his most striking and successful comic figure. This character is a por trait of Sir Giles Mompesson, svho had procured from the king a monopoly for the manufacture of gold and silver lace, and then imposed upon the public by sup plying an inferior article. His friend, Sir Francis Michel, \" a poor sneaking Justice,\" is the original of Justice Greedy. Mezieres considers some of the situa tions are worthy of Moliere, but he judges the con clusion and madness of Sir Giles as an improbable exaggeration. This play is still occasionally acted. It has been translated into German and adapted to the German stage. The plot somewhat resembles that of Middleton's Trick to Catch the Old One.

JOHN FORD. \" Deep in a dump, John Ford was alone 'gat, With folded arms and melancholy hat. SUCH is the graphic contemporary description of one of the most remarkable of the Elizabethan dra matists \u2014 one who occupies a place distinct and apart, as having been independent of the stage and of litera ture (as he takes care to remind us), svriting plays merely as an amusement in his leisure hours. Born in 1586, of a somewhat aristocratic Devonshire family, this austere and unsociable man adopted the profes sion of a lawyer and entered the Middle Temple. His first essay in literature was an elegiac poem, Fame's Memorial (1606) on the death of the Earl of Devonshire. To the same year belongs his prose tract, Honor Triumphant. Besides four unpublished plays, destroyed by Warburton's oft-execrated ser vant, he svrote several dramas in conjunction svith Webster, Rowley, and Dekker. Tsvo of these are extant, (1) The Witch of Edminton, \u2014 founded on the then recent execution of Mother Sasvyer in 1621, and \" perhaps the first protest on the stage against the horrors and brutalities of vulgar superstition ; \" \u2014"], [380, "366 fOHN FORD. svritten in collaboration svith Rowley and Dekker: and (2) a moral masque, or allegory of the Seasons, entitled The Sun's Darling, probably a re-cast of Dekker's lost play, Phaeton. Ford's earliest printed play by himself alone, produced svhen he svas 43 years of age, is The Lover's Melancholy, a title avosvedly suggested by Burton's famous work. This, \" the best of his three romantic comedies,\" and, according to a baseless anecdote, stolen from Shakspere's papers, contains the svell-knosvn graceful description of a contention be tsveen a nightingale \"ordained to be music's first martyr\" and \"a ssveet lute's master.\" This story, translated from Strada's Prolusions, has also been paraphrased in Music's Duel by Crashasv, evidently an admirer of Ford, and writer of the follosving epi gram \u2014 \" Thou cheat'st us, Ford ; mak'st one seem two by art ; What is Love's Sacrifice but The Broken Heart ? \" The latter of these tsvo dramas is Ford's noblest effort, it contains many most posverful and touching- passages and several charming lyrics. It has been svell said that the story (probably derived from some Italian source) is not of one but of three broken hearts. The plot, though complicated, is skilfully constructed. The comic episodes are rather above the average of Ford's attempts at svit elsesvhere ; of true humour he is utterly devoid, and in his gratui- tously gross and dull underplots he introduces us to a \"despicable set of buffoons,\" svho merely excite our contempt and loathing, not our laughter. Perhaps that \" svise piece of formality,\" the Mayor of Cork in Pcrkin Warbrck, is the sole exception to this remark. Love's Sacrifice, an inferior play, somewhat resem- bling Othello, exemplifies Ford's love of repulsive and unnatural plots, as also does a play, considered by manyhis masterpiece, butsvhich cannot be even named here. Ford \" unquestionably displayed great power in these horrors, svhich svas all he desired ; but had he been of the first order of poets, he would have"], [381, "fiOHN FORD. 367 found and displayed superior posver in familiar matter of to-day, in failings to svhich all are liable, virtues svhich all may practise, and sorrosvs for svhich all may feel the better.\" (H. Coleridge.) To three of Ford's productions these remarks are not applicable, viz., the badly-constructed comedy of The Fancies, Chaste and Noble, the tragi-comedy, The Lady s Trial, svhich, though good in parts, is as a svhole feeble and unsatisfactory, and lastly his fine chronicle history, Pcrkin Warbeck (1634), sounded on Bacon's Life of Henry Vllth ; svhich, together svith Marlosve's Ed zvard Ilnd and the anonymous Edward Illrd, de serves to be ranked next to Shakspere's historical dramas. Swinburne, in his admirable essay on Ford, thus speaks of this play: \"The simple and lofty purity of conception, the exact and delicate accuracy of execution, are alike unimpaired by any slip orflasv of judgment or of seeling. The heroic sincerity of Warbeck, his high courtesy and constancy, his frank gratitude and chivalrous confidence, give worthy proof of Ford's ability to design a figure of stainless and exalted presence ; the sad, strong faith of his svife, the pure and daring devotion of the lover svho has lost her, the petulant and pathetic pride of her father, all melted at last into stately sympathy and approval of her truth in extremity of trial ; and more than all these, the noble mutual recognition and re gard of Warbeck and Dalyell in the time of final test, are qualities svhich raise the drama to the highest place among its compeers for moral tone and effect. Of imaginative beauty and poetic passion this play has nothing ; but for noble and equable design of character it stands at the head of Ford's svorks.\" This play svas revived in 1745. The subject also attracted Schiller. Of all his contemporaries, Webster most nearly resembles Ford, especially in his choice of horrible and abnormal subjects ; but, as has been svell said, the posver of Webster lies in terror, that of Ford in tenderness. He is the poet of the broken heart ;"], [382, "368 fOHN FORD. he is above all a sentimentalist, as the very names of his plays show. Harrosving scenes of intense and tender pathos are his forte. His versification is soft and fluent. Although not equal to Dekker or Fletcher in this respect, he possessed a consider able lyric note. Hazlitt (his severest critic) finds his plays defective in imagery, in character, and in action ; and artificial in style. Although Lamb pro bably erred in placing Ford in the first order of dramatists, still, as Swinburne rightly observes, his \" name is ineffaceable from the scroll of our great svriters ; it is one of the loftier landmarks of English poetry.\""], [383, "READING TABLE OF \"PERKIN WARBECK.\" Act I.

THE precise date at svhich this fine play svas svritten is not known, but it is conjectured to have been some where about 1610-1612 ; it was first acted about 1625. It first appeared singly in quarto form in 1634 \u2014 some eighteen years after Shakspere's death and nine years after that of Fletcher. The title-page of that edition describes the play as \u2014 \" Presented at the Blackfriars, by the King's \" Majesties Servants, svith great applause. \" Written by the memorable Worthies of their time \" Mr. John Fletcher ) r \u201e \" Mr. William Shakspere j Lrent' It svas included in the folio editions of Shakspere published in 1664 and 1685, and in the second folio Beaumont and Fletcher of 1679. Is the authorship correctly stated on the title-page of this first quarto? Critics are nosv svell-nigh unanimous in replying to this question in the affirma tive. It is clear to the most casual reader that two different minds were engaged on this play. All agree that one of these svas Fletcher ; and there has always been a tradition that Shakspere svas certainly con cerned in it, more especially in Act I. \u2014 a conjecture"], [472, "458 FLETCHER AND {?) SHAKSPERE. svhich receives still further corroboration from internal evidence and metrical tests. Hickson, Spalding, Littledale, and others svho have fully discussed the question, are in the main agreed as to svhat portions of the work are to be assigned to Shakspere and svhat to Fletcher. (See the short summary at foot.) Fleay maintains that it svas written by Fletcher and Mas singer. The pathetic story of Arcite and Palamon, already dramatised by Richard Edwards before 1566, svas (according to Skeat) of Grecian origin. It is to be found in the Teseide of Boccaccio, but probably the more immediate source of the present version was The Knight's Tale of Chaucer. Mr. Hudson has pointed out that \" in the Shakspere part the borrosv ing is mainly in the form of hints and ideas ; in the Fletcher parts it is much more in the way of incidents and details.\" The underplot (not in Chaucer) de scribing the madness of the gaoler's daughter \u2014 a character often, but svithout sufficient foundation, said to be copied from Ophelia \u2014 is, possibly svith the ex ception of two scenes, to be assigned to Fletcher. Hence Mr. Dyce conjectures, but without much pro bability, that the two poets did not work simulta neously at the play, and that possibly Fletcher altered, interpolated, and added to a version of an older play (svhich is no longer extant) as remodelled by Shakspere. It is to be remarked that in those portions usually attributed to Shakspere we have the entire of the plan of the play and the groundwork of every character (Hickson), svith the single exception of Gerrold, a feeble copy of Holofernes.
