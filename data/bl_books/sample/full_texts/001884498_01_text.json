LIPPINCOTT & CO., PHILADELPHIA"], [6, ""], [7, "INTRODUCTION The subject of this history is the territory now composing the counties of Allegan and Barry, in the State of Michigan, and the acts of the inhabitants of that territory, whether red or white. Everything lying beyond those limits will receive only such mention as may be necessary to show the connection of events. Its plan embraces three parts, the first embracing a general history of both counties; the second containing separate histories of the townships and villages of Allegan County; the third comprising like separate histories of the city of Hastings and the townships and villages of Barry County. The General History is composed of a continuous connected account of the Ottawa and Pottairalfamie Indians, who formerly ruled and occupied all this region, with an outline of the general course of events from the advent of the white man to the present time, this being followed by chapters devoted to various subjects which could not well be embodied in the continuous history ,\u2014 such as the civil organization, the lists of officers, the press, etc., concluding with brief sketches of the numerous regiments in which the gallant sons of Allegan and Barry upheld the flag of the Union against pro-slavery treason. In the second and third parts each township history tells in detail the story of the hardy pioneers, whose arduous toil and dauntless resolution subdued the savage wilderness of fifty years ago ; describes the organization and names the officers of the township ; and finally, gives separate sketches of the various churches and societies to be found within its limits. With each township, too, are given biographical notices of prominent citizens and old jnoneers, accompanied by their portraits or by views of their residences. Such is our plan, and we can at least guarantee that it is carried out to the extent of a full and exhaustive account of the principal facts connected with the history of Allegan aud Barry Coun ties. As to the manner of the presentation and the correctness of the statements, we must leave others to judge. No one can reasonably expect perfection, \u2014 especially in a work of this size, in volving the collection and collation of such a mass of details. But we have taken great pains to secure accuracy, and we believe we have succeeded, so far as success is practicable in a work of this nature. Certain it is that if reasonably accurate, this is a work the value of which will increase with every decade of years as it rolls- away. Some may possibly look askance now on so simple a work as a county history, but in future years their children and their children's children \" will, we trust and believe, turn eagerly to these pages to learn the humble but honorable story of their home. For the earliest history of Western Michigan we are indebted principally to the works of Francis Parkman, who is the recognized authority in regard to French rule in America, and whose \"Dis covery of the Great West,\" \"Jesuits in North America,\" and \"Conspiracy of Pontiac,\" have been closely consulted by us. Among other works which we have examined have been Smith's \"Life and Times of Lewis Cass,\" Drake's \"Life of Tecumsch,\" Drake's \"Book of the Indians,\" Los- :i"], [8, "4 INTRODUCTION. sing's \"Field Book of the War of 1812,\" Lanman's \"Red Book of Michigan,\" Durant's \"History of Kalamazoo County,\" and especially the valuable reports made out by Gen. John C. Robertson, adjutant-general of Michigan during the war for the Union, and still holding that position. But nearly all the latter part of our work is derived from living lips, and our informants are so numerous that it would be entirely out of the question to mention them here, but their names will often be found in the various township and village histories. We can but thank them en masse for the information they have given us. And now, our labor done, we submit our work to the candid consideration of our readers. C.

In a large majority of cases the stalwart warrior wore only leggins of deer skin and robe of buffalo-skin, or else strode among the pines in naked majesty, unrelieved save by a narrow breech-clout, while his arms were the war-club, the stone tomahawk, and the bow and arrows, with which his ancestors had for un known generations waged war against their foes. The squaws were more amply clothed, but in the same deer skin materials, while the bright-eyed, 'cute-looking children of both sexes disported here and there in absolute freedom, clad only in the copper-colored garments which nature had provided for them. k Still, there was a considerable number of Indians and On the 14th day of June, in the year 1671, a wild and motley throng was gathered beside the narrow channel down which the waters of the mightiest of lakes rush foaming towards the far Atlantic, forming a succession of rapids to which the zealous missionaries of Catholic France had already given the name of Saut de Sainte Marie (Falls of St. Mary), in honor of their most beloved intercessor, the virgin mother of Christ. By far the greater portion of the assembled crowd con sisted of the fierce aborigines of the Northwest. There were to be seen the sullen occupants of that immediate locality, the Ojibwas, or Chippewas, the most intractable of all those intractable savages, whose scowling features were now, however, somewhat relaxed in anticipation of the fire water to be dispensed at the impending ceremony. There, too, were their neighbors and kinsmen, the Ottawas, a trifle less implacable in disposition, a shade less forbidding in feature, but ready, nevertheless, in the caprice of a moment, to imbrue their hands in human blood, and to subject the enemies they might capture to the most fearful tortures which a demoniac malice could invent. squaws adorned with gaudy blankets and cheap jewelry of French manufacture; many warriors had substituted iron tomahawks for stone ones, and occasionally there might be seen one who by extraordinary diligence in fur-hunting had acquired, or who on account of especial prowess had been presented with, a long flint-lock French musket, which he proudly bore with him wherever he went, to the despairing envy of his less fortunate comrades. The assemblage combined the characteristics of council, camp, hunting-excursion, fishing-party, and co-operative do mestic establishment. While the old sachems conversed gravely regarding the occasion of their meeting, some of the younger warriors scoured the forest for game, which, when slain, was borne into camp by the ever-patient squaws. Others, in frail birch-bark canoes, fearlessly rode the foaming waters of the Saut, holding themselves poised motionless There also were Pottawattamies from the western side of Lake Michigan, Miami's from the head and eastern shore of that same broad sheet, and Illinois from the banks of the river which still bears their name ; while the members of numerous other tribes \u2014 Crees, Amikones, Nepissiugs, 'J"], [18, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 10 warriors, gazing with curious and half-suspicious eyes on the unwonted scene. Dablon blessed the cross, and it was then raised erect and planted in the ground, while the Frenchmen, with uncovered heads, sang the '* Vexilla Re-is.\" Next, the post bearing the royal arms was planted beside the cross, this portion of the ceremonies being ac companied bv the singing of the \u00ab Exaudiat,\" and by a prayer for the French king on the part of one ot the amid the boiling waves, and anon darting a flint-tipped lance into an incautious fish, affording an example of dex trous and picturesque fearlessness which still, as displayed by their descendants, awakens the admiration of every spectator. On shore scores of squaws were working to gether around the fires, preparing the food of their lordly masters. Save in a few of the very youngest there were no traces of that nut-brown beauty with which romancers have loved to endow the female companion of the Indian war rior ; for toil and hardship soon destroy the small modicum of grace and symmetry which nature may have bestowed. Yet Indian custom, though harsh in its requirements in regard to labor, assigned no slight dignity and influence to the older matrons of the tribes, and their grave faces might be seen iu groups here and there amid the trees, as they con sulted regarding the events of the day.

Then St. Lusson, holding his drawn sword in his right hand, raised a sod of earth with his left, and in a loud voice made this proclamation in the French language : \u00ab In the name of the Most High, Mighty, and Redoubted Monarch, Louis, Fourteenth of that name, Most Christian King of France and of Navarre, I take possession of this place, Sainte Marie du Saut, as also of Lakes Huron and Superior, the island of Manitoulin, and all countries, rivers, lakes, and streams contiguous and adjacent there unto both those which have been discovered and those which may be discovered hereafter, in all their length and breadth, bounded on the one side by the seas of the North and of the AA'est, and on the other by the South Sea; declaring to the natives thereof that from this time forth they are vassals of His Majesty, bound to obey his laws and follow his customs; promising them on his part all succor and protection against the incursions and invasions of their enemies, declaring to all other potentates, princes, sovereigns, states, and republics,\u2014 to them and their subjects,\u2014 that they cannot and are not to seize or settle upon any of the parts of the aforesaid countries, save under the good pleasure of His Most Christian Majesty, and of him who will govern in his behalf, and this on pain of incurring his resentment and the efforts of his arms. Long live the king !\" Conspicuous among these numerous children of the forest were a score of Frenchmen, almost as varied in appearance as their red brethren. The majority of these were voya geurs, a wild and hardy race, whose lives were spent on the streams and in the forests of the wilderness, and who, with French versatility, had become half-Indian in garb, in manner, and in appearance. The most prominent of these was Nicolas Perrot, who acted as interpreter between the commander of the expedition and his Indian friends.* Another distinguished explorer present was Louis Joliet, one of the most adventurous of French traders, whose name is now borne by a flourishing city of Illinois. \" Long live the king !\" repeated the Frenchmen present, and the thousands of savages collected around yelled in sympathy with the shouting Europeans. There were also four black-gowned Jesuits from the mission close by, an establishment founded three years before, which, on account of its isolated position among so many savages, had a half-military appearance, consisting, as it did, of a square palisade of cedar pickets, with a chapel and residence inside. These were Claude Dablon, superior of the missions of the lakes, Gabriel Druillettes, Claude Allouez, and Louis Andre. It is hardly to be supposed that the free sons of the forest and the prairie would have consciously assisted in the assumption of sovereignty over the country they had so long called their own by an unknown potentate beyond the Atlantic, but all the tribes of this region were in great fear of the terrible Iroquois, who occupied the central and western portions of the present State of New York, and whose native valor was made still more dangerous by the muskets and ammunition which they had received from their friends, the Dutch of New Amsterdam, now New York. The upper-lake tribes were very glad to receive the promise of assistance from the French against these dreaded foes, and even the acquisition of a few French muskets and some powder would tend materially to put them on an equality with their enemies. They were accus tomed also to give the respectful appellation of \" Father\" to the leaders of the whites, and were doubtless willing to acknowledge the great chief of the French beyond the seas as their \" father\" and protector, provided he would whip the Iroquois. We cannot believe that they meant more than this by the screams with which they responded to the proclamation of St. Lusson. But the great man of the assemblage, in the eyes of both whites and Indians, was Daumont de St. Lusson, a French officer who had been sent out the previous year by the intendant of Canada to search for copper-mines on Lake Superior, and who had determined to signalize his expe dition by an important and imposing proceeding. For this purpose he had called together all the tribes of the Great Lakes* and the savages, already favorably disposed towards the French, and generally fond of councils, speeches, and ceremonies, had promptly responded, no less than fourteen tribes being represented in the grand assemblage. St. Lusson had caused a large wooden cross to be pre pared, and also a cedar post, to which was attached a metal plate graven with the arms of France. When all was ready the commander (attended by the four priests) led forward his fourteen followers, fully armed and equipped. All around stood or crouched or reclined, the Indian But St. Lusson and his superiors meant much more than this, and the chances were then very great that they and their successors would be able to carry their schemes to completion ; that they would be able not only to subject this whole region to the authority of France, but to place it in the actual occupation of French gentry and peasantry. * Perrot was the most conspicuous of all the voyageurs of his day, not so much on account of superior valor and enterprise, though he was both brave and enterprising, as because he had that very unusual accomplishment for a voyageur, the ability to write, \u2014 not only to write his name but to write a book. He was the author of a work entitled \" M\u0153urs, Coutumes et Religion des Sauvages de l'Amerique Septentrional\" (Manners, Customs, and Religion of the Savages of North America). After the commandant had concluded his portion of the ceremony, Father Allouez, the most distinguished of the"], [19, "RETROSPECTIVE 11 priests present, though not the highest in ecclesiastical rank, harangued the Indians on the religious and political aspects of the great event. He spoke of the cross which had just been set up as the symbol of the Christian reli gion, and then continued in the following florid but striking language : notary, if one was present, \u2014 if not, then by the commander. It is somewhat doubtful whether a notary accompanied St. Lusson in his wanderings, but a \" proe'es verbal de In prise de possession\" (official account of the taking possession) was duly executed, and is mentioned in Parkman's \" Dis covery of the Great West,\" from which most of the facts set forth in this chapter are derived. \"Look at this post, to which are affixed the arms of the great chief of France, whom we call king. He lives across the sea. He is chief of the greatest chiefs, and has no equal on earth. All the chiefs whom you have ever seen are but children beside him. He is like a great tree, aud they are but the little herbs which one walks over and tramples under foot. You know Onontio [as the Indians called all the French Governors of Canada], that famous chief at Quebec ; you know and you have seen that he is the terror of the Iroquois, and that his very name makes them tremble since he has laid their country waste and burned their towns with fire. Across the sea there are ten thousand Onontios like him, who are but warriors of our great king, of whom I have told you. When he says, ' I am going to war,' everybody obeys his orders; and each of these ten thousand chiefs raises a troop of a hundred war riors, some on sea and some on land. Some embark on great ships, such as you have seen at Quebec. Your canoes carry only four or five men, or at the most ten or twelve, but our ships carry four or five hundred, and sometimes a thousand. Others go to war on the land, and they are so numerous that if they should stand in a double line they would reach from here to Mississaquenk, which is more than twenty leagues away. When our king assaults his enemies he is more terrible than the thunder; he makes the earth shake; the sky and the sea are on fire with the flash of his cannon; he goes in the midst of his warriors covered with the blood of his enemies, whom he slays in such numbers that he does not count them by scalps, but by the streams of their blood. The number of the prisoners whom he takes is so great that he makes little account of them, but lets them go where they will to show that he is not afraid of them. No one now dares make war on him. All the nations beyond the sea have submitted to his power, and have humbly asked for peace. Men come from every part of the world to listen to him and admire him. All that is done on the earth is decided solely by him.\" It will have been observed that only Lakes Huron and Superior were mentioned in St. Lusson's proclamation. The northern part of Lake Michigan had certainly been navi gated as far as Green Bay, and perhaps the southern por tion had been explored, but a map made about that time delineated only the northern part, which it showed as a prolongation of Lake Huron, the whole being named \" Michigane,\"f or \" Mer Douce des Hurons\" (Fresh Sea of the Hurons). At all events, both peninsulas of Michi gan are embraced in the claim of the proclamation, which included \" all countries, rivers, lakes, and streams contigu ous and adjacent\" to Lakes Michigan and Huron. The action of Daumont de St. Lusson was the formal procedure which invested France with the sovereignty of the present State of Michigan (including, of course, the counties which are the subject of this volume) and of many adjacent lands, thus bringing all this vast region, nominally at least, under the rule of a civilized nation. It has, there fore, been selected as the starting-point of our history, and has been described with considerable minuteness. True, the proclamation and the prods verbal did not give possession of the territory in question, hut like the execution of a deed it gave a legal title in the eyes of the French, and, as it was afterwards made good by the erection of forts and trading-posts throughout the Northwest, it formed an era from which we may properly date the history of the counties of Allegan and Barry. Before, however, descending the stream of time from that era, it is necessary to devote a chapter to a cursory mention of preceding events affecting the destiny of the upper-lake country, and to a description of the situation in 1671. CHAPTER II. RETROSPECTIVE. This is the French report of the speech, and it shows that the worthy Jesuit, who would have given his life with out a moment's hesitation for his faith, did not scruple to say whatever was necessary to make a strong impression upon his savage auditors. These were well satisfied with his gorgeous rhetoric and inflated statements, and greeted the close of his speech with vociferous marks of approval.

The closing scene of St. Lusson's little drama, and one which was considered very important by all French officials in similar circumstances, was the drawing up and signing of the prods verbal, or official statement of the whole transac tion.* Such a statement, made on the spot, was the almost invariable accompaniment of any important act done by a French officer; it being written, signed, and sealed by a When Daumont de St. Lusson took possession of the upper lakes and their adjacent lands in the name of Louis the Fourteenth, only a hundred and seventy-one years had passed since the discovery of America by Columbus. It had been a hundred and thirty -seven years since (in 1535) the French explorer, George Cartier, had sailed up the St. f This word Michigane, or Michigan, is said to be derived from two Chippeica words, Mitchan Sagegan, meaning great- lake ; being applied by that tribe to Lakes Huron and Michigan, which were con sidered as one body of water. * Notwithstanding the word \" verbal,\" the general meaning of which is the same in French as in English, this species of process was always in writing."], [20, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 12 repulse their arrogant enemies, who thenceforth seldom sought a war-path which led so far to the north. In 1668 the celebrated Father Marquette, accompanied by Father Claude Dablon, finding the friendly Chippewas and others in peaceful possession at the Saut de Sainte Marie, had established there the mission of Sainte Marie du Saut, and had soon afterwards founded that of St. Esprit among the Ottawas, near the western extremity of Lake Superior. But in 1669 or 1670 the Ottawas, finding that they were no longer molested by the Iroquois, had estab lished their principal seat on the island of Mackinaw, in the straits variously known as Michillimacinac, Mackinac, or Mackinaw, but which we much prefer to designate by the latter appellation, and there Marquette established the mission of St. Ignace in 1671, the same year that De Lus son took possession of the country in behalf of Louis the Fourteenth. From Mackinaw the hunting-parties of the Ottawas rapidly spread southward, especially along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, nearly or quite to the counties which are the subject of this history, \u2014 Allegan and Barry. Lawrence to Montreal, and had taken possession of all the country round about, in the name of King Francis the First, by the name of New France. He had made some attempts at colonization, but in 1543 they had all been abandoned, and for more than half a century the disturbed condition of France had entirely prevented its people from utilizing the discoveries of Cartier. In 1603 the celebrated French mariner, Samuel Cham plain, had led an expedition to Quebec, had made a perma nent settlement there, and had, in fact, founded the colony of Canada. From Quebec and from Montreal, which was soon after founded, the adventurous French explorers, fur traders, and missionaries had pushed rapidly into the West ern wilderness, and as early as 1615 Champlain himself had visited the Hurons on the shores of Lake Manitouline. Almost or quite as early, priests of the R\u00a3collet, or Fran ciscan, order had established missions in the same locality. Meanwhile, in 1606, the English had settled Virginia, and in 1609 a Dutch ship, under the command of the Eng lish sailor, Henry Hudson, had sailed into the river which still bears its captain's name. These events had been fol lowed in 1620 by the landing of the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock, and in 1623 by the commencement of permanent Dutch settlement on the Hudson. Thus three distinct streams of emigration, with three attendant claims of sov ereignty, had begun to make their way westward from the Atlantic, and to all appearances the French, having such ample water-communication with the interior by means of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, had decidedly the advantage in the race for empire,** \u2014 at least so far as Michi gan was concerned. At this time (1671) the Pottawattamies were located on the western shore of Lake Michigan, from Green Bay to the site of Chicago ; while the Miamis dwelt and hunted on the eastern shore, from the head of the lake nearly to the mouth of Grand River. Such was the situation in 1671. There is but one more subject that needs to be dealt with in this retrospective chapter. That is the so-called \" pre-historic race\" which is supposed to have inhabited this region previous to its oc cupation by the Indians. In various parts of this State, and eastward along the southern shore of the Great Lakes, to the foot of Lake Ontario, numerous mounds were found by the first settlers, some of which were evidently places of sepul ture, while others had every appearance of having been originally erected as fortifications. The latter were simple breastworks, from three to six feet high, usually, though not always, constructed on strong natural positions, such as a steep hill or a promontory nearly surrounded by ravines. In 1625 there had arrived on the shores of the St. Law rence a few Jesuits, the vanguard of a host of those fiery champions of the cross, destined to crowd aside the more peaceful or more inert Franciscans throughout the whole lake region, and substantially to appropriate that missionary ground to themselves. Their course was generally across Canada by land to Lake Manitouline, and thence in canoes through Lakes Huron, Superior, and Michigan ; for the more convenient route by way of the Niagara River and Lake Erie was guarded by the ferocious Iroquois, whom Champlain, by an ill-advised attack, had made the implaca ble enemies of the French. As one goes southward the works become more extensive and elaborate, and in the vicinity of the Ohio they are so large as to have attracted the most earnest attention of scientific men. It has long been a matter of general belief by such men that those works were built by a race anterior and superior to the Indians, to whom, for lack of any other name, has been given the appellation of \" Mound-Builders.\" It is needless here to discuss the question whether such a race actually existed on the shores of the Ohio and lower Mississippi, or, if so, what were its characteristics. It may reasonably be presumed that the general belief of the scientists is correct on those points. About the year 1650 those terrible confederates, already famed far and wide for their wisdom, their valor, and their ferocity, had become more redoubtable than ever before. Having destroyed the Kahquahs and Pries on the shores of Lake Erie, they had (about 1659) attacked the Hurons, or Wyandots, located on the eastern shore of the lake which bears their name, inflicting such terrible defeat that many of the conquered nation are said to have sought shelter on the frozen borders of Hudson's Bay. The greater portion, however, fled to the Ojibway hunting-grounds, on the southern shore of Lake Superior, as did also the Ottawawas, or Ottawas, who had been located in the vicinity of the Ottawa River, in Canada. The implacable Itoquois fol lowed the fugitives to their new haunts, but the latter, by the help of the Chippewas* were at length enabled to But as to whether a portion of that race ever resided in Michigan, we feel like expressing a modest opinion to the effect that there is but slight evidence of its presence here. In fact, the generally trivial character of the works in the lake country, compared with those on and near the Ohio, naturally raises the presumption that the former were not built by the same race as the latter. Moreover, the struc- * The original name of these Indians was Ojibwas, but for a long time they have always been called Chippeicas by the whites, and to avoid confusion they will thenceforth be thus designated in this volume."], [21, "RETROSPECTIVE 13 tures in the lake region were such as certainly could have been erected by the Indians, whether they were or not. True, the Indians were not in the habit of building earthen fortifications when the whites first settled in America, but they did build very elaborate palisades out of logs cut down with their stone axes, and this required much more labor and skill than the construction of small earthen forts. In fact, among warriors whose only weapons were clubs, stone tomahawks, and bows and arrows, the palisade was a much better protection than the earthwork, as it was much harder to shoot over or climb over, and may very naturally have succeeded the latter in the rude engineering of the savages. Subsequently, the Creeks, Choctaws, and other southern Indians built breastworks at Talladega, Horseshoe Bend, and elsewhere, to protect themselves from the rifles of the Americans, and there is no reason why their ancestors should not have done as much. Or perhaps the earthworks were auxiliary to the palisades, as suggested below. m four feet by eight, inside the two circles on the Helmer place, but no traces of them remained at the time of Mr. Post's visit. Besides these there was a burial-mound, thirty feet in diameter and apparently four or five feet high, on the north west quarter of the northwest quarter of section 6, in Heath. Mr. George Harrington, who accompanied Mr. Post, examined this in 1870, finding, some eighteen inches below the top, about one hundred human skeletons, with little or no earth among them. These extended to a depth of some two feet and a half. Beneath them was a layer of ashes and fine coals, perhaps half an inch thick, and then came the natural soil, on a level with that around. It doesn't seem as if it needed any antediluvian or pre historic race to pile a lot of corpses together and throw some dirt over them. Another mound, on the northeast quarter of section 1, in Manlius, measured twenty feet in diameter and three feet high. It had been dug open and a large skeleton re moved from it. Moreover, some of the fortifications in the lake country contained, when discovered, large piles of round stones, evidently intended for use against assailants, and tend ing strongly to prove that those works were built by a very barbarous people, having none of the culture and skill at tributed to the so-called \" Mound-Builders\" of the Missis sippi and Ohio valleys. No weapons, ornaments, nor implements were found or heard of, either in the mounds or circles. Mr. Post appended to his statement what seems to us the most sensible theory in regard to these circular earth works that has ever come under our notice. He says, \u2014 \"These earthen walls, after making due allowance for the leveling of the centuries past, and the more destructive plows of latter years, could never have been high enough to have been of any use for shelter or defense alone. They are probably the remaining traces of slight stockade forts, surrounded with palisades set deep in the ground, and the earth from a ditch outside used to make an elevated walk on the inside, high enough to give their defenders command of the level, outside, and to enable them to shoot over their palisade defense.\" The same may be said of the mounds found in Michigan, and apparently constructed for burial-purposes. Perhaps they were not built by Indians, but they do not seem much beyond the capacity of Indians to construct. From an article by H. D. Post, Esq., in the Allegan Journal of June 8, 1878, we condense a description of several mounds, etc., carefully examined by him, and which will serve as types of those found elsewhere in Southern Michigan. They were all situated within a mile of each other, and of the crossing of Rabbit River by the Grand Haven Railroad, in the townships of Fillmore, Manlius, and Heath, in Allegan County. The first work visited was on the farm of Mrs. Bostwick, on the southeast quarter of section 36, in Fillmore. On the south end of a ridge which rises fifteen or twenty feet above the adjoining land the explorers found a circular earthwork, averaging two feet high (notwithstanding frequent plowing) and sixteen feet wide ; the diameter of its outer circumference being from one hundred and twenty-four to one hundred and thirty eight feet. It was evidently formed by throwing up earth from a ditch outside. Or, perhaps, the palisade was loopholed for arrows; we think some early Indian forts discovered in the East were thus constructed. The so-called \" Ancient Garden-Beds\" of Michigan fur nish more material for controversy. They are so named because they are raised above the earth and separated by paths, like modern garden-beds, though many times larger. They have seldom been found out of Michigan, but were quite numerous in the southern part of that State at the time of its settlement by the whites. Many were found in Kalamazoo County, and some in Allegan and Barry. Bela S. Hubbard, Esq., of Detroit, who has given especial attention to this subject, divides the beds into eight classes, which he describes as follows : On the land of Mr. Brouwer, on the northeast quarter of section 1, in Manlius, was a circle which had been leveled by plowing, and was then barely discernible, but which was described by early settlers as having been two and one-half feet high and sixteen feet wide when the land was cleared. Its maximum diameter was one hundred and forty-four feet. \"1. Wide convex beds, in parallel rows, without paths, composing independent plats. AA'idth of beds, twelve feet; paths, none; length, seventy-four to one hundred and fifteen feet. \" 2. Wide convex beds, in parallel rows, separated by paths of same width, in independent plats. AA'idth of beds, twelve to sixteen feet; path-, the same; length, seventy-four to one hundred and thirty-two feet. Another circle similar to the foregoing was found on the land of Mr. Helmer, on the southeast quarter of section 36, in Fillmore. Its greatest diameter was one hundred and thirty feet, and it was said to have been three feet high when first cleared. Another, nearly obliterated, on the same farm, had a maximum diameter of about eighty feet. There are said to have been several small mounds, about \"3. Wide parallel beds, separated by narrow paths, arranged in a series of plats longitudinal to each other. AVidth of beds, fourteen feet; paths, two feet; length, one hundred feet. \"4. Long, narrow beds, separated by narrower paths and arranged in a series of longitudinal plats, each plat divided from the next by semicircular heads. AVidth of beds, five feet; paths, one foot and a half; length, one hundred feet ; height, eighteen inches. \" 5. Parallel beds, arranged in plats similar to Class 4, but divided"], [22, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 14 of the territory itself, as it was in the former year, and as it remained until the beginning of settlement within it by by circular heads. \"Width of beds, six feet; paths, four feet; length, twelve to forty feet; height, eighteen inches. \"6. Parallel beds, of varying widths and lengths, separated by narrow paths, and arranged in plats of two or more, at right angles (north, south, east, and west) to the plats adjacent. AVidth of beds, five to fourteen feet; paths, one to two feet; length, twelve to thirty feet; height, eight inches. the whites. That territory would now be described as all that part of the State of Michigan bounded south by the base-line, east by the line between ranges 6 and 7 east, north by the line between townships 4 and 5 north, and west by Lake Mich igan. But in 1671 there were of course no base-lines nor meridians, no ranges nor townships, and the voyageurs and missionaries, the primitive geographers of that day, would have used a far different method of description. They would have spoken of a tract of rather sandy land, twenty four miles wide, stretching back about sixty miles from the eastern shore of Lake Michigan (its southwestern corner being but about sixty miles from the head of that lake), and if they had been extremely minute in their explorations they might have told something of the nature of its forest covering, and of the streams which rolled across it. \" 7. Parallel beds, of uniform width and length, with narrow paths, arranged in plats or blocks, and single beds at varying angles. AVidth of beds, six feet; paths, two feet; length, about thirty feet; height, ten to twelve inches. \" 8. Wheel-shaped plats, consisting of a circular bed, with beds of uniform shape and size radiating therefrom, all separated by narrow paths. AVidth of beds, six to twenty feet; paths, one foot; length, fourteen to twenty feet.\" The labor involved in constructing these \" beds\" (which were raised from twelve to eighteen inches above the paths) was not at all beyond the capacity of the squaws, but the mathematical regularity which is attributed to them seems somewhat more precise than we should expect from Indians. But when we consider the proneness of mankind to exag gerate the wonderful character of anything they may dis cover, when we take into view the rapidity with which these so-called \" beds\" were obliterated by the settlers' plows, and the consequent difficulty of ascertaining whether they were as regular in form as represented, we may well hesitate before we create another race of men on purpose to construct and work these curious plats. Mr. Hubbard himself ad vances the opinion that these beds may have been cultivated until within three or four centuries of the present time. If such was the case, they were certainly cultivated by Indians, for it is almost three hundred and fifty years since Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence to the site of Montreal, finding the shores of that river occupied by Indians of the Algonquin race, and there can be no question but that the whole northern part of North America was then occupied by the red men so well known to the settlers of this country. The surface was somewhat broker^ but not extremely so, and gradually ascended from the lake eastward. It has been decided by scientific observation that at the eastern limit of the tract (being the eastern boundary of the present county of Barry) the ground rises to a height of two hundred and fifty feet above the level of Lake Michigan, and the distance is nowhere exceeded between that line and the sheet of water just mentioned. The principal stream which watered the tract under con sideration was the one which, according to the early ex plorers, was called the Kekalamazoo by the Indians, but which has long been known to the whites under the abbre viated but still sufficiently lengthy appellation of Kalamazoo ; which entered the present county of Allegan from the southeast, three miles west of its southeastern corner, and pursued a general northwestern course, though with many turns and convolutions, till it poured its waters into Lake Michigan seven miles south from the northwestern corner of the same county. Its principal tributary, now known as Rabbit River, entered the \" Kekalamazoo\" from the northeast, about eight miles from its mouth, and, with its branches, drained all of the northeastern part of the terri tory of Allegan County. The next largest affluent, which has long borne the name of Gun River, carried the waters of a large lake from the present boundary between Allegan and Barry Counties southwestward into the Kalamazoo, which it reached only four miles below the entrance of that stream into the territory under consideration. The other tributaries of the river just named drained all the remainder of the territory of Allegan County except a small tract in the southwestern corner, the dark waters of which flowed southwestward through the various branches of Black River into Lake Michigan, and a still smaller area in the northwest, the brooks and creeks of which found their way into the long bayou now known as Black Bay. All things considered, therefore, and in spite of the opinion of some eminent men on the subject, we must be permitted to doubt whether Michigan had ever been occu pied, previous to the advent of the whites, by any race more civilized than the Ottawas and Pottawattamies who then roamed through its forests.

AVhat our Subject is \u2014 The Territory of Allegan and Barry in 1671 \u2014 Surface of the Ground \u2014 The Rivers and their Tributaries \u2014 Numer- ous Lakes \u2014 The Trees of the Forest \u2014 AVild Animals. The subject of this history is the territory comprised in the counties of Allegan and Barry, the events which have transpired within its limits, and the deeds of its red and white residents, wherever done. In order, however, to show the chain of events, we are obliged to mention briefly some outside occurrences connected with the general progress of discovery and civilization in Michigan and the Nctrthwest. Before, however, proceeding down the historic pathway from 1671 to 1880, we will glance at the principal characteristics The eastern portion of the tract under consideration, now known as Barry County, was mostly drained by the main channel and the branches of a stream which flowed north westwardly through it, \u2014 making its way into Grand River, and theuce into Lake Michigan, \u2014 and to which, on account of the wild fruit along its banks, was early given the name"], [23, "FROM 1671 TO 1707. 15 of Thornapple River, although the water of the extreme southern and western borders rippled southwestward through groves-of pine to unite with the Kalamazoo. CHAPTER IV. FROM 1671 TO 1707. But the distinguishing feature of the territory of Barry County was the lakes which dotted its surface in the most lavish profusion. The Ottawa or Pottawattamie warrior, as he bounded through the gloomy glades after the deer, or set out on the war-path against his distant foes, passed scores of pellucid lakes flashing in the sunlight of summer or covered with the ice of winter, and varying in size from the broad, irregular expanse now known as Gun Lake, covering over five square miles, to the miniature sheet flashing amid the daik mass of pines like a diamond im bedded in emerald. Nearly a hundred and fifty of these lakes or ponds were to be found in what is now Barry County, while the territory of Allegan County, though much larger, showed but about eighty.

After 1671 the French pushed rapidly forward in vari ous directions, and under various leaders, to make good their possession of the lands over which they had so proudly proclaimed their sovereignty. The intrepid Jesuit, Father Jacques Marquette, inspired by zeal for his religion, was one of the foremost of these bold explorers of the North west. In 1672, in company with the adventurous trader, Louis Joliet, already mentioned, he went up Green Bay into Wisconsin, and the following spring he proceeded up Fox River and down the Wisconsin, discovering the Mis sissippi at Prairie du Chien on the 17th of June, 1673, and exploring it for a long distance southward. Returning to Green Bay, he remained there until the autumn, when he set out to found a mission among the Illinois. He was detained by sickness near the site of Chicago through the succeeding winter, but in the spring of 1675 he reached the Illinois, located on the river of the same name, and preached to them with all his wonted zeal. These hills were covered, these lakes were surrounded, largely by towering pines, comprising some of the most majestic specimens of that genus to be found in America, the dark and odorous foliage of which swayed and sighed in the breeze one hundred and fifty feet above the earth from which they sprang. These, however, did not comprise the whole of the native productions of the soil. Beeches, maples, oaks, elms, and other trees common in American for ests were found in many localities, and the hemlock showed itself here and there beside the more stately form of its sister evergreen. Around the lakes and through the sorest the deer roamed in large numbers. Here, too, at night, was heard the howl ing of innumerable wolves, always apparently hungry and seeking with ill success for food, their principal reliance being some superannuated or crippled deer which they were able to overtake. Occasionally a black bear rolled his un wieldy form beneath the trees, though the prevalence of pines, instead of the oaks and hickories on which those animals depend for food, rendered their presence rare. At still wider intervals the shrill scream of the panther, fiercest of American beasts, was heard afar in the forests, making all other animals tremble with fear, and startling even the Indian warrior with the prospect of more than ordinary Finding his health rapidly failing, however, he set out for Mackinaw, making his way with two or throe compan ions in a small boat along the eastern shore of Lake Michi gan. This is the first definite account we have observed of white men even skirting the shore of Allegan County, though it is not improbable that French missionaries had previously tried their eloquence on the wandering Ottawas or Miami's along its shore, nor that French fur-traders had made their way up the Kalamazoo in their eager search for valuable peltry. Marquette's health continuing to fail, he and his com panions landed on the 19th of May, and that same night he died. The place of his death is described as being \" at the mouth of a small river, some distance south of Sleep ing Bear Point.\" It has generally been supposed to have been at the mouth of Pere Marquette River, on the site of the present town of Ludington, which was also long known by the name of Pere Marquette, but the locality is now believed to have been farther north. danger. Raccoons, squirrels, and other small animals abounded ; wild turkeys trooped in noisy squadrons through the under growth ; wild geese and ducks, in spring and autumn, often covered the surface of the placid lakes; while amid the trees flitted thousands of the smaller birds, of varied song and diverse size and many-hued plumage. On the ground, besides some harmless varieties of serpents, the deadly rattlesnake made its tortuous way, preluding its fatal stroke with the warning note which distinguishes it from all other reptiles. But a still greater explorer than Marquette was about to traverse the lakes and lands of the Great West, though, unlike Marquette, he did not subordinate all other objects to the spread of his religion. In the month of August, 1679, the wonder-stricken savages on the shores of the De troit River saw what seemed to them a huge canoe, with immense wings, stemming the powerful current, without the aid of oars or paddles, and swiftly traversing the placid sheet of water now known as Lake St. Clair. This was the \" Griffin,\" a schooner of sixty tons burden, built the pre ceding winter and spring on the shore of the Niagara, just Of the human occupants of this region, almost as deadly as the serpent we have just mentioned, and even more deadly, enough will be said in some of the following chapters."], [24, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 16 Despairing of the return of his vessel, La Salle went with the greater portion of his men to a point on the Illi nois River, where he built a post to which he gave the ex presive name of Fort Crevec\u0153ur, \u2014 Broken Heart. His courage was by no means exhausted, however, and in order to obtain reinforcements and supplies he and three com panions performed the remarkable feat of returning from Crevec\u0153ur to Fort Frontenac (on the site of Kingston, Ontario) on foot, depending on their guns for support. Having once more made his way to the West he was met with new disappointment, for both the Fort of the Miamis and Fort CreA'ec\u0153ur had been destroyed, and all his men, save Tonty and a few others, had deserted to join the savages or the scarcely less lawless voyageurs. above the great cataract, and which on the 7th of August had set forth on the first voyage ever made by a sail-vessel over the waters of the upper lakes. Its commander was Robert Cavelier de La Salle, the most hardy and adventur ous of all the gallant Frenchmen who explored the wilds of North America, and the one whose discoveries did the most to extend the dominions of his royal master. The only portrait which has been preserved of La Salle represents him as a handsome, blue-eyed cavalier with blonde ringlets, apparently better fitted for the salons of Paris than the forests of America, but a thousand evidences show not only the courage, but the extraordinary vigor and hardihood, of this remarkable man. He was accompanied by Tonty,* a gallant Italian, who was his second in command, by Father Hennepin, a Franciscan monk, who became the historian of the expedition, and by about thirty sailors, voyageurs, hunters, etc. Nevertheless the intrepid explorer again re-established his posts, passing, in the autumn of 1680, along the west ern shore of Allegan County, and thence down the lake to Mackinaw, where he obtained twelve men, with whom he returned by the same route to the fort on the Illinois. The subsequent career of this adventurous explorer is not espe cially connected with the history of this region, and must be dismissed in a few words. After many other exploits and hardships he descended the Mississippi to the sea, in 1682, being the first to traverse the lower part of that stream and to prove that it emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. He took possession of the country in the name of King Louis the Fourteenth, and called it Louisiana. Returning to France, he astonished and gratified the court of that mon arch with the story of his discoveries, and in 1684 was fur nished with a fleet and several hundred men to colonize the new domain. The fleet, however, through the blunders of the^naval commander, landed in Texas instead of Louisiana, and after innumerable misfortunes the indomitable La Salle set out for Canada, in 1687, on foot, to seek assistance, but was assassinated while still in Texas by two of his own men. The \" Griffin\" passed on over the waters of Lake Huron, stayed but a brief period at the post of Mackinaw, where Tonty stopped with some of the men, and then proceeded to the mission at the head of Green Bay. Thence it was sent back with a part of its crew and a cargo of furs, while the intrepid La Salle, with a score of men, remained to explore the vast empire which lay spread before him. He and his comrades coasted around the western shore and the head of Lake Michigan in birch-bark canoes, and in the month of October reached the mouth of the St. Joseph River. To this stream he gave the name of River of the Miamis, from the Miami Indians whom he found in that vicinity, and on the site of the village of St. Joseph he built a fortified trading post, which he called the Fort of the Miamis. This was the first post built on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, and its erection, together with the appearance of a French vessel in the upper lakes, was another important step in the work of subjecting the great Northwest, and especially the southwestern portion of Michigan, to French rule. But, notwithstanding the unfortunate end of the great discoverer, his achievements had extended the dominion of France more widely than had those of any of his compa triots, and from that time the Bourbon kings maiutained an ascendency more or less complete throughout all the vast region extending from Quebec to New Orleans, until compelled to resign it nearly a century later by the prowess of the British. French vessels circled around the Great Lakes on the track of the ill-fated \" Griffin,\" French forts and trading-posts were erected in the wilderness, and French missionaries bore the cross among the heathen with redoubled zeal. French adroitness succeeded in establish ing and continuing friendly relations with nearly all the Indians of the Northwest, and members of nearly all the tribes found their way to Fort Frontenac, and even to Montreal, with packages of furs to sell to the children of their great father across the sea. The English, busily engaged in building up a powerful but compact empire along the coast, scarcely attempted to rival their Gallic competitors in gaining control over the immense interior. The Indians would doubtless have re jected with scorn the idea of French ownership in the lands which they and their ancestors had so long occupied, but, as between the English and French, it was substantially understood that the dominion of the former extended from La Salle and his companions waited several weary weeks at the Fort of the Miamis for the return of the \" Griffin,\" and also for the arrival of Tonty from Mackinaw. About the 20th of November, Tonty, with ten men, made his way in boats along the western shore of Allegan County, having left ten more men to supply the common larder by hunting a little farther north. The gallant Italian had lost an arms on a European battle-field, but was always ready to meet the greater dangers of the American wil derness or the stormy lakes with unflinching eye, and was still more distinguished for his fidelity than his courage among the many faithless followers of La Salle. He joined his chief at the Fort of the Miamis at the time just men tioned, and was soon followed by the hunters who had been left behind. But the \" Griffin,\" the pioneer vessel of Lake Michigan was never heard of after leaving Green Bay. It probably went to the bottom in a storm with all its men, but it mi\"*ht possibly have been captured at anchor by jealous savages the crew butchered, and the vessel itself destroyed. * This name was originally the Italian one of Tonti, but La Salle 's lieutenant always wrote it in the Gallic form, \u2014 Tonty. t Its place was supplied by one of iron ; hen\u00e6 he was generally called \" Bras de Fer\" (Iron Arm) by the Indians."], [25, "THE OTTAWAS AND POTTAWATTAMIES IN 1707. 17 the mouth of the St. Lawrence to that of the Mississippi, the only question being where the boundary-line should be drawn between the two domains. continued to keep their headquarters at Mackinaw, and to occupy their hunting-grounds on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. About 17U7 the Miamis, who were located on the St. Joseph River, removed to Detroit. Their place was supplied almost immediately by the warlike Pottawat tamies, who established their chief seats along the lower St. Joseph, and whose hunting-parties roamed northward until they met those of their friends and allies, the Ottawas, in or near the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties. The Ottawas and Pottawattamies occupied the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, including the counties of Allegan and Barry, nearly one hundred and thirty years, and the accouut of their dominion must be reserved for another chapter. In 1686 Fort St. Joseph was erected near the site of the city of Port Huron, where the waters of Lake Huron enter the river St. Clair, to aid in the maintenance of French dominion over the Northwest. Soon after, a post called Fort Detroit was established near the site of Detroit. Fort St. Joseph, however, was destroyed two years after its erection, by the French themselves, and about the same time a fort bearing the same name was erected at the mouth of the St. Joseph River, on the site of La Salle's Fort of the Miamis. The Indians of the upper lakes were the more ready to court the French,, in order to obtain from them arms and ammunition with which to combat the dreaded Iroquois. In 1687 volunteers were obtained from almost all the tribes of the Northwest to join the expedition of the Marquis de Denonville, Governor-General of Canada, against those fierce confederates. Tonty led one band of about two hundred from Illinois to Detroit, while the main body, consisting of Ottawas, Pottawattamies, Chippewas, and others, assembled at Mackinaw. Their conduct was somewhat doubtful, but La Durantaye, the French commander, waylaid and cap tured some English boats which were on their way with goods to be traded with the savages, distributed their con tents among the latter, gained their zealous friendship, and led them to Fort Detroit.

Thence they all proceeded to the southern shore of Lake Ontario, where they assisted Denonville to defeat the Senecas in battle, but without materially diminishing their power or that of their brother Iroquois. A few prisoners were cap tured, and Denonville wrote about the atrocities committed by \" our rascally Ottawas,\" whom he also accused of coward ice in the fight. As early as 1707 the two tribes of Indians whose names head this chapter became the owners, by right of occupa tion, of the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties, and remained so until within the memory of men now living. The Ottawas were on the north, the Pottawattamies on the south. The boundary between their respective posses sions was not strictly defined, \u2014 as, indeed, boundaries sel dom were among the Indians, \u2014 and the hunting-parties of both tribes roamed at will over the territory in question. As, however, the two nations were, during all the time mentioned, bound closely together by the ties of friendship and alliance, no ill results were caused by this joint own ership. Fort Detroit was soon after abandoned, and for many years the only French posts in Michigan were those at Saut Sainte Marie, Mackinaw, and the mouth of the St. Joseph River. The Miamis continued a great part of the time on the latter river, but they were absent for about ten years after 1681, and in 1697 a large number of them were massacred by the Sioux, and many, but not all, of the remainder fled the country. The territory of Allegan and Barry Counties remained a debatable ground between the Miamis and Ottawas, unoccupied save by winter hunting parties, but to all appearances more fully under the control of the Ottawas than of any other tribe. The Ottawas, as before stated, were fugitives from Canada, where the Ottawa River and the capital city of British North America still perpetuate their memory, while the Pottawattamies were recent emigrants from the western shore of Lake Michigan, where they had been found by the earliest French discoverers. Yet both tribes belonged to the great Algonquin race, and both spoke dialects of the Algonquin language, so similar that Ottawas and Potta wattamies (as well as Chippewas) could understand each other without the aid of an interpreter. In 1701, La Motte Cadillac, who had been for several years the commandant at Mackinaw, established a perma nent post on the \" detroit,\" or strait, between Lakes Erie and St. Clair, which was at first known as Fort Ponchar train, but soon received the appellation of Detroit, which, as post, village, and city, it has retained to this day. Ca dillac immediately made strenuous efforts to induce all the various tribes of the Northwest who were friendly to the French to locate themselves around Fort Ponchartrain, evidently desirous to have them well in hand, so that the French commanders could more easily lead them on warlike expeditions against the English and Iroquois. A portion of the Ottawas accepted his invitation, while the remainder The Algonquins, it should be said, according to those who have made a special study of Indian history, were a great Indian race, comprising nearly all the tribes residing north of the present State of Tennessee, east of the Mis sissippi, and south of Hudson Bay. Nearly all, we say, for in the midst of them were established the five confed erated nations of Iroquois, who constituted a separate race, and who occupiedthe greater part of the present State of New York. The Wyandots, or Hurons, residing near Lake 3"], [26, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 18 corn, the beans, and the pumpkins which constituted the Indians' only relief from a diet of fish and meat. It will be seen that, while the Ottawas and Pottawatta mies were undoubtedly, according to Indian ideas, the own ers of the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties, their residence there was of a very transitory character. Yet, as they were so long the only human occupants of the ter ritory in question, we shall devote the following chapter to a slight account of some of their principal exploits. This can the more easily be done because, on account of the league already mentioned, these two tribes, together with the Chippewas, almost always sought together, whether against the Iroquois, the English, or the Americans. Huron, were an outlying branch of the Iroquois, but hos tile to that great confederacy, while the Tuscaroras were a friendly offshoot in the south, who, about that time, became the sixth of the \" Six Nations.\" Aside from these the woods and prairies, far and near, swarmed with the divers tribes of the Algonquin race ; \u2014 Abenaquis in Canada, Pequots and Narragansetts in New England, Delawares in Pennsylvania, Shawnees in Ohio, Miamis in Ohio and Indiana, Illinois in the territory of the State which still bears their name, Sauks, Foxes, and Menomonees in the country west of Lake Michigan, while the great peninsula of Michigan and some neighboring sec tions were occupied by the Chippewas, the Ottawas, and the Pottawattamies. All these, though so widely scattered, and though often warring desperately among themselves, belonged as has been said to one great stock, and spoke various dialects of one language. They outnumbered the Five Nations of Iroquois more than ten to one, yet such was the sagacity and valor of those confederates that they had been able to defeat their disunited foes one after the other, until the terror of the Iroquois name had spread over half the continent of North America. Even the Hurons, though of the same race and almost equal in numbers, lacked the ferocious energy of the Five Nations, and had been driven in utter rout before them. It would be foreign to the design of our work to give an extended description of these ancient lords of the soil. They had the usual characteristics of the Indian, and espe cially of the Algonquin, race. Less terrible in battle, less sagacious in council, than the men of the Six Nations, they were nevertheless, like the rest of their red brethren, brave, hardy, and skillful warriors, astute managers so far as their knowledge extended, generally faithful friends, and invaria bly most implacable enemies. Their own time they devoted to war, the chase, or idleness, abandoning to the women all the labors which could be imposed upon their weary shoul ders. They lived in the utmost freedom which it is possible to imagine, consistent with any civil or military organization whatever. Their sachems exercised little authority, save to declare war or make peace, to determine on the migrations of the tribes, and to give wise counsels, allaying any ill feel ing which might exist among the people. There was no positive law compelling obedience. The Chippewas, Ottawas, and Pottawattamies, who, as already stated, after the removal of the latter tribe to the St. Joseph valley, occupied the present State of Michigan and some adjoining territory, were united in a rude confed eracy, somewhat similar to the celebrated league of the Iroquois, but far less thorough aud less potent. We are unable to say whether it was formed before or after the re moval of the Pottawattamies to the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, though its origin was certainly not much later than that event, aud it could hardly have been much earlier, on account of the previous wide separation of the three tribes. Even in war there was no way by which the braves could be forced to take tbe war-path. Any chieftain could drive a stake into the ground, dance the war-dance around it, strike his tomahawk into it with a yell of defiance, and call for volunteers to go forth against the foe. If his courage or capacity was doubted, he obtained but few followers. If he was of approved valor and skill, a larger number would grasp their tomahawks in response to his appeal ; while, if he was a chieftain distinguished far and wide for deeds of blood and craft, the whole nation would spring to arms, and all its villages would resound with the terrific notes of the war-song, chanted by hundreds of frenzied braves. Even after they had taken the field (or, more properly speaking, the woods) against their enemies, they could not be com pelled to fight, except by the fear of being called a \" squaw,\" which, however, to the Indian mind was a very terrible punishment. Since the advent of the French, who furnished them with arms, ammunition, and leadership, these tribes had become less afraid of the Iroquois, and were consequently willing to locate themselves in positions farther east than they would previously have dared to occupy. La Motte Cadillac had urged his policy of concentration with such success that already, in 1707, a considerable number of the Ottawas, Hurons, and Miamis had located themselves under the protecting walls of Fort Ponchartrain. The main body of the Ottawas, however, remained in Northern Michigan, and the Pottawattamies were just setting up their wig- wams in the fertile valley of the St. Joseph. More of the Ottawas subsequently went to Fort Ponchartrain (or De- troit), and several villages of the Pottawattamies were subsequently transferred thither, but the two tribes still retained their ownership of the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties, and occupied it as a hunting-ground for nearly a century and a half. In winter they hunted over its hills and dales, in spring they fished in its streams, but in summer they returned, the Ottawas to the northern part of the State, the Pottawattamies to the St. Joseph valley, and some of both tribes to the vicinity of Detroit ; and in these localities, during the summer, the squaws raised the With the Indian method of warfare the American mind is pretty well acquainted, so that we need not give a de tailed description of it here. Few have not read how the warriors went forth against their foes clad chiefly in hid eous paint, but armed with tomahawk and scalping-knives, and those who had been sufficiently successful in fur-catch ing carrying also the coveted muskets of the white man ; how they made their way with the utmost secrecy through the forest until they reached the vicinity of their enemies, whether white or red ; how, when their unsuspecting vic tims were wrapped in slumber, the whole crowd of painted"], [27, "OTTAWAS AND POTTAWATTAMIES FROM 1707 TO 1815. 19 demons would burst in among them, using musket, knife, and tomahawk with the most furious zeal ; and how, when the torch had been applied, men, women, and children were stricken down in indiscriminate slaughter by the lurid light of their blazing homes.

It is well known, too, that those who escaped immediate death were often reserved for a still more horrible doom ; that the fearful sport of running the gauntlet, when a hun dred weapons were flung by malignant foes at the naked fugitive, was but the preliminary amusement before the awful burning at the stake, accompanied by all the refine ments of torment which a baleful ingenuity could invent, yet supported with unsurpassable fortitude by the victim, who often shrieked his defiant death-song amid the last convulsions of his tortured frame. Their religion was what might have been expected from their practices, \u2014 a mass of senseless and brutal superstition. Marquette, the most zealous of missionaries, after several years' labor on the upper lakes, could only say that the Hurons \" retained a little Christianity,\" but that the Ottawas were \"addicted above all other tribes to the foulest incantations, and to sacri fices to evil spirits.\" The efforts of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries made very little improvement among them in regard to religion. The Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and Chippewas, forming the Michigan league already mentioned, usually acted to gether in their numerous warlike expeditions. Of the con flicts which they waged with other savages there is seldom any record unless they fought in connection with the French. Even in that case the accounts are few and meagre. The Michigan Indians were almost continually at war with the Iroquois, and, notwithstanding the acknowledged valor and sagacity of the Six Nations, the former, having the sup port, and sometimes the active assistance, of the French, were able, after 1707, to hold their ground, remaining in possession of the peninsula throughout the century. In speaking of Indians, the term \" nation\" is generally used as synonymous with tribe, and to the civilized ear the word carries the idea of large numbers, confirmed by the immense range of Indian operations and by the terror which they always inspired on our frontiers. Yet the cele- brated Five Nations, in the height of their power, numbered altogether but two or three thousand warriors ; the Wyan- dot branch of the Iroquois had about the same number, and the various tribes of Algonquin lineage were propor- tionally small. As nearly as can be ascertained the Potta- wattamies, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, numbered, all told, about eight hundred warriors, while the Ottawas had probably about twelve hundred. The Chip pewas \u2014 with whom, as before stated, those two tribes were linked in a loose confederacy \u2014 were supposed to num- ber as many as both of them. Early in May, 1712, when the warriors at Cadillac's settlement at Fort Ponchartrain were nearly all absent, hunting, a large body of Oiitagamie (Fox) and Mascoutin Indians, supposed to be in league with the Iroquois, sud denly appeared before the fort, erected a breastwork, and made other preparations for an assault. Du Buisson, the commandant, who had only about twenty men with him, sent runners to call in the hunting-parties, and then awaited the assault of his foes. It was made on the 13th of May, and, though temporarily repulsed, there was every prospect that it would be successful, on account of the comparatively large numbers of the assailants. At the time of the settlement of the Pottawattamies in the St. Joseph valley, about 1707, both that tribe and the Ottawas were at enmity with the Miami's, and from the vague accounts which have come down to us it seems prob able that it was the joint hostility of the first two tribes which compelled the Miamis to leave that locality and es tablish themselves farther southward. Yet all three tribes were under the influence of the French, who were able to produce at least partial harmony among them, and to unite them for hostile purposes against the Iroquois and the Eng lish. The following chapter gives a slight account of the subsequent history of the Ottawa and Pottawattamie lords of Allegan and Barry. While it was going on, however, the Ottawa, Pottawat tamie, and Wyandot warriors returned from the hunt, aud immediately attacked the assailants. The latter were driven into their own defenses ; those defenses were assaulted by the French and their allies, and these were in turn repulsed by the Foxes and Mascoutins. Thus the conflict continued with varying fortunes for no less than nineteen days, when the invaders fled. Several miles north of Detroit they halted and built a rude fortification, but the French and their allies attacked them with two small pieces of artillery, and routed them after three days more of fighting, when the Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and Wyanduts massacred eight hundred men, women, and children."], [28, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 20 could resist ; routing him with great slaughter, and returning to their homes laden with glory and scalps. When war broke out, in 1744, between the French and English, numerous bands from all the northwestern tribes sought the service of the French. Some of them assailed the\u00b0 frontiers of Pennsylvania and Virginia, while others made their way to Montreal, where they were furnished with arms and ammunition, and were sent forth against the settlers of New York and New England. In 1745 one of the numerous records made by the Canadian officials states that fifty \" Poutewatamies,\" fifteen Puans, and ten Illinois came to go to war. Another mentions the arrival of thirty-eight \" Outawois,\" seventeen \" Sauternes,\" twenty-four Hurons, and fourteen \" Poutewatamies\" Similar official memoranda show the sending out of not less than twenty marauding expeditions against the English colonists in one year, fre quent mention being made of the part taken by the Otta was and Pottawattamies in these bloody raids. In fact, the Fox nation was reported to be completely destroyed, but this was not the case. Some of its warriors joined the Iroquois, while the main body fled to the west side of Lake Michigan, where they were long distinguished for their especial hatred against the French. In 1716 an expedition was sent against them by the Governor of Canada, which defeated them near Green Bay and com pelled them to assume an attitude of comparative peace fulness. On the other hand, the friendship then cemented be tween the French and the Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and Wyandots endured through more than half a century of varied fortunes, and was scarcely severed when throughout Canada and the West the Gallic flag went down in hopeless defeat before the conquering English. During the next thirty years there are but few records regarding the acts of the Ottawas and Pottawattamies. Their hunting and fishing parties every year roamed over the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties, and doubtless their war-parties marched across that territory against their savage foes, but England and Fiance were at peace for thirty-one years (from 1713 to 1744), and the exploits of our Ottawa and Pottawattamie friends were not considered After the close of that war by the treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle, in 1748, there was comparative quiet among the red men of the Northwest until the opening of the great conflict known in Europe as the Seven Years' War, but in America called the \"Old French and Indian War.\" This contest was begun in 1754 by a fight between a body of Virginia rangers, under Maj. George Washington, and a company of French sent out from Fort Duquesne, now Pittsburgh. The next year desperate exertions were made on both sides. Bands of Northwestern Indians again joined the French, while the Iroquois acted, as usual, in the interest of the English. worthy of much notice. In 1721, Monsieur de Tonty, then in command of De troit (a younger brother of La Salle's lieutenant), held a council with the chiefs of the Hurons, Ottawas, and Potta wattamies, and united them in a league against the hostile tribes west of Lake Michigan, but neither party was able to drive the other from its hunting-grounds. The latter fitted out three expeditions, the most celebrated of which was the one under the eommander-in-chief, Gen. Braddock. Early in June, 1755, that brave but conceited and thick-headed commander led forth an army of some two thousand men, mostly British regulars, against Fort Duquesne, situated on the site of Pittsburgh. After a part of the distance had been traversed he advanced with twelve hundred men and some light artillery, and on the 8th of July camped within a few miles of the fort. The French, meanwhile, had made the most earnest efforts to strengthen their meagre force with all the Indians they could induce to repair to Fort Duquesne. The red men, however, are much averse to being shut up in forts, and, according to \" Sargent's History of Braddock's Expedition,\" there were but six hundred and thirty-seven warriors at Fort Duquesne when Braddock approached that post. These comprised Ab enakis and Caughnawagas from Canada, Shawnees from Ohio, Chippewas, Ottawas, and Pottawattamies from Michigan, and some smaller bands from other sections. There were also two or three hundred French regulars and Canadian militia. These numbers, to a generation which has seen a million and a half Americans in arms at once, may perhaps seem too scanty to deserve attention ; but In dian forces were usually small (extremely small in compar ison with the terror they inspired), and the mere squad then gathered at Fort Duquesne was able to affect the course of the war throughout this continent, and to fill England itself with indignation and alarm. The Michigan Indians usually sold their surplus furs to their friends, the French, in exchange for blankets, cali coes, ornaments, guns, ammunition, and brandy. After 1727, however, when the English opened a trading-house at Oswego, many of the upper-lake Indians made their way thither with their furs, where they could obtain much better bargains than the French would give them. Never theless, their friendship was bestowed on the latter people, and a few years later the French local authorities reported to the home government that they exercised authority over a hundred and three tribes, numbering sixteen thousand warriors. But this authority was very precarious, and would more properly have been described as influence. An incident which occurred in 1734 shows the supersti tion which the Ottawas shared with all savage tribes. In that year they became engaged in a struggle with another tribe, said to be allied with the English. Twice the Ottawa warriors went forth to attack the foe, and twice they were repulsed with heavy loss. In vain the French commandant at Mackinaw urged them to repeat the attempt. They were discouraged, and would not try. At length the great war-chief, La Fourche, announced that he had learned from a dream that the Ottawas could not succeed unless they were accompanied by the half-breed boy, Charles de Lang lade (then, according to the story, only five years old), son of a French trader and his Indian wife, the sister of the chieftain. His father consented ; the boy was taken on the hostile expedition by his uncle, and the Ottawas, believing themselves protected by a powerful Manitou, rushed upon the enemy with a confidence and impetuosity that nothing The second officer in command at the fort, Capt. Beaujeu, boldly proposed to attack the English on their march, and"], [29, "OTTAWAS AND POTTAWATTAMIES FROM 1707 TO 1815. 21 the commander reluctantly consented. But the Indians were much alarmed at the reported numbers of the English, and at first refused to make the effort. But Beaujeu, who had great influence over them, harangued them ardently, and finally threatened to go alone against the enemy if they would not accompany him. They yielded, and were soon as eager as Beaujeu himself. The next morning. July 9th, that officer led forth about eight hundred white and red warriors and fiercely attacked the English, a little after noon, while passing among deep ravines about nine miles from the fort. Charles de Langlade, the boy already men tioned, now grown to man's estate and become an ensign in the French army, was an active participant in the fight, and is said by some to have led the Ottawas on that occa sion. Beaujeu was killed at the first fire, but his lieuten ant rallied the wavering forces, and the Indians ensconced themselves in the ravines, whence they kept up a terrific fire on the demoralized British, who were extremely fright ened at seeing that the volleys, as was said, came out of the ground at their feet. ever, supported by a few French and Canadians, attacked and almost utterly destroyed a force under Maj. Grant, sent forward to reconnoitre the post. On the approach of the main army, however, the French and their red allies were compelled to abandon Fort Duquesne and retreat to fast nesses still deeper in the forest. During the summer of 1759 an Anglo-colonial force at tacked Fort Niagara, at the mouth of Niagara River, and once more the French summoned their Ottawa, Pottawat tamie, Chippewa, and Shawnee allies to aid them. D'Au bry, the commander at Venango, succeeded in gathering about six hundred Indians, and with these and a somewhat larger force of French and Canadians proceeded down Lake Erie and the Niagara River to relieve the fort. Sir Wil liam Johnson, however, who commanded the besiegers, at tacked D'Aubry just below the Falls of Niagara, defeated, wounded, and captured him, and slew or took prisoner a large part of his command. Fort Niagara soon surrendered, and a little later the fall of Quebec (at which a large body of Western Indians was present) virtually decided the fate of Canada and the Northwest. The Indians began to lose faith in the omnipo tence of their French friends, and most of them returned to their homes on the shores of the great lakes and rivers of the West, and gloomily awaited the result. In vain the British officers endeavored to encourage their soldiers ; in vain Braddock himself rushed into the thickest of the fire, where five horses were successively shot under him ; in vain his aide-de-camp, young Col. Washington, seconded the efforts of his chief, having two horses killed under him and his clothes riddled with bullets ; in vain a few Virginia riflemen sought the enemy with good effect from behind trees. The whole body of regulars was com pletely demoralized, and after three hours' fighting, during which the general was mortally wounded, while nearly three-fourths of the officers and more than half the men were killed and wounded, the whole command fled in utter rout, and hardly halted till it reached the settlements of Pennsylvania. The next year three British armies were concentrated against Montreal, and the Governor-General was compelled to surrender Canada, which included the whole Northwest, to the English. Maj. Robert Rogers, a celebrated New Hampshire partisan, was immediately sent with a body of his rangers to take possession of Detroit, and the following year (1761) Mackinaw and St. Joseph were surrendered to the English, the three posts being considered as carrying with them authority over the whole peninsula of Michi- The Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and other Indians present celebrated their victory with a perfect carnival of blood, having never before reaped such a harvest of scalps and plunder. gan. It was not, however, until February, 1763, that the final treaty of peace between France and England was signed, by which Canada, including the Northwest as far as the Mis sissippi, was formally transferred to the latter power. The news of this event did not reach Detroit till the following summer, and in the mean time the newly-established power of the British was almost overthrown in the West by a few despised bands of savages. The defeat of Braddock encouraged the rest of the West ern warriors to take up arms for the French, and nearly every Ottawa or Pottawattamie who could lift a tomahawk went forth upon the war-path against the hapless inhabitants of the Pennsylvania and Virginia frontiers. Near]}' a thou sand Western savages joined the army of Montcalm in Canada in 1757, and took part in the stirring scenes in that locality. The Ottawas are particularly mentioned for their valor and activity, in the accounts of that period. A letter from Montcalm describes the destruction visited by them in July, 1757, on a regiment of three hundred and fifty New Jerseymen who were crossing Lake George (N. Y.) in barges, of whom one hundred and fifty-one were killed and about one hundred and sixty taken prisoners. Three hundred and thirty-seven Ottawas were also engaged in the siege of Fort William Henry the same season, and in the ferocious massacre which followed its capture. At the close of the war the principal chief of the Ottawas was the celebrated Pontiae. Tradition declares that he led the warriors of that tribe at the time of the destruction of Braddock's army, but there is no direct evidence on this point, yet the statement is quite probable, for he could hardly have become head-chief of the Ottawas without displaying his valor on many a stricken field. As before stated, the Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and Chippewas were united in a loose confederacy, and Pontiae seems to have been recog nized as its head, though his authority over the last two tribes was not so great as over his own. In the \" Pontiae Manuscript,\" written soon after Pontiac's war and now in the possession of the Michigan State Historical Society, he is described as \" Pondiac, great chief of all the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pottawattamies, and of all the nations of the lakes aud rivers of the North,\" yet he seems to have had no power over any but the three tribes named, save the In 1758 they were again summoned to the defense of Fort Duquesne, then threatened by another English army, under Gen. Forbes, but such was their inveterate dislike to the task of either attacking or defending fortified posts that less than a thousand were brought together. These, how-"], [30, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 22 rible massacre. On the 4th of June, the anniversary of the king's birthday, the Chippewas played a game of ball close beside the fort, the officers and soldiers watching them with unsuspicious minds and open gates. At length the ball was thrown, apparently by accident, inside the wall ; several Indians ran in after it ; squaws, already inside, gave them tomahawks ; the work of murder immediately began, and in a moment the whole horde of furious demons was engaged in the attack on the hated English. Seventeen were killed and as many more captured. Most of the prisoners, including the commander, were released by a body of Ottawas from L'Arbre Croche (Little Traverse), under Charles de Langlade, the half-breed officer already mentioned, being subsequently allowed to go to Montreal. After the fall of Forts Mackinaw and St. Joseph the British authority in Michigan was confined to the walls of the fort at Detroit. The Indians did not succeed, however, in reducing that post, as the English had free communica tion with the East by means of a couple of small schooners, which the Indians were unable to capture. natural influence of a commanding mind; their temporary adhesion to him being entirely voluntary. Pontiae had long been the friend of the French, and he, as well as all the Indians of the Northwest who had come in contact with the English after the conquest of Canada, had been much exasperated by the rudeness and arrogance of the latter. He laid a plan for capturing all their forts in the West, including Fort Niagara and Fort Pitt (for merly Fort Duquesne), and in the autumn of 1762 sent emissaries to all the tribes of the Northwest asking their assistance. All assented. Each post had its destined cap tors assigned to it. The Chippewas were intrusted with the destruction of Mackinaw, the Pottawattamies of the St. Joseph promised to massacre the garrison of the little fort at the mouth of that river, while Pontiae himself, with his Ottawas, the Hurons, and a part of the Pottawattamies, undertook the capture of Detroit. That post was defended by a hundred and twenty sol diers, under Maj. Gladwyn, of the British army, and also contained forty or fifty employees and fur-traders, who might aid in its defense. On the 7th of May, 1763, Pon tiae with a large number of his chiefs obtained admission under pretense of holding a council, his intention being to massacre the unprepared officers while assembled at the council, and then, after letting in the eager horde outside, to destroy the leaderless garrison. But Gladwyn had in some way been notified of the plan (tradition says by a Chippewa damsel who lived among the Pottawattamies and had become the mistress of the British commander), and when Pontiae entered at the head of his chiefs he found the whole garrison under arms. The baffled conspirators withdrew and spent two or three more days in attempts to circumvent the English, but in vain. On the 29th of July, Capt. Dalzell, of the British army, and Maj. Rogers, the renowned partisan, brought two hun dred and eighty soldiers, with a large quantity of ammu nition and provisions, to the relief of the garrison. But this aid was almost neutralized by the imprudence of Dal zell, who, at two o'clock in the morning of the 1st of Au gust, led out his command to attack Pontiae in his camp, \u2014 an enterprise to which Gladwyn had reluctantly and most foolishly given his consent. The chieftain had heard of the threatened onslaught through some of the French Cana dians who resided in the vicinity, and, instead of waiting to be attacked in his camp, he stationed his warriors on the north side of Parent's Creek (since called Bloody Run), about a mile and a half above the fort, and assailed the approaching column with a tremendous fire, made more ter rible by the darkness of the night. Half of the advance guard was killed or wounded at the first fire, and after several fruitless charges on the elusive foe Capt. Dalzell was compelled to retreat. On the night of the 9th of May the conspirators were reinforced by a band of Chippewas, and the next morning they assaulted the fort with great energy, keeping up a furious fire for half a day, which was steadily returned by the garrison. But, though they numbered ten times as many as their opponents, the Indians dared not charge the walls, and finally suspended the attack. The assailants in front were Ottawas and Chippewas ; the Pottawattamies and Wyandots having made a treaty of peace with Gladwyn a short time before. But when Dal zell retreated, the treacherous warriors of those tribes fiercely assaulted the flank of his column. Dalzell was killed, and it was only by the most desperate exertions that his successor, Capt. Grant, with* the aid of Maj. Rogers and his American rangers, was able to make good his retreat to the fort, after a fourth of his men were killed and wounded. Pontiae then attempted to starve out the garrison by a siege, and actually maintained one throughout the whole summer and a part of the autumn, \u2014 a remarkable manifes tation of steadiness for Indians to make, which shows the extraordinary influence established by Pontiae over those brave but unstable warriors. In the mean time all the other British posts doomed by Pontiae, except Forts Pitt and Niagara, were captured by the Indians, and their garrisons wholly or partially massa cred. On hearing of this victory, new bands of warriors from St. Joseph, Mackinaw, and the intervening country has tened to the aid of their brethren, but still the Ottawa chieftain was unable to capture the fort. When autumn came the warriors were obliged to seek their hunting grounds to obtain food for the coming season. The Potta wattamies, Wyandots, and Chippewas made treaties of peace (which they doubtless intended to keep or break, as suited their convenience), and then scattered in pursuit of deer and moose. Pontiae and his Ottawas continued the unavailing contest, firing on every Englishman who showed Fort St. Joseph was garrisoned by an ensign and four teen soldiers. On the 25th of May a number of Potta wattamies, apparently friendly, strolled into the fort. They were speedily followed by others; their savage war-cry was raised, the sentinel was tomahawked, and in less than two minutes all of the garrison was butchered except the ensign and three soldiers, who were seized and bound hand and foot. These were afterwards exchanged for Pottawattamie prisoners in the possession of Maj. Gladwyn at Detroit. The post at Mackinaw was the scene of a still more ter-"], [31, "OTTAWAS AND POTTAWATTAMIES FROM 1707 TO 1815. 23 himself outside the fort, until the last of October, when a messenger came from the commandant of Fort Chartres, the principal French post on the upper Mississippi, warn ing the chieftain that the French and English were at peace, and that he could expect no help from the for mer. Pontiae had paid no attention to previous notifi cations of peace, but he now sent word to Maj. Gladwyn that he should advise all the Indians to bury the hatchet, and himself soon withdrew from the vicinity. fight against Clarke. They went up Lake Michigan in canoes to the mouth of the St. Joseph, where their leaders learned that Hamilton himself had surrendered to Clarke, and the expedition was consequently abandoned. In the summer of 1780 the British Col. Byrd led a force of some six hundred Michigan Indians into Kentucky, capturing quite a number of stockades and many prisoners. Occa sional bands also made murderous raids against the frontiers of Virginia and Pennsylvania, but it is not necessary to describe them here. The next summer, 1764, Gen. Bradstreet came to De troit with a considerable force of English, Americans, and Iroquois, the appearance of whom doubtless tended to im press the power of England on the Ottawa and Pottawat tamie mind. Bradstreet sent troops to reestablish the posts at Mackinaw and Green Bay, and then returned east. The one at the mouth of the St. Joseph does not seem to have been reoccupied. At the close of the Revolution the treaty of peace gave Michigan to the United States, but England continued to hold Detroit and the other posts of the Northwest, and all the Indians of this section were still under its influence. In 1789 the Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and other tribes were represented by their principal chiefs in a great coun cil held by Gen. St. Clair, Governor of the Northwestern Territory, on the Muskingum River, in the present State of Ohio, where they made a treaty of peace with the United States. None the less they still hated the Americans, who were moving westward in a resistless column of emigration, and were encouraged in this seeling by the British officials. And when, a little later, two American armies, under Gens. Harmar and St. Clair, were successively defeated by the tribes of Ohio, those of Michigan were eager to take part in the fray. In August, 1765, George Croghan, deputy superintendent of Indian affairs under the celebrated Sir William Johnson, held a grand council at Detroit with the Ottawas, Cliip pewas, and Pottawattamies. They had by that time become thoroughly humbled, and were sincerely desirous of peace and the reopening of the fur-trade. After the treaty then made, all these tribes remained steady friends of the British so long as that nation had any need of their ser vices. Pontiae himself gave in his submission at another council held the same month. This celebrated chieftain was mur dered by an Illinois Indian near St. Louis in 1769. The Ottawas and other tribes which had followed his lead sprang to arms to avenge the murder, and almost extermi nated the Illinois. Accordingly, when Gen. Wayne led his army into Western Ohio in 1794, aud the Shawnees and Miamis gathered on the Maumee so oppose him, they were soon joined by numerous bands of Ottawas and Pottawattamies, equipped with guns and ammunition obtained at the British post at Detroit. But \" Mad Anthony\" was a different kind of general from those who had previously commanded in the West, and when the hostile forces of red men and white men met a few miles south of the rapids of the Maumee, the former, after a hot contest, were completely routed, and fled with the utmost precipitation from the field. A trader who not long afterwards met a Miami warrior that had fled before the terrible onslaught of Wayne's soldiers said to him : Except this and similar conflicts with neighboring sav ages, the Ottawas and Pottawattamies remained at peace until the outbreak of the Revolution. The British then made strong efforts to obtain their assistance, and in the summer of 1777 several hundred Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and Chippeicas, with some Winnebagoes and others from west of Lake Michigan, all under Langlade and another French officer, joined the army of Gen. Burgoyne. They accom panied him in his invasion of New York, but accomplished little except to burn some houses and slaughter a few fami lies. The celebrated murder of Jane McCrea was attribu ted to a band of Pottawattamies. Burgoyne made some efforts to restrain their ferocity, which so disgusted them that nearly or quite all returned home before his surrender to Gates. They also complained that Burgoyne did not take good care of them, and that over a hundred of their number were needlessly sacrificed at Bennington. \" Why did you run away ?\" With gestures corresponding to his words, and endeavor ing to represent the effect of the cannon, he replied : \" Pop, pop, pop, \u2014 boo, woo, woo, \u2014 whish, whish, boo, woo, \u2014 kill twenty Indians one time, \u2014 no good, by dam I\" A young half-breed Pottawattamie, named Robinson, afterwards one of the principal war-chiefs of the tribe, who was present at the battle with Wayne, used iu later years to describe it very clearly. The chiefs had selected a swamp for the battle-ground. They formed their line, however, half a mile in front of it, on the summit of a gentle ele vation, covered with a very open growth of timber, with no underbrush, intending when Wayne attacked them to fall back slowly, thus inducing the Americans to follow them into the swamp, where the Indians would have every advantage, and where they expected a certain victory. But \" Mad Anthony\" soon broke up their plan. About half of his little army was composed of cavalry, whom he formed in front of his infantry. Aster a few volleys from his artillery, always very trying to the nerves of the red men, After this, although the Iroquois were kept employed in ravaging the American frontier, few or none of the Michi gan Indians were taken to the East. When the American general, George Rogers Clarke, took possession of Southern Indiana and Illinois, the Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and other tribes were called together by the British agents at L'Arbre Croche (Little Traverse Bay), in the winter of 1778-79. Many were opposed to taking any further part in the contest, but after much debate a large force of In dians set out from L'Arbre Croche early in the spring to reinforce the British commander, Governor Hamilton, and"], [32, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 24 tinued to be the most important personages in Western Mich igan. Those tribes still occupied the territory of Allegan a'nd Barry Counties as a common hunting-ground, and their war-parties still passed over it in their conflicts with the Shawnees and other tribes to the south or west. Many interesting legends regarding these contests are related by Judge Littlejohn in his work entitled \" Legends of Michi gan and the Old Northwest.\" \u00b0 In 1805 the Territory of Michigan was organized, and be tween that time and 1810 Gen. Hull, the first Governor of the Territory, made several treaties with the Ottawas and Pottawattamies, but none of much importance except the one made at Detroit on the 17th of November, 1807. By that agreement the chiefs of the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pottawattamie tribes ceded to the United States all their land in Michigan east of what is now known as the prin cipal meridian, and southward of a line drawn from the centre of Shiawassee County to White Rock, on Lake Huron. he ordered the cavalry to advance. The Indians had never seen men fight on horseback, and supposed they would dis mount before reaching the top of the ridge. But instead of that they began to trot, then drew their swords,\u2014 those terrible \" long knives,\" which always inspired the Indians with dread,\u2014 then broke into a gallop, and the next mo ment were charging at the top of their horses' speed, \" yell ing like hell,\" as Robinson expressed it, swinging their swords, and looking like demons of wrath to the astonished red men. \" Oh !\" said Robinson, \" you ought to have seen the poor Indians run then.\" They gave but one random fire, and fled as fast as possi ble towards the swamp. But it was too late. The cavalry burst through them like a whirlwind, and then wheeled about to cut off their retreat, while the infantry came up on the double-quick and barred their escape iu that direction. In 1810-11 the warriors of those tribes, as of all the Northwest, were aroused to renewed hostility by the arts of the celebrated Shawnee war-chief, Tecumseh, who was en deavoring to unite all the Indians from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Superior iu a league against the advancing Amer icans. In person or by eloquent messengers he visited all the tribes, reawaking their ancient hatred of the Yankees, and probably promising the assistance of their father, the king of Great Britain, a war between that potentate and the United States being constantly expected. \" Oh !\" the chieftain would continue, \" it was awful.\" Robinson admired his conqueror so much that he named one of his sons \" Anthony Wayne,\" and always expressed the most profound respect for that dashing soldier.* The chiefs were much impressed both by Wayne's vigor and by the strength of the United States, and when that general summoned them to council in 1795, at Greenville, Ohio, they all promptly responded. There a treaty was made by which the Shawnees and others ceded a large part of their land in Ohio to the government, but the Michigan Indians only agreed to keep the peace towards the United States, remaining in undisturbed possession of their old hunting-grounds. On the 7th of November, 1811, Tecumseh's brother, \" The Prophet,\" at the head of a large force of Indians of various tribes, including about three hundred Pottawatta mies aud a considerable number of Ottawas, attacked the army of Gen. Harrison on the celebrated field of Tippe canoe. . After a hotly-contested battle of two or three hours, the Indians gave way at all points. Harrison destroyed the villages of the Shawnees, which were not far from the battle-field, but the more fortunate Pottawattamies and Ot tawas fled to their homes iu the forests of Michigan, whither the Americans were in no situation to follow them. It is evident from the treaty that the Ottawas and Pot tawattamies rauked among the more important tribes, for, though they conveyed no land, each tribe received a thou sand dollars in gratuities, as did also the Delawares, Mi amis, Shawnees, and Chippewas, while the Kickapoos and other tribes received only five hundred dollars each. When the time came for signing the treaty, it was twice read over to the chiefs, and every section was carefully explained to them by Gen. Wayne through an interpreter. Then he said : \" You, Chippewas, do you approve of these arti cles of treaty, and are you prepared to sign them ?\" A unanimous \" Yes\" was the response. In June, 1812, war was declared by the United States against Great Britain. At first there seems to have been some doubt what part the tribes under consideration in this chapter would take, for the British and Americans both sent agents to the Pottawattamies to influence their action. The British agent, Jean Chandonais, attempted to capture his half-breed nephew, Jean Baptiste Chandonais, who was one of the American agents, but was instantly killed by the latter. \" And you, Ottawas, do you approve of these articles of treaty, and are you prepared to sign them ?\" Again a unanimous affirmative. \" Aud you, Pottawattamies, do you approve of these articles of treaty, and are you prepared to sign them ?\" \" Yes, yes, good !\" said or grunted the dark warriors of Southern Michigan. Similar responses were obtained from the other tribes ; then the white officials signed the treaty, the chieftains made their marks, and the negotiation was concluded. Is the Ottawas and Pottawattamies had any doubts as to their course, they were dispelled by the messengers of Tecumseh, who speedily summoned the warriors to take up the tomahawk in behalf of the British. Many of the braves promptly responded to the call, and on the 5th of August they participated with Tecumseh and his Shawnees in the defeat of Maj. Van Horn's command, on Brownstown Creek, in the northern part of the present county of Mon roe. The same warriors, with a body of British soldiers, also attacked Col. Miller at Maguagua, twelve miles below Detroit, a few days later, but were defeated and compelled to flee to Canada. In 1796 the British surrendered Detroit and the other posts in the West to the United States, and then, and not till then, did that government obtain any real power over Michigan. Even then the Ottawa and Pottawattamie chiefs con- * AVisconsin Historical Collections, vol. vii. p. 329."], [33, "25 OTTAWAS AND POTTAWATTAMIES FROM 1707 TO 1815. On the 15th of August a large force of Pottawattamies attacked the garrison of Fort Dearborn (on the site of Chicago) a short distance from that post, as it was endeavor ing to retreat to Fort Wayne, Ind., killing two-thirds of the soldiers and a large number of the women and children accompanying them, and capturing the remainder. Topen abee, the head-chief of the Pottawattamies, Robinson, already mentioned, and two or three other chiefs, were friendly to the Americans, sent them information of the attack, and saved several intended victims from being mur dered. Robinson took Captain Heald, the commander of the troops, and his wife, both wounded, in a bark canoe along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan to Mackinaw, and delivered them to the British commander there. On the other hand, Pokagon, long known as the second chief of the Pottawattamies, was said to have received that name (which meant \" rib\"), in lieu of the one he had formerly borne, on account of his having slain a pregnant woman at the Chicago massacre, and then cut under her rib and taken out the child. In July the British and Indians again attacked Fort Meigs, but without success. On the 31st of July, Gen. Proctor appeared before Fort Stephenson, at Lower Sandusky, with a thousand British and fifteen hundred Indians, of whom, as before, about half were Ottawas and Pottawattamies. These surrounded the fort and fired at every soldier, while on the 2d of August a column of British attempted to carry it by storm. The assailants were repulsed, however, with heavy loss, by the garrison of a hundred and sixty Americans under Maj. Croghan, and Proctor soon retired in disgust. After the defeat of the British fleet on Lake Erie by Commodore Perry, Gen. Harrison at once advanced into Canada. On the 29th of September he took possession of Detroit, and Michigan once more \u2014 let us trust forever \u2014 passed under American sway. On the 5th of October, 1813, he came up with the enemy at the Moravian towns on the river Thames, where Proctor with his British and Canadians, and Tecumseh with his Shawnees, Ottawas, and Pottawattamies, had determined to make a final stand. The Americans gallantly charged the hostile lines. Proc tor fled almost at the first fire, Tecumseh was slain while fighting desperately at the head of his braves, and the whole combined force of British and Indians was either killed, captured, or sent flying in utter rout before the victors. The cowardly surrender of Detroit by Gen. Hull on the 16th of August, 1812, preceded as it had been by the capture of Mackinaw and dther posts by the British, carried with it the control of the whole of Michigan, which for the next year became practically British territory. The Indians, of course, became still more favorable to the Eng lish after this manifestation of their power, and still more warriors flocked to the British standard. This battle extinguished the hopes of victory enter tained by the Indians of the Northwest. The Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and several other tribes at once sent dele gations to offer peace, and on the 16th of October Gen. Harrison granted an armistice. The warriors returned to their respective villages and took no further part in the war, which closed a little more than a year afterwards. The government inflicted no punishment on them for their conduct, and by a treaty concluded at Springwclls, near Detroit, on the 8th of September, 1815, it was agreed as follows : The next battle in which the Ottawas and Pottawattamies were engaged was the celebrated conflict on the river Raisin, in which, in conjunction with the British troops under Gen. Proctor, they defeated and captured the Ameri can Gon. Winchester with his whole force. The sick and wounded Americans were abandoned to the tender mercies of the Indians, who butchered nearly all of them. The Ottawas and Pottawattamies were also largely rep resented in the force which Gen. Proctor led against Fort Meigs, at the rapids of the Maumee, on the 28th of April, 1813, full half of the thousand Indians under Tecumseh belonging to those tribes. Gen. Harrison, who was in command of the Americans, succeeded in repelling his assailants, but during the siege, which lasted till the 9th of May, Col. Dudley, with eight hundred Kentuckians, was lured too far in pursuit of the enemy aster a temporary success, fell into an ambuscade devised by Tecumseh, and was slain, nearly all his command being killed or captured.* \"The United States give peace to the Chippeica, Ottau-a, and Pot tawattamie tribes. They also agree to restore to the said Chippewo, Ottawa, and Pottawattamie tribes all the possessions, rights, and privileges which they enjoyed or were entitled to in the year 1811, prior to the commencement of the late war with Great Britain, and the said tribes upon their part agree to place themselves under the protection of the United States, and of no other power whatsoever.\" Nevertheless, the war of 1812 dosed the career and de stroyed the power of the great league, consisting of the three tribes just named, which had for more than a century exercised an important influence over the destinies of the Northwest. Thenceforth they are to be considered as fee ble, disorganized, and practically subjugated tribes, and, though we shall have considerable to say regarding the un fortunate remnants of the Ottawas and Pottawattamies in the succeeding chapters, no separate record of their acts will be convenient or necessary. * The Rev. Isaac McCoy, long a missionary among the Pottawat tamies, charges the Michigan Indians with cannibalism as well as massacre. In a book descriptive of his mission and the Indians, he says : \" From well-attested facts we are compelled to believe that the Pottawattamies, Ottawas, Chippewas, and Miamis have all been guilty of cannibalism. ... If the accounts of the Indians can be credited, the last war with England, in which Indians were mercenaries on both Bides, was disgraced by cannibalism, the last instance of which we have been informed having occurred near Fort Meigs, on the Maumee River, in 1813.\" 4"], [34, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 26 changes will be noted in the order of time, on the occasions of their occurrence. CHAPTER VII. Gen. Cass was superintendent of Indian affairs in the Northwest as well as Governor of Michigan, and imme diately after the close of the war he turned his attention to the extinguishing of the Indian title, so that the Territory might be open to settlement by the whites. In September, 1817, he and Gen. Duncan McArthur held a council with the chiefs of the Wyandots, Ottawas, Chippewas, Potta wattamies, and other tribes, at the Maumee Rapids, when they ceded to the United States all their lands in Ohio, and a small tract in the southeastern part of Michigan.

The Wyandots seem to have had the principal interest in the lands then ceded, as the treaty provided that they should receive four thousand dollars annually forever ; the Pottawattamies being granted thirteen hundred dollars a year for fifteen years, and the Ottawa and Chippewa na tions a thousand dollars each, annually, for fifteen years, while the other tribes received still smaller annuities. Desiring to confine the attention of the reader in the preceding chapter to the fortunes of those ancient lords of the soil of Allegan and Barry, the Ottawas and Potta wattamies, we passed with little or no mention over sev eral political changes which nominally, but in fact not very seriously, affected those counties. In 1774, by what was known as the \" Quebec Act,\" the British Parliament made Michigan a part of the province of Quebec, but, in fact, it did not receive any civil government. Small tracts around the military posts were subject to the commandants, while the remainder was under the rule of our friends, the Chippewas, Ottawas, and Pottawattamies. This treaty was signed by thirty-two Pottawattamies, while all the other tribes were represented by a less num ber than that one. The Pottawattamies usually had very large delegations at the councils at which their interests were decided, and, judging from this fact, we should sup pose them to have been the most democratic people in the whole Northwest. In September, 1819, a treaty was concluded at Saginaw with the Chippewa Indians, by which they ceded to the United States the whole of Northeastern Michigan, bounded as follows : Beginning at a point in the then Indian bound ary (the principal meridian) six miles south from the base line ; running thence west sixty miles ; thence northeasterly in a direct line to the head of Thunder Bay River ; down that river to its junction with Lake Huron and northeast to the Canada line ; thence southward along that line to the line prescribed by the treaty of 1807, and along that line to the place of beginning. Four years later the captain-general of Canada divided that province into four districts, the peninsula of Michigan being one of them, with the name of \" Hesse,\" given in honor of the Hessian troops then serving King George III. in America. But the fortunes of war decided that the people of Michigan should not be \" Hessians.\" By the treaty of peace at the close of the Revolution, as before stated, Michigan became part of the United States, but the British still held the military posts, thus retaining their influence over the Indians and the control of tho peninsula. In 1787 Congress declared Michigan to be a part of the \" Northwest Territory,\" which was then organized, but the possession of the forts by the British prevented the act from being carried into effect north of the Maumee. A distance of sixty miles from the principal meridian reaches to the east boundary of Kalamazoo County ; a line from a point in that boundary six miles south of the base line, running northeastwardly to the head of Thunder Bay River, would cut off about one-third of the county of Barry, which seems to have then been ceded to the United States by the Chippewas. Yet in the following paragraphs it will be seen that two years later the whole territory south of Grand River, including all of Barry and Allegan Coun ties, was ceded by the Ottawas, Pottawattamies, and Chip pewas. All the authorities show that the Ottawas and Pottawattamies occupied the land south of Grand River, and that the Chippewas did not. Doubtless the last named tribe made large claims, and it was thought best, in 1819, to buy all they claimed ; after that the rights of the true owners, covering a part of the same ground, were purchased. Immediately after the surrender of the posts to the Americans in 1796, Gen. St. Clair, Governor of the North west Territory, organized the county of Wayne, extending from the Cuyahoga River in Ohio to Detroit, and thence indefinitely into the woods of Michigan. In 1800 the western part of Michigan became a part of Indiana, that Territory being formed from the Northwest Territory in the year named, and its present eastern bound ary being continued north to the Straits of Mackinaw. When the State of Ohio was formed, in 1802, the eastern part of Michigan was also annexed to Indiana. In 1805 the Territory of Michigan was organized, and the soil of Allegan and Barry Counties has ever since been a part of that Territory, or of the State into which it de veloped. No counties were organized in the Territory until aster the war of 1812. In 1815, Gen. Cass, the first Governor after the war, reorganized Wayne County. But of all the treaties concluded by Gen. Cass the most important was the one which conveyed the soil of Allcan and Barry Counties from red to white owners. It was concluded at Chicago on the 29th day of August, 1821 and has ever since been known as the treaty of Chicago. This closes our retrospective view, and the subsequent Hon. Solomon Sibley was associated with Gen. Cass as"], [35, "EVENTS FROM 1815 TO 1830. 27 a commissioner on the part of the United States, while the treaty was signed by two chiefs of the Chippewas, eight of the Ottawas, and fifty-five of the Pottawattamies. In fact, however, a large proportion of the two last-named tribes, \u2014 men, women, and children, \u2014 were gathered at the council, the number being estimated by a spectator at from five to six thousand. Although the names of two Chippewa chiefs were sigued to the treaty, yet but few of that tribe were present, and nothing was paid to them, as they had already sold whatever claims they might have had to the lands in question. The tract ceded by the treaty of 1821, is thus described in it : peesausee, Kayneewee, Moaputte, and Matcheepeenashee wish.* On the part of the Pottawattamies, the treaty bore the signatures, or rather the crosses, of Topenabee, Meteay, Chebonsee, Loinson, Weesaw, Keepotaw, Schayauk, Kee bee, Schomang, Wawemickemack, Nayouchemon, Kongee, Sheeshawgau, Ayscham, Meeksaymauk, Meytenway, Shaw wenuemetary, Francois, Mauksee, Waymego, Mandauming, Quayquee, Aapenhawbee, Matchaweeyaas, Matchapoggish, Mongan, Puggagans, Sescobenuish, Cheegwackgwago, Waw sebban, Peecheco, Quonquoitaw, Rannish, Wynemaig, On muckemeck, Kawaysin, Ameckose, Oseemeet, Shawkoto, Noshaweequat, Meegunn, Macshekeetenmore, Keenotoge, Wabawnesheu, Shawwawnaysee, Atchweemuckquee, Pish sheebaugay, Wawbassay, Meggeessesee, Saygawkoomick, Shawwayno, Sheeshawgun, Totomee, Ashkuwee, Shayauk kcebee, Awbetonee. \"All the land comprehended in the following boundaries : Beginning at a point on the south bank of the river St. Joseph of Lake Michi gan, near the Pure aux Vaches [a few miles south of Niles, Berrien Co.], due north from Rum's Village, and running thence south to a line drawn due from the southern extremity of Lake Michigan ; thence with the said lino east to the tract ceded by the Pottawattamies to the United States by the treaty of Fort Meigs, in 1817, if the said line should strike the said tract ; but if the said line should pass north of the said tract [as was actually the case], then such line shall be con tinued until it strikes the western boundary of the tract ceded to the United States by the treaty of Detroit, in 1807 [the principal meri dian], and from the termination of the said line, following the bound aries of former cessions, to the main branch of the Grand River, of Lake Michigan, should any of the said lines cross the said river; but if none of the said lines should cross the said river, then to a point due east of the source of the said main branch of the said river, and from such point due west to the source of said principal branch, and from the crossing of said river, or from the source thereof, as the case may be, down the said river, on the north bank thereof, to the mouth ; thence following the shore of Lake Michigan to the south bank of the said river St. Joseph, at the mouth thereof; and thence with the said south bank to the place of beginning.\" Certainly, a title sanctioned by such a list of names ought never to be disputed. A curious incident in connection with this council is nar rated in Smith's \" Life of Cass,\" derived from the general himself. While the latter was watching some peculiar cer emonies of the Indians, in the early part of the proceed ings, he observed a Chippewa looking very grave, and keeping apart from his fellows. Governor Cass inquired the reason, and learned that the man, in a fit of passion, had killed a Pottaicattamie in the early part of the same season. The Pottawattamies had demanded the surrender of the murderer, and as the Chippewas, and in fact the homicide himself, admitted the justice of the claim, it was expected that the clansmen of the slain man would inflict the penalty of death. As the principal meridian crosses Grand River in Ing ham County, that river comprised the whole northern boundary of the tract in question. Five reservations were excepted from the cession, \u2014 two in what is now Kalamazoo County, one in St. Joseph County, one in Branch County, and one at \" Maugachqua, on the river Peble.\" These were all designed for the Pottawattamies and the Ottawas mingled with them, as the main body of the Ottawas, who occupied the north part of the ceded tract, still retained an ample territory north of Grand River. There were also several small individual reservations near the St. Joseph River for the benefit of favored Potlawaitamies. But the murderer was owing some traders for goods re ceived of them, and he was anxious to pay them before he died. He accordingly solicited and obtained the postpone ment of his execution until he could, by hunting, procure the means of satisfying his creditors. He had hunted suc cessfully through the season, had obtained furs enough to pay his debts, and had come to the council prepared to suffer death at the hands of the friends of his victim. The Governor was touched by the stolid honesty of the doomed man, and by liberal presents to his intended executioners persuaded them to let him go free. In consideration of the cession the United States agreed to pay the Ottawas a thousand dollars a year forever, be sides fifteen hundred dollars a year for fifteen years to sup port a blacksmith, teacher, and farmer. To the Pottawat tamies the government agreed to pay five thousand dollars annually for twenty years, besides a thousand dollars a year to support a blacksmith and teacher. * The last signer for the Ottawas, Matcheepeenashewish, was the chief of the band at Kalamazoo, and the reservation there was named aficr him. Yet that reservation, like all the others in Michigan south of the Grand River, is generally said to have been occupied by Potta wattamies. Doubtless they formed a decided majority, but there were some Ottawas mingled with the Pottawattamie bands, as has been fre quently observed, and it was no uncommon thing for a member of one tribe to become a chief in another, even where the relations of the two tribes were much less close than those of the Ottawas and Potta wattamies. The chieftain and the region in which he flourished are thus mentioned in a quaint old song of the pioneer days, reprinted in the Centennial Record of Michigan. After glorifying various Michi gan localities, the poet says : Such was the treaty which gave the ownership of the land of Allegan and Barry Counties to the United States, and which, in a certain sense, constitutes the basis of all the land-titles in those counties. It being of so much im portance, we append a list of the chiefs and warriors who signed it, which is long and grim enough to give title to a continent. \"But of all the d;irndest countries Benenth the shining sun, Old Kalamazoo can take the rag When all the n'St are done.

Mr. McCoy thus describes one which he attended in 1825: Very likely a good supply of whisky was the principal consideration which induced them to forego their revenge, for that has ever been the most potent agent to reach the Indian's heart. It is related that even Topenabee, the principal chief of the Pottawattamies, the octogenarian warrior who had signed the treaty with Gen. Wayne in 1795, and had vainly endeavored to save the doomed gar rison of Chicago in 1812, was more anxious about obtain ing a supply of whisky than anything else. When Gen. Cass urged him to keep sober, so as to make a good bargain for himself and his people, he replied, \" Father, we do not care for the land, nor the money, nor the goods. What we want is whisky; give us whisky.\" \" Different festivals, have appropriate names. The seasons for some occur regularly, but most of them are occasional, as circumstances are supposed to suggest or require them. That which occurred at this time was one at which singular feats of legerdemain\u2014 such as taking meat out of a boiling pot with their naked hand, drinking boiling-hot broth, eating fire, etc.\u2014 are attempted. Some ignorant whites, who have mingled with the Indians, have reported that the latter were very dextrous in these feats ; but we have never seen anything of the kind attempted among them that was not very clumsily performed. \" On the present occasion a little tobacco was placed in the centre of the hall, on the bottom of a new moccasin, with a small bundle of cedar sticks resembling candle matches [pine splinters]. Three large kettles of meat, previously boiled, were hanging over a small fire, near the centre of the house. The aged chief, Topenabee, led in the ceremonies. He delivered a speech of considerable length without rising from his seat, with a grave countenance, and his eyes almost closed. He then sat and drummed with one stick, and sung at the same time, while his aid at his side rattled a gourd. At length four women appeared before him and danced. Awhile after this he arose, delivered another speech, then, drumming and dancing, turned round, and, moving slowly around the dancing-hall, was followed by all the dancing-party. AVhen he had performed his part in leading, others went through the same ceremony, and these were repeated until every pair had twice led in the dance. The old chief was a sad drunkard himself; still, it is possible that he spoke sarcastically, in view of the manifest anxiety of the Indians for their deadliest bane. The next year Rev. Isaac McCoy established what was known as the Carey Mission, on the site of Niles, Berrien Co. In his published journal he depicts the Potta wattamies as rapidly falling victims to their own love of liquor, and as becoming demoralized to the last degree, so much so that in 1832 the missionaries abandoned their self imposed task in utter hopelessness. The Ottawas drew back into their northern wilds, and were less affected by the presence of the whisky-sellers, although even they suf fered severely from them. \"These exercises were accompanied with many uncouth gestures and strange noises. Three large kettles of meat, previously boiled, were hanging over a small fire near the centre of the house, and occasionally a man would 6toop to the kettle and drink a little soup. One fellow, assuming a frantic air, attended with whooping, lifted out of a kettle a deer's head, and, holding it by the two horns with the nose from him, presented it first upwards and afterwards towards many of the bystanders as he danced round, hallooing. The drop pings of the broth were rather an improvement than an injury to the floor, it being of earth and now becoming pretty dusty. Other statements in Mr. McCoy's book show that the Indians retained their old superstitions in addition to the acquired vices of the white man. He relates an instance of this in the story told by themselves regarding the man ner in which they obtained food on a certain occasion. According to their account, four or five hundred of them were collected on the St. Joseph in the autumn of 1826, and set out to attend a council on the Wabash, under the leader ship of Chebass, a prominent chief. They depended on game for their food ; but during the first three days their best hunters, though sometimes as many as fifty were out in the woods at once, could not kill a deer. The people began to suffer from hunger. \"At the conclusion, which was after sun-setting, each brought his or her vessel and secured a portion of the food. Chebass, a chief, sent to me and invited me to eat with him, and I having consented he placed the bowl on the earth beside me, and said, 'Come, let us eat in friendship.' After eating, another speech was delivered, the music followed, all joined in the dance with increased hilarity, and most of them with their kettles of meat and broth in their hands, and, at length breaking off, each went to his home.\" For several years after the treaty of Chicago no settle ments were made west of the principal meridian, and the Ottawas and Pottawattamies still continued to roam at will over the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties. On the morning of the fourth day, the chief Saugana in formed them that during the night a ghostly visitant had come to him in a dream and had told him that the hun ters' ill success was due to the fact that Chebass had set out on the journey \" like a white man,\" without making a re ligious sacrifice. Therefore Chebass must fast that day, and just twelve men, with faces blackened to indicate hun ger and devotion, must go out hunting, just six on each side of the trail the company was following. By the mid dle of the forenoon Saugana said they would kill four deer, because in his dream he had seen four deer lying dead. Down to 1823 all of Michigan was embraced in the land district of Detroit. In that year the district of Monroe was established, which included not only the southern part of the State, but also all west of the principal meridian. In 1826 a few prospecting-parties went west over the celebrated \" Chicago road,\" through the southern tier of counties of the State, as far as Lake Michigan ; but there were still no settlers west of the meridian. In November of that year the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties was nominally brought under civil jurisdiction by an act of the Legislative Council, declaring that all the country pur chased at the treaty of Chicago should be attached to the county of Lenawee. In April, 1827, the same territory was constituted the township of St. Joseph. These directions were followed, and, according to the Indians' story, the four deer were killed within the appointed time, and were brought to the company. A halt was called, the deer were boiled, and all went to eating except poor Chebass, who was condemned to fast till sunset, on account of his beginning the journey as irreligiously as a white man. During the rest of the expedition plenty of game was killed, aud all fared sumptuously. In the spring of that year (1827) settlement began in Hillsdale County, pushing thence westward and northwest ward with great rapidity. In November, 1828, it reached Prairie Ronde, Kalamazoo Co., and in June, 1829, the first settler made his appearance on the site of Kalamazoo village. The so-called religious ceremonies of the Indians would hardly be described as such by the whites of the present 'o'"], [37, "EVENTS FROM 1815 TO 1S30. 29 Meanwhile, the United States surveyors had made their way westward a little in advance of the settlers. Accord ing to the simple system of surveys adopted by the United States, the western boundary of the lands bought from the Indians by the treaty of 1807 (which ran through the centre of the present county of Ingham, nine miles east of Lansiug) was adopted as the principal meridian from which ranges of townships should be numbered east and west, while the parallel of forty-two degrees and twenty-five minutes was made the base-line, from which the townships themselves (each six miles square) should be numbered north and south. This was subsequently made the south boundary of Allegan and Barry Counties, their eastern boundaries being respectively the eastern lines of ranges 1 1 and 7 west. empties into the Kalamazoo, in the present township of Manlius, Allegan Co., was the post of Louis Campau, a noted French trader of Detroit. The American Fur Com pany had a post, as early as 1825, at what was then called Peach Orchard (from the fact that the Indians planted some peach-stones and raised peach-trees there before any settlement by the whites), but was afterwards known as McCormick's Landing, on the Kalamazoo, some four miles above the site of Saugatuck village. These were all of which we could learn which were established in Allegan and Barry Counties previous to 1830. f The houses used by the traders were of various sizes, being in some places mere huts, in others quite commo dious. They were built of logs, and were usually covered with black-ash bark. Here the traders sold ammunition, tobacco, steel traps, fish hooks, and a few hats, caps, boots, and shoes, besides beads, calicoes, and some other cloths, of those gay colors in which both Indians and squaws greatly delighted. They also sold a few shot-guns and rifles. In 1825, the outer boundaries of township 1 north, range 11 west (Gun Plain), were run out by John Mullett, one of the government surveyors. But it does not seem to have been the custom then to run the range and township lines for long distances, for it was not till the next year that Mr. Mullett ran the boundaries of township 2, range 11 (Martin), and Lucius Lyon those of townships 3 and 4 in the same range (Wayland and Leighton) and of township 4 in range 12 (Dorr). The boundaries of the other town ship were not run until 1830 or aster. None of the town ships were subdivided into sections until 1831. Immense numbers of brooches, ear-rings, and other arti cles of adornment were likewise disposed of. From the books of William Burnet, an early trader in Berrien County, we learn, that he sent by a single agent, who went to trade among the Indians in their camps, a thousand \" silver brooches\" of the largest size, and eleven hundred smaller ones. According to Mr. Barnes, the traders of Allegan and Barry were equally well supplied with such jewelry. It was called \" silver,\" but in fact was made of a cheap white metal, a brooch costing only about twenty cents. Barry County was established by law, with its present boundaries, on the 29th of October, 1829, and six days later it was attached to St. Joseph County, as were ranges 11 and 12, in the territory of Allegan, while the rest of that territory was for the time being assigned to Cass County.* But, above all other articles, whisky and other ardent spirits formed the most profitable, if not the most exten sive, portion of the trader's outfit. The sale of strong liquors to the Indians was strictly forbidden by law, but the profits were enormous, the braves were thirsty, and the traders were avaricious ; and we doubt whether there was a single one of them who did not sell all he could, \u2014 at least until the organization of courts in the respective counties. We have now reached the verge of permanent settlement by white people within the territory to which our history especially relates, and have to notice but one other class of facts previous to entering on that portion of our subject. Between the close of the war with Great Britain, in 1815, and the beginning of settlement in Allegan and Barry Counties, in 1830, numerous posts were established for the purpose of trading with the Indians throughout Central and Western Michigan. Some were built by individual traders and some on behalf of the American Fur Company, of which John Jacob Astor was the head. The first in this region was at Kalamazoo, and this was followed by others at various points in Allegan and Barry Counties. The old traders are all dead or scattered far away, and the exact date of the establishment of the various posts cannot be ascertained. Even in regard to that at Kalamazoo, as to which special inquiries were made a number of years ago, there was a serious discrepancy, one early trader (the late Rix Robinson, of Kent County) fixing the date of its es tablishment in 1823, and another (G. S. Hubbard, of Chi cago) stating it to have been before 1820. The traders were mostly, though not all, French or French half-breeds, and with the usual Gallic adroitness gained great influence over their savage customers. Their articles for trade were either brought across the peninsula f Our principal information in regard to the early posts and also in regard to many of the other facts mentioned in this chapter is derived from Mr. Lucius A. Barnes, of Wayland, Allegan Co., who is better informed on that subject than anyone else now living in either of the two counties. He acted as clerk for Campau at his post, at the mouth of Rabbit River, for over a year, in 1S31 and 1S32, and states that it had then been there several years, \u2014 how many he does not know. The post of the American Fur Company, farther down the Kalamazoo, was equally as old, or older. The logs of which it was composed and the stumps from which they were cut showed many marks of age. At a later date, as we are informed by others, a post was established by Campau at the foot of the '* Bouchon Stretch,\" on the Kalamazoo, in the present township of Pine Plains, Allegan Co., and there was another at a place called *' AVolf Skin,\" on the Kalamazoo, in tho eastern part of the present township of Manlius, in the same county. Campau also established one on Green Lake, in what is now Leighton, Allegan Co., and one near the southeast corner of Thornapple, Barry Co. The next year after Mr. Barnes' service with Campau he worked lor Rix Robinson, a celebrated trader of that day, at the junction of Thornapple and Grand Rivers, in Kent County. This also appeared quite old. AV. G. Butler's post, on the site of Saugatuck village, was established in 1S30, but this, though his first business was with the Indians, was intended as the beginning of a permanent settlement. Subsequently a Frenchman named Bouchon had a trad ing-post in the cast edge of the present township of Allegan, on the south side of the Kalamazoo River, at the head of what was known as the '* Buuchon Stretch,\" a long piece of nearly level water. At the point where Rabbit River * See Chapter XII."], [38, "30 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. which the traders affixed their own prices. Cheap calico sold at twenty-five cents a yard, and a better quality at fifty cents. Good mink-skins were estimated at fifty cents each, raccoon-skins at the same price, and muskrat-skins at twenty-five cents. There were also a few fisher-skins, \u2014 the fisher being an amphibious animal somewhat larger than a cat, \u2014 which rated at a dollar each. from Detroit on pack-horses, or, as was much more com monly the case, were transported from Detroit, Mackinaw, or even from Montreal, on large open boats, known as Montreal barges, which would carry about eight tons each in smooth water. When these boats came all the way from Montreal, they passed from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron through the streams and lakes of Upper Canada, several portages being made on the way. A quite common way was for the American Fur Company, or large traders like Campau, to bring the goods to Mackinaw in sail-vessels, which were unloaded there. They were then furnished to small traders at a stipulated price, who sold them out among the Indians and paid for them with furs, skins, etc., at a price also agreed upon with wholesale dealers. Bouchon and others were furnished in this manner by Campau, and other traders were supplied by the American Fur Company. From Mackinaw the goods were brought in barges up Lake Besides these, which were called by the general name of \"furs,\" there were those which were known in distinction aa \"skins,\" viz., \u2014 deer-skins and quite a number of bear skins. After the treaty of Chicago, the Ottawas and Potta wattamies received a yearly payment from the government. Nearly the whole of the money thus received went into the hands of the traders. If an Indian had neither money nor furs to offer, and wanted to purchase on credit, it was gen erally given him, unless he was known to be dishonest. On the average, they paid quite as promptly as white men do at the present day. The traders always attended the pay ments by the United States agent, and generally received the money due them from the Indians. If he did not, or if there was a dispute about the amount, the trader would sometimes at least take the law into his own hands, and seize the money.* Michigan, and then up the principal rivers to the various trading-posts. The navigation of the lake was attended with much danger, and that of the river with scarcely less. G. S. Hubbard, an early trader at Kalamazoo, in a letter read before the State Pioneer Society in 1875, says : \" In the fall [of 1820] I had left buried in the sand at the mouth of Kalamazoo River some heavy articles, because of the rapids, my boat being heavily loaded. In March I took a perogue, a large wood canoe, and with one of my men went for them. AVe camped at the foot of the rapids [where Allegan village now stands] in a snow-storm. In the morning, still snowing, we with great effort poled up the rapids; had reached the upper end \u2014 I, in the bow, poling, my man seated, with paddle. A tree had fallen into the river; pushing out to round it, current still strong, the bow striking the current, my man careless, the canoe would have upset had I not jumped into the river. Telling my man to follow me down the rapids, I swam and reached our camp ing-ground safely, though much exhausted; got dried and started up again; reaching home the next day.\" Such was the state of affairs in Allegan and Barry Counties in 1829. The scenes of the next ten years must be reserved for another chapter. CHAPTER VIII. EARLY SETTLEMENTS. There were two or three sail-vessels which used to run on Lake Michigan to Chicago and St. Joseph, and the tra ders at the head of the lake were largely supplied by them, but they rarely or never stopped at the mouth of Grand or Kalamazoo River, or elsewhere in this locality, until after the settlement of the country by the whites.

The latter com modity was not much sought for by traders, as it could not be exchanged for goods in the Eastern markets ; yet, to please their tawny customers, they did receive large quanti ties of it, which they shipped East and sold as best they could. All the larger traders kept runners among the Indian camps all winter. These were usually French or half-breeds, who carried their goods on their backs, and brought back in the same way the furs they received. The first settler in the territory comprising the counties of Allegan and Barry was William G.Butler, of Hart ford, Conn., who, with his wife and two children, located on the site of the village of Saugatuck, three miles up from the mouth of the Kalamazoo River, in the spring of 1830. True, his first business was trading with the Indians, and we have not generally classed Indian traders as settlers, be cause they had no intention of becoming permanent resi dents at their respective posts ; but Mr. Butler did come There had once been beaver-dams and beavers in this sec tion, and there may have been a few of these animals here between 1815 and 1830, but they were all hunted out before the arrival of the white settlers. The greater part of the furs sold to the traders were those of the marten, mink, muskrat, and raccoon. The three first named were am phibious animals, spending much of their time in the water. The most valuable were the marten-skins, \"for which the traders usually allowed the Indians a dollar apiece, or what they called a dollar, all furs being paid for in goods, to * Mr. Barnes informs us that he saw Campau's men take away money from a chief who disputed the trader's account at a payment at Grand Rapids."], [39, "EARLY SETTLEMENTS 31 with that intention, and selected land for that purpose.* He came by the way of the lakes, being landed from a ves sel, with his family and a small amount of Indian goods, probably in May of the year mentioned. corporate limits of Otsego. His son, Samuel D. Foster, still resides there. The survey of this township into sections was completed in the latter part of January, 1831. In the certificate of survey the surveyor, Lucius Lyon, mentioned that three families (above designated) had already settled in the township, and also stated that Messrs. Sherwood and Scott were preparing to erect a saw-mill and a grist-mill on Pine Creek, near the mouth. Mr. Scott we have already spoken of. His partner was Hull Sherwood, who arrived in the fall of 1831. He was accompanied by his married sons Eber Sherwood, Hull Sherwood, Jr., and Royal Sherwood and their families, and his unmarried son Lebbeus ; a still younger son, Edmund, having come with Mr. Scott. Like Mr. Scott, the Sherwoods were from Rochester, N. Y. He immediately erected a log house on the site of Sau gatuck and began trading with the Indians. For three years he and his family were the only white residents of the western half of Allegan County, except the transient traders mentioned in the preceding chapter. On the advent of other settlers, however, he platted a village, as he had evi dently intended from the first, went to trading with the whites, and assumed the usual duties of a citizen. The first settlement in the two counties entirely uncon nected wjth the Indian trade was made by Giles Scott, who came from Rochester, N. Y., with his wife and two chil dren, in the autumn of 1830, and began the erection of a log house at the mouth of Pine Creek, in township 1 , range 12, now the township of Otsego, Allegan Co. He had been through this region during the previous year (1829) in company with Dr. Samuel Foster and a Mr. Percival, look ing for mill-sites and other points desirable for a new set tler. He was accompanied in the fall of 1830 by Uri Baker, Sloan Eaton, a Mr. Hill, and John B. Yeomans. By an act of the Legislative Council approved on the 2d day of March, 1831, the county of Allegan\"); was formed with its present boundaries, but this was merely a formal proceeding which did not change the actual relations of the few inhabitants. The settlers in township 1, range 12, were still citizens of Kalamazoo County for all prac tical purposes, while Mr. Butler and two or three traders, who were the only voters in the western part of the new county, could only exercise the franchise by going forty or fifty miles south to the settlements of Cass County. These matters are fully set forth in Chapter XIII., devoted to the subject of organization. As soon as his house was complete Mr. Scott moved into it, and was joined during the following winter by the other members of his family. The house, as was usually the case with the settlers who preceded the erection of saw mills, had a floor made of \" puncheons\" or split logs, yet it was afterwards found sufficiently smooth to dance on, and, as Mr. Scott was quite an adept with the fiddle, it was fre quently utilized for that purpose, the house being probably the first temple of Terpsichore in the two counties. In the spring of this year, Amasa S. Parker raised him a small log house (it is said without assistance) on the land he had chosen, and became the first permanent white resi dent of Barry County. His land was the west half of the southwest quarter of section 35, in township 1, range 2. In June, 1831, he located his tract at the land-office. Somewhat later than Scott, but during the same autumn, Turner Aldrich, Jr., of Lodi (now Gowanda), Erie Co., N. Y., made his appearance in the same locality. He was accompanied by two daughters, and brought with him a complete set of irons for a saw-mill, and an old-fashioned, perpendicular saw. He immediately began the erection of a saw-mill, about a mile up Pine Creek from its mouth. This was completed the following year, and was the first mill of any kind in the counties of Allegan aud Barry.\")\" But very few more settlers came into the territory of Otsego township in 1831, and at the end of the year that was still the only township settled in Allegan County. In the spring of 1832 nearly the whole West was start led from its propriety by the outbreak of the Black-Hawk war. This celebrated chief sent runners to the Ottawas and Pottawattamies to urge them to join him in a war with the whites. The old chiefs of those tribes, however, had had so much experience of the folly of fighting the Americans that they were strongly opposed to taking up the hatchet. Many of the young braves were desirous of war, and the question was zealously debated at several councils, but finally the wiser plan prevailed, and the whites of Michigan were not molested. It is related in the history of Cass County that at the council of the Pottawattamies of the St. Joseph, Topenabee, the venerable head-chief of that tribe, who had signed the treaty with Gen. Wayne in 1795, argued strongly against war and advised neutrality. A chief named Optogome charged him with cowardice. At this the ancient warrior threw a knife to Optogome, or dered him to defend himself, and then, with his own knife in his hand, advanced to attack him. At the first thrust About the same time that Mr. Scott made a settlement in Otsego, Amasa S. Parker, a sturdy young bachelor who had just arrived at Gull Prairie, Kalamazoo Co., selected a piece of land in township 1, range 10 (now Prairie ville, Barry Co.), and began to clear it off. This was the first improvement made in Bany County. Mr. Parker, however, did not put up a house until the next year, re turning to Gull Prairie to winter. The next settler in Allegan County was Dr. Samuel Foster, a native of Maine, who had practiced as a physician in Vermont, but who had given up his profession and never practiced it in Michigan. He located himself, near the end of 1830, on section 23, in the same township as Scott and Aldrich, being the first settler within the present \"f The word \" Allegan\" is evidently of Indian origin, but we have never met with any satisfactory explanation of its meaning. There is no stream nor lake of that name, and we have never heard us any tribe of Indians bearing it. The closeness of its resemblance to Alle gany suggests that some New Yorker may have chosen that name, but sought to make it more convenient by dropping the \"y.\" * As soon as tho land was surveyed, which was in the summer of 1831, he made a purchase. | This mill was burned in July, 1832, while in possession of Charles Miles and Cyrenius Thompson (afterwards the first settler in Gun Plain), who had leased it. V"], [40, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 32 Thompson, a physician from Ohio, who had quit the prac tice of the profession and had moved into township 1, range 12 (Otsego), erected a framed house in the adjoining town ship west (now Gun Plain), and moved into it early in the autumn of that year, becoming the first white resident of that township. It was not a very elegant mansion, the boards being fastened perpendicularly to the frame with wooden pins, yet it is entitled to notice as the first framed house in the two counties, \u2014 so far, at least, as we can ascer- the veteran drove his knife completely through the body of his antagonist, who fell dead at his feet. The council de cided for peace. The Chippewas, Ottaicas, and Pottawattamies of this region met in council on Gun Plain (or Gun Plains, as the locality was more commonly called), in the present town ship of that name, to decide on the same momentous ques tion. A half-breed, named Prickett, who lived at the mouth of Gun River (and who is said to have been of In dian and Yankee parentage, instead of Indian and French, which was the composition of most of the half-breeds), told the whites that the Indians were going to massacre them. Some buried their goods in preparation for flight, but we believe none lest. In fact, it was suspected by some that Prickett wanted to frighten them into fleeing in order to get their property, though perhaps this suspicion was un just. tain. In 1832, also, the first post-office in the counties of Al legan and Barry was established by the government ; Sam uel Foster, of township 1, range 12, being appointed the first postmaster. Another early event of much importance was the first marriage in the two counties, which as nearly as can be ascertained was a double one, which occurred in December, 1832, A. L. Cotton being wedded to Mary Sherwood, and Erastus Jackson to Ann Sherwood, her sister. Mr. Cotton and the two brides were all residents of township 1, range 12 (Otsego), but Mr. Jackson was from Comstock, Kala mazoo Co., and the officiating justice of the peace was Col. Isaac Barnes, of Gull Prairie, in the last-named county. The next marriage, which occurred during the following October, was between another of the same family, Miss Martha Sherwood, and Mr. Oka Town, who then lived in Kalamazoo County, though he has for the last forty-six years been a resident of Otsego. The officiating minister was Rev. William Jones, of Gull Prairie, who came on foot and waded the Kalamazoo River for the purpose of per forming the ceremony. Bouchon, the French trader on the Kalamazoo, below the site of Allegan, came up to the settlement and agreed to attend the council, relying on the friendship of the In dians, and, if they declared for war, to notify the settlers in township 1, range 12 (Otsego), as fast as his pony could carry him thither, \u2014 albeit the warning would have come rather late, for an Indian declaration of war is usu ally followed very speedily by overt acts. The council lasted three days. Young Samuel D. Foster, then about nineteen, determined that he, too, would have early in formation of the intentions of the Indians, and every day he went over to the council on Gun Plains. Bouchon was there all the while, and from time to time he interpreted the language of the speakers, whether friendly or hostile, for the benefit of young Foster. Quite a number of new settlers located in the present townships of Otsego and Gun Plain in 1833, and a Baptist Church \u2014 the first church in the two counties \u2014 was organ ized in the latter locality in that year. Not a solitary emi grant, however, made his home in Allegan County outside of these two townships, Mr. Butler's family remaining the sole white occupants of all the rest of the county (except, perhaps, two or three keepers of Indian trading-posts), while in Barry County there was but one more settler during the year, viz., Orville Barnes, who located himself on the same section as Parker, in the present township of Prairie ville. Near the end of the third day the final decision was arrived at, \u2014 not to attack the whites, \u2014 and this, too, was promptly interpreted to young Foster. Soon afterward the squaws began to clear off a piece of ground, eight or ten rods long and twelve or fifteen feet wide. This they brushed off with great care, making it almost as smooth as a floor. Then there was a grand dance and \" pow wow,\" which lasted all night. Young Foster, who seemed to have had a good deal of confidence in the Indians, remained through out the scene, and said that he never saw anything else that would compare with those extraordinary performances. The Indians jumped, and kicked, and howled from end to end of the extempore ball-room, till one might have thought a legion of demons were holding their orgies there, while the woodland arches rang on every side with their shrill, far-reaching, unearthly cries. The following extract from the Territorial laws of 1833 describes the first road provided for in the two counties under consideration. The \" middle village\" mentioned in it was an Indian village near the line between Thornapple and Yaukee Springs townships : The whites soon became satisfied that the Indians of this vicinity were not going to injure them ; and when the mili- tia was called out in May to march to the assistance of the Illinoisans against Black Hawk, several men of the Otsego settlement joined the command of Col. Isaac Barnes, of Gull Prairie, Kalamazoo Co. They were un- married, transient men, however, and their names are not remembered. It was soon found that the danger was not as great as had been supposed, and the command only went to Niles or thereabout, being mustered out after a week or two of service. \"Sec. 8. That a Territorial road shall be laid out and established, beginning at the middle village (so called), in Barry County, thence on the most diVect and eligible route through or near to Gun River Plain, to the Territorial road, near the forks of the Paw Paw (so called) ; and AVilliam Duncan, Cornelius Northrop, and Carlos Barnes are hereby appointed commissioners to lay out and establish said road. * * \u00bb * m * \u00bb \u00ab- \" Provided that no part of the expense of laying out said roads, or damage accruing to persons through whose lands either of said roads may pass, shall be paid out of the Territorial treasury. \"Approved March 29, 1833.\" In the latter part of the summer of 1832, Dr. Cyrenius In 1833 or 1834, Louis Campau built a house, out of"], [41, "EARLY SETTLEMENTS 33 timber cut on the spot with a whip-saw, near Green Lake, in the present township of Leighton, Allegan Co., where he established an Indian trading-post, but no permanent settlement was made there until several years later. Thus, by the latter part of 1836, nearly all of the west ern half of Allegan County was settled to the extent of having at least one family in each township. The excep tional townships in that half were No. 4, in range 11, now Leighton (in which there were no whites but the keepers of the trading-post) ; Nos. 3 and 4, in range 12 (Hopkins and Dorr) ; and No. 4, in range 13 (Salem). At this time speculation had become rampant throughout the country, especially in the West, and speculators and capitalists were constantly wandering through the wilds of Michigan in search of locations for future cities. In 1834 a party of capitalists residing in Boston, Mass., and Roch ester, N. Y., purchased the lands on both sides of the Kal amazoo, at the rapids of that river, in township 2 north, range 13 west, and also bought large tracts in the surround ing country. Here they projected the city of Allegan and immediately sent on workmen to make a beginning ; the first actual settlement being made by Leander S. Prouty and family, who descended the Kalamazoo on a raft for that purpose. The details of the early improvements in Allegan are given in the history of that village. But not alone in Eastern Allegan were the axes of the pioneers heard resounding in all directions throughout the spring, summer, and autumn of 1836. New settlers made their appearance at Saugatuck, near the mouth of the Kal amazoo, with minds intent on lumbering and tanning; and during the same year John Allen, of Ann Arbor, laid out the city of Richmond, a few miles up that river, in town ship 3, range 15, now known as Manlius, sending Ralph R. Mann thither with a number of workmen, in the fall, to make a settlement. Turning to Barry County, we find it too all astir with emigrants and land-seekers of various kinds. The old In dian trail from the Pottawattamie village, on the site of Kalamazoo, to the \" rapids of Grand River\" (now more concisely designated as Grand Rapids), passed through Gull Prairie, in the present township of Richmond, Kala mazoo Co., and thence northward through the present townships of Prairieville, Orangeville, Yankee Springs, and Thornapple, by way of the Indian Middle Village, in Barry County, and thence down the Thornapple River. The emigrants and other travelers naturally followed the same route, and by 1836 there was a well-defined road along the old trail, although as yet no surveyor had desig nated any portion of it as a highway. The same year (1834) the first settlement in township 1, range 9 (now Barry township, Barry Co.), was made by Moses Lawrence, who is noted in local history as having entered the first land, built the first cabin, preached the first sermon, arrd set out the first fruit-trees in that town ship. In the autumn of 1834, also, Calvin G. Hill began the settlement of the north part of Barry County, selecting a location on the site of the village of Middleville, in the present township of Thornapple. The only new township settled in the two counties in 1835 was No. 1, in range 13, now Trowbridge, in Allegan County, one of the pioneers there in that year being Leander S. Prouty; already mentioned as the first settler in Allegan. About thirty laborers were also at work on the various improvements begun in Allegan village. On this road, near the northwest corner of section 35, township 3, range 10 (now Yankee Springs), and near some fine springs of delicious water, a man named Calvin Lewis and a Mr. Tryon built a log house in the year 1836. This year Allegan County was organized, as stated in the chapter relating to organization (Chapter XIII.), and at the first election in the autumn was found to contain sixty-one voters. As near as can be estimated, there were then about a dozen voters in Barry County, including six or eight who had settled in town 1, range 10 (Prairieville), that year. Lucius A. Barnes (now of Wayland, Allegan Co.), of whom we have already spoken, while returning from a trip to the North, came to the point named just as Lewis was about to raise his house, and helped in the task. In a few months Calvin Lewis and Mr. Tryon transferred the place to a brother of tbe former, William Lewis, who denomina ted his log tavern the \" Mansion House,\" and hung a sign bearing that name on an oak-tree standing near the door. It attained a widespread reputation, but was generally known as the Yankee Springs House.* It was not until 1836 that the tide of emigration got under full headway. In that year settlements were made in the present townships of Martin, Watson, Monterey, and Manlius, in Allegan County, and in Hastings, Yankee Springs, Orangeville, Rutland, Carlton, and Johnstown, in Barry County. The first settlement in township 2, range 1 (now Mar tin), was made in March, 1836, by Mumford Eldred, who selected a little opening which was still occupied by a band of Indians, who were not dispossessed without con siderable trouble, the story of which is told in the history of that township. * The origin of this name dates back to the previous year, when Henry Leonard and family, including a youth named Charles Paul, were moving into Thornapple. They were from one of the New England States, and while they were stopping for luncheon at the excellent springs mentioned above, a stranger joined them, who was also from that part of tbe Union. One of the party remarked, \" AVe are all Yankees,\" and suggested that the springs should be called Yankee Springs. Charles Paul hewed the bark off the side of a large oak, and cut the words \" Yankee Springs'' upon it. The name was adopted by the public. Lewis' tavern became known as the Yankee Springs House, and finally the township received tbe same appella tion. The settlement of township 2, range 2 (now Watson), by William S. Miner and Daniel Leggett, followed within two or three months aster that of Martin, and was con temporary with that of township 3, range 13 (now Mon terey), by a person bearing the peculiar name of Gil Bias Wilcox. Wayland was also settled in 1836 by Daniel Jackson and Lucius A. Barnes, on the land of Col. Isaac and Mr. George W. Barnes. All accounts agree that the Yankee Springs House was one of the very best hotels ever known in the pioneer days. Its glories were celebrated, in the lines quoted below, by George Torrey, Sr., in the Kalamazoo Telegraph, in 1S14. The springs, it is true, were not on 5"], [42, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 34 Legislature of 1836, as shown by the session laws of that year, are as follows : Road running from Allegan eastward through the county-seats of Barry, Eaton, and Ingham Counties, and terminating at Howell, the county-seat of Livingston County. Joseph Fisk, of Allegan County, Charles G. Hill, of Barry County, and J. B. Crane, of Livingston County, were appointed commissioners to lay it out. Road beginning at Allegan, running thence to the \" old county seat of Van Buren County\" (Lawrence), thence to Niles, and thence to the Indiana State line. Ninian Ab bott, E. G. Nichols, and Hull Sherwood, Jr., were appointed commissioners. Township No. 2, range 10 (now Orangeville), which ad joined the one just mentioned on the south, was settled the same year\u2014 1836\u2014 by George Brown, John Patton, and Joshua J. Pease. The same season Lorenzo Cooley and a Mr. De Groat came and made a beginning in the way of improvement near the eastern shore of Long Lake, in township No. 3, range 9 (now Rutland), lying directly east of Yankee Springs. Passing eastward on the same line, we find that in August, 1836, several residents of Marshall, who had already bought a large tract of land on the Thornapple River, in township 3, range 8, organized a company known as the Hastings Company, which immediately set laborers at work building a saw-mill on the site of the city of Hastings, and pro ceeded to lay out a village at that point.

Enoch Baker, Alanson Crossman, and Charles Thayer, commis sioners. Township No. 1, in range 8, now Johnstown, was settled in the fall of 1836 by Harlow Merrill, his location being made in the east half of the northeast quarter of section 35. Still another township was added in 1836 to the list of those which could be described as \" settled,\" in the two counties under consideration in this work. This was No. 4, in range 8, lying directly north of Hastings, and now known as Carlton, the first settlement in which was made in September, 1836, on the banks of the north branch of Thornapple River, near the centre of the township, by Samuel and Harrison Wickham and George Fuller. Road from Allegan to the mouth of North Black River. Ira Burdick, John E. Brackett, and Enoch Baker, commis sioners. Road from Edwardsburg, in Cass County, by way of Cassopolis, Volinia, and Paw Paw to Allegan. David Crane, Jacob Silver, and John L. Shearer, commissioners. Township 1, in range 7 (Assyria), was also settled in 1836, the first pioneer being Joseph S. Blaisdell, who located on section 36, in the southwest corner, a mile or two from a couple of Indian villages, the inhabitants of which were his nearest neighbors in Barry County until the following March. It will be observed that every one of these roads termi nates at Allegan, which may be accounted for by the fact that Hon. Elisha Ely, one of the proprietors of that village, was a member of the Legislature of 1836. The year 1837 opened with popular excitement still intense and emigration still active. Nearly everybody expected to become rich through the rise of land, and espe cially of city lots. Surveyors were kept constantly busy running out the lines of newly-selected lands, and some of the earliest pioneers made a good living merely by showing desirable tracts to new-comers. This brings the list of settled townships in Barry County at the close of 1836 up to nine, while in Allegan County there were ten. During the session of the Legislature of the half-way State (for Michigan, though provided with a State govern ment, was not admitted into the Union until the fore-part of 1837), that body had provided roads for the gathering tide of emigrants so far as it could do so by the mere authorization of State roads without expense to the State, care being taken to insert in every law of the kind a pro vision that no part of the burden of either surveying or making such roads should be borne by the State. The roads through either Allegan or Barry authorized by the Few emigrants located in the dark pine forests of Western Allegan, the only new township invaded that year in that region being No. 2 in range 15, now known as Clyde, whither Jacob Bailey led a party of laborers and began the erection of a saw-mill, as the agent of a New York firm. In Eastern Allegan no new township was settled. But in Barry County the tide was as strong as ever, four new townships hearing the woodman's axe reverberating through their previously unbroken forests during the year 1837. the direct road from \"Detroit to Kalamazoo,\" but then something must doubtless be allowed for poetic license: In that year A. E. Bull built a cabin and made his home in the southeast corner of section 33, township 4, range 9 (now Irving), having purchased a forty-acre lot there in 1836, as well as a much larger tract in the adjoin ing township to the south, now known as Rutland. His purchase was mostly prairie-land, and the locality is known as Bull's Prairie to this day. This was near the site of Campau's trading-post, kept by Moreau, as already men tioned. \" Did you ever go out to Grand River, From Detruit to Kalamazoo, In a wagon without any kiver, Through a country that louks very new? \"If you're hungry, and wish for a dinner, BreakfiBt, supper, and lodgings to boot, If you're a Turk, a Christian, or sinner, Yankee Springs is the place that will suit. \"The landlord's a prince of his order, \u2014 Yankee Lewis, whose fame aud renown, Township 4, range 7 (now Woodland), was first settled in the autumn of 1837, by Samuel S. and Jonathan Hai\u00ab*lu Far and near throughout Michigan's border, Is noised about country and town.\""], [43, "PIONEERING IN GENERAL. 35 and Charles Galloway, who all located on section 15, near the centre of the township. difficulties conquered by the pioneers of Allegan and Barry Counties is given in the following chapter. The names of the settlers in each township, with numerous incidents con nected with them, are given in the separate township his tories. Lorenzo Mudge made the first improvement in the ad joining township on the south (now Castleton) in 1837, having purchased the southeast quarter of section 32 on the south line of the township, where for eight months his family resided alone, his wife not seeing the face of a white woman during that period. CHAPTER IX. Township 2 in range 7, now known as Maple Grove, like Castleton, was first occupied on its southern border, and like it was settled in 1837, though probably a few months earlier in the year. Eli Lapham, its first pioneer, was obliged to leave his family several weeks at Cleveland Ellis' house, in Assyria, while he prepared a home for them on section 35 in Maple Grove.

Thus, at the close of 1837, fourteen out of the sixteen townships of Barry County had been occupied by one or more settlers each, while only eleven of the twenty-four townships of Allegan County contained any other inhabi tants than Indians and wild animals. In the preceding chapter we have sketched an outline of the course of settlement in the two counties of Allegan and Barry. In this one we purpose to give a general idea of the scenes passed through by the pioneers after their arrival. It is true that many of them still survive, and need no county history to tell them the story of the hard ships they have endured, and that others of the people have often heard from parents and friends the same absorb ing tale. Nevertheless, some of our readers will doubtless be new-comers, who never knew the joys and woes of pio neer life, and it is to be hoped that a few copies of our work will survive to a day when all the forests shall have been swept from the surface of Michigan, and when the last survivor of the pioneer army shall have passed away. For the benefit of the numerous emigrants, as well as for that of the old settlers (for all who had been in Michigan over a year were thus designated), a new crop of State roads was provided by the Legislature of 1837 and 1838, subject, as before, to the provision that the people of each county should lay them out and work them. These were as follows : Road from Marshall, Calhoun Co., by Verona, through the south part of Prairieville, and through Gun Plains to Allegan. C. W. Spaulding, of Prairieville, Silas F. Little john, of Allegan, and Cephas A. Smith were appointed commissioners. The settlers of Michigan were of two classes, \u2014 one com posed of men with more or less capital, who erected mills and went to lumbering, and who usually laid out villages wherever there was a promising locality, and in some places where it required a very sanguine temperament to see any promise whatever; the other comprising the pioneers proper, who were usually poor, who purchased from the United States from forty to a hundred and sixty acres of land each, and who then set themselves to work to clear off and cul tivate their farms with their own hands. It is of these that we speak here. A road from Bellevue, Eaton Co., to Hastings, the county-seat of Barry County. Andrew L. Hays, Reuben Fitzgerald, and Jeremiah P. Woodberry, commissioners. ,Road from Battle Creek, Calhoun Co., through Gull Prairie, on the most eligible route to Grandville, in the county of Kent. George Torry, Isaac Barns, and Roswell Britain, commissioners. Road from the county-seat of Kalamazoo County to the county-seat of Barry County. Mumford Eldred, Jr., Isaac Otis, and John Mills appointed commissioners. At this period (1837) the general inflation of the cur rency by \" wild-cat\" banks, and the consequent reckless speculation in land and other property, culminated in a great financial collapse, the most distressing ever known in the United States. Nearly all the business enterprises of the West were stricken with financial palsy, and even emi gration moved with an exceedingly slow pace for several In many cases the emigrant came on foot, selected his land, cleared a little piece of ground, built a cabin, and then returned East for his family. Some of the very first settlers in Allegan and Barry found small prairies, where the plow could be put at work at once. Others were able to obtain \" oak-openings,\" where the timber was scattered, and where comparatively little work was required to fit the land for cultivation. But the large majority were obliged to content themselves with homes in the dense forest, where the soil, indeed, was generally fertile, but where the severest labors were necessary ere it could be made to yield up the wealth which was hidden within it. years. Settlers came slowly into the townships already occupied, and it took no less than twenty-one years even to make a beginning in all of the others. In 1838 a commencement was only made in three, \u2014 now kngwn as Hopkins, Pine Plains, and Ganges, all in Allegan County. Cheshire, Allegan Co., was first occupied in 1839 ; Leighton, in the same county, in 1840 ; Fillmore, same county, 1S41 ; Bal timore and Hope, Barry Co., 1842 ; Casco, Allegan Co., 1845; Laketown, same county, 1847; Overisel, same county, 1848; Heath, 1850; Salem, 1851 ; Leo, 1858. A general view of the hardships undergone and the Those who were able to make beginnings and then bring their families belonged to the more \" fore-handed\" class of emigrants. Many brought their families with them in the first place. Some had horse-teams, but probably a decided majority of the settlers in Western Michigan, between 1830 and 1845, came behind ox-teams. These patient, cheap,"], [44, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 36 townships of Allegan and Barry. If there were no settlers in the locality which the head of the family selected for his new home, a little cabin was hastily constructed of small logs, which he and his boys could handle, and covered with bark or grass, a blanket serving as a door and ample cracks taking the place of windows. If there were a few settlers within two or three miles of the selected place, the emigrant's family was probably sheltered in one of them until a log house could be built. New-comers were always warmly welcomed by their predecessors, partly, no doubt, from natural kindness, and partly because each arrival helped to redeem the forest from its forbidding loneliness, and added to the value of improvements already made. and hardy animals were much better adapted than horses to the terrible roads of those days, and possessed the further advantage of being always transmissible into beef in case of accident to them or scarcity in the family. Sometimes two or three yoke of cattle were hitched to a single wagon, and they were pretty sure to be needed on the early roads of Michigan. A picture of one emigrant family with its appurtenances on its way to Western Mich igan would do for thousands of others, and we will take a look at one in imagination as a type of its class. A big substantial wagon is seen, surmounted with hoops, on which is stretched a sheet of heavy canvas which was once white, but which is now stained with every one of the seventy or eighty different kinds of mud to be found be tween Detroit and Battle Creek. Two sturdy yoke of cattle pull it slowly along the sorest roadway, now moving easily over a comparatively dry track, and anon straining every muscle to drag the vehicle from some almost fathomless mud-hole puddle, or some unbridged creek. By their side, with long ox-goad in hand, marches a tall pioneer, the type of a class which has subdued a continent. His hair is un kempt and his face is darkly bronzed by exposure and toil, but his eye flashes with native intelligence, and his features are marked all over with the signs of indomitable will and unflinching courage. His form is long and slim and gaunt, but, except the skin and the bones, it is composed entirely of muscle, and every muscle is as tough as a raw hide whip-lash. There is no danger that he will not face, no hardship he will not undergo, no experiment he is not ready to try, if necessary, and yet his cool, sound judgment aud unemotional nature prevent him from indulging in either rashness or bravado. Suitable trees for a house were speedily felled and cut into logs from fourteen to twenty feet long, according to the wealth and pretensions of the builder. When these were ready a man or boy was sent to all the pioneers for miles around to summon them to the \" raising.\" It was rare in deed that one failed to respond, for a raising not only added another house to the township, but was usually the occasion of a jollification, furnishing one of the few recreations of frontier life. On the day specified, perhaps only a dozen men would be collected from as many square miles, but all would be able to handle their axes as easily as the deftest clerk flourishes his pen. The logs already cut were drawn by oxen to the desired spot, and four of the largest were selected as a foundation. Four of the most active and expert men were designated to build the corners. They began by cutting a kind of saddle at the ends of two of the logs. Notches to fit these saddles were cut in the other logs, and then they were laid upon the first ones. The operation was repeated again and again, the four axemen constantly shaping the logs, which were quickly raised by their comrades. Arrived at a height of six or eight feet, rasters made of poles from the forest were placed in position, and if a supply of \"shakes\" (rough, hard-wood shingles, three feet long) \"had been provided, the roof was at once constructed, the gable end being formed of logs successively shortened to the pin nacle. Then a place for a door was sawed out, and another for a window (if the proprietor aspired to such a conve nience), and the principal work of the architects was done. On the front seat of the wagon sits a woman who may be the counterpart of her husband in strength and determi nation, but is quite likely to show the delicate features so common among American women, worn with toil and sur mounted by sad eyes, which look with dread on the dark forest, by which they are surrounded, and in which they are to make themselves a new home. Beside her sits the oldest girl, red-cheeked, blue-eyed, and curly-haired, her features glowing with youth, and very probably resplendent with a delicate beauty not to be found out of America in persons of no higher position in life. They were usually cheered in their labors, and rewarded at the end of them, by the contents of a jug of whisky; for it must have been a very poor neighborhood indeed in which a few quarts of that article could not be obtained for great occasions. If you lift a corner of the canvas and glance inside, you will find the whole space below the hoops crammed full of beds, bedding, provisions, a few simple articles of furniture, and probably two or three children stowed away wherever it is most convenient. A cow and a few young cattle prob- ably follow in the rear, driven by a youngster of fourteen, who is alternately shouting at his charge and grumbling to himself because he is not as fortunate as his bi<* brother of eighteen, who is out on the flank with his father's rifle. If he could only carry that rifle through the woods for a day, he knows he could kill a deer, and perhaps a bear. Oh if he could only kill & bear his highest hopes would be satis fied, and he would aspire to no loftier ambition on this earth. Afterward the proprietor made a door of rough boards, built a fireplace of stone, surmounted by a stick chimney well plastered with mud, and perhaps put in a glass window and a board floor. A log house eighteen feet square, with a shingle roof, a board floor, and a window containing six lights of glass, was a decidedly stylish residence, and its owner was in some danger of being disliked as a bloated aristocrat. The furniture was often as primitive as the houses. Most families brought a bed and some bedding with them, and if they added a bedstead and three or four chairs, it showed that they belonged to the higher classes. Substitutes for the latter were frequently made by splitting a slab out of a Day after day, from 1830 to 1845 or later, such corteges as we have described were to be seen making their way through the wilds of Western Michigan to the various"], [45, "PIONEERING IN GENERAL. 37 log, boring four holes in the corners, and inserting four legs manufactured with equal expedition. spike-men being always ready to put it right if it caught against an obstacle. As it tore along the ground the black dust flew up in every direction, and when a collision oc curred the sooty zephyrs arose in treble volume. A bedstead was almost as easily constructed, four posts being quickly hewed out, holes bored in them, and poles in serted on which a rope was strung, \u2014 that is, if the family had ropes enough for the purpose. In some extreme cases strips of bark supplied their places. Soon every man was covered with a thick coat of black, involving clothes, hands, and face in a darkness which no mourning-garb ever equaled. But the work went on with increasing speed. The spirit of rivalry broke forth, and each sooty trio or quartette strove to make the quickest trips and the highest piles. It is even said by old loggers that the oxen would become almost as excited as the men, and would \" snake\" the logs into place with ever-increasing energy. Teams that understood their business would stand quiet while the chain was being hitched, then spring with all their might, taking a bee-line to the log heap, and halt as soon as they came abreast of it. They had not the bene fit, either, of the stimulus applied to the men, for the whisky jug was in frequent circulation. Usually the emigrant brought a small stock of provis ions with him, for food he knew he must have. These, however, were frequently exhausted before he could raise a supply. Then he depended on his neighbors, and on the game he could shoot or could buy from the Indians. The latter still occupied several villages in the two counties. They were almost invariably friendly to the. whites, and fre quently sold them food at very reasonable rates, asking but a quarter of a dollar for a \" saddle\" of venison, \u2014 that is, the two hind-quarters of a deer, large or small. They also frequently helped in raising houses, being especi ally fond of the whisky dispensed on such occasions. The following chapter is devoted to the Indians of that period. There was a good chance, too, for the men to show their skill in ox-driving. Some never hitched to a log their cat tle could not draw, and always made them draw the one they did hitch to. Others were constantly hitching to the wrong log or failing to get the right one to the heap. Aster building a house, the next task was to clear a piece of land. If the pioneer had arrived very early in the season, he might possibly get half an acre of woods out of the way, so as to plant a little corn the same spring, es pecially if his land was wholly or partly \" oak-openings.\" If not, his ambition was usually limited to getting three or four acres ready for winter wheat by the first of September. To do this he worked early and late, fortunate \u2014 very for tunate \u2014 if his hand was not stayed by the ague, that dreaded scourge of all new countries. But as the day went on there was an increasing tendency to depend less on skill and more on main strength and recklessness. Faster and faster sped the men and teams to and fro, harder strained the handspike heroes to increase the pile, higher flew the clouds of dust and soot. Careless of danger, men sprang in front of rolling logs or bounded over them as they weut whirling among the stumps. Ac cidents sometimes happened, but those who have been on the scene only express wonder that they were so few, and that half the necks of those present were not broken. The first move, of course, was to fell the trees, but even this was a work of science. It was the part of the expert woodman to make them all lie in one direction, so they could be easily rolled together. Then they were cut into logs from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and the brush was cut up and piled. When the latter had become dry it was fired, and the land quickly burned over, leaving the black ened ground and charred logs. Next came the logging. When the piece was small the pioneer would probably \" enange work,\" so as to obtain a couple of helpers, and the three would log an acre a day, one driving the team and two using handspikes, and thus dragging and rolling the logs into piles convenient for burning. The first dry weather these too were fired ; the brands were watched and heaped together, and when all were consumed the land was ready for the plow. As the day draws to a close a thick cloud covers the field, through which are seen a host of sooty forms, \u2014 four-legged ones with horns, and two-legged one with handspikes, \u2014 pulling, running, listing, shouting, screaming, giving the most vivid idea of Pandemonium that a farmer's life ever offers, until night descends, and the tired yet still excited laborers return to their homes, clothed in blackness, and the terror of even the most careless of housewives. But the work is done. The land would perhaps be sown for winter wheat, per haps reserved for corn and potatoes in the spring. The next thing in order was fence-building. Sometimes a temporary one was constructed by piling brush together around the edge of the clearing, but this was a poor de fense against a steer that was really in earnest, and if it was retained after the first year the owner would incur the reproach of \" shiftlessness,\" that chief of sins to the Yankee mind. Even an ordinary day in the logging-field was a suffi ciently sooty and disagreeable experience, but was as noth ing compared with a \" logging-bee.\" When a tract of several acres was to be logged, the neighbors were invited from far and near to a bee. Those who had oxen brought them ; the others provided themselves with cant-hooks and handspikes. The officer of the day, otherwise known as the \" boss,\" who was usually the owner of the land, gave the necessary directions, designating the location of the various heaps, and the work began. The charred and blackened logs were rapidly drawn (or \" snaked,\" according to the common term) alongside the heap, and then the handspike brigade quickly rolled them on to it. Another aud another were dragged up in rapid succession, the hand- The universal reliance of the pioneer's heart was the old-fashioned \" Virginia rail-fence.\" When winter had put an end to other work, the sturdy settler, armed with axe, and beetle, and iron wedge, and wooden wedges, tramped through the snow to the big oaks, elms, and walnuts already selected, working late and early to convert them into great three-cornered rails twelve feet long and facing six or eight inches on a side. Many young men made a specialty of splitting rails, and there was frequently con-"], [46, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 38 It opened the account with you at such an hour on such a day, and then put in its appearance a little later every day or every other day, until your morning shake was changed to one at sunset or midnight. The cold sensation increased in severity until it culminated in shaking the life nearly out of you ; then by degrees it waxed and waned perceptibly less till it left you. The ' fits' oame so regularly that the settler made his calculations by it. His calendar was divided into well-days and ague-days. The minister made his appointments to preach so as to accommodate his ' shakes.' The justice entered the suit on his docket to avoid the sick-day of the party or his own. The constable watched the well-day of the witness to get him into court, and the lawyer adjourned his case on account of his ague-day. The housewife regulated her affairs by it,\u2014 she would do up her work, and sit and wait for the ague, as for a visitor to come. And the pioneer gallant went sparking on his well-night, and then he sometimes found his Dulcinea 'sitting up' with the 'fever'n ague.' \" siderable rivalry as to the number which the respective knights of the beetle and wedge could produce in a day. To fell the trees, cut them into logs, and split a hundred rails was considered a fair day's work for an ordinary hand, and two hundred for a good hand, but some would improve even on the latter number. Breaking up the soil was also made a specialty by some of the settlers. In the heavily-timbered land it was soft, and the owner could break it as easily as in the East, with one or two yoke of cattle. In the \" openings\" the ground was tougher and three yoke were employed, while on the open prairie the matted turf, bound together with innu merable long, strong grass-roots, required four yoke of cattle to tear it apart and overturn it, though sometimes a less number were used. After that there is nothing more to be said about pio neering. The fever and ague was the cap-sheaf of the settler's experience. It is scarcely necessary to say that when the county was first settled wild game was found in abundance. Deer were frequently seen from the settler's cabin-door nibbling at the edge of his wheat-field, and sometimes a drove of from twenty to thirty would be found feeding at night on some secluded grain-field or grass-grown \" opening.\" As the pioneers were usually expert with the rifle, many a fine haunch of venison rewarded their moonlight vigils. An occasional bear, too, which in its desire for pork ventured too near an emigrant's cabin, was sometimes brought low by a deadly bullet, but these were rare cases. Fish, how ever, was abundant in all the streams, and furnished a welcome relief from the salt pork, potatoes, and \"johnny cake,\" which formed a large part of the emigrant's usual sustenance.

During the first ten years of white settlement in Alle gan and Barry Counties the Indians were almost as numer ous and active as they had ever been. As had been their custom for more than a hundred and fifty years, most of the Ottawas spent the summer in the vicinity of Mackinaw, and came up Lake Michigan in the autumn to hunt. With these were mingled large numbers of Pottawattamies, from the banks of the St. Joseph (though they were not as nu merous as the Ottawas), for the two tribes still, as of yore, occupied their hunting-grounds in common. In fact, so closely had they become united that some of the Pottawat tamies made their summer home at Mackinaw, remaining with their Ottawa, friends year aster year, while a few of the latter were to be found raising corn and beans in sum mer far south of the Kalamazoo. Besides the deer and the bear, there was another wild animal, which, indeed, could not be utilized by the settlers for food, but which might possibly use him for that pur pose, and which was certain to engage a portion of the thoughts of every pioneer who tried to keep sheep. The \" wolf's long howl\" was heard on every hillside by the first pioneers, and woe to the unlucky sheep which was not in safe quarters when night came down upon the forest ! But the most dangerous enemy of the early settlers of Allegan and Barry was no four-legged wanderer of the woods, but a foe which entered every household in spite of bolts and bars, seized upon old and young with undis criminating fury, and, if it did not slay them outright, often made them wish for the presence of death. This was the celebrated monster of the West, the fever and ague. This disease ruled in Michigan with more than imperial sway. If there was a solitary one of the early settlers who did not at one time or another own the power of Lord Fever and-Ague, we have yet to learn his or her name. In fact, its blessings were so widely enjoyed and are so vividly remembered that it is needless to describe them, especially as no description could do the subject justice, and as, more over, there are enough cases occurring at the present time to give an idea of the old enemy. A. D. P. Van Buren, Esq., of Kalamazoo County, very vigorously presents some of the characteristics of the disease in an article reproduced in the history of that county, from which we quote the following vivid paragraph regarding some of its results : After the corn was harvested at Mackinaw, in the latter part of October or fore-part of November, the watcher on the shore of Lake Michigan might have seen, when there was a favorable wind, a gallant fleet of the celebrated Mackinaw boats sweeping southward before the breeze. If there was no wind, or none in the right direction, one or more Iudians would go on shore from each boat, and tow it up the lake by means of a long rope made of birch-bark. As the fleet came nearer, the spectator would see a host of boats which, probably, combined size and lightness more fully than any others in the world. Twenty to thirty feet long, made of great strips of birch-bark stretched upon light ribs of cedar, and carefully sewed together with cords made of the inner bark or of deer-skin, the seams bein\"* well pitched to keep out the water, the Mackinaw boat \"There were several phases to this complaint. Some had it every day, some every other day. As it began with you, so it continued."], [47, "INDIANS IN TnE PIONEER DAYS. 39 would carry the whole family of an Ottawa warrior (con sisting of himself, three or four squaws, and an indefinite number of children of various sizes), blankets, guns, fishing tackle, and an ample supply of dried corn for the winter's use. It is believed by those conversant with the subject that a Mackinaw boat would carry ten tons, and yet it was so light that when unloaded it could easily be borne by two men. A slender cedar mast was erected in it, which usually supported a cloth sail, but sometimes, when the owner was too poor for that, he supplied its place by a piece of the heavy matting woven out of bark by the squaws for the material of a tent. The boats sailed very handsomely on the lake before a light wind, though of course they would hardly weather a severe storm. fatigues and dangers of war and the chase, and nothing else. Of the pleasures of war the Ottaicas and Pottawattamies had been largely deprived since their complete conquest by the United States, but the chase still remained. It was followed with ardor through the closing weeks of autumn, but it was when the white mantle of winter covered all the land that the brave girded his loins for the severest toil. Over hill and dale, over ice and snow, through chilling stream and tangled undergrowth, he pursued the track of the deer with unwavering patience and unflinching endur ance. Arriving at length in the vicinity of the quarry (the nearness of which he could discern with extraordinary sa gacity), his approaches are made with a skill equaling that of the profoundest military strategist. Creeping slowly and stealthily, with half-frozen feet, a mile or more, to gain the side of the doomed animal away from the wind, lying prone in a snow-bank to lull its half-aroused suspicions, standing so quiet behind a tree that he seems a part of it, he at length gains the long-desired opportunity, and a bullet from his rifle brings the stately animal to the ground. With a yell in which lingers some of the glory of the old scalp hunting times, the hunter bounds forward to cut the throat of his victim, and then, after hanging the carcass on a tree, out of reach of the wolves, presses on with undiminished zeal to fresh toils and fresh conquests. Perhaps he returns and carries the animal to camp, but more probably he in forms his squaw (or squaws) of its whereabouts, who skin and quarter it and carry it home. Arriving in this region, the fleet would perhaps turn up the Grand River, to be followed the next day by one which would ascend the Kalamazoo, and these again by others, going up the same or other streams. A hundred boats have been known to ascend one of these rivers at once ; each bearing a family which would probably number on the av erage ten persons. Sometimes two small families would oc cupy one boat, but usually the domestic establishment of one polygamous brave was considered enough for the capa city even of a Mackinaw boat. On up the streams went the frail vessels, the head of the family invariably sitting in the stern and steering, while the squaws did the harder work of paddling the boat against the often rapid tide, \u2014 up the Kalamazoo to Allegan, to Ot sego, and even to Kalamazoo ; up Grand River, and some times up the Thornapple to the centre of Barry County, for no slight obstacle would stop them. If a bit of low water or an unusually rapid riffle was encountered, all sprang out ; the squaws loaded themselves with the freight in the boat, while a couple of Indians shouldered the boat itself, one under the prow and one under the stern, and passed rapidly around the obstacle. A similar method was used when it was desired to cut across a neck of land and avoid paddling around a long bend in the river. Meat was of course abundant, and a white man could always buy a fine \" saddle\" of venison (that is, the two hind quarters) for twenty-five cents. Though accustomed to the most distant and most uncer tain excursions in search of game, yet, in traveling from one well-known locality to another, the Indians usually fol lowed one trail year aster year in all its windings, marching one after the other in the well known \" Indian file,\" and with their own and their ponies' feet wearing a hard, deep path into the ground, barely wide enough for a pony to walk in, but six or eight inches below the surface. Each brave selected his own place for winter headquar ters, though sometimes several located together. Unless they were much crowded, they chose a place on the bank of a stream navigable by their canoes. They carried light cedar tent-poles with them, aud each family could put up its tent, move its household goods (consisting mostly of dried corn) into it, and be ready for keeping house within fifteen minutes from the time of arrival. Ponies could not of course be brought from Mackinaw in birch-bark canoes, so they were not as common here as at the summer quarters of the Indians, but the Pottawala mies brought up some from the south. Some were kept by the Indians whose permanent homes were in this vicinity, and perhaps a few were brought down from the north by land ; at all events, they were not very uncommon here. When an Indian wanted to hitch his pony, he tied his fore feet together, so that he could only travel by jumping like a rabbit, feeling certain that under such circumstances he would not go farther than was necessary to find food. Even this was no slight task, for, when there was no grass, the poor ponies usually had to subsist on browse. Occasionally a particularly prudent or tender-hearted brave would ex change fur or venison with a white man for hay ; but this was not common. Then the hunters scattered out over the hills of Allegan and Barry. As an old settler said, \" The woods were alive with them.\" Every head of a family had a gun. Of the younger Indians some had guns, while others were still forced to content themselves with bows and arrows. But all were alike eager for the sport. They knew the drinking places and the salt-licks to which the deer resorted, and could often waylay and shoot them down with but slight exertion. But if his intended victims became too wary for easy slaughter, the son of the forest hesitated at no toils neces sary to accomplish his object. For, notwithstanding the apparent indolence and selfishness with which he abandoned the labors of the field to his squaws, he did not shirk his duty, \" as he understood it.\" That duty embraced the Nevertheless, the Indian ponies, though small, were hardy and sagacious beasts, well fitted for the service required of them, which was to carry their masters and occasionally a"], [48, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 40 _. , _ i __ TV.P mtched so as to make a square, permanent bucket, a hd load of tent-material, kettles, etc., from place to place.

The farewell rites being thus celebrated, the assembled thousands speedily embarked, and their hundreds of canoes were soon sweeping rapidly to the northward. If the hunters had had good fortune in this vicinity they would probably make their way directly to Mackinaw, but if not, then they would stop to hunt or fish at different points on the way. If the former was the case, they would take back with them those who had died during their stay in this region. These had been buried at various accustomed places. One was at \" Jenner's Rift,\" at the foot of the Allegan County fair-ground ; another on the site of the village of Saugatuck. The birch-bark, which was used for boat, sail, house, carpet, sap-bucket, and sugar-hogshead, was also employed as coffin and shroud ; for when a de parted Indian or squaw was to be buried, after a hole was excavated and the body placed in it, a covering of birch bark was laid over the corpse to preserve it from contact with the dirt with which the hole was then filled. In 1838, Right Rev. Samuel A. MeCoskry, Episcopal bishop of Michigan, proposed to Sagamaw and his band to locate themselves permanently on a tract of land and go to farming under the protection of the Episcopal Church. (The United States gave some aid to several churches to carry out such a plan in regard to various scattered bands of Indians.) After considerable discussion Sagamaw and his band agreed to the proposition, and in 1839 they took possession of a small tract purchased for their use, though in the name of Bishop MeCoskry, situated in the present township of Wayland, near the sheet of water now known as Selkrig Lake. They were placed under the charge of Rev. James Selkrig, and went to farming in a small way under his direction. Sagamaw was killed by a drunken relative in 1845, but Mr. Selkrig continued engaged in his self-imposed task until 1878, when he died. The band, now reduced to about seventy-five persons, still occupies the tract on which it entered in 1839. The farming of the Indians is not very thorough and their houses are far from elegant, yet they support themselves by their own labor, and bear a fair reputation for honesty and morality. A detailed account of the Selkrig mission is given in the township history of Wayland.\")\" If the intention was not to sail directly to Mackinaw, but to hunt or fish on their way, the dead were left behind. They were not abandoned, however. Sometimes they were lest till the end of the next winter's hunt ; some times a special visit was made for the purpose of removing them ; but removed to Mackinaw they always were.

In silence the long, floating column swept down the turbid stream, the hard, stoical faces of the Indians becoming yet more stern and solemn from the consciousness of their mournful errand. noble bearing, of great integrity, and in everyway a dignified gentle man. He was called a great orator among his people. He was a true friend to the whites. I have heard him make speeches to his people, and, although I could not understand him, his manner and voice were very interesting, and the effect of his speech on his people was very great. He was the only Indian that I ever saw who was polite and attentive to his squaw. When they came to the store at Schoolcraft to do their trading, he would help her off of her pony, and when they were ready to return he would place his hand on the ground by the side of her pony, and she would place one foot in it, and he would lift her with apparently great ease into her saddle, and no white man could have shown more respect and politeness. If he wished for any credit at the store, he had it and paid promptly. Any Indian that he told us it was safe to trust was sure to pay us. He always told us never to trust his son, Cha-na-ba, who was a very worthless fellow.\" Until about 1840 the annual visits of the Indians con tinued in full force. At that time the Pottawattamies were removed, in accordance with treaty stipulations, to territory beyond the Mississippi. By this time, too, the presence of so many white settlers had scared away much of the game, and the yearly attendance of the Ottawas began to dwindle in. numbers. It gradually fell off during the succeeding ten years, and since the close of that period the Mackinaw boats have scarcely been known on the streams of Allegan and Barry, and the Ottawa hunters have rarely chased the deer through the forests of those counties. \u25a0J\" The most prominent of the Selkrig band was Rev. Henry Jack son, an educated minister, but a full-blooded Indian. His Indian name was Bammenodenukaid or Storm-Cloud. He was a Chippewa by birth and a native of Canada, but resided among the Ottawas, while his business frequently called him to the home of the little band of Pottawattamies remaining on Xottawa Creek, about twenty miles south of the city of Battle Creek, of whom he was the interpreter and agent. The Detroit Post said of him at the time of his death : Besides the great body of the Ottawas who moved back and forth with the recurring seasons in the manner already described, there were some small bands which stayed in this region throughout the year, having a summer residence in some small openings where the squaws raised corn and beans, and removing a short distance for hunting purposes in the winter. The most prominent of these bands was the one of which \" Sagamaw\" or \" Saginaw\"* was the chief, \" He was well educated, and a very intelligent man. He once de livered a lecture in the Seventh-Day Adventists' church, in this city, upon 'The Manners and Customs of the Chippewas,' which drew a large audience, and which proved a highly entertaining and instruc tive lecture. He was probably better acquainted with the history and traditions of the Indians of Michigan than any other person in the State, and it is to be regretted that some of our State historians, or the secretary of the State Pioneer Society, did not secure these tradi tions and histories in writing before bis death.\" * This name has been given us both ways. AVe believe, however, that the former method is correct, and that he was the same chief who had formerly resided with his band on the reservation at Kalamazoo. That chief is thus described in a letter from A. H. Scott, of St. Joseph, Mich., dated Jan. 9, 1SS0, and published in the recently-issued his tory of Kalamazoo County : A. D. P. A'an Buren, Esq , of Kalamazoo County, has published the following regarding Jackson and his people: \" I well remember Jackson, or * Storm-Cloud.' He was a forcible speaker, earnest and pathetic in his appeals to his red brethren. His English education, and the knowledge which he had gained iu his in tercourse with the whites, had aided him much in his labors. One Sabbath morning I had gone with a party of young ladies and gen tlemen from the school district north of the mission, where I was then teaching. We arrived at an early hour, and, entering the log \"In regard to personal characteristics of any noted Indians, etc., I would say that the best specimen of an Indian that I ever saw in those early days was Sag-a-maw, the chief of all tho Pottawattamies in and about Kalamazoo County.

After the pioneers had fully begun the work of settle- ment, the events occurring in the territory under considera- tion were of course of a less remarkable character, and most of them are sufficiently noticed in the histories of the sepa- rate townships, or in those chapters of the general history devoted to various separate organizations. Only a brief and cursory survey is necessary of the general progress of the two counties during the past four decades. By the census of 1840 the population of Allegan County was seventeen hundred and eighty-three, and that of Barry County was ten hundred and seventy-eight. The people were still sorely distressed by the great financial disaster of 1837, although the first breath of returning prosperity was beginning to revive the country. There was at that time scarcely a framed house in the two counties, except a few in the village of Allegan. The village of Hastings, which had been designated for about six years as the seat of jus- tice of Barry County, and which had been settled four years, contained in 1840 but one framed house and four or five log ones. The settlements were scattered far apart through nearly the whole of Barry County and the eastern half of Allegan. The western part of the latter county had still no occu- pants except the Indians and wild animals, save in three or four localities, where saw-mills had been erected and a few laborers had located around them. During the succeeding ten years immigration went on slowly at first, and then with increasing rapidity. By the close of 1842 settlements had been made in all the town- ships of Barry, and by the end of 1850 all those of Alle- gan had been settled except Salem and Lee. The older townships had also been filled up by sturdy emigrants, until log houses and clearings of greater or less size were to be found on nearly every section of Barry County and of the eastern half of Allegan. In 1846, Rev. A. C. Van Ralta (commonly called Domi- nie Van Ralta), Mr. John Grotenhous, and Mr. Harm Kook arrived at Allegan, looking for a location for a com- pany of Hollanders who were seeking a home in the West. This company, numbering from three to four hun- dred, had set out from Holland, intending to locate in Penn sylvania. On arriving in that State, however, thinking the climate too warm for them and the land too dear,\u00b0they determined to go farther north and west. They accord ingly proceeded to St. Clair, Mich., whence the three gen tlemen before mentioned went ahead to select a suitable location. On their arrival at Allegau they visited Mrs. Elisha Ely, as her parents were natives of Holland and she could talk some in that language. She advised them to consult Jud\u00ab-e Kellogg, of Allegan, who was the agent for large tracts of Jan. 9, 1862. Robert McCnrty full bounty. S. L. Konkel Oct. 16, 1S62.

Previous to the organization of this county, wolf-slaugh- ter could only be rewarded by the slayers taking the scalps to Kalamazoo. For several years after the organization, also, the county paid no bounty. The first action taken by the board of supervisors on this subject was on the 8th day of July, 1839, when State bounties were awarded to the following persons : Bache (an Indian) $8.00 Samuel Hagar (two wolves) 16.00 Moses Durkee 8.00 The dates, recipients, and amounts of the bounties allowed during the next three years are as follows : Oct. 15, 1S39.

Barnum 8.00 On the 28th of December, 1842, the board resolved, \" That an additional bounty of five dollars be allowed for the killing of every full-grown wolf, and two dollars and a half on every wolfs whelp, killed within the county of Barry ;\" and in the October following the bounty on wolves was raised to $12.00, and on whelps to 86.00. The whole county bounty, however, was soon abolished, and only the State bounty was paid. In the supervisor accounts for 1843 occur the following names, to whom were granted wolf-certificates : I.

He recommended them to locate at the head of Black Bay. They adopted his recom mendation and conducted the colony to that place, where the city of Holland was founded. This was the beginning of the large emigration from Holland which, in the course of a few years, overflowed a great portion of Ottawa County and several townships in the northwestern part of Allegan. The advent of the Hollanders in the latter region is men tioned in the township histories. angry and excited condition which needs but a word to de velop into the most determined action. On the 14th of April, 1861, the spark was applied to the waiting magazine, and the whole North burst into a flame of patriotic fire. In the great contest of the next four years it is well known that the soldiers of Michigan stood in the very foremost rank, and among them those of Allegan and Barry were certainly quite equal to any of their peninsular compatriots. The story of their valor, their dangers, and their sufferings is told in the last chapters of the general history, which consist of sketches of all the regiments which contained any considerable representation from Allegan and Barry Counties, together with the names of the officers and men from those counties. By 1850 the population of Allegan County was five thou sand one hundred and twenty-five, while that of Barry County was five thousand and seventy-two. The former contained nearly three times as many as it had had in 1840, while the latter had almost five times as many as at that date. For several years aster the war the population increased with almost as much energy as in the old pioneer days. By the census of 1874 the population of Allegan Couuty was eighteen thousand eight hundred, and that of Barry County fourteen thousand four hundred and forty-one. When the country was released from the immediate duty of preserving its own existence, the people sprang with renewed energy to the task of developing the magnificent resources com mitted to their care. They swarmed westward almost as readily as ever. Many sought the fertile farming-land of Allegan and Barry ; many expended their energies on the pine forests which still overshadowed a considerable portion of the territory in question ; and by the census of 1870 the population of Allegan County had increased to thirty-two thousand one hundred and five, and that of Barry County to twenty-two thousand two hundred. Aster 1850 a marked change took place throughout the two counties. The energy and industry of the settlers had furnished a large part of them, not, indeed, with wealth, but with a moderate competence, and this resulted in the con stant change of log houses for framed ones throughout Barry County, the eastern part of Allegan County, and some portions of the western part. The change went on rapidly through the decade between 1850 and 1860, and by the latter year a majority of the residents of the two counties lived in framed houses. The picturesque but inconvenient old well-sweeps, which in the pioneer days were seen from afar beside every farm er's house, gave way to modern pumps, orchards were in full fruitage on every farm, and, in fact, the greater part of the two counties had been changed in less than thirty years from a wilderness to a land of pleasant homes. Before such a population the pines have gone down more rapidly than ever, and now there is scarcely a township in the two counties which has not been, to a great degree, denuded of those stately lords of northern forests. Along the shore of Lake Michigan, and for many miles eastward, the lumber business has been largely replaced by the cul ture of fruit, to which the soil and climate (tempered, as the latter is, by the breezes of the lake) are found admira bly adapted. Details regarding this business will be found in the histories of some of the western townships of Alle gan County. In 1860 the population of Allegan County was sixteen thousand and eighty-seven ; and that of Barry was thirteen thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight. The financial crisis of 1857 had somewhat checked the tide of prosperity, but it was so trivial in comparison with that of 1837 that old settlers hardly considered it as worthy of the name of crisis. The country was rapidly recovering from it, and all looked forward hopefully to a long era of prosperity and improvement. But in the autumn of 1860 a President was chosen who was unfavorable to the spread of human slavery over the territory previously free, and at once there came from the South murmurs of discontent and anger. How they swelled and increased through all that fateful winter, how State aster State fell away from its allegiance, how the whole South resounded with preparations for war, need not be recounted here. It is a part of the nation's history. The two counties which form the subject of this history of course suffered a serious check at the time of the great financial crisis of 1S73, but they promptly responded to the breezes of prosperity which swept over the land in 1879, and all the probabilities now point to a long period of mate rial prosperity. We now call the attention of our readers to various sketches describing the process of organization, showing the civil officers who have resided in the county, depicting the career of the Allegan and Barry regiments in the war for the Union, and setting forth various other matters which are necessarily given in independent form. Here, as elsewhere throughout the North, men looked on in amazement, hoping even to the last for peace, and deeming it impossible that the lunacy of secession could ever ripen into the open madness of armed rebellion. Few made any preparations for the event, yet all were in that"], [54, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 46 County, yet it was doubtless intended to do so, and those eight survey-townships seem to have been always considered, from that time till the organization of Allegan County, as a part first of St. Joseph and then of Kalamazoo County.

On the following day (Nov. 5, 1829) Kalamazoo and Barry Counties, and all the country lying north of the same which was attached to the county of St. Joseph, were formed by law into the township of Brady. On the 2d day of March, 1831, a law was approved forming the counties of Clinton, Ionia, Kent, Allegan, Ot tawa, Gratiot, Montcalm, Oceana, Saginaw, Midland, Glad wyn, Avenac, and Isabella. The fourth section reads as follows : \"That the country included within the following limits \u2014 to wit, south of the base-line and south of the line between townships 4 and 5 north, west of the line between ranges 10 and 11 west of the me ridian, and east of the shore of Lake Michigan \u2014 be and the same is hereby set off into a separate county by the name of Allegan.\" The four western ranges still remained attached to the township of Penn, in Cass County, and the two eastern ranges, as before stated, were treated as a part of St. Joseph County until the organization of Kalamazoo County (July 30, 1830), and subsequently as a part of Kalamazoo County. The first enactment which, nominally at least, brought the territory of Allegan and Barry Counties under civil ju risdiction was that passed by the Legislative. Council of the Territory of Michigan in November, 1826, which declared that all the country to which the Indian title had been extinguished by the treaty of Chicago should be attached to and compose a part of the county of Lenawee. On the 12th day of April, 1827, another act formed the territory thus annexed to Lenawee County into the township of St. Joseph. That township must have contained at least ten thousand square miles. On the 29th day of March, 1833, a law was approved which enacted \" that all that district of country which has been set off into a separate county by the name of Allegan shall be a township by the name of Allegan ;\" also \" that said township of Allegan shall be attached to the county of Kalamazoo for all legal purposes whatsoever.\" As the township thus formed comprised the whole county, we give here a copy of the record of the first town-meeting, taken from the original township-book, which was after wards used by the township of Otsego : ERECTION AND ORGANIZATION OF ALLEGAN COUNTY AND ITS TOWNSHIPS. \"The inhabitants of the Township of Allegan met on Saturday the 6th April, 1833, at the house of Samuel Foster, according to previous notice, and proceeded to organize, when Hull Sherwood was chosen moderator, and Cyrenius Thompson township clerk ; Charles Miles, supervisor; Ebenr. Sherwood, Calvin White, and D. A. Plumber were chosen assessors; Martin AV. Rowe was chosen collector; Giles Scott and H. C. White, overseers of the poor ; T. Aldrich, Norman Davis, and R.

Baker were chosen overseers of roads, and Abijah Cbiehester also overseer of roads; S. Foster, C. Miles, S. Thompson were chosen school inspectors. The meeting then adjourned, to be convened again at 10 O'C. a.m., on first Monday of April next. After the organization of the whole region acquired by the treaty of Chicago as the township of St. Joseph, as just narrated, the first change in the municipal relations of the territory of Allegan County was made by the law passed by the territorial council, and approved on the 4th of No- vember, 1829, which organized the counties of St. Joseph and Cass, and provided that Kalamazoo, Calhoun, Branch, Barry, and Eaton Counties,* and all the country north of township 4, north of the base-line, west of the principal meridian, south of the county of Mackinaw (as then formed) and east of the line between ranges 12 and 13, should be attached to and compose a part of the county of St. Joseph.

It will be observed that the meeting did not recommend any one for county register or treasurer. None of the survivors of that period recollect with certainty who were appointed to those offices, but from all the evidence, of which more will be said farther on, we are satisfied that Alexander L.

On the 6th of October, 1834, the Governor of the Ter ritory appointed Oshea Wilder, Cyrus Lovell, and Isaac E. Crary as commissioners to locate the county-seat of Allegan County, as was the practice at that day. Their report on making the location, and the Governor's proclamation con firming the same, cannot be found in the office of the Sec retary of State, but it is well known that the county-seat was duly located at Allegan village. \"STEVENS T.

In 1835 a considerable number of people located them selves at Allegan village, and in the summer the people of the county thought themselves strong enough to have a separate county organization. The matter was presented to the Legislative Council, and an act was duly passed organ izing the county. It is not published with the other terri torial laws, and we are not able to give the exact date of its passage, but we learn from the Secretary of State that one of the sections provided for the act's taking effect on the 1st day of September, 1835.

There was no contest in regard to any office, except that of representative to the Legislature from this county, and for this position the struggle was entirely sectional. Dr. Lintsford B. Coats was the candidate of the settlers of Otsego and Gun Plain, and that vicinity, while the proprietors and workmen who were making a begin ning at Allegan supported Elisha Ely. At the close of the election it was found that Dr. Coats had thirty votes and Mr. Ely thirty-one, and the latter was accordingly de clared elected. No county officers were chosen at this election. one may see by glancing at the first book of records ; but the above is the most plausible solution we can suggest. On the 23d day of March, 1836, an act of the State Legislature was approved, dividing the township and county of Allegan into four townships, as follows: Plainfield con tained survey-townships 1, 2, 3, and 4 north, in range 11 west ; now the civil townships of Gun Plain, Martin, Way land, and Leighton. Otsego comprised the same numbered townships in range 12 ; now Otsego, Watson, Hopkins, and Dorr. Allegan included the same numbered townships in ranges 13 and 14, being the present civil townships of Trowbridge, Allegan, Monterey, Salem, Cheshire, Pine Plains, Heath, and Overisel. Newark contained the sur vey-townships bearing the same numbers in ranges 15 and 16, and a small fraction of township 1 in range 17, its territory being now divided between the townships of Lee, Clyde, Manlius, Fillmore, Casco, Ganges, Saugatuck, and Laketown. In April, 1836, a county treasurer and a county register were elected by the people. Milo Winslow, the appointee of the Governor, was chosen treasurer, and to the best of our knowledge Joseph Fisk was elected register. Owing to the long time which has elapsed, and the mass of import- ant business which has occupied his attention, Col. Fisk himself does not recollect the exact date at which he entered on the office, nor is there any one else now living in Allegan County who is at all certain as to the facts. The books show that a number of the earliest entries were made by Mr. Ely or his deputy, Mr. Parkhurst, though the minute of the reception of each one was not dated and signed, as has since been the case. After that, for several months, closing about the last of June of that year, deeds and mortgages are marked as received for record, some- times by Joseph Fisk, and sometimes by A. L. Ely, and, what is more strange, the handwriting of the records made in the same book at this period are alternately in the hand- writing of the respective deputies of Messrs. Fisk and Ely. Now, that an election for treasurer and register was held in April, 1836, and also that there was some legal defect in the election or the method of conducting it, appear by the fact that in June of that year a law was passed by the State Legislature, legalizing the election of treasurer and register of Allegan County, in spite of any illegality in the election or the manner of canvassing the votes. Immedi ately after that, Mr. Ely ceased entirely to act as register, all the records bearing Col. Fisk's name until the close of the year. Then Mr. Ely again took the office, by virtue of his election in November, 1836. Town-meetings were duly held in the four townships in April following, and the board of supervisors met for the first time on the 4th day of the ensuing October. Its pro ceedings on that occasion are given in Chapter XIV. Since that time there have been twenty new townships organized in Allegan County, and several other changes made. Until 1852 such organizations and changes were directed by the State Legislature. From that time until 1860 the board of supervisors had full authority over those subjects. Control over them was then resumed by the Legislature, but no townships have been formed in Allegan County since that time. The following is the record : Manlius was formed from Newark on the 6th day of March, 1838, consisting of township 3 \"north, race 15 west, \u2014 its present territory.* Martin, formed from Plainfield March 22, 1839, com prised townships 2, 3, and 4 (Martin, Wayland, and Leigh ton). Trowbridge, taken from Allegan Feb. 16, 1842, included townships 1 in range 13, and 1 in range 14 (Trowbridge and Cheshire). Watson, taken from Otsego Feb. 16, 1842, embraced townships 2, 3, and 4 in range 12 (Watson, Hopkins, and Dorr). From all this, we infer that Mr. Ely was first appointed register by the Governor ; that Col. Fisk was elected to the same office in April, but that, on account of some legal defect in the election, Mr. Ely still claimed to be the register ; that both acted from that time until the passage of the law be- fore mentioned, when Col. Fisk took entire control. Ap- parently, the first deeds were not copied when received, or were copied into a temporary book, and when the contest was decided, each of the contestants, or his deputy, copied the deeds he had received into the present book of records. There are some deeds and mortgages which are marked as received by Col. Fisk before the 1st of April, but these may have been some which Mr. Ely, in the confusion of that period, had failed to record, and which, when they came into Col. Fisk's possession, he dated back to the time of their reception by Ely, as we learn from other evidence was sometimes done. Wayland was organized on the 9th day of March, 1843, being taken from Martin, and being composed of townships 3 and 4 in range 11 (Wayland and Leighton). The name of Plainfield was changed to Gun Plain, March 19, 1845. Ganges was organized on the 16th day of March, 1847, being formed from Newark, and comprising townships 1 and 2 in range 16, and a small fraction of township 1 in range 17 (now Ganges and Casco). Dorr, formed from Watson on the 16th day of March, 1847, embraced townships 3 and 4 in range 12 (now Dorr and Hopkins). Monterey, taken from Allegan on the 16th day of March, 1847, was composed of townships 3 and 4 in range 13, and * Township 4, range 14 (Fillmore), was taken from Newark and annexed lo Manlius by the Legislature, but was subsequently given a separate organization, as mentioned a little farther on. The whole matter is involved in much confusion, as any"], [57, "ORGANIZATION 49 of township 4 in range 14 (now Monterey, Salem, and Overisel).* the Alleghanies it has long been common to form counties first and put the people into them afterwards. In accord ance with this custom, the Legislative Council of Michigan passed an act, which was approved on the 29th day of October, 1829, establishing the counties of Washtenaw, Ingham, Eaton, Barry, Jackson, Calhoun, Kalamazoo, Van Buren, Hillsdale, Branch, St. Joseph, Cass, and Berrien. Section 4, with which alone we are especially concerned, reads as follows : Leighton, erected on the 9th day of March, 1848, was taken from Wayland, and was composed of township 4 in range 11, its present territory. Fillmore, organized on the 15th day of March, 1849, was formed from Manlius, and comprised township 4, range 15,f its present territory. Pine Plains was formed from Allegan and Newark on the 28th day of March, 1850, comprising townships 1 and 2 in, range 15 (now Lee and Clyde), and all of township 2 in range 14, west of the Kalamazoo. The part of the last named township east of the river was subsequently an nexed to Pine Plains, the limits of which now correspond to those of the survey-township just mentioned. \"That so much of the country as lies north of the base-line and south of the line between townships 4 and 5 north of the base-line, west of the line between ranges 6 and 7 west of the meridian, and east of the line between ranges 11 and 12 west of the meridian, be and the same is hereby set off into a separate county, and the name thereof shall be Barry.\" Of the thirteen counties established by this act, eight (Jackson, Calhoun, Van Buren, Ingham, Eaton, Branch, Berrien, and Barry) were named respectively after the President, the Vice-President, and the six cabinet minis ters of that date. Barry received its appellation from the Hon. William T. Barry, then Postmaster-General under President Jackson. J Cheshire, formed from Trowbridge on the 2d day of April, 1851, consisted of survey-township 1, range 14, as it does at the present time. Heath was erected on the 18th day of March, 1851, and consisted of all of survey-townships 2 and 3, range 14, east of the Kalamazoo. Its boundaries have since been made to correspond with those of survey-township 3, range 14. By an act approved on the 4th day of November follow ing, the newly-formed counties of Branch, Kalamazoo, Cal houn, and Barry, and all that tract lying north of the north line of the townships numbered 4 in the several ranges, west of the principal meridian, east of the west line of range 12, and south of the south line of the county of Mackinaw, was temporarily attached to St. Joseph County for legislative and judicial purposes. The townships formed after this time were erected and organized by the board of supervisors. Hopkins was established on the 29th day of December, 1852, being taken from Dorr, and comprising township 3, range 12, as it still does. Casco, formed from Ganges Dec. 27, 1844, embraced then as now township 1, range 16, and fractional township 1 (about three sections) in range 17. On the following day (Nov. 5, 1829) a law was approved enacting that Kalamazoo and Barry Counties, and the tract, belonging to no county, described in the preceding para graph, should form a township by the name of Brady ; the first town-meeting being directed to be held at the house of Abram I. Shaver, in the south part of Kalamazoo County. Salem was erected on the 10th day of October, 1855, being formed from Monterey and comprising township 4, range 13, \u2014 its present territory. Overisel was formed from Fillmore on the 14th day of October, 1856, and comprised township 4, range 14, \u2014 its present territory. Barry County was not formed into a separate township until the 24th day of March, 1836, when an act of the State Legislature was approved, which contained the follow ing sections : Laketown came into existence on the 13th day of Oc tober, 1858, being taken from Newark, and comprising fractional township No. 4, in range 16 (about twenty-two sections), which still constitutes its territory. Lee was taken from Pine Plains on the 4th day of Jan uary, 1859, being composed of township 1, range 15, as is still the case. \"Sec. 50.

Spaulding ; Commissioners of Highways, Ephraim Block, Eli Waite, and William Lewis; Justices of the Peace, George Brown, Henry Leonard, and Isaac Otis ; Collector, Ambrose Mills ; School Commissioner, Benjamin Dibble ; Directors of the Poor, no record ; Constables, Timothy G. Johnson, Isaac Messor, and Ambrose Mills. The election was duly held on the first Monday of April, and the following officers were duly elected : Probate Judge, Stephen V. R. York ; Associate Judges, Nathan Barlow and Isaac Otis ; Sheriff, Willard Hayes ; County Clerk, Thomas B. Bunker ; Register, Abner C. Parmelee ; Treasurer, Chas. W. Spaulding; County Commissioners, Nelson Barnum, John Bowne, and Calvin G. Hill; County Surveyor, Calvin G. Hill ; Coroners, Calvin Brown and Henry Leonard. By an act passed on the 6th day of March, 1838, the county of Barry was divided into four townships, each com prising one-fourth of its territory. Survey-townships 1 and 2 north, in ranges 9 and 10 west (now Orangeville, Prairieville, Hope, and Barry), were formed into the civil township of Barry ; numbers 3 and 4 in the same ranges (now Thornapple, Yankee Springs, Irving, and Rutland) were organized as Thornapple ; 1 and 2, in ranges 7 and 8 (Baltimore, Johnstown, Maple Grove, and Assyria), re ceived the name of Johnstown ; while townships 3 and 4 in the same ranges (Carlton, Hastings, Woodland, and Cas tleton) became, under the same act, the civil township of Hastings. These townships duly held town-meetings under the law (accounts of which will be found in the townships still bearing the four names above given), and thus entered on their organic existence. Before the time for holding the election \u2014 namely, on the 22d day of March \u2014 the number of townships in the county had been increased to five by the organization of Yankee Springs, with boundaries embracing survey-township 3, in range 9, and the same numbered township in range 10, being the south half of the old civil township of Thorn apple. Its first town-meeting was held on the first Monday of April (the same day as the first election of county officers), when the county of Barry entered on its organic existence, with five subordinate organizations within its limits. About two weeks later (on the 17th of April) still an other township was erected and organized, by the name of Irving, which comprised survey-townships 3 and 4, in range 9, being the west half of both Thornapple and Yankee Springs, which were thus reduced to their present limits. The act organizing Irving was not to take effect until the 31st day of March, 1840. On the 30th of March, 1840, the law was repealed. The people apparently did not hear of the repeal before the first Monday of April, for on that day they elected a full set of township officers, some of whom, at least, proceeded to exercise their functions as such. On the 18th of March, 1841, the original act establishing Irving was revived by law, and the official acts of the township officers just mentioned were made valid. It was not until the 15th day of March, 1839, one year and nine days after the formation of the four townships before mentioned, that Barry County was duly organized by an act of the Legislature. As this law is the foundation of and warrant for all legal and municipal proceedings in the county since that time, we give a copy of it entire : \"AN ACT TO ORGANIZE THE COUNTY OF BARRY. \" Section 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa tives of the Slate of Michigan, That the county of Barry be, amt the same is, hereby organized, and the inhabitants thereof entitled to all the rights and privileges to which, by law, the inhabitants of the other counties of this State are entitled. Since then, besides those already mentioned, the follow ing ten townships and the city of Hastings have been organ ized, and the following changes of name have been made : \" Sec. 2. All suits, prosecutions, and other matters now pending before any court or before any justice of the peace of the county to which the said county of Barry is now attached for judicial purposes [KalamazooJ shall be prosecuted to final judgment and execution, and all the taxes heretofore levied shall be collected in the same manner as though this act had not been passed. On the 20th day of March, 1841, the township of Spaulding was organized by the Legislature, being taken from Barry, and comprising survey townships 1 and 2 north, in range 10 west. Its name was changed to Prairieville by an act of the Legislature approved March 9, 1843. The township of Castleton was formed from Hastings by an act approved Feb. 16, 1842, being composed of survey township 3, in range 7, which is its present territory. \"Sec. 3. That the sheriff of the county of Barry, under the direc tion of the commissioners of said county, shall provide a convenient place for holding courts in said county, at or near the county-seat, until pu jlic buildings shall be erected."], [59, "EARLY SUPERVISORS AND COMMISSIONERS. 51 Woodland was also formed from Hastings on the same day as Castleton, having the same limits as now, \u2014 those of survey-township No. 4, in range 7. \" State of Michigan, \"\\ County of Allegan, > Board of Supervisors. ) Carlton was likewise taken from Hastings (which was thus reduced to its present limits, except that the city of Hastings has been since formed from it) on the 16th of February, 1842, embracing survey-township No. 4, in range 8, which is its present territory. Assyria was formed from Johnstown by an act approved Feb. 29, 1844, then comprising survey-townships Nos. 1 and 2, in range 7, now Assyria and Maple Grove. On the 4th day of May, 1846, the township of Orange ville was formed from Prairieville (which was thus reduced to its present limits), comprising then as now survey-town ship No. 2, in range 10. Maple Grove was formed from Assyria by an act ap proved March 25, 1846, comprising survey-township 2, in range 7 (its present territory), and reducing Assyria to its present size. Rutland was formed from Irving by an act approved March 16, 1847, comprising survey-township No. 3, in range 9, both townships having after the passage of the act the same territory as now. The name of the township of Yankee Springs was changed to Gates in 1848, but was very properly changed back to its original appellation by an act approved March 15, 1849. The township of Baltimore was formed from Johnstown by an act approved March 14, 1849, the latter township being thus reduced to its present boundaries, and those of the former being then as now those of township 2, in range 8. The last township organized in the county was Hope, which was taken from Barry at the session of the Legis lature in 1850. It comprised the same territory that it now does, viz., survey-township No. 2, in range 9, while Barry, which had once comprised the whole county, was by the act of separation reduced to its present limits, those of township 1 in the same range. The city of Hastings was formed from the township of Hastings by an act of the Legislature approved March 11, 1871. Although it is surrounded by the township, yet it is in a legal sense entirely separate from it, and constitutes the seventeenth of the distinct organizations comprised in the county of Barry.

ALLEGAN COUNTY. The first record of the proceedings of the supervisors of Allegan County is as follows : \" On this 4th day of October, 1836, being the first Tues day of the said month, the day appointed by the Laws of this State for the Annual meeting of this Board, the fol lowing persons, Supervisors of the several townships in the said county, are convened in the village of Allegan \u2014 that is to say : Hull Sherwood, Jr., Supervisor of the township of Otsego ; Alexander L. Ely, Supervisor of the township of Allegan ; Daniel A. Plummer, Supervisor of the town ship of Newark ; John Murphy, Supervisor of the town ship of Plainfield. \" Hull Sherwood, Jr., is chosen chairman of this Board, and Hovey K. Clarke, of the township of Allegan, is chosen clerk, and duly sworn.\" At this first meeting bills were audited to the amount of $28, and it was voted that orders on the treasurer should be issued in favor of the several parties. The supervisors presented the assessment-rolls of their several townships for examination, and the board proceeded to ascertain whether the valuations had been made in just proportion in all the townships in the county. It was then ordered \" That the valuations in the townships of Otsego and Plainfield be confirmed ; that there be added to the valua tions in the township of Allegan twenty-two per centum, and that there be added to the valuations in the township of Newark fifteen per centum.\" The board then adjourned to meet on the following day at nine o'clock. At the meeting held pursuant to adjournment it was or dered \" That there be raised by tax upon the county the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars to be expended in repairs on bridges in the county as follows : For the bridge across Gun River, $30 ; for the bridge across Pine Creek, 875 ; for the bridge across Schrobel Creek, $75 ; for bridges between Allegan and Newark, $75.\" Also, \" That there be raised by tax upon the county the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars for a county contin gent fund.\" This order was reconsidered, and three hun dred and fifty-seven dollars was inserted in the place of two hundred and fifty. Still later, at the same meeting, it was ordered that four hundred dollars should be inserted in place of three hundred and fifty-seven. This last amount was not changed, and constituted the contingent fund of the county for that year. On application of the supervisors of the several town ships, it was ordered that the following sums be assessed for township expenses: On the township of Allegan, one hundred and fifty dollars ; on the township of Otsego, seventy-five dollars ; on the township of Plainfield, fifty dollars ; on the township of Newark, seventy-five dollars. A small amount of other business was transacted, and then the board adjourned without day. A meeting of the board of supervisors was held on the 7th day of March, 1837, at the office of the county clerk, in Allegan, at which the chairman and clerk were author ized to procure and prepare some suitable place to confine prisoners."], [60, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 52 \"Barry County, j Commissioners* Record. \" State of Michigan. > At a meeting held in November of the same year it was unanimously resolved that one hundred dollars should be raised to constitute a poor-fund, and also that the sheriff should be authorized to procure a suitable place for the confinement of debtors and criminals ; provided, the ex pense should not exceed one hundred dollars for one year. At the same meeting the clerk was directed to put up public notices in three places in each township, requesting the qualified electors at the next town-meetings to authorize the board of supervisors, by a vote of said electors, to borrow on the credit of the county such sum as the body should deem proper, not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting county buildings, pursuant to an act of the Legislature passed March 20, 1837. \"At the first meeting of commissioners-elect for the county of Barry, held at the county-seat, to wit, the village of Hastings in said county, on the thirteenth day of April in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine,\u2014 present, Calvin G. Hill and John Bowne,\u2014 \" Three numbers were prepared by the clerk, and the commissioners present drew for the term of time for holding their said office. AVhere upon it was found that Calvin G. Hill drew for one year, John Bowne for two years, leaving tbe term of three years to Nelson Barnum, who was absent by reason of sickness. \" The commissioners present then took the oath of office prescribed by law, and organized the board by choosing Calvin G. Hill chair man for the legal term, and then proceeded to business. \" On motion, Resolved, That John J. Nichols, of Barry, John AV. Bradley, of Yankee Springs, and AVilliam P. Bristol, of Johnstown, be and are hereby appointed superintendents of the poor, in and for the county of Barry, for the term of one year from the date of their said appointment. On motion, the board adjourned without date.\" A bounty of five dollars was authorized to be paid by the county treasurer for each wolf that should thereafter be taken and killed therein ; the proof of the same to be a certificate of a justice of the peace, based upon the oath of the claimant or a competent witness, and on the produc tion of the scalp. It will be seen that the only business done at the first meeting was the appointment of superintendents of the poor, but on the 8th of July, 1839, pursuant to public notice, the board convened for the purpose of examining the assessment-rolls of the several townships and other business. After a proper examination of the rolls it was resolved, \" That to the township of Yankee Springs twenty per cent, be added in order to produce an equal relative valuation in the several townships in the county.\" The following is an abstract of the assessment-rolls in each of the several townships in the county of Barry for the year 1839 : Townships.

Aster a three days' session and the transaction of con siderable other business, the board adjourned \"sine die.\" By the provisions of a law passed by the Legislature in 1838, the powers and duties of the board of supervisors were transferred to a board of county commissioners. The first commissioners of Allegan County were Oshea Wilder, of Newark ; Silas F. Littlejohn, of Allegan ; and Hull Sherwood, of Otsego. These officers were duly quali fied on the 20th of December, 1838. The board then organized, with Silas F. Littlejohn as chairman, and ad journed to meet at Allegan on the 15th of January, 1839. The business of the county was transacted by the new board until the office of county commissioner was abolished and that of supervisor was revived, by an act of the Legis lature approved Feb. 10, 1842. The powers which had been exercised by the commissioners were then resumed by the supervisors of the county, whose first meeting under the new law was held July 4, 1842. As they were not all present, the board adjourned until the next day, when the townships were represented as follows : Lintsford B. Coats, Otsego; Archibald Jameson, Plainfield; Joel Brown son, Martin ; Stephen A. Morrison, Newark ; John H. Billings, Manlius ; Amos D. Dunning, Watson ; John Weare, Trowbridge; Alexander L. Ely, Allegan. Alex ander L. Ely was elected chairman for the ensuin\u00b0* year. From that time until the present the board has exercised the legislative authority of the county. An account of its action in regard to the poor-farm and the erection of county buildings is given in Chapter XVI.

The first term of the Circuit Court for the county of Barry was held in May, 1840, in the school-house in the village of Hastings, which was situated on the southeast corner of Jefferson and Court Streets. The following \" There being no further business, the court then adjourned without day. \"Alexander L. Ely, Clerk, by Elijah G.

At the November term of the same year \" George Y. Warner was appointed prose cuting attorney during the present term of court.\" The first bill in chancery was filed Sept. 29, 1849, by Johnson & Higley, solicitors for the plaintiff in the case of Bela Turner vs. Michael Spencer et al. An order to take the bill as confessed was entered Jan. 9, 1850. Hon. Epaphroditus Ransom, who held all the early cir cuits in Allegan County, was a native of Hampshire Co., Mass. He graduated at the Northampton law-school in 1825, removed to Michigan about 1833, and was admitted to the bar at Kalamazoo in 1834. In 1836 he was ap pointed to the bench of the Supreme Court, and became chief justice in 1843. In 1848 here signed to accept the office of Governor of the State. He was succeeded in this circuit by the Hon. Charles W. Whipple, who presided, for the first time in this county, at the May term, 1849. His last term here was held in Oc tober, 1851. The next circuit judge was the Hon. Abner Pratt, whose first term in this county was held in April, 1852, and his last one in May, 1856. Upon the organization of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, the Hon. Flavius J. Littlejohn was elected to the position of circuit judge. He first presided at the July term, 1858.

The old county courts were abolished in April, 1833, the circuit courts of the Territory of Michigan taking their business and jurisdiction. It was re-established in 1846, with one county judge and a second judge, who officiated in the absence of the former. The first session held in the county of Allegan was after the re establishment, and was held April 5, 1847, by Hon. Henry H. Booth, county judge, in the Methodist chapel (then occupied as a court-room) in the village of Allegan. No business was brought before the court at this session, and it was adjourned without day. The first official act of Judge Booth was the appointment, on the 10th of April, 1847, of E. Bourne Bassett as county clerk, in place of N. Manson, Jr., deceased. During the continuance of the county courts, Judges Henry H. Booth and Abram J. Dedrick presided over that of Allegan County.

Barry County, having been organized after the old county court was abolished, had no such tribunal until 1847, when county courts were re-established throughout the State, each having one county judge and one second judge. The first term of the Barry County court was held by Hon. Hiram Greenfield, county judge, in April, 1847. The following from the records will show the organization : After the court had been duly opened by the sheriff, the grand jury was called, and the following persons ap peared and were sworn : John W. Bradley, Nelson Coman, Charles W. Spaulding, George Brown, John I. Nichols, Samuel Case, Cleveland Ellis, Lorenzo Mudge, Israel H. Cooper, Phineas Coe, Nelson N. Sprague, Jared S. Rogers, Orris Barnum, Frederick Ingram, Samuel Wollotson, Cal vin G. Hill, Charles Paul, Stephen Collier, and Hiram F. Merrill. They retired after receiving the charge of the court. \" On the first Monday of April, it being the fifth day of said month, the county court for the county of Barry convened at the clerk's office, in the village of Hastings, at ten o'clock in the forenoon of said day, for the purpose of organizing and transacting such business as might come before the same. Court was opened by proclamation of the sheriff, and duly organized. Three appealed cases were decided by the court. In two of them judgments were entered in favor of the re spective plaintiffs, while one was decided in favor of the defendant, and one case was continued by consent of both parties. \" The office of I. A. Holbrook, in the village of Hastings, had been designated by the board of supervisors as the court-house. \" There being no further business, the court adjourned to meet again the first Monday in May.\" The first case in which a petit jury was called was that of John Patten vs. Lawrence Van De Walker, in which the following persons were sworn as petit jurors : Demie Bennett, Hiram J. Kenfield, John Hangun, George Fuller, Anson Seely, William B. Shorod, William M. Paul, Mager Mott, Albert C. Hill, Rufus Cowles, Estus Rich, and Charles V. Patrick. The jury, having heard the testimony and received the charge of the court, and having retired and duly deliberated thereon, returned into court and ren dered a verdict in favor of the defendant. The county court was finally abolished in 1853. The following is a list of the attorneys who have been admitted to the bar in the county of Barry, with date of admission.

The record of the court was read, corrected, and signed in open court on the 6th day of May, 1840, by Hon. Epaphro ditus Ransom, presiding judge. Judge Ransom held his last term of court in Barry County in April, 1847. The next circuit judge who held court in Barry County was the Hon. George Martin. He was elected on the 7th of April, 1851, and presided for the first time in this county at the August term of that year. He served a full term, holding his last session here in October, 1857.

At the annual meeting of the supervisors on the 15th day of October, 1846, the sum of five hundred dollars was voted to erect a fire-proof building for county officers, and on the 8th day of January, 1847, the following resolution was adopted : COUNTY BUILDINGS AND POOB-PAEMS.

That said building be of the size of 20 feet by 30 feet; to contain three rooms, with a hall part way across the building, to be built of brick with tin roof.\" Henry H. Booth, Ralph R. Mann, and David D. Davis were appointed a building committee, with power to draw plans and specifications, advertise for proposals, make a con tract, and accept the building when completed. The contract was let to Thomas M. Russell, who erected the building the following summer, and at the session of the board in October of that year the building committee reported the completion of the structure, which report was accepted and adopted. The total cost of the build ing was five hundred and twenty-eight dollars and fifty cents. It was of brick, twenty feet by forty (the original plan of twenty by thirty being found to be too small), and one story high. There was a hall part way along the north side, the entrance to which was at the west end of the building. The probate judge's office was on the right of the entrance, in the southwest corner, that of the treasurer being situated next east. The office occupied by the county clerk and the register extended entirely across the east end of the building. The county clerk was authorized at this meeting to fit up that part of the county-building previously occupied for offices so as to be a convenient room for holding courts, etc. ALLEGAN COUNTY BUILDINGS. The reader will have observed in Chapter XIV. that the board of supervisors of Allegan County, at their meeting in November, 1837, endeavored to obtain a vote of the people authorizing the sum of fifteen thousand dollars to be raised for the purpose of erecting public buildings. There is no record to show whether this vote was taken or not, but, as nothing further was done by the board in reference to it, it is fair to presume that the proposition was voted down or was not acted upon. At a session of the board in the fall of 1851, Messrs. Kellogg & Bailey were appointed a committee to inquire as to the facilities for effecting a loan, and as to the propriety of raising a tax for the purpose of building a court-house, also to draw a plan of such house and to estimate the ex pense of the same. The next action tending toward that object was taken at a special meeting of the board of commissioners held on the 25th day of April, 1839, when the following resolution was adopted : At the next annual meeting, held on the 14th day of October, 1852, the following resolution was adopted by eleven yeas to six nays : \"Resolved, That S. F. Littlejohn be authorized to procure a plan for a convenient jail, to be constructed of wood, and a jail house for the jailer, to contain a convenient room for county purposes, the ex pense of said buildings not to exceed S1200, and receive proposals for the construction.\" \" Resolved, That the present board of supervisors order the sum of $2000, to be assessed upon tho taxable property of the county of Al legan, for the purpose of building a court-house in the village of Al legan ; the same to be submitted to the people for their approval or rejection at the next annual township election.\" On the 7th day of June, the same year, the board exam ined the proposals for a jail and a jailer's house, submitted under the foregoing resolution. Six proposals were pre sented, the highest being for the sum of two thousand and ninety-five dollars, the lowest for sixteen hundred dol lars. After due examination and consultation the plan and proposal presented by S. F. Littlejohn were adopted, and a contract for the erection of the proposed building was made with him. On the 27th of February, 1840, the county building, then completed, was examined and accepted, and Mr. Littlejohn was released from his contract. The cost of the building was fifteen hundred and sixty-seven dollars and ninety-eight cents. Some extra work was done after There is no record of any action of the people on this subject, but on the 4th day of January, 1853, a resolu tion passed the board directing that a committee of three should be appointed to examine the brick church (Bap tist), and to report their opinion as to its value and the practicability of purchasing the same for a court-house. The committee appointed consisted of Messrs. McMartin, Day, and Wheeler. At the same meeting Messrs. Bassett, McMartin, and Field were appointed a committee to nego tiate with the Baptist society for the purchase of their house and lot. On the 30th day of March, 1854, this last committee re-"], [65, "COUNTY BUILDINGS AND POOR-FARMS. 57 ported that they had concluded negotiations with the Bap tist society for the purchase of their house and lot, for the sum of two thousand dollars. The committee on county buildings was instructed to prepare the building for use, which was accomplished at a cost of eleven hundred and six dollars and sixty-three cents. The proposition was voted upon at the next election, and was lost. On the 15th of January, 1869, the committee of the supervisors on county buildings recommended the erection of a fire-proof building for the county offices, but nothing further was then done in relation to the matter. At the January meeting of the board in 1859, the com mittee on county buildings reported the necessity of erect ing a new county jail, and four days later a resolution was adopted submitting to the people the question whether the sum of five thousand dollars should be expended for that purpose. A committee was also appointed to procure plans and estimates for the proposed structure. The people duly authorized its erection. On the 4th of January, 1870, a committee was ap pointed by the supervisors to visit the county buildings of Kent County, at Grand Rapids, and then to report a plan for the county offices of Allegan County. This committee performed its duties, and on the 7th of January presented a report, which was duly adopted. It also presented two plans for the consideration of the board. The committee recommended that the site of the court-house should be in the centre of the public square, and that of the county offices on the south side of the court-house, twenty feet from the line of Hubbard Street. On the 2d of May, the same year, Messrs. Jameson, Chichester, Henderson, Strong, and Raplee were appointed a committee to investigate and report in regard to a site for a jail. This committee reported the next day in favor of locating the edifice on the lot now known as the court house lot, and the location was duly adopted by the board. A building committee was then chosen (consist ing of Messrs. Leonard Bailey, Ira Chichester, and Eli D. Granger), with instructions to advertise for proposals for the erection of a brick building with stone foundations, forty feet by fifty in size and two stories high. Twenty nine feet on the west side were to be finished as a jail, with four cells below, each eight feet by twelve, and six cells above, each eight feet by ten. The front part of the building was to be the jailer's residence. Ira Chichester, Alanson Case, and Ira Chaffee were ap pointed a building committee to superintend the construc tion of the proposed building, provided the electors of the county should vote the money to build the same. The board also authorized the county treasurer to raise a tem porary loan of five thousand dollars, to be used for the purpose above mentioned, with the same proviso regarding the sanction of the people. In one of the early meetings of the same session (Janu ary, 1870), Messrs. Hardin, Mincklin, and Crawford were appointed a committee to request the prosecuting attorney to investigate the title to the public square. No detailed report is given of the result of this investigation, but a search in the register's office shows the following to be the facts in the case: On the 23d of June, 1837, Samuel Hubbard and Charles C. Trowbridge, proprietors of the village of Allegan, recorded a plat of that village in the register's office of Allegan County. The Public Square is laid out on that plat. On the 7th of April, 1847, two deeds were recorded in the register's office, \u2014 one from Samuel Hubbard and Charles C. Trowbridge to the board of supervisors of Allegan County, the other from the president, recorder, and trustees of the village of Allegan to the board of supervisors. Some time elapsed before the work was commenced, and there are few records of its progress, but on the 9th of January, 1862, the committee reported that the new jail was in the possession of the sheriff, that they had effected a settlement with the contractor, and that the cost of the building was four thousand eight hundred and ninety dol lars. On the 4th of January, 1867, the committee on public buildings, in the board of supervisors, made a report, of which the first part reads as follows : \"To the Board of Supervisors: \"Your Committee on County buildings ask leave to report That they have examined the buildings occupied for County offices and find the same inadequate and insufficient for that purpose. These deeds both recite that they dispose of \" all right, title, and interest of as much of the public square as is laid out and applied for that purpose on the village plat as may be wanted or used for county buildings and necessary appurtenances, and this grant is for no other purpose.\" These conveyances doubtless make the title of the county to so much of the public square at Allegan village as may be necessary for county buildings absolutely perfect. \"That the Building is not of sufficient capacity to properly ac commodate the several county officers and the people who have official business to transact at said offices. That the building has become dilapidated, and the increasing demands and business of the several offices requires that a new building should be erected, more commo dious, and so situated and arranged as to afford greater protection and security for the public records, papers, and property left and deposited therein. \"Your Committee have also examined the condition of the Court- House, and are of the opinion that the same is not what will soon be required for the growing business of the County, and is not provided with proper and convenient Jury Rooms, and other accommodations usuul and proper for a Court-House.*' At the October session of 1870 the committee on county buildings reported that they had examined the building and offices in which the public records are kept, and found them extremely unsafe, the building being, in fact, in danger of falling down, and the records and maps being more or less damaged by every heavy storm which occurred. Other reasons were given at length, and the committee recommended that a court-house should be built with rooms in it for the county offices, and that the sum of twenty four thousand dollars should be raised by tax upon the county, but that the question of raising such tax be sub mitted to the people. During the same session a resolution was adopted direct ing the submission to the people of Allegan County at the next annual town-meeting the question whether the sum of s"], [66, "58 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. The county offices, previous to 1841, were kept at either the residences or business-places of the officers. At that time the jail was completed and the offices of the clerk and register, judge of probate, and treasurer were thenceforward kept in the basement of the jailer's house until the comple tion of the old fire-proof building in 1846, when they were removed to that building. six thousand dollars should be raised in 1871 for the pur pose of erecting county offices. The question was so sub mitted, and was decided in the affirmative. The building was erected on the public square, and is a neat and substantial edifice of brick, forty feet by forty-two, and two stories high. It contains a hall through the centre, and offices on each side. On the 1st of January, 1872, the committee on county offices reported the cost of the structure at that time as seven thousand four hundred and sixty-one dollars and ninety-seven cents. On the 18th of October the same year they reported the further amount expended for work on and about the new building, and for furniture and fixtures in it, at two thousand and ninety-nine dollars and twenty eight cents, making a total of nine thousand five hundred and sixty-one dollars and twenty-five cents. The committee on public buildings of the board of super visors, appointed in 1870 to superintend the erection of a building for the county offices and the grading of the site for it, found the public square about eight feet higher on the north side than at present. It was soon after graded down to its present condition, and now slopes from the centre two or three feet to the north line. ALLEGAN COUNTY POOR-HOUSE AND FARM. The board of supervisors, in November, 1837, passed a resolution to raise six hundred dollars by tax, one hundred dollars of which should constitute a poor-fund. This is the first official action in reference to paupers. Bill No. 31, of the county audits of 1838, debits the county as follows: The offices were first occupied by the county officers on the 1st of January, 1872, the county clerk and judge of probate occupying the upper floor, and the register and treasurer the first floor. LOCATION OF COURT-ROOM AND PUBLIC OFFICES. \"To Moses Hawks, a director of the poor, for examining a pauper, $1. In the records of the board of supervisors for 1838 the following appropriations are to be found : \" To Moses Hawks for the support of John Hansel, a county pauper, from Oct! 14 to Nov. 10, 1838, $19.29.\" \"To A. L. Ely, For the use of School-House for the circuit court of this County previous to 1837, $4.00. Another bill, dated December 24tb, of the same year, makes a similar charge : \"To the Dist. Board of School District No. 1, in the Township of Allegan, For the use of School-room for holding courts in the years 1837 and 1838, $28.00. \"To Moses Hawks, for keeping county pauper from November 10th to 22d, $5 per week, $8.59.\" \" To Henry Booher, for use of room for Grand Jury at fall term of Circuit Court, $4.00. At a meeting of the county commissioners, on the 15th day of November, 1839, a resolution passed the board to abolish the distinction between township and county poor, and providing that all the poor in the county should become a general charge. At that time Elisha Ely, of Allegan, John W. Watson, of Plainfield, and George Y. Warner, of Allegan, were appointed superintendents of the poor. By the first annual report of the superintendents, pre- sented October 27, 1840, it would appear that but little business had been before them, as the report shows that only three dollars and twenty cents more than their salaries had been expended. No further action in reference to the county poor is shown by the record until Jan. 3, 1849, when a committee was appointed by the board to confer with the superintendents of the poor as to the best method of disposing of paupers. It reported in favor of instructing the superintendents to give notice publicly for a reasonable time that they would receive sealed proposals for keeping the whole of the county poor. The report was accepted and adopted. At a meeting of the supervisors, held on the 5th of Jan- uary, 1849, the first step was taken toward providing a farm for the support of the county poor. The superin- tendents were authorized to purchase a farm of from forty to one hundred acres, with suitable buildings thereon for the accommodation of the poor, at an expense not to exceed twelve hundred dollars ; the purchase not to be concluded without the concurrence of the entire board. \"To Daniel Emerson, for use of room for Petit Jury, $4.00.\" The school-house mentioned above was situated on the south side of Trowbridge Street, just east of Pine Street, in the village of Allegan. Henry Booher, in whose house the grand jury met, was the landlord of the Michigan Exchange, which is still standing. Daniel Emerson's house was situ ated on the north side of Trowbridge Street, on the first lot east of where John Askin now resides. The records show that in January, 1844, seven dollars was allowed to Spencer Marsh for the use of the Methodist chapel for the October term of court, and on the 15th of October, 1844, six dollars was appropriated to pay for the use of the same building during the spring term previous. Similar payments were regularly made after that time to the trustees of the Methodist chapel for the use of the room for several years, the last being in October, 1847. For some time afeerward the courts were held in the basement of the jail, then standing on the southwest corner of the public square, on the north side of Hubbard Street near Walnut.* The courts were also held for a time in the basement of the Baptist church at Allegan. Upon the purchase of the property of the Baptist society, in 1856, the upper portion (then unfinished) was fitted up as a court room, since which time the courts have been regularly held there. * The jailer's house was about twenty-four by thirty feet, one storv and a half in height, with basement in which the offices were kept The jail was built of hewed timbers, and stood in the rear of the jailer's house, being about twenty feet square and one story in height The jailer's house now stands on the north side of the public sq'uan,, and is used for a residence. No report was made of the purchase of a farm, and in October, 1851, Messrs. Kellogg, McMartin, and' Heath were appointed a committee to inquire and report to the"], [67, "COUNTY BUILDINGS AND POOR-FARMS. 59 board as to the propriety of purchasing such an establish ment. $5000, or so much thereof as authorized by the Legislature of the State.\" Nothing appears to have been done, as thirteen years elapsed before any further action was taken. On the 12th day of October, 1864, the superintendents of the poor earn estly recommended to the supervisors to provide a more per manent and suitable location for the county poor than the temporary places then occupied. No immediate action was taken, and on the 7th day of January, 1870, the committee on the poor-farm again urged the board to take immediate action in regard to the com pletion of the main building of the poor-house. The next day the superintendents of the poor were instructed by the board to build the main building of the poor-house, after a plan in the office of the county treasurer ; said building to be completed by the 10th day of October in that year. Two years later, on the 14th day of January, 1866, a committee which had been appointed to examine farms for county purposes reported that it had received several pro posals, covering land valued at from twenty-five to fifty dollars per acre, and that after due examination it rec ommended the farm of J. P. Pope as the best suited for the purpose. The report says : The work was pushed rapidly forward, and on the 13th of October, 1870, tbe poor-committee reported the structure completed, in a creditable and satisfactory manner, at a cost of seven thousand four hundred and sixty-one dollars and ninety-seven cents. During the year 1874 a committee of the board of super visors visited the insane asylum at Kalamazoo, to obtain information bearing on the expediency of erecting a build ing for the insane of Allegan County. After a conference with the authorities of the asylum, and a thorough examin ation of the subject, the committee recommended the board to erect a building for that purpose. \"It contains 160 acres, about 95 acres improved, an orchard of 100 bearing apple-treeg, a fair grain and corn barn and small dwelling, about 300 sap-buckets, about 20,000 feet of pine logs. The farm is the southeast quarter of section 5, township 2 north, range 13 west (Allegan), and could be purchased for $7000.'* This report was accepted and adopted. The farm was purchased and the deed recorded on the 15th day of June, 1866. The board accordingly authorized the superintendents of the poor to erect such a structure on the poor-house farm, at an expense not exceeding one thousand dollars. On the 14th day of October, 1867, the committee on county buildings reported that it had examined the county farm, buildings, and conveniences, and recom mended an appropriation of one thousand dollars, to be expended in buildings for the accommodation of the poor and insane ; the means then in use being entirely inadequate for the purpose. The next day Joseph Fisk, Ira Chichester, and Dr. O. D. Goodrich were appointed a committee to make, or cause to be made, a plan and an estimate for a poor-house on the poor-farm. This committee made a verbal report Jan. 15, 1868, and submitted a plan for a building, which report was accepted and adopted. The building was erected during the summer and autumn of that year. It was two stories in height, containing four rooms in the basement, and sixteen above. It was occupied on the 1st of January, 1876. The total cost was thirteen hundred and twenty-eight dollars and sixty-two cents. On the 3d day of January, 1877, the board of super visors adopted a resolution looking towards the erection of a separate building for children on the poor-house farm, and directing the appointment of a committee to examine re garding the size and expense of such a work. Two days later the committee appointed under that resolution recommended the construction of a building thirty by forty-six feet, to be divided into rooms, the cost of which should not exceed the sum of fifteen hundred dollars. The board adopted the report, and the committee on county buildings was placed in charge of the work. On the 11th day of January, 1878, it reported the Juvenile Building completed and occupied, having been placed in charge of the superintendents of the poor on the 1st of December, 1877. The contract price was fourteen hundred and forty-nine dollars and forty-nine cents, and the entire cost was sixteen hundred and thirty three dollars and thirty-nine cents. On the 14th day of October, 1868, the building com mittee reported that the poor-house was in course of con struction, and that the expense thus far incurred amounted to twelve hundred and eighty-eight dollars and ninety cents. On the 13th of January, 1869, the same committee re ported the building completed, at a cost of two thousand and ninety dollars and seven cents. Two days after the acceptance of the new building the committee on the poor-farm reported that a certain portion of the poor were yet compelled to occupy the old building, which was rapidly falling into decay, and recommended that measures be taken to secure the completion of the main building, according to the plan originally designed, and that the board authorize a loan of three thousand dollars for that purpose. The expense of supporting the poor for the year 1879, as given in the report of the superintendents, was ten thousand and eight dollars and thirty-six cents. In view of this recommendation, the following resolutions were adopted : BARRY COUNTY BUILDINGS. THE FIRST JAIL. \" Resolved, By the Board of Supervisors of Allegan County, that the Chairman and Clerk of this Board be authorized to issue bonds upon the credit of this county to the amount of $5000, for the erection and completion of the buildings for the reception of tho Poor. The first place set apart for the detention of prisoners was located on the south side of the court-house square, on the corner of Broadway aud Court Streets. \" Resolved, That in case the Legislature of this State authorize said Board to issue bonds upon the credit of this County for the erection and completion of the building for the reception of tho Poor of said County, we do hereby authorize and instruct the building committee to erect and complete said buildings at a cost not to exceed the sum of \u2022 This place was a hole in the ground, about six feet deep and ten feet square, covered with plank about four feet above the surface of the earth.

The first record that appears on the books in reference to a county jail and court-house is that of the proceedings of the board of county commissioners on the 13th of Jan uary, 1842, which reads as follows : On the 9th of January John Lewis was allowed one dollar for drawing a bill of expenses for building the court house. On the 28th of April, 1847, the board finally adopted the plan presented by Mr. Lewis, and on the same date a contract to build the court-house was executed by the property committee and Alvin W. Bailey. The final price agreed upon was two thousand three hundred and eighty-one dollars and nine cents, an addition having been made to pay for raising the house and chimneys two feet higher than the original plan. The time for completion was also extended to the 15th of March, 1848. \" The first business under consideration was the subject of building a jail. Aster the subject had been fully discussed, drafts were made, together with estimates upon the same. \" The Board resolved that it is expedient for the county at this time to erect a jail together with a room suitable for holding courts. Therefore, further Resolved, that we will adopt a plan as soon as may be, receive proposals, and let the job of erecting the said building to tbe lowest bidder.\" The commissioners commenced the erection of the court house and jail in the spring of 1842. Before its comple tion the board of county commissioners was abolished and its powers transferred to a board of supervisors, which held its first meeting on the 4th of July, 1842. The contract for building the combined court-house and jail was awarded to H. J. Kenfield, and in the treasurer's account for 1842 appears this item, \" To II. J. Kenfield on contract, $425.77.\" The building was not finished until the 25th of December, 1843, and in the treasurer's report for 1843 appears another item, \" To H. J. Kenfield on contract, $788.15,\" making the whole cost of the court-house and jail twelve hundred and thirteen dollars and ninety-two cents. During the session of the board in the fall of 1843, Messrs. Lacey and Alden were allowed thirty dollars \" for doing their contract better than it called for.\" This work was on the well and out-buildings. At this session it was likewise voted, \" That A. C. Parmelee be requested to cause two slats of wood to be properly put on before each window in the court-room, for a protection against damage of said windows. Also to procure and put up a suitable curtain in the rear of the judge's bench ; and further, that the table for the use of the bar in said court-room be cov ered with suitable cloth.\" On the 30th of April, 1847, it was resolved by the board of supervisors \" that the court-house to be built by A. W. Bailey be set directly south of the wall on which the old court-house stood, so that the north side of the house come within two feet of the south wall of the old house.\" The court-house was not finished at the date specified, and the time was extended till October, 1848, a new con tract being drawn March 16, 1848. On the 19th of Jan uary, 1849, the supervisors examined the court-house, then nearly completed, and at their session the next day it was accepted. Settlement was made with Mr. Bailey the same day, on condition that he give bonds with sufficient security for the entire completion of the court-house, in conformity to the contract. Later in the same session Mr. Bailey pre sented a bond agreeably to the resolution, which was ac cepted and approved, and Mr. Bailey was allowed three hundred dollars for extra work over and above the amount he was to receive by his contract, and three hundred dollars for furniture. John Lewis was allowed seventy-five dollars \" for his skill and attention given in the erection of the court-house.\" Soon after, in January, 1849, the offices of the county clerk, register, treasurer, and s-heriff were re moved to the new court-house, where they still remain. On the 25th of December, 1843, the court-house and jail were reported complete, and authority was given to have it insured in the Marshall Mutual Fire Insurance Company, which was done. The building was two stories in height, the court-room being in the upper story. The jail, consisting of four cells, was in the southeast corner of the building, on the lower floor. The jailer's residence was in the southwest corner, while the county offices occu pied the front part of the building. This court-house was in use until 1816, when it was destroyed by fire, which caught near the chimney in the jailer's residence. The square on which the court-house stands was deeded by the Hastings Village Company to the supervisors of Barry County on the 15th of October, 1840, the deed being recorded in Liber B, page 424, Oct. 18, 1842. This square is on the plat that is designated in the deed from Eurotas P. Hastings to the Hastings Village Company, dated July 26, 1836, as the \" Barry County-Seat Purchase.\" THE PRESENT JAIL. Nothing was done toward erecting a new jail until the fall session of 1851, when H. J. Kenfield was appointed a committee by the board of supervisors to procure a plan for building a jail, which he was to present at the next session. No mention is made of such a plan being presented at the next meeting, although the propriety of building a jail was then under consideration. A resolution was offered by Mr. Salisbury to raise two thousand dollars for the purpose of building a jail and to lay the question before the electors of the county at the spring election of 1852. This resolution was lost. From this time until the completion of the brick jail, in 1853, prisoners were taken to Kalamazoo. THE PRESENT BARRY COUNTY COURT-HOUSE. After the destruction of the old court-house aud jail, in 1846, the supervisors, at their first meeting, in January, 1847, resolved to build a court-house, and invited individ uals to present plans and specifications. Plans were accord ingly presented, and the following resolution was adopted Jan. 6, 1847: The subject was not brought up for consideration till the 10th of October, 1853, when the board appointed Cleveland Ellis, John Miles, and E. R. Carpenter a com- \" Resolved, That the county give the man who will build the court house according to the plan agreed upon by the board two thousand two hundred dollars, provided that proper steps (to the house) be in-"], [69, "COUNTY BUILDINGS AND POOR-FARMS. 61 mittee to investigate in regard to the practicability of build ing a jail. The report of the committee was substantially embodied in the following extract : be requested to solicit and obtain terms and information preparatory to purchasing and building a county poor-house and premises, and report to the board of supervisors at their annual session.\" \" That the county of Barry proceed to build a jail of the dimen sions of the upright building of the Calhoun County jail, and that a committee of three be appointed to purchase a site and get a plan, and make an estimate upon the probable cost, and lay the same before the board at their next session. The committee also report favorably of the purchase of village lots Nos. 583 and 584.\" The superintendents made no report that is on file in reference to a purchase, and nothing further is recorded concerning it until 1853, when the subject was again brought up. The superintendents then earnestly recommended the board to take some action relative to obtaining a county poor-farm, whereupon W. W. Ralph was appointed an agett to open a correspondence and elicit such information as would be useful in obtaining a suitable farm for that purpose. The report was adopted, and it was resolved that the sum of one thousand dollars should be raised by tax that year to be applied to the construction of the jail. Nathan Barlow, Jr., G. K. Beamer, and E. R. Carpenter were ap pointed the committee for the purpose mentioned in the report. On the 11th of October, 1854, the board of supervisors resolved \" That a tax of eight hundred dollars be assessed upon the taxable property of the county, to be applied towards the purchasing a county poor-farm, and that R. N. Hanna, D. G. Robinson, aud Hiram Lewis be appointed a committee to select a proper location for said farm and report to the board at its next meeting.\" On the 2d of January, 1855, this committee made its report, which was not adopted, and the board resolved not to purchase a poor-farm. The record of the next day's proceedings on this subject is as follows : At the next session of the board, in January, 1854, the committee on the jail made a verbal report, which was ac cepted, and the committee was discharged. Messrs. Barlow, Ellis, and Beamer were then appointed a committee to super intend the building of the jail, to purchase lots on which to place the same, to let the contract for building it, agreeably to the specifications and plans adopted by the board, to draw upon the county treasurer for such moneys as might become due to the contractor, and to report to the board of supervisors at its next session. A contract for the erection of the building was duly entered into by Messrs. Ferris and Edgecourt. The land on which the jail was erected was purchased of Oliver N. Boltwood, the deed bearing date March 27, 1854, and being recorded April 13th the same year. The price paid was one hundred and fifty dollars ; the premises are known as lots 729 and 730, and are situ ated on the south side of Court Street, between Park and Washington Streets, in the village of Hastings. There the present jail was erected during the summer of 1854. \"The resolutions passed yesterday not to purchase a farm for the county poor was rescinded, and Messrs. John Miles, 0. B. Sheldon, and Silas Bowker were appointed a committee, with the powers con ferred in the following resolutions, to wit : Resolved that the commit tee purchase a poor-farm as soon as practicable, to select a proper location, and to exercise their own judgment as they shall think proper in the situation and purchase of such farm, and they shall have power to draw upon the county treasurer for money to pay for said farm not exceeding eight hundred dollars.\" A farm of one hundred acres was purchased of John L. McLellan, it being the west half of the southeast quarter and the east twenty acres of the southwest quarter of sec tion 27, in township 3 north, in range 8 west (Hastings). The deed for this property bears date Feb. 17, 1855, and is on record in Liber M, page 19, of Barry County deeds. The price paid was three thousand five hundred dollars. Repairs, improvements, and additions were made upon and to the buildings from time to time, until the October session of the supervisors in 1877. The committee on county buildings then reported that they found the poor-house entirely unfit for the comfortable keeping of the inmates, and recom mended the board to construct a new one, containing rooms for the comfort of the insane ; the material to be brick, and the cost not to exceed six thousand dollars. LOCATION OF OFFICIAL QUARTERS. The offices of the county during the first year or two after its organization were kept in an addition to the double log house owned by Abner C. Parmelee, situated on the north end of the lot that corners on Broadway and Water Streets, about fifteen rods south of the bridge. Upon the completion of the first court-house and jail they were re moved to that building. After its destruction the offices were kept at the business-places or residences of the officers. On the 19th of January, 1849, the officers were instructed to remove their papers to the offices fitted up for that pur pose in the new court-house. All the principal county officers now have their offices in that building, except the probate judge, whose office is located on the north side of Broadway, in the city of Hastings. At the same session it was resolved that a poor-house should be erected on the poor-farm at a cost not exceeding six thousand dollars. David G. Robinson, Lewis Durkee, and Samuel J. Bidelman were appointed a building com mittee to adopt plans and specifications and advertise for proposals. The money for the purpose was taken from the county contingent fund. The building was reported com plete on the 9th of January, 1879, and was then given in charge of the superintendent of the poor. BARRY COUNTY POOR-HOUSE AND FARM. Superintendents of the poor were appointed at the first session of the county commissioners after the organization of Barry County, in 1839. From this time until 1849 no special mention is made of any effort for the relief of pau pers, whose board had been hired by the superintendents at the lowest rates possible. On the 31st of December of that year the board of supervisors resolved \" That the superintendents of the poor"], [70, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 62 CHAPTER XVII.

It was proposed to hold a summer meeting, and the subject was finally placed in charge of the executive committee, but no account of such a gathering is given in the records. At the meeting in January, 1878, it was resolved to adjourn to the 29th day of May following, at the fair-ground in the village of Allegan, and there hold a basket-picnic. Owing to the inclemency of the weather but few were present in Allegan at the time specified, and the meeting was held at the office of Warner & Latta. It was adjourned to the 26th day of June at the fair-grounds. This last meeting was a marked success; several hundred were in attendance, and the day passed very pleasantly. Joseph W.

The following is an account of the grounds and the buildings erected on it, so far as one can be gleaned from the imperfect records of the association : On the 4th day of January, 1859, a motion was made and adopted \" that a building thirty-six by one hundred feet be built on the society's grounds for the purpose of exhibition during the current year.\" This buildin\" was erected, and was occupied for the fall exhibition. Discussions are held at these meetings on the different methods of cultivating fruit, and essays are read on topics connected with that subject. ALLEGAN COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETIES. In the autumn of 1861 an exchange of land was made with James Dawson, which is thus described on the record : Pursuant to a previous call, Drs. L. B. Coats, E. N. Up john, L. Foster, G. W. Hubbard, and A. R. Calkins, physi cians of the county, met at the town clerk's office in the vil lage of Otsego on the 18th day of February, 1850, for the purpose of forming a county medical society. Dr. L. Foster was appointed chairman, and E. N. Upjohn secretary. It was resolved to form an association to be known as the Allegan County Medical Society. Permanent officers were elected as follows : Dr. L. B. Coats, President ; Dr. E. N. Upjohn, Vice-President ; Dr. A. R. Calkins, Secretary ; Dr. L. Foster, Treasurer. A committee was also appointed to draft a constitution and by-laws. On the 20th day of March the same year a constitution and by-laws were adopted, and a fee-bill was arranged and accepted by the society. \" Dawson to have all of Society lands on the east and south below the brow of first and second tables, and the Society to have all west of the brow of table and north of their own land.\" The original association not being legally organized tbe members, in January, 1866, formed themselves into \" The Agricultural Society of Allegan County,\" under the laws of the State. A constitution was adopted and officers were elected. The supervisors then deeded to the society the land previously purchased for its use. During the next season a new tract was laid out and graded, and other im provements were made. In the year 1874 the society purchased by contract nineteen and seventy-one one-hundredths acres of land west of and adjoining the old grounds, at a cost of fifteen hun dred and eighty-three dollars and twenty-five cents. The physicians of other parts of the county, however, paid but little attention to the Otsego organization, and its"], [79, "COUNTY SOCIETIES. 71 meetings were consequently very thinly attended. On the 14th of February, 1867, the physicians of Allegan and vicinity met at the Exchange Hotel in that village, and or ganized and resolved to form an Allegan County auxiliary medical society, with the usual by-laws. Speeches were made by several of the pioneers concerning the trials of early life, and contrasting it with the present time. Officers were elected as follows : H. A. Goodyear, Presi dent; W. P. Bristol, Vice-President; Willard Hays, Sec retary. After the business was concluded refreshments were served, and around the tables filled with good cheer the best of feeling prevailed, friendships were renewed, old memories were revived, and time sped on to the \" wee sma' hours\" before the meeting broke up, all feeling that the associa tion would be a means of binding together those who came into the county when it was a wilderness, and who by hard and patient labor wrested a competence, and sometimes wealth, from the most adverse circumstances. Meetings are held annually. The society now numbers thirteen members, and the officers for 1880 are as follows: J. J. McConkie, President; W. H. Bills, Vice-President; F. M. Calkins, Secretary; Milton Chase, Treasurer. Drs. Chase, Thompson, and Thomas are the censors. ALLEGAN COUNTY COUNCIL OF PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY.

The record-book of this society contains on the first, pages the constitution and by-laws, accompanied by the solitary statement that the association was organized on the 29th of December, 1851. Nothing further is to be found in the book of records until the 12th of July, 1858, when men tion was made of a meeting in the village of Hastings for the purpose of electing officers and transacting other bus iness. From the columns of the Barry County Pioneer, pub lished at Hastings in 1853, we learn that the second annual fair of the society was held at the court-house in October of that year, an address being delivered by Charles S. May. At that meeting the following officers were elected : Hiram Lewis, Prairieville, President ; J. W. Bradley, Yankee Springs, Secretary ; H. A. Goodyear, Hastings, Treasurer ; R. N. Hanna, D. B. Pratt, C. Balch, T. P. Johnson, and W. P. Bristol, Executive Committee. At the meeting for the election of officers held on the 12th of July, 1858, one vice-president was appointed from each township, as follows : Alonzo Barnum, Woodland ; Isaac Messer, Carlson ; C. Hanna, Irving ; I. N. Keeler, Thornapple; T. Johnson, Yankee Springs; Asa D. Rork, Rutland ; Nathan Barlow, Hastings ; Lorenzo Mudge, Cas tleton ; Leander Laphaiu, Maple Grove; Gilbert Striker, 1854.

In the year 1875 the Horse Asso ciation of Hastings built a grand stand one hundred feet in length, which was purchased by the agricultural society from that association in 1879 for four hundred dollars. Floral Hall was erected in 1878, at a cost of six hundred and eighty-six dollars and seventy-five cents. It is in the form of a Greek cross, the central part being seventeen feet square, and each wing also seventeen feet square. Hiram Lewis, Prairieville; Irvin Hewitt, Barry; William P. Bristol, Johnstown ; Cleveland Ellis, Assyria. It was resolved that the seventh annual fair be held at Hastings on the 13th and 14th of October next. The names of the officers-elect will be found in the list of officers. The president and secretary at that time were J. W. Bradley and R. B. Wightman. As near as can be ascertained, Ashman A. Knappen was the first secretary ; the first fair was held in the court-house and the surrounding square, the lower hall being used for the exhibition of articles, and the court-room above for reading reports and delivery of addresses. Fairs were held at the same place for several years, and for two years at Prairieville. The grounds and buildings are taken care of throughout the year by a family who reside in a dwelling-house built by the association within the inclosure. The amount of premiums paid at the annual fair of 1879 was nine hun dred and fourteen dollars and eighty cents. The receipts from all sources were two thousand two hundred and seventy-two dollars and forty-two cents. The society is now out of debt and in a flourishing' condition. The fol lowing is a list of the presidents, secretaries, and treasurers as far as can be ascertained : In the year 1859 it was decided to hold the annual fair on the \" market square,\" which was prepared by the citizens of Hastings for that purpose. The square was leased from the corporation of the village of Hastings. Several pieces of land adjoining were soon after purchased, which, with Market Square, included the blocks bounded by State Street on the north, Market Street on the east, Centre Street on the south, and Benton Street on the west.

On the 21st of November, 1864, Nathan Bar low deeded to the society lot 738, it being the northeast corner lot of the block south of Market Square. At the annual fair on the 11th of October, 1861, offi cers were elected who subsequently declined to serve. The following from the records will show the condition of the association in 1862 : SECRETARIES. J. W. Bradley, Yankee Springs, 1852-54; H. A. Goodyear, 1858; D. Striker, 1859-60; J. M.

Goodyear, N. Barlow, D. Striker, J. P. Roberts, Gilbert Striker, R. B. Wightman, S. H. Cook, H. N. Sheldon, and J. N. Ladow. SHEEP-BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION. Pursuant to a published call, several of the farmers of Barry County convened at the court-house in the city of Hastings on the 9th of March, 1880, for the purpose of organizing a sheep-breeders' and wool-growers' association. The Hon. James A. Sweazey was called to the chair, and W. H. Merrick was chosen secretary. A committee of three, consisting of A. Ryerson, L. D. Gardner, and Harvey Burton, was appointed to draft a constitution and by-laws, which were presented and adopted. The constitu- tion was then signed by those present. Nine directors were chosen, as follows: James A. Swea- zey, A. Ryerson, A. C. Towne, Friend D. Soule, L. D. Gardner, Henry Burton, Albert Kent, William Lee, and C. McQueen. The following officers for 1880 were then elected by the directors: A. Ryerson, President; W. H. Merrick, Secretary ; J. A. Sweazey, Treasurer. A festival was held on the Barry County Agricultural Society's fair-grounds on the 6th of May, 1880. Copies of the articles were filed,\u2014 one in the clerk's office of Barry County, and one in the office of the secre- tary of the State agricultural society,-and the associa- tion thus became a body corporate under the name of the Barry County Agricultural Society. The title to its land having been secured, as before stated, the ground was put in good condition, and on the 29th of June, 1872 the two blocks west of the old ground were purchased of Daniel Striker, making in all an area of eighteen acres. An exhibition-hall about twenty by thirty feet was the first bu.ld.ng erected. It is now situated on the north side of the track, and is used for horticultural displays In 1870 a refreshment-hall was erected, at a cost of one hun- dred and sixty dollars. This building was used for that purpose unt,l 1879, when it was fitted up sor a dwelling The next year after the purchase of the new ground, in 1872, a new track, half a mile in length, was laid out and BARRY COUNTY POMONA GRANGE.

On the 2d day of December, 1879, pursuant to a call by Mrs. N. Bailey, vice-president of the State Women's Chris tian Union for the Third Congressional District, a number of ladies from the various townships of the county assem bled in the city of Hastings to consider the question of organizing a county union. Mrs. N. Bailey presided, and Mrs. Charles Bentley, of Hastings, was chosen secretary. The annual meetings for 1879 aud 1880 were held in the city of Hastings, in May of each year. The officers of 1879 were re-elected in 1880, and were as follows: Dr. A. B. Drake, President ; Dr. Wm. H. Young, Vice-Presi dent ; Dr. Wm. E. Upjohn, Secretary and Treasurer. The present members of the society are W. H. Young, Nash ville : D. McLeay, Prairieville ; A. L. Van Horn, Balti more ; D. B. Kilpatrick and J. A. Baughman, Woodland ; A. B. Drake, C. Russell, Miss D. J. Wolf, William Up john, and William E. Upjohn, Hastings. After some remarks by the president on the desirability of establishing a county union for the mutual good of the unions of the different townships, it was decided to estab lish such an organization. Mrs. Button and Mrs. Hayes, of Hastings, and Mrs. Sprague, of Middleville, were chosen a committee to draft a constitution, which, after due delib eration, was presented by the president and adopted by the meeting. Resolutions were then adopted which embodied the sentiments of those present ; the first one, which relates substantially the whole object of the society, is as follows: \" Resolved, That we, women of Barry County, pledge ourselves to use our individual and united efforts to educate public sentiment in behalf of temperance and all moral and social reformation which shall redound to the strength, wisdom, and sobriety of its present and future citizens.\" HAHNEMANN MEDICAL SOCIETY OF BARRY AND EATON COUNTIES.

Willard Davis was elected president, and W. A. Nimrocks secretary. The first policies took effect on the 12th of April, 1864. \u2014 one by Mrs. Fleming, of Nashville, entitled \" An Appeal to Mothers and Sisters ;\" one by Mrs. Robinson, of Hast ings, on \" Sowing the Seed ;\" and one by Mrs. Clement Smith, whose subject was \" Literature and its Influence on our Children.\" These subjects were taken up and earnestly discussed by Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Fleming, Mrs. Bailey, and Mrs. Boltwood. The ladies of the union, realizing that much of the vice and moral weakness which exists in the country is caused by the immoral and trashy literature of the day, determined to banish all such reading from their own homes, and to endeavor earnestly to induce others to do the same. Be lieving, also, that the use of tobacco is a most objectionable habit, incompatible with purity and decency, and gravely injurious to those who indulge in it, they earnestly besought the Christian mothers, sisters, and teachers of the county to do all in their power to repress that pernicious custom in the young. The company has steadily increased in numbers and use fulness, and on the 31st of December, 1879, it had three thousand three hundred and nine outstanding policies, cov ering a total risk of five million five hundred and eighty thousand dollars. From the date of its organization to May 1, 1880, about ninety thousand dollars have been paid in losses, which is an average of about twenty cents for every hundred dollars upon the amount of risk. The present officers of the company are as follows : President, D. B. Hale ; Vice-President, B. J. Bidleman ; Secretary, D. W. Rogers ; Treasurer, C. E. Chappell ; Directors, Z. B.

It is not known exactly when this society was organized ; the first records now extant are dated Dec. 29, 1867. At that date Robert J. Grant was president, and he has con tinued to occupy the position till the present time. Daniel Striker was then the secretary, and filled the position until the spring of 1870, when he was succeeded by John M. Nevins, who still acts in that capacity. The society is auxiliary to the American Bible Society, to which an an nual report is made. THE PROPOSED CLINTON AND KALAMAZOO RIVER CANAL. FARMERS' MUTUAL FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY OF BARRY AND EATON COUNTIES. Under the system of internal improvements adopted by the State in February, 1837, money was appropriated for the survey of a canal commencing near the mouth of the Clinton River, to terminate at or near the mouth of the Kalamazoo River; and also for the survey of the St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rivers, with a view to the use of the same by slack-water navigation. The prelimi- In the year 1863, G. K. Beamer, Cleveland Ellis, Lo renzo Mudge, Willard Davis, John Dow, R. M. Wheaton, P. S. Spaulding, William P. Bristol, and A. C. Ells\u2014 all residents of Barry and Eaton Counties \u2014 associated them selves together as an incorporated company for the transac tion of the insurance-business under the above title. By"], [85, "INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS, ETC. 77 nary survey for the canal was made by the State engineer in the summer of 1837. The line started at the mouth of Clinton River, ran through Oakland County, touching the northwest corner of Ingham, and thence through Eaton, Barry, and Allegan Counties to the village of Allegan ; whence it was intended to use the river to its mouth. river-service between Saugatuck and Allegan. It made but two trips, however, and was then transferred to the lake trade. The steamer \" Adelaide\" was built in the village of Allegan, below the Littlejohn bridge, about the year 1847. The machinery was that previously used in the \" Maid of the Mist\" at Niagara Falls. Captain Elliott was the com mander. It ran from Allegan to Saugatuck one day and back the next, for about two years, and was then sold at Chicago. Mr. F. J. Littlejohn was employed by the board of in ternal improvements, in the winter of 1837-38, to make a thorough survey of that portion of the line running from a \" bottom-peg\" placed by the State engineer on the west side of Barry County, near the north end of Gun Lake, to Allegan, and thence to the mouth of the Kalamazoo, and to make the necessary estimates regarding the same. The proper instruments were furnished by the board, and the work was both commenced and finished in February, 1838. When Mr. Littlejohn made his report to the State engineer, it was found that the result reached by him differed but three-tenths of a foot from the preliminary survey of that official, although the latter was made in the summer and Mr. Littlejohn's in the winter, with two feet of snow on the ground. The point where the canal, ac cording to the survey, was to reach the Kalamazoo was in the village of Allegan, at the north end of the north bridge across that river. J. D. Bush built the \" Helen Mar\" at Allegan about 1854, and subsequently ran it five or six years on the river. It was finally dismantled. All its machinery was built at Allegan except the boiler, and is now in use at Vosburg's mill, at that village. Two barges were built at Allegan about the same time, named \" Adam\" and \" Eve.\" They were intended for towing on the lake, and were the first experiment of the kind. The schooner \" Lavinda\" was built at Allegan in 1861, and was used on the lake, running from Saugatuck to Chicago. It is still in use. The steamer \" Aunt Betsey\" was built for Ira Chaffee, George Stone, and J. C. McMil lan. It plied on the river for about five years, and was sold to parties at St. Paul, Minn. In the year 1867 the propeller \"Ira Chaffee\" was built at Allegan for the lake trade. It was owned by Ira Chaf fee, Frederick May, E. B. Costin, and George Dutcher. The same year the schooner \" White Oak\" was built at Allegan for the lake trade, and the next season the propel ler \" Dunbar\" was built. In 1865 the barge \" Utell\" was built at Allegan. It ran on the river for a time, but was finally sold to parties at Grand Rapids. The only portion of the canal which was ever built was sixteen miles at the eastern end. NAVIGATION ON THE KALAMAZOO RIVER. In the month of June, 1834, Oka Town and Abijah Chichester ran a raft containing thirty thousand feet of lumber from Pine Creek (where the first saw-mill in Allegan County was located) to the mouth of Kalamazoo River, where it was transferred to William G. Butler, who had bought it. They were obliged to hire an Indian to pilot them back through the woods. This was the first raft which was taken down the river. Ship-building has ceased at Allegan, but is still energeti cally carried on at Saugatuck. Numerous tugs and lumber barges have been built there, besides several propellers and large grain-carrying vessels. The year 1879 was an ex tremely busy one for Saugatuck ship-builders, and the busi ness is still increasing there. Vessels were soon after constructed along the lake-shore for carrying lumber. Among the first builders was James McLaughlin, who built the \" Crook.\" The \" Octavia\" was soon built by Carter & Co. at Singapore. In 1841, David Walbridge, from Buffalo, N. Y., came to Kalamazoo and commenced buying wheat. He established a line of flat boats, on which the grain was carried down the river, being transferred at Saugatuck to sail-vessels bound for Buffalo. In the spring of 1842 he leased a grist-mill, and carried on an extensive business in grinding flour, which followed the same course to the Eastern market. ALLEGAN AND MARSHALL RAILROAD. The Allegan and Marshall Railroad Company was incor porated on the 4th day of March, 1836. The directors residing in Allegan County were John R. Kellogg and Alexander L. Ely. It was hoped that the building of a road from Marshall to Allegan would lead to a choice of this line to the lake for the Central Railroad, the west ern terminus of which had not then been determined on. An extremely circuitous route was surveyed, which passed from Marshall through Battle Creek, Comstock, and Bron son (now Kalamazoo) to Allegan. Cars, and even cushions for the seats, were purchased, for the latter of which suit was brought several years afterwards, but no part of the road was ever graded. The first flatboat of any size on the Kalamazoo was the \" Pioneer,\" built by James D. Bush, of Allegan, for Milo Winslow. This vessel carried one thousand barrels of flour, and twelve men were necessary to pole it up and down the river. The \" Great Western\" employed ten men, and the \" Tippecanoe\" eight. There were several others, but these were the most important. These boats were in active operation on the river until the opening of the Michigan Central Railroad, in 1846, furnished a quicker and more convenient means of transportation. LAWTON AND GRAND RAPIDS RAILROAD. The next projected railroad was from Lawton, on the Michigan Central, through Paw Paw and Allegan, to Grand Rapids, about 1848. F. J. Littlejohn made a preliminary survey, but no work was eA'er commenced. The project was defeated by the efforts made at an early day to locate About 1842 a flat-bottomed steamboat named \" C. C. Trowbridge\" was built at Singapore by Porter & Co. for"], [86, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 78 1869 the three companies were consolidated under the name of the Michigan Lake Shore Railroad Company. The stock was sold to parties interested in the Pennsylvania system of roads, and who also controlled the Grand Rapids and Indiana road. The survey was adopted by the company on the 19th day of August, 1869, and Avas filed in the register's office of Allegan County on the 7th of Septem ber following. The route passed through the townships of Allegan, Heath, Overisel, and Fillmore, in the county of Allegan. the route of tho Grand Rapids and Indiana road from Kalamazoo through Allegan to Grand Rapids. This latter route was also surveyed, and followed the previous line from Allegan to Grand Rapids. This project also failed for the time, and when it was revived several years afterwards a route was chosen ten or eleven miles east of Allegan vil lage, as appears in the sketch of the Grand Rapids and Indiana road. KALAMAZOO, ALLEGAN AND GRAND RAPIDS RAILROAD. Upon the completion of the Kalamazoo, Allegan and Grand Rapids road the contractors placed their men im mediately upon this work. It was prosecuted with great vigor, and on the 1st of July, 1870, was opened from Allegan to Muskegon, \u2014 a distance of fifty-seven and a half miles. Articles of association were filed in the office of the Sec retary of State of Michigan in the spring of 1868 for the organization of the Kalamazoo and Allegan Railroad Com pany. The directors belonging to Allegan County were Joseph Fisk, of Allegan, and Wilson C. Edsell, of Otsego. A preliminary survey was made, which passed through the townships of Gun Plain, Otsego, Watson, and Allegan. A map of the line was filed at the register's office on the 7th of May, 1868, but a change of route was made, and a new map was filed on the 4th of August of the same year. This change was on sections 22, 24, 27, and 28, in the village of Allegan. The company defaulted on the interest of its bonds in 1873 and 1874, and the road passed into the hands of D. P. Clay, of Grand Rapids, as receiver. It was operated by him till the 1st of October, 1878, when it was sold on the foreclosure of its mortgage bonds and purchased by the bondholders' committee. A new company was then organ ized under the name of the Grand Haven Railroad, by which the road has been operated from that time till the present. During the summer of 1868 the articles of association were amended so as to change the name to the Kalamazoo, Allegan and Grand Rapids Railroad Company, and pro viding for the extension of the road from Allegan to Grand Rapids. The map of the survey of the northern portion of the line is dated in September, 1868, and was filed on the 21st of October following. The extension passes through the townships of Allegan, Monterey, Hopkins, and Dorr. The tract was completed, and the first train of cars ran into Allegan on Thanksgiving-day, Nov. 23, 1868. On the same day work was commenced on the northern por tion, and the first train of cars reached Grand Rapids on the 1st of March, 1869. On the 1st of October of the same year the road was leased to the Michigan Southern Railroad Company, by whom it is still run, being known as the Kalamazoo Division of that road. The cost of the construction of the road and its equip ment was $960,000. The new company, upon its organiza tion in October, 1878, owed debts to the amount of $160,000. The receipts for the carriage of passengers during the year previous to the last annual report was $22,223.07 ; for that of freight, $27,780.31 ; of mails, $3250.45; of express matter, $1565; of miscellaneous articles, $878.47. The receipts other than earnings were $11,615, making a total of $67,312.40. There are employed on the road three locomotives, weigh ing over twenty tons each ; three eight-wheel passenger cars, one express- and baggage-car, thirty box freight-cars, and sixty-six platform-cars. The Ward air-brake is used on the passenger-cars. The length of the road from Kalamazoo to Allegan is twenty-six miles, and from Allegan to Grand Rapids thirty three miles, making a total of fifty-nine miles. The cost of construction of the road was $1,450,000. The equip ment is owned by the Michigan Southern Company. The receipts during the year 1878 from transportation of pas sengers was $43,082.67 ; from that of freight, $73,436 ; of mails, $4612.85; of express matter, $504.66, \u2014 making the total earnings $122,546.18. The expenses of operating the road for the same time were $101,917.28. The funded debt of the company amounts to $840,000. Tho number of passengers carried during the year 1878 was 40,376. The total number of tons of freight carried over the road was 25,223, distributed as follows : Grain and flour, 1727 ; provisions, 322 ; other agricultural products, 422 ; lumber and forest products, 19,479 ; coal, 131 ; plas ter, 160; petroleum, 52; pig- and bloom-iron, 23; other iron and castings, 114 ; stone and brick, 82 ; manufactures, 873 ; merchandise and other articles not previously men tioned, 1830. The United States Express Company does business on this road, paying five dollars per day for the use of an apartment in a car. THE GRAND HAVEN RAILROAD. GRAND RAPIDS AND INDIANA RAILROAD. The company that now operates this road had its origin in three organizations, \u2014 the Allegan and Holland, the Hol land and Grand Haven, and the Muskegon and Ferrysbur\" Railroad Companies. The first two were organized in the spring of 1869, but accomplished little even in the pre liminary work of location and survey. The last named company had built a road between Muskegon and Ferrys burg, which was then in operation. During the summer of This road extends from Fort Wayne, Ind., to Petos key, Mich., \u2014 a distance of three hundred and twenty-two miles. The first section, from Grand Rapids to Cedar Springs, was opened for traffic Dec. 23, 1867, and the last one, from Fife Lake to Petoskey, in May, 1874. The portion from Kalamazoo to Grand Rapids, running through the county of Allegan, was first opened sor business in Octo-"], [87, "INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS, ETC. 79 ber, 1870. It passes through the townships of Gun Plain, Martin, Wayland, Leighton, and Dorr. West Michigan Railroad, and changed the name of the road accordingly. The cost of construction of the road and its branches 'was $9,877,363.99; that of equipment, $1,214,721.47. The funded debt of the company amounts to $8,000,000, the unfunded debt to $2,164,706.72. The receipts from the carriage of passengers during the year 1878 was $425,882.33 ; from that of freights, $699,557.84 ; of mails, $17,142.06; of express matter, $17,238.68. The cost of construction was $6,225,802, and that of equipment $899,220. The funded debt of the company amounts to $6,630,000, the unfunded to $2,517,218. The receipts from carriage of passengers during the year 1878 (the one covered by the last report of the railroad com missioners) was $175,921 ; from that of freights, $333,809 ; from other sources, $28,293 ; total, $538,023. The entire running expenses for the same period were $500,479. The total expenses of operating the road during that year were $958,170.80; the total earnings for the same time, $1,200,629.19. There are employed on the road seventeen locomotives weighing over thirty tons each, twenty others which weigh over twenty tons each, and one other which weighs over ten tons. There are ten twel\\Te-wheel and eleven eight-wheel passenger-cars, ten express- and baggage-cars, three hundred and forty-seven box freight-cars, seven hundred and thirty-six platform- cars, and twenty-one conductors' way cars. Thirteen locomotives and thirty-two passenger-ears are equipped with the Westinghouse air-brake. There are employed on the road twenty-one locomotives weighing over thirty tons each, and five which weigh under that amount. There are three twelve-wheel and ten eight wheel passenger-cars, nine express- and baggage-cars, one hundred and fourteen box freight-cars, three hundred and seventy-six platform-cars, seven conductors' way-cars, and one pay-car. The total number of tons of freight carried over the road during the year 1878 was 266,701, distributed as follows: Grain, 14,055; flour, 1949; other provisions, 1225; other agricultural products, 9673 ; lumber and other sorest prod ucts, 153,563; coal, 2585; plaster, 12,000; railroad iron, 189 ; pig- and bloom-iron, 11,050 ; ores, 19,499 ; stone and brick, 2812 ; merchandise and other articles not previously enumerated, 38,151. The number of tons of through freight was 241,962, and of local freight 141,348, distributed as follows: Grain, 39,160; flour, 5324; provisions, 2038; other agricultural products, 13,460 ; lumber and forest products, 239,830 ; coal, 11,449; plaster, 2785; salt, 2931 ; petroleum, 900 ; railroad iron (iron and steel rails), 1993 ; pig- and bloom iron, 507 ; other iron and castings, 2544 ; stone and brick, 3897 ; manufactures, 13,835 ; merchandise and other articles not previously mentioned, 42,757. The American Express Company sends its freight over the road, paying for the privilege one and a half times the price of first-class railroad freight. ALLEGAN AND SOUTHEASTERN RAILROAD. The United States Express Company transacts business on this road, paying forty-five dollars and forty-five cents per day for the transmission of four thousand pounds of freight. This road was built in ninety days by Joseph Fisk, the contractor, who completed it in September, 1871. It was then a section eleven and a half miles long (from Allegan to Monteith, in the township of Martin), belonging to the Mansfield, Coldwater and Lake Michigan Railroad Com pany. The intention of that company was to construct a road from Mansfield, Ohio, to Allegan, Mich., but the portion from Allegan to Monteith was all that was ever completed in this State. The company operates the Allegan and Southeastern road, as mentioned a little farther on. CHICAGO AND WEST MICHIGAN RAILROAD. In May, 1869, a company was organized at St. Joseph, Berrien Co., under the general law of the State, called the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad Company, for the purpose of building a railroad from New Buffalo north ward along the western shore of Lake Michigan. The work was begun at St. Joseph, the grading was rapidly carried southward from there, and on the 28th of January, 1870, the road was completed to New Buffalo, and subse quently it was built northward from St. Joseph, being com pleted to Grand Junction, Van Buren Co., on the 28th of February, 1871, and to Pentwater, its present terminus, on the 1st of January, 1872. The last-named portion runs through the townships of Lee, Clyde, Manlius, and Fillmore, in Allegan County. The distance traversed in that county is twenty-six miles. The property and franchises of the Mansfield company were sold under the foreclosure of its mortgage bonds on the 28th of August, 1877, and on the 13th of December following the purchasers subscribed to new articles of asso ciation, changing the name to the Allegan and Southeastern Railroad Company, and fixing the amount of the capital stock at $1,500,000. These new articles were filed in the office of the Secretary of State of Michigan on the 22d of January, 1878. The road has been operated by the Grand Rapids and Indiana Company since its completion, and a formal lease was made to that company on the 5th of March, 1879. The cost of construction and equipment was $250,700. The company has no funded or unfunded debt. The revenue received from passengers during the year 1878 was $3568.99, and that from freights $2593.27. The re ceipts other than earnings were $6192.11. The total ex penses of operating the road during that year were $5294.89. The rolling-stock is furnished by the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Company. The total num ber of tons of freight carried over the road in 1878 was The road was managed by the original company until 1874, when it was given up to the bondholders. They operated it about three years, and then foreclosed their mortgage. On the sale most of the stock passed into the hands of citizens of Boston, who organized themselves into a new company, by which the road has since been controlled.

Through the exertions of Amos Root, of Jackson, a charter for a company to build a railroad from Jackson to Grand Rapids, to be known as the Grand RiA'er Valley Railroad, was granted by the State Legislature on the 4th of March, 1836. The route was through the townships of Castleton, Hastings, Rutland, Irving, and Thornapple, in Barry County, following the valley of the Thornapple River along its entire course in that county. The capital stock of the proposed company was $1,000,000. The road was to be commenced within three years, twenty miles were to be constructed in five years, and the whole was to be finished within ten years from the passage of the act of incorpora tion ; otherwise that act was to become void.

No work was done during the prescribed ten years, but the charter was extended from time to time, and about 1866 the matter was again earnestly agitated. At that time the question of building a road from Hastings to Bat tle Creek was under discussion. Subscriptions had been obtained in support of the project, and a preliminary survey had been made. The line passed, in Barry County, through Hastings, Castleton, Maple Grove, and Assyria. The citi zens of Battle Creek were not very earnest in favor of the work, however, and it was finally given up. But in the mean while the people of Barry County had become excited on the railroad question, and Amos Root, the original pro jector of the Grand River Valley road, came into the county and urged the construction of that work. Subscriptions were given to aid the project, bonds were issued by the townships of Barry County, and after the survey was completed work was commenced in the spring of 1867. On the 26th of January, 1869, regular trains commenced running from Jackson to Nashville, and on the 22d of February of the same year the road was completed to Hastings, when trains began to run regularly to that place. Work was pressed forward on the northern portion of the route, and in the spring of 1870 the road was completed to Grand Rapids. It was then leased to the Michigan Central Railroad Com pany, by whom it was equipped and has since been man aged. It is known as the Grand River Valley Division of that road. ALLEGAN COUNTY. The first movement towards the establishment of a news paper in Allegan County was made at the embryo city of New Rochester, which was laid out at the junction of Pine Creek with the Kalamazoo River, in the township of Otsego. The exact date at which the attempt was made is unknown, but it was probably about 1837, the era when so many promising enterprises had their birth and met their death in swift succession. The arrangements were pushed so far that a building was erected at the village just mentioned, intended for a newspaper office, but the \" hard times\" which crushed so many other schemes also overwhelmed this one, and the journalistic history of New Rochester came to an end just before the beginning of its first chapter. The cost of the construction of the road was $2,840,031. The funded debt of the company amounts to $1,500,000, which constitutes their total liability. The receipts for the transportation of passengers during the year previous to the last report were $114,722.03 ; for that of freight, $147,462. 29 ; of mails, $8537.40 ; of express matter, $1989.31 ; mis cellaneous, $3920.70; total, $276,631.73. The running expenses for the same period were $245,261.73. The num ber of passengers carried during the year was 144,326. The number of tons of freight carried over the road was THE ALLEGAN COUNTY DEMOCRAT. The first paper actually established in the county was the Allegan County Democrat, the first number of which was issued at the village of Otsego on the 12th day of April, 1842, by Moses Hawks, editor and publisher.* We have * Mr. Hawks was the first printer in the county. He had previ ously been foreman of the Oswego (N. Y.) Palladium, and in 1840"], [89, "THE PRESS 81 not been able to find a copy of the Democrat, and doubt whether there is one in existence. It is known, however, to have been Democratic in its politics, and, from the brief period of its existence, may be presumed to have suffered frotu serious financial difficulties. It was doubtless of the same size as its successor, the Allegan and Barry Record, which had four pages, each sixteen inches by twenty, \u2014 that is, when a full sheet was issued ; but various exigencies fre quently compelled the publishers of those days to issue a half-sheet, or even a still smaller production. The Demo crat was only published seven or eight months, when it suspended. inches by twenty in dimensions. But the number which we examined was only a half-sheet, and even that was more than sufficient to contain the news, for in truth there was not a solitary article of news in the whole paper. The ab sence of local news was a characteristic of all the papers of that period, but they usually contained some general and foreign news. The issue in question contained two short editorials, \u2014 one on \" The Balance of Trade,\" and one on \" A Canal around the Falls of St. Mary.\" \u2014 a full list of the State and county officers, a story of four columns, two col umns of legal advertisements, about a column and a half of other advertisements, a few miscellaneous articles, and a political article, copied from the Detroit Free Press, in re lation to a contest for the office of representative in the Leg islature between Hon. F. J. Littlejohn, of Allegan, and A. C. Parmelee, Esq., of Hastings. THE ALLEGAN AND BARRY RECORD. On the suspension of the Democrat, the press and type of the office were purchased by Alexander L. Ely, one of the founders and chief proprietors of the village of Allegan, who removed them to that village, and used them to estab lish a new paper called the Allegan and Barry Record. The first number of the Record was issued on the 23d day of January, 1843. It was the only newspaper published in the two counties the name of which it bore, and, like most other journals in new places, depended largely for sus tenance on the official printing which might be done in the office. The reason for the issue of a half-sheet, as given in the following paragraph, shows very forcibly the slowness of business proceedings and the difficulties of transportation at that period : \"Some time in September last we commenced making preparations for procuring a supply of printing-paper, thinking that two months* time would be sufficient to get it from Ann Arbor to this place. It seems, however, that we were mistaken. AVe are reduced to the neces sity of issuing but a half-sheet this week, but shall endeavor to make such arrangements as will secure a supply of paper by the next pub lication.\" Now, the dispensers of official favors in Michigan in that day were thorough-going Democrats, while Mr. Ely was a decided Whig. He cared, however, more for the interests of the village of Allegau than for those of the Whig party, so he procured a succession of Democrats to publish the paper for him, and it gave a moderate support to the Democ racy (though it paid very little attention to politics in any way), which secured sor it the coveted official printing. Doubtless this was the true reason for the publication of a half-sheet on this occasion, but a half-sheet issue was no uncommon occurrence in the history of the Record. The printers were young apprentices and their pay was poor, while the hunting and fishing in the vicinity were excel lent. Consequently, the boys often went fishing and hunt ing, and as a further consequence there were frequent proc lamations of \" sickness in the family,\" \" absence of the edi tor,\" or other valid reasons for the issue of half a sheet, or even less. Sometimes the journal bearing the lofty title of the Allegan and Barry Record consisted of only a two column slip, containing the legal advertisements. These must be printed, for these brought money, whereas most of the subscriptions were paid, when paid at all, in wheat, oats, potatoes, lumber, or such other articles as the subscribers thought they could spare. The first publisher placed in possession by Mr. Ely was Augustine W. Adams, an intelligent and well-educated gentleman, who superintended the publication about a year and then returned to Pontiae, the place of his former resi dence. By the courtesy of Mr. Henderson, of the Allegan Journal, we have been permitted to examine a tattered copy of the Record, \u2014 a solitary relic of early journalism in Allegan County. It is No. 46, Volume I., and is dated Dec. 5, 1843. Beneath the heading, \"Allegan and Barry Record,\" appears the elaborate motto \" Devoted to the Maintenance of Democratic Principles in Politics, News, Education, Agriculture, Literature, and Good Morals.\" Mr. Adams was succeeded as publisher by a Mr. Bacon, and he, after a short time, by Moses Hawks, the founder of the original Allegan County Democrat. The first editor of the Record was Hovey K. Clarke (now of Detroit). Ho was succeeded by Dr. John F. Ely, a brother of the pro prietor. Mr. A. L. Ely continued to own the paper until 1846, when he removed to Cedar Falls, Iowa, of which place he was the founder.* The business notice in the upper left-hand corner declares that the Record will be published for the proprietor by Augustiue W. Adams, price two dollars per annum, payable in advance, with the additional statement, \u2014 very illustrative of the condition of affairs at that period, \u2014 \" All kinds of produce received in pay for subscriptions.\" The price of advertisements was announced at fifty cents per folio for the first insertion, and twenty-five cents for each subsequent one. The first apprentices who printed the Record, when they were not hunting, fishing, nor indulging in other recreations of the period, were Boyd Coates and George H. Foster, both since deceased, and Donald C. Henderson, who went to New York in 1847 and obtained a position on the Tri bune, becoming one of the assistant editors of that paper. The normal size of the Record was that of a four-page sheet, each page having five columns and being sixteen just before coining to Allegan County, had occupied the same position iu the office of the Detroit Advertiser. He was connected with the press of the county many years, as will be seen farther on, sergeant at-nrms of the Legislature of this State in 1845, and died at Plain- When Mr. Ely removed to Cedar Falls he sold the Record to the then publisher, Mr. Hawks, who owned it in well, in 1872. * He died there in 1S48. 11"], [90, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 82 whole or in part (or at least it Avas published under his name) until 1857. Mr. E. B. Bassett was the chief editor during all of this period after 1847, though Hon. F. J. Littlejohn was a frequent and valued contributor. THE ALLEGAN JOURNAL. This paper was established in April, 1856, by Donald C. Henderson. The first number was issued on the 30th day of that month, although, owing to the non-arrival of the press in time, it was only a little sheet, ten inches by twelve, printed on one side. The next week, the press having arrived, a handsome paper, twenty-four inches by thirty-six, was issued. The Journal was, in many respects, the pioneer modern-style newspaper of Allegan County, the print having the light, open appearance of the present day, in contrast to the old \" black letter,\" while the publication of the news was a more important item than in the Record, and editorial articles were much more frequent. The price of the Journal at that time was one dollar per annum, and the cost of a square of advertising was fifty cents a week, or eight dollars a year. Until 1851 the Allegan and Barry Record was the only journal published in the two counties named in its title. In the fore-part of that year the Barry County Pioneer was established at Hastings. It naturally obtained the subscrip tion, advertisements, and official business of that region, and so the word Barry was dropped from the name of the Record, which became the Allegan Record. It was steadily Democratic in politics, except that in 1848 it supported Van Buren and Adams, the Free Democratic or Free-Soil candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency. We have examined a file of the Record for 1855, which is preserved in the office of the Allegan Journal. It was then a four-page sheet (seven columns to the page), the di mensions of each page being sixteen by twenty-two inches. Hawks & Manson were the publishers, the latter gentleman having purchased a half-interest in May of that year. The editor's name did not appear. The second number (the first full-sized one) has not been preserved, but Mr. Henderson's salutatory, entitled \" Our Bow,\" was reprinted in number three. It declares that \" The Journal will advocate as best it knows how the principles aud policy of the great Republican party of the nation,\" adding, however, that it will not be exclusively a political paper, but will devote itself largely to the advance ment of local interests. It also claimed that it already had a larger circulation than any other paper in Western Mich igan, and that subscriptions were pouring in from every quarter. This was at the time when the people of the North were much excited over the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska act the year before, and when the Republican party was in rapid process of formation. The Record, however, staunchly adhered to the Democratic party, and its issue of May 21, 1855, declares that \" The Record will, as formerly, be found doing battle against all the isms of the day, and knife to the hilt to anything that opposes Democracy, of which we know but one kind.\" The same number contained an editorial on Kansas affairs, and another on the approaching Republican Na tional Convention of 1856, in which the editor says: \" Our first choice for the Presidency is that veteran champion of Liberty and Reform, William H. Seward, The Record of that day still retained the principal char acteristics of the old style of typography, with numerous black-letter capitals, such as are still to be seen in English papers. It had very little local and not much general news, although it had progressed so as to give a column of New York correspondence. whose name alone is a tower of strength to the Republican cause.\" Mr. M. Bates Mills was announced as one of the propri etors of the Journal, but remained connected with it only a short time. Mr. Henderson then carried it on success fully as sole proprietor, publisher, and editor, it being al ways a strong Republican paper. In August, 1862, he purchased the Allegan Record, as before stated. In the following year he enlisted as a private in the Third Michi gan Cavalry,* transferring the Journal to his brother, Alexander Henderson. The latter gentleman conducted the paper throughout the war. On the conclusion of peace Mr. D. C. Henderson returned, and the Journal was retransferred to him, and he has been its principal editorial writer since that time. * Until 1856 the Record was the sole paper published in the county, and after its first struggles were over enjoyed a reasonable amount of prosperity. But in that year the Allegan Journal was established as a Republican organ, and, as the Republican party became largely predominant in the county, that paper naturally took the lion's share of the patronage. In 1858-60 the Record was owned and edited by Wil liam Francis, an accomplished gentleman of English birth, who was the candidate of the Douglas Democrats for Secre tary of State of Michigan in 1860, and who still resides in the vicinity of Allegan. He was assisted in his editorial labors by Frederick Lyman. In August, 1872, the paper was increased to a sheet twenty-nine inches by forty-seven. In the fore-part of 1861, Mr. Francis disposed of the paper to Mr. E. B. Bassett, so long its editor, who con tinued it for two years more as a thorough-goin\"- Demo cratic organ. But the war had still more increased the strength of the Republican party, and all of Mr. Bassett's efforts and ability were unable to sustain a Democratic paper in Allegan. In 1874, Mr. Edwy C. Reid, who had been the local editor of the Journal during the previous two years, be came one of the proprietors, and it has since been published by the firm of Henderson & Reid. The local department has been entirely conducted by Mr. Reid. Being a vigorous and able writer and a capable business-manager, Mr. Reid has contributed his full share to the success of the Journal during the past six years. In August, 1862, Mr. Bassett sold the Record to Mr. Henderson, who transferred the material to the Journal office, and the former paper ceased to exist, after a varied life of between nineteen and twenty years. * Mr. Henderson is believed to be the only Michigan editor who served in the army as a private. He was appointed a lieutenant iu 1864, but declined the position."], [91, "THE PRESS 83 In March, 1876, the Journal was changed to an eight page sheet, each page having six columns, and the dimen sions of the whole being thirty-one inches' by forty-four. issued on the 7th day of January, 1880. It is a bright eight-paged sheet, its dimensions being thirty inches by forty-four. Its editor is Mr. D. R. Waters, who for three years and a half held the same relation to the Allegan County Democrat. Mr. Scales is in charge of the local department. Its politics are \" Greenback, with Democratic leanings.\" Its history is necessarily short, and its future of course cannot be prognosticated, but it is vigorously written, well printed, and full of news. The editors aie able, and it may reasonably be expected that the era of prosperity which has opened before the country since the resumption of specie payments will bring prosperity to this promising journalistic enterprise. The Journal has now just passed its quarter centennial, and is apparently in the full tide of success. Besides Mr. D. C. Henderson and Mr. Reid, its editorial writers have been James D. Henderson, E. J. R. Currey, A. C. Wallin, G. H. House, William B. Williams, and Gustavus A. Morgan. THE ALLEGAN COUNTY DEMOCRAT (No. 2). From the time of the sale of the Allegan Record to the proprietor of the Journal, no Democratic paper was pub lished in Allegan County until December, 1807. On the 11th day of that mouth Mr. Freeman D. Austin issued the first number of the Allegan County Democrat, a hand some four-page sheet, twenty-six by forty inches in size. It was owned and conducted by Mr. Austin until his death, in July, 1869. THE ALLEGAN TRIBUNE. On the first day of January, 1880, Messrs. E. R. Morgan and Frank W. Bailey (the firm being Morgan & Bailey), having purchased the material and good-will of the Allegan County Democrat, issued at Allegan the first number of a new four-page paper, twenty-four inches by thirty-six, called the Allegan Tribune. It is Republican in polities, having for editor Mr. G. A. Morgan, previously connected with the Otsego Herald and the Allegan Journal. Like its compeers and rivals in Allegan journalism, it is full of news, and especially of local news. In fact, one can hardly imagine a greater contrast than that presented by the papers of forty years ago or more, which scarcely ever mentioned an event occurring in their respective counties, and those of the present day, which chronicle all the most trifling circum stances in the whole region round about. It was then controlled for a short time by Mr. Oscar Hare, but during the same year passed into the hands of Messrs. Martin T. Ryan and George C. Furber (composing the firm of Ryan & Furber), Mr. Ryan being the editor. These gentlemen carried on the establishment until the summer of 1874, when Mr. W. W. Watkins took the place of Mr. Furber, and the firm assumed the name of the Northwestern Bible and Publishing Company. In the following year Mr. 0. D. Booth purchased an interest, and the proprietors were then incorporated as a stock-company under the same name which had previously been borne by the firm. In 1876 several changes were made. In March of that year the paper was made an eight-page sheet, its entire di mensions being twenty-nine inches by forty-three. In July, Mr. D. R. Waters became the principal editor of the Democrat, and occupied that position as long as the paper existed. In October, 1876, the Northwestern Bible and Publishing Company was dissolved, and the Democrat be came the property of a stock company, composed of about twenty prominent Democrats, known as the Allegan County Democratic Association. Mr. Waters remained the editor. THE OTSEGO COURIER. In the year 1855 the State government of Michigan was in the hands of the newly-formed Republican party, while the only newspaper in Allegan County (the Allegan Record) was of Democratic politics. There Avas a good chance for a Republican paper to obtain that coveted boon of those days, the State advertising, and accordingly Mr. George A. Fitch, of the Kalamazoo Telegraph, removed a small quantity of type and other material from the office of that paper to Otsego, and established a little journal called the Otsego Courier. It accomplished its object for the time, but on the establishment of the Allegan Journal, in the spring of 1856, the party patronage naturally accrued to it, and the Courier was found to be a non-paying enterprise. The material was accordingly moved back to the Telegraph office, and the Otsego Courier ceased to exist. From this time the Democrat continued to advocate the Democratic principles suggested by its name until the sum mer of 1878. It then embraced the -cause of the Green back party, though still under the same proprietorship and editorship. It continued in its career until the close of the year 1879, when it was sold to Messrs. Morgan & Bailey, and ceased to exist as a journal. The last number was published on the 31st day of December, 1879. THE OTSEGO nERALD. Ten years after the establishment of the Otsego Courier, in the year 1865, Mr. George W. Parks founded the Otsego Herald. It was also a small paper, and its financial course was beset with difficulties, as may be seen by the number of proprietors through whose hands it passed durino* the four years of its existence. These were in succession, after Mr. Parks, S. M. Hubbard, F. D. & W. F. Austin, G. A. Morgan, Morgan & Hart, P. B. Lines, Geo. Scales, and G. A. Morgan. The Herald closed its career in 1S69. The material remained, however, and after the death of the Allegan County Record (noticed below) the Herald was revived three several times between THE ALLEGAN DEMOCRAT. Although this paper has the same politics, the same editor, and nearly the same name as the Allegan County Democrat, yet it is an entirely new journal. The material of the Allegan County Democrat was used for the establish ment of the Allegan Tribune, while, immediately after the suspension of the former paper, Mr. George Scales, the proprietor of the Plainwell Independent Republic, pur chased an entirely new outfit and established the Allegan Democrat, at Allegan, the first number of which was"], [92, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 84 1871 and 1875 by George Scales, Jerome Michell, and Thomas T. Talbot successively. In 1875 it sank to rise THE LAKE-SHORE COMMERCIAL. This paper was established at Saugatuck by Dr. A. H. Pattee, in July, 1868, under the name of the Saugatuck Commercial, the first number being issued on the 9th day of that month. Dr. Pattee published the paper about a year, also issuing at Douglas, during a part of the same time, a journal called the Douglas Messenger. The latter venture soon collapsed, and even the Commercial was not very profitable. Dr. Pattee disposed of it to a stock company, who installed E. W. Perry as manager. Not long afterward the company sold out to Myron Tarbox, and he in turn transferred the paper to John Wilson and Henry Elmeyer. These gentlemen employed Charles M. Winslow as editor. In 1877, C. F. Wasson & Co. became the pro prietors. They were succeeded in January, 1879, by L. E. Woodhull, who is still the proprietor and publisher. The paper now bears the name of the Lake- Shore Com mercial. no more. THE ALLEGAN COUNTY RECORD. Just after the suspension of the Otsego Herald, in 1869, Mr. H. E. J. Clute established in the same office, but with an entirely new outfit of material, a neat little Republican paper called the Allegan County Record. It was published by Mr. Clute alone until September, 1870, when Mr. Edwy C. Reid became a partner with him. The paper was continued until May, 1871, when the prospect of its yield ing any profit to the owners became so poor that it was discontinued. THE WEEKLY UNION. The first number of this paper was issued at Otsego on the 2d day of August, 1875, by C. H. Harris and V. V. Campbell. Mr. Campbell retired at the end of a few months, his place being taken by Mr. G. A. Morgan, who remained connected with the paper about a year. Mr. G. E. Johnson then became Mr. Harris' partner, and the paper has since been published by the firm of Harris & Johnson, the former gentleman being the editor. The Union, which was at first a four-page sheet, was enlarged to eight pages (six columns on a page) in 1878, and now vies in size and appearance with almost any country paper. A part of it, however, is printed outside of the county. AVAYLAND PAPERS. No less than three papers were published in the village of Wayland between 1870 and 1877, but none of them at tained much success, and journalism has finally been given up, at least for the present, in that place. The Wayland News was established in 1870 by A. V. Hopkins. It was published by him something less than a year, when he died. The News then passed into the hands of 0. E. White, who conducted it a little over a year, when the enterprise was abandoned. THE PLAINWELL EXPRESS. A short time afterward Mr. W. W. Secord established The Venture, but it proved to be an unfortunate one, and endured but a short time. The first newspaper published in Plainwell was the Plainwell Express, which began its career in the spring of 1868, being owned and edited by the proprietors of the Allegan County Record at Otsego. It was a small inde pendent, four-page paper, and was discontinued at the end of four months. In 1876, Mr. George L. Miles established the Wayland Courier, of which he was the editor and proprietor. This, too, was unable to stand the storm, and went down at the end of about a year. THE PLAINAVELL REPUBLIC. BARRY COUNTY'. This paper was established at Plainwell by Jerome Mitchell in February, 1871. It was a four-page sheet, with six columns on a page. It was independent in poli tics until the opening of the campaign of 1876, when it advocated the Republican side of the Presidential contest. A Mr. Hickok became a partner of Mr. Mitchell in 1878, and remained so until the absorption of the paper by the Plainwell Independent. The Republic was twice enlarged, having in the latter part of its existence eight columns on each of its sour pages. THE BARRY COUNTY PIONEER. This was the earliest newspaper published in Barry County, its first number being issued at Hastings on the 20th day of February, 1851. The proprietor was George A. Smith, who is said to have also been publisher, editor, typo, and devil, \u2014 all in one.* Through the courtesy of Mrs. O. N. Boltwood, we have been permitted to examine the tenth number of this paper, published on the 25th of April, 1851. It is a four-page sheet, each page having five columns, and being fourteen inches by twenty in size. It announces that the Barry County Pioneer is published every Friday by George A. Smith ; office two doors west of Barlow's, up stairs. Terms, taken at the office or sent by mail, one dollar per year; de livered by carrier in the village, one dollar and a half. One shilling is to be added for every three months during which payment is delayed after subscription. The charge for an advertisement of one square (ten lines or less) is THE PLAINAVELL INDEPENDENT-REPUBLIC. The first number of the Plainwell Independent was is sued on the 25th day of May, 1876, George Scales being the editor and proprietor. In June following, Mr. Scales purchased the Plainwell Republic, und the two papers were consolidated under the name of the Plainwell Independent- Republic. Mr. Scales is still the proprietor, and was the editor until the 1st of January, 1880. Since that time Mr. A. C. Roberts has been the editor. The Independent- Republic is a handsome eight-page sheet, with six columns on a page, and is devoted to local interests. It is partially printed out of the county. u * AVe think, however, he must have had the aid of the sulphurous personage last mentioned, for he advertised to deliver the paper by carrier, and it is fair to presume that the duties of that office were discharged by the gentleman from Tartarus, who is known to be a good traveler."], [93, "THE PRESS 85 fifty cents for the first insertion, and twenty-five cents for each subsequent one. For a square, one month, one dol lar; three months, two dollars; one year, six dollars; for a column, one year, twenty dollars. The number in ques tion contains a six-column story, a column of local edito rials, two columns of outside news, five columns of local and legal advertisements, and six columns of prospectuses and other worthless advertisements. Democratic polities, called the Barry County Review, which took away a large part of the Pioneer's support. A num ber of the latter sheet, dated Oct. 7, 1853, which we have perused, frequently mentions the Review under the name of the \" court-house organ\" in very bitter terms. In 1854, Mr. Knappen was obliged to sell his paper to the proprietor of the Review. The latter consolidated the two journals, adopting the original name of the Barry County Pioneer, and retaining the old series of volumes and numbers. An issue of Jan. 17, 1855, with Mr. Smith's name at its head as editor and proprietor, bears the sounding motto : The Pioneer was Democratic in politics, and the number of which we are speaking complains bitterly of treachery on the part of a faction of that party in this locality. A paragraph on local affairs reads as follows : \" Here shall the press the people's rights maintain, Unawed by tyrants, and unbribed by gain.\" \"Our village for a short time past has presented an uncommon lively appearance. New buildings are going up in various parts of it, and the almost daily arrival of emigrants from the East are con clusive evidences that they will not come amiss. The improvement of the court-house square will add much to the beauty and pleasant ness of the place. Our merchants are bestirring themselves for a fresh supply of goods, a vast amount of which, we apprehend, will be sold here during the present season. Judging from the passengers we occasionally see alighting from the stages at 'The Astor House of Michigan,' kept by H. Edgcomb, in this place, they are also alive back north of us, in the vicinity of Grand Rapids or thereabouts.\" It also states that the price is one dollar and a half per year if paid in advance, and two dollars per year if paid after six months. It shows evidences of increased pros perity, having seven columns of local and legal advertise ments. The Pioneer continued its career over eleven years more, but the organization and growth of the Republican party, the establishment of a rival newspaper in the interest of that party, and the events of the war, which still more de pressed the fortunes of the Democracy, all combined to injure the Democratic champion. In July, 1860, Mr. Smith transferred the paper to F. D. Ackley, who employed C. G. Holbrook as editor. It subsequently passed to George W. Mills, from whom it was again acquired by F. D. Ackley, in the summer of 1865. The last-named owner sold the paper to a Mr. Gensler in the spring of 1866. That gentleman conducted the paper through the summer, but with constantly-decreasing hopes, and when the returns from the autumn elections showed an overwhelming Re publican victory he abandoned the field in disgust, and the Barry County Pioneer ceased to exist. The following paragraph in the same number tends to show that there was some rascality in the good old pioneer times, as well as now : \"AVe are informed by Constable Tinkler of this village that seven gentlemen, charged with horse-stealing and other criminal offences, were, last week, arrested and lodged in Kalamazoo jail. These, to gether with the railroad haul, makes out quite a goodly number for one week.\" Whether Mr. Smith was possessed of a devil or not, it is certain that during that first year he had no other assist ance. He had some farming-land near Hastings, and in the middle of the summer he published a notice that, the editor being called upon to do his harvesting, no paper would be issued until the completion of that work ; and no paper was issued for three weeks. On another occasion the sus pension of the Pioneer for a week was excused on the plea of \" an increase in the editor's family.\" THE HASTINGS REPUBLICAN BANNER. In April, 1856, just as the young Republican party was marshaling its forces for its first great conflict, several prominent members of that party in Barry County, in cluding John S. Van Brunt, Harvey N. Sheldon, Norman Bailey, A. W. Bailey, John W. Stebbins, and C. S. Burton, under the firm-name of C. S. Burton & Co., established a newspaper at Hastings, called The Republican Banner, to advocate the principles of that party. It was placed under the charge of C. S. Burton as publisher, and of Norman Bailey as editor, and the first number was issued on the first day of May, in the year just mentioned. It bore quite as hi\"h-soundiug a motto as its rival, the Pioneer, the legend reading {apropos of the journal's name), \u2014 In December, 1851, Mr. Smith sold the paper to Ash- mun A. Knappen. That gentleman soon slightly enlarged it, making it a six-column sheet, each of its four pages being sixteen inches by twenty. In April, 1853, it was consid- erably enlarged, the pages thereafter being each eighteen inches by twenty-four. The issue of April 8, 1853 (for a perusal of which we are also indebted to Mrs. Boltwood), announced that this enlargement would take place two weeks from that time. Mr. Knappen was still the editor, and the price had been advanced to one dollar and twenty- five cents per annum. The paper then bore the motto, \" Our Country and our Country's Good,\" and the editor evidently thought that the country's good required a strict repression of intemperance. A man had just been drowned at Hastings while under the influence of liquor, apropos of which event the Pioneer contained a brief editorial denun ciation of the liquor business and an earnest contributed article in favor of the Maine law. *' Long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\" It was a sour-page sheet, each page having seven columns and being twenty-four by thirty-six inches in size. By tho courtesy of Mr. John M. Nevins, we have examined several of the early numbers of the Banner. No. 4 contains an editorial on \" Slavery and Slavery Extension,\" in which stron\"* \"round is taken in favor of the great Republican principle, opposition to the extension of slavery into free territory. The next issue states that the success of the About this time the paper is said to have displayed Whig (perhaps Free-Soil) proclivities, which alienated its Demo cratic supporters.

In the number issued on the 26th of June there appears for the first time the Republican national ticket : for President, John C. Fremont ; for Vice-President, William L. Dayton. made it a thorough-going Democratic paper again, Mr. J. H, Dennis becoming the editor. In May, 1871, that gentleman's partners sold their inter est to Charles B. Wood, the firm-name becoming Wood & Dennis. In September, Mr. Wood sold out to George C. Worth, the firm being then known as Worth & Dennis. In March, 1873, Mr. Worth transferred his interest to W. H. Holmes, when the firm of Dennis & Holmes was formed, which has ever since owned and controlled The Home Journal. On the 11th day of December, 1856, the firm-name of the proprietors became R. J. Grant & Co., when George W. Mills appeared as the editor. Several changes in the business management took place during the winter and spring, but Mr. Mills continued to be the editor until July, 1857. On the 18th of that month the firm of J. M. Nevins & Co. (J. M. Nevins and J. S. Van Brunt) took possession as proprietors, and two weeks later Mr. Nevins assumed the chair as sole editor. This position he occu pied nearly nine years, supporting the Republican and national cause with unswerving zeal through all the gloomy period of Buchanan's administration and the stormy days of the great rebellion. In May, 1859, the price was re duced from one dollar and a half to one dollar and a quarter per year, and in October, 1861, it was further reduced to one dollar a year. In 1878 the paper became an advocate of the Greenback party, and has since remained in that faith. THE BARRY COUNTY SENTINEL. In April, 1878, Philip W. Niskern began the publica tion of a Greenback organ, which he called The Barry County Sentinel. He issued thirty-one numbers, and then disposed of it to E. E. Smith, who changed its politics to Republican. After an experience of twelve months, which convinced him that the investment was not a desirable one, Mr. Smith sold the good-will and subscription-list of the Sentinel to the proprietor of the Banner. On the 7th of May, 1862, the name of the paper was changed to The Hastings Banner. On the first day of April, 1866, Mr. Nevins, who had become the sole proprietor, sold the Banner to George M. Dewey, who immediately assumed control as editor and proprietor. Mr. Dewey gave the paper the benefit of both the names it had previously borne, calling it The Hastings Republican Banner ; under which name, and under Mr. Dewey's editorial and proprietary management, it has ever since remained. From May 1, 1876, to May 1, 1877, a semi-weekly edition was published : all the rest of the time the paper has been issued once a week. As under his predecessors, so under Mr. Dewey, the Banner has been at all times a staunch Republican paper, battling with untiring energy against Democracy, Greenbackism, and all other foes of the Republican cause. THE BARRY COUNTY REPUBLICAN. The original name of this paper was The Middleville Plaindealer. Its first publishers were Marvin & Dunn, and the date of its first issue was April 14, 1870. The Plaindealer was a weekly Republican journal. It flourished a short time under Marvin & Dunn, but after the death of the latter Mr. Marvin sold out (in February, 1871) to P. W. Niskern. At the close of 1871, Mr. Niskern changed the name of the paper to the one given above, \u2014 Tlic Barry County Republican, \u2014 and thenceforward conducted it with much success until June, 1876, when he disposed of it to M. F. Jordan and William M. Watkins. Iu April, 1877, Mr. Watkins sold his interest to Mr. Jordan, who immedi ately transformed the Republican into a Greenback organ, and carried it on as such until Jan. 11, 1879. William M. Watkins, his former partner, then repurchased the paper, returned it to the Republican sold, and still conducts it in the interest of the Republican party. THE INDEPENDENT. In January, 1867, W. Roscoe Young, having obtained possession of the material formerly used to publish The Pioneer, issued the first number of a weekly paper called The Independent, professing to be independent in politics, but leaning decidedly toward Democracy. It was pub lished by Mr. Young until December, 1867, when the office was destroyed by fire, and the career of The Independ ent came to a sudden end. THE BLADE. Meanwhile, in October, 1878, Mr. F. B. Angier came to Middleville and established a weekly Republican paper called The Blade, thinking to supply the place made vacant by the departure of the older journal from the Republican ranks. It soon became apparent, -however, that two papers could not be sustained in Middleville, and in January, 1879, the material of The Blade was purchased by the proprietors of The Republican, and The Blade itself ceased to exist. THE HASTINGS HOME JOURNAL. Until the autumn of 1868 the Democracy of Barry County had no organ. At that time a subscription among leading Democrats assisted in the establishment of The Barry County Democrat, a weekly journal, of which W. Roscoe Young was the editor, the first number being issued on the 20th day of October, in that year. In October, 1869, the paper was sold to the firm of Gibson Brothers, who changed its name to The Hastings Home Journal, but carried it on as a Democratic paper until the spring of 1 870. Through the State campaign of 1870 they advocated the cause of prohibition. On the 5th November, in that year, they transferred the Journal to Dennis, Aiken & Co., who THE NASHVILLE INDEPENDENT. The inhabitants of the growing village of Nashville, re alizing the advantages to be derived from an enterprising newspaper in promoting the interests of the place, made liberal overtures in the spring of 1872 for the establish ment of a weekly publication among them. These offers were accepted by Rev. C. H. Ellis, then pastor of the Meth odist Episcopal Church of Nashville, and William S. O'Brien, a practical printer from Charlotte, Eaton Co. As"], [95, "STATISTICS 87 a result, the Nashville Independent came into existence with a flattering list of cash subscribers and considerable adver tising patronage. The paper was not a success, however, and after a struggling existence of half a year it passed into oblivion. THE NEWS. On the 3d of October, 1873, Orno Strong, a young printer with a two years' editorial experience, began the publication of a seven column weekly sheet called The News, mailing the papers to a list of sixty-eight subscribers, the result of nearly a month of energetic canvassing. This enterprise was begun amid many discouragements, as may be seen by the following item, clipped from the leading paper of the county : \" Report says that another effort is to be made to establish a news paper at Nashville, in this county, this time by a gentleman from Lawton. We trust, for the sake of the would-be publisher, the report is not true; 'for the investment cannot be other than a financial dis aster.''* He devoted himself with especial zeal to the compilation of columns of brief and spicy locals, realizing that matter of this character is usually more sought for than carefully pre- pared editorials of a political or \u00e6sthetic character. The following is the result of the venture, given in figures de- noting the bond fide circulation of The News for each suc- ceeding year of its existence: Jan. 1, 1874, 240 copies; Jau. 1, 1875, 384 ; Jan. 1, 1876, 480 ; Jan. 1, 1877, 624 ; Jan. 1, 1878, 7G8; Jan. 1, 1879, 960; Jan. 1, 1880, 1248; May 1, 1880,1560. From a seven-column folio The News has grown to a six- column quarto (eight pages), and its printing-office is fully equipped with everything needful for such an establish- ment. THE CITIZEN. On the 13th of June, 1879, the publication of another paper, called The Citizen, was begun in Nashville by Ed- win E. Smith ; but, the field not proving large enough for two journals, the new venture came to an end after a very brief existence. CHAPTER XXI. STATISTICS.

This is more than can be found in the reports of the adjutant-general of the State, but the discrepancy is principally due to the fact that re enlisting veterans were credited to the county twice, while their names appear in the reports but once. A number of men, also, served in the navy whose names do not appear in there ports. The credits also include those drafted men who, in the first months of the draft, were allowed to pay three hundred dollars each in lieu of personal service, though of course they are not represented on any rolls.

From that time until March, 1863, it shared in all the victories and defeats of the Union arms in Virginia. It was then trans ferred to Kentucky, where it remained until June, when, with Gen. Parke's division of the Ninth Army Corps, it reinforced Gen. Grant at Vicksburg. With Sherman at Jackson, Miss., it lost heavily. From Mississippi it re returned to Kentucky, and in September, 1863, marched via Cumberland Gap to Knoxville, Tenn., where, under Gen. Burnside, it took part in all the severe fighting inci dent to the siege of Knoxville, losing one-half its effective strength. ALLEGAN COUNTY SOLDIERS IN THE SECOND INFANTRY. Company I. David S.

The Third Regiment of infantry, which was recruited during the month of May, 1861, mainly from the counties of Allegan, Barry, Clinton, Easton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Muskegon, Mecosta, Montcalm, Newaygo, and Ottawa, had its rendezvous at Grand Rapids. A large number of its remaining men re- enlisted in De cember, 1863, and returned home on furlough. From Mount Clemens, Mich., the regiment returned to Virginia in May, 1861, arriving in time to plunge into the Wilder ness and bear its share on that hotly-contested field. Thereafter, at Spottsylvania, Bethesda Church, Petersburg, Weldon Railroad, and in all the other principal engage ments which culminated at Appomattox, the Second was an active participant. It was the first regiment organized in this portion of the State, the second mustered for three years, and the third to take the field from Michigan. Barry County was repre sented by about a hundred and fifty men,\")\" scattered through all its companies except I, while Allegan's representation was divided among companies A, C, E, F, I, and K. It was mustered out of service at Delaney House, D. C, July 28, 1865, and arrived at Detroit, Mich., for final pay and disbandment, August 1st of the same year. Having upon its muster-rolls the names of one thousand and forty officers and enlisted men, the regiment left Grand Rapids on the 13th of June, 1861, and proceeded directly to the seat of war on the Potomac. It was soon after as signed to the brigade commanded by Col. Israel B. Rich ardson, and first met the enemy at Blackburn's Ford, Va., July 18, 1861. Three days later Richardson's brigade was engaged in that famous conflict, the first battle of Bull Run. To show that the Michigan regiments then and there gave evidence of the material composing them, we need but cite the New York Tribune's account of that battle, from which the following is an extract: MEMBEES OF THE SECOND INFANTRY FROM BARRY COUNTY. Company B. Henry D. Thompson, disch. for disability, Sept. 16, 1862. Company 0. AVilliam S. Fox. disch. for disability, Oct. 2, 1862. Royal G.

In the preparation of the sketches of the services of the regiments great care has been taken to make them \u2014 although necessarily brief \u2014 as correct and interesting as possible. The adjutant-general's reports and the \"Red Book of Michigan\" have been closely exam ined, surviving soldiers of the various regiments have been consulted, and in many cases items have been added derived from tbe personal information of the gentleman who, under the direction of the general historian, compiled these military* sketches. That gentleman, Mr. J. S. Schenck, was formerly adjutant of the Sixteenth Illinois, and served nearly three years side by side with several of the Michigan regiments whose exploits he has here narrated. It is intended that the sketches of the various regiments shall bear some proportion as to size to the number of men from these two counties in them. \" I was told that a few regiments besides the three faithful ones of Blenker's brigade bad come in in fair order, aud that they were the Second and Third Michigan and the Massachusetts Firtt, of Rich ardson's brigade.\" Gen. McDowell also stated that \" Richardson's troops were the last to leave the field.'' When the defeated and almost disbanded Union army fell back on Washington, Richardson's brigade served as rear-guard. It maintained its position at Centreville Heights until the morning of July 22d, and when all detachments and stragglers had passed to the rear, it deliberately took up the line of march to Washington, where it arrived in perfect order. It may be proper to add here that during the Mexican war Samuel Brown, Jr., Henry Starring, Franklin H. Heath, Silas S. Price, and Chester Ross, of Allegan County, served in Capt. F. AV. Curtenius' company in the First Michigan Infantry of that period; the two men last named dying in the service. C. J. To this brigade was then assigned the duty of guarding Bailey's Cross-Roads and picketing other highways leading from Rebeldom to Alexandria aud Washington. After * Col. Richardson was a native of Arerniont, and a graduate of AA'est Point. He served in the Mexican war, aud attained the rank of major. He was made brigadier-general of volunteers in September, 1861, promoted to the rank of major-general soon after, and met his death at the battle of Antietam, Sept. 17, 1S62, whilo commanding a f This number represents all who served in both the first and secoud terms of service. division. 12"], [98, "90 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. assisting in the construction of the defenses of Washington, the Third went into winter-quarters near Alexandria, Va., where it remained until March, 1862, when it moved with McClellan's army to the Peninsula. On the 26th of November, 1863, the regiment took part in the Mine Run campaign, engaging the enemy on the 27th at Locust Grove, and on the 30th at Mine Run. With the army it returned to Brandy Station December 2d, having lost during the movement thirty-one men in killed, wounded, and missing. At the battle of Williamsburg, fought on the 5th of May, 1862, Berry's brigade* of Kearney's division moved, through mud and rain, to the front at double-quick, formed line under fire, and, immediately charging a supe rior force of the enemy, recaptured a lost position and ar tillery, and did not stop until the enemy was dislodged and beat back from his own position to the plains below. In regard to this fight, a Tribune correspondent said : \" By confessions of rebel prisoners, eight hundred of Berry's men, mostly of Michigan regiments, drove back sixteen hundred of the enemy.\" One hundred and eighty members of the regiment re enlisted as veterans Dec. 23, 1863. They received a thirty days' furlough, and at the expiration of that time returned to their command. From December, 1863, until the beginning of May, 1864, a season of inactivity prevailed. On the 4th of the latter month the Third crossed the Rapidan at Ely's Ford, ad vanced to Chancellorsville, and during the three following days was in the midst of the terrific battle of the Wilder ness, sustaining a heavy loss. It was also engaged at Todd's Tavern on the 8th and at Spottsylvania on the 12th, where it participated in the successful charge of the Second Army Corps. At the North Anna River it again encoun tered the enemy, May 23d and 24th. The Pamunky River was crossed on the 27th, and the advance continued toward Cold Harbor. During this month of continuous fighting the regiment sustained a loss of thirty-one men killed, one hundred and nineteen wounded, and twenty-nine missing. At Fair Oaks, on the 31st of May. the Third particu larly distinguished itself. Its commander, Col. Stephen G. Champlin, was severely wounded, and the gallant Capt. Sam uel A. Judd was killed. The total losses of the regiment in this action were thirty men killed, one hundred and twenty four wounded, and fifteen missing. The Prince de Joinville, an eye-witness of this battle, said : \"As at Williamsburg, Kearney comes to re-establish the fight. Berry's brigade of this division, composed of Michigan regiments and an Irish battalion, advances firm as a wall into the midst of the disordered mass which wanders over the battle-field, and does more by its example than the most powerful reinforcement.\" At Cold Harbor, on the 9th of June, 1864, the regiment, with the exception of the re-enlisted men and such as had joined since the original organization, and certain desig nated officers, was ordered home for the purpose of being discharged. The remaining officers and men \u2014 some three hundred and fifty in number \u2014 were formed into a battalion of four companies, and attached to the Fifth Michigan In fantry. The order consolidating these regiments was con firmed by the War Department June 13th, and on the 20th day of June, 1864, the old Third, which had been one of the first to take the field in defense of the government, was formally mustered out of the United States service. The Third was also engaged at Savage Station and Peach Orchard, June 29, 1862 ; Glendale (or Charles City Cross- Roads), June 30th ; Malvern Hill, July 1st ; and Grove ton (or Second Bull Run), Aug. 29, 1862. In the latter battle it lost twenty men killed, besides a large number wounded and missing. Proceeding from Edward's Ferry, Md., vid Warrenton and Falmouth, Va., to Fredericks burg, Va., the regiment was engaged at the latter place Dec. 13, 1862, losing nine men wounded. At Chancel lorsville, on the 1st, 2d, and 3d of May, 1863, it sustained a loss of sixty-three men, killed, wounded, and missino*. THIRD INFANTRY (NEW). In addition to the hundreds of thousands gone before, on the 18th of July, 1864, the President issued his proclama tion calling upon the loyal States for five hundred thousand more men. Volunteers from the several States were to be accepted for one, two, and three years, as they elected. Michigan's quota under this call was more than eighteen thousand, of which twelve thousand had to be recruited or drafted. GoA'ernor Blair determined to raise six new regi nients of infantry, viz., the Third, Fourth, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, and Thirty-first, or one in each Congressional district, and in pursuance of this plau issued his proclamation on the 21st of July, 1864. On the 29th of the same month orders were issued to reorganize the Third Infantry, and to Col. Moses B. Houghton (formerly lieutenant colonel of the old organization) was intrusted the charge of raising the new regiment. Grand Rapids was named its place of rendezvous, and the Fourth District its field for recruiting. On the 11th of June the regiment began a toilsome march vid Centreville, Va., Edward's Ferry, and Frederick City, Md., to Gettysburg, Pa. The roads were dusty, the heat was intense, and the men suffered terribly. At Get- tysburg, on the 2d and 3d days of July, 1863, the Third again dealt staggering blows to the cohorts of treason, sus- taining a loss on its side of forty-one men, killed, wounded, and missing. Having followed the enemy to Williamsport, it marched thence to Harper's Ferry, crossed the Potomac at that point, and moved forward to Manassas Gap. On the 17th of August, 1863, the regiment proceeded to Alexandria, Va., and from there to New York City, whither it had been ordered to aid in the preservation of the public peace and the keeping down of a mob durin\" the then pending draft. Remaining there some days, it proceeded up the Hudson to Troy, N. Y., where it was sta tioned two weeks. It then returned to its brigade in the Army of the Potomac, arriving at Culpepper, Va., Sept 17, 1863. The exigencies of the service did not permit the com plete organization of all these regiments before the enforce ment of the impending draft (Sept. 5, 1864), and seven \u00abompanies, which had been raised for the Thirtieth at * Composed of the Second, Third, and Fifth Michigan, and a New York regiment."], [99, "SECOND AND THIRD INFANTRY. 91 Christian Fostler, trans. to 5th Inf., June 10, 1864.

Pontiae, were distributed between the Third and Fourth, four companies going to the former and three to the latter, and the organization of the Thirtieth was abandoned. The Third, thus reinforced, completed its organization at once (October 15th), and, being mustered in with eight hun dred and seventy-nine officers and men, left camp for Nash ville, Tenn., Oct. 20, 1864, going thence to Decatur, Ala. It remained at Decatur \u2014 having meanwhile a skirmish with the enemy at that point \u2014 until November 25th, when it was transferred to Murfreesboro, Tenn., and ordered to duty at Fort Rosecrans. On the 7th of December, while Gen. Milroy was engaged at the Cedars with the principal part of Forrest's rebel com mand, Faulkner's rebel brigade of mounted infantry made a dash on the picket-line at Murfreesboro, drove in the guard, and gained possession of the town. After a spirited engagement of an hour's duration, sour companies of the Third, together with an equal number of companies of the One Hundred and Eighty-first Ohio, with a section of ar tillery, repulsed the rebels and pursued them two miles. The regiment remained at Murfreesboro and its vicinity until Jan. 16, 1865, when it was moved to Huntsville, Ala., and assigned to the Fourth Army Corps. On the 31st of January it was ordered to Eastport, Miss., and proceeded as far as Nashville, Tenn., when, the order being counter manded, it returned to Huntsville, remaining there until the middle of March. With its brigade it then marched to East Tennessee, occupying successively positions at New Market, Bull Gap, and Jonesboro', where it was employed in pursuing, capturing, and driving off the numerous guer rilla bands infesting that region. The Third was ordered to Nashville, Tenn., on the 20th of March, arrived there the 28th, and on the 15th of June, 1865, with its corps, pro ceeded by rail from Nashville to Johnsville, Tenn. ; thence by steamers down the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, arriving on the 5th of July. After a short delay the regiment proceeded in vessels to Indian ola, Texas, and thence it marched to Green Lake. On the 12th of September it started out for Western Texas, and, after a fatiguing march of fourteen days' duration, it reached San Antonio. During the following winter two companies were on duty at Gonzales. Early in the spring of 1866 the entire regiment was ordered to Victoria, Texas, and was there mustered out of the service, May 26, 1866. Marching to Indianola, it took steamers to New Orleans, going thence vid the Mississippi River to Cairo, UL, whence it was transported by railway to Detroit, Mich. It arrived there June 10, 1866, and was soon after paid off and dis charged. BARRY COUNTY OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WHO SERVED IN THE THIRD INFANTRY (FIRST TERM). Non-Commissioned Skiff. Sergt.-Maj.

During the siege of this stronghold by Gen. Banks it was in an advanced position, and participated in the assaults of May 27th and June 14th, in which it lost severely. On the 29th of June a detachment of thirty-five men formed the forlorn hope of an assaulting column which attacked the \" citadel,\" but were driven back with a loss of eight killed and nine wounded. By an order of Maj. -Gen. Banks, commanding the De partment of the Gulf, issued on the 10th of July, following the surrender of Port Hudson, the Sixth was, converted into a heavy artillery regiment, and on the 30th of the same month the order was approved by the Secretary of War. SIXTH INFANTRY. Tnis regiment was formed during the summer of 1861, having for its rendezvous the village of Kalamazoo. It was afterwards organized as heavy artillery, and on account of its almost entire isolation from other Michigan regiments during its term of service, and of the fact that it served as both infantry and artillery as occasion required, it was de nominated at State headquarters the \" peculiar regiment of Michigan.\" The regiment was stationed at Port Hudson from the last-mentioned date until March 11, 1864, engaged in gar rison duty. At the latter date, the men having mostly re-enlisted as veterans, the command proceeded to Kala mazoo, Mich., on a furlough of thirty days. On the 11th of May it arrived at Port Hudson, with its ranks well filled by men recruited in Michigan. On the 6th of June it was ordered to Morganza to serve as infantry, at which place it remained until the 24th, when it proceeded to Vicksburg, where it joined the engineer brigade. Allegan County had a large representation in its ranks. Company G, which started for the front under the com mand of Capt. Chauncey J. Bassett,* was most emphati cally an Allegan County company, and was the first entire command to leave that county's borders. Bearing upon its rolls the names of nine hundred and forty-four officers and enlisted men, and commanded by Col. Frederick W. Curtenius, of Kalamazoo, a veteran of the Mexican war, the regiment left its rendezvous Aug. 30, 1861, and proceeded to Baltimore, Md., where it remained on duty for several months. On the 23d of July it was sent to the mouth of White River, Arkansas, and thence to St. Charles, in that State, where it was attached to a regiment of infantry. A de tachment of the regiment, while on a transport en route from Vicksburg to White River, was fired upon by a rebel battery, and lost two men killed and several wounded. Early in March, 1862, it sailed for Ship Island, Miss., and from there in April proceeded to New Orleans, and was one of the first regiments to enter that city upon its surrender to Gen. Butler and Admiral Farragut. On the 15th of May it sailed up the Mississippi, and was engaged in the battle at Baton Rouge on the 5th of June, and again at the same place on the 5th of August, losing on the latter day fifty-three men. It remained but a short time at St. Charles, when it re turned to Morganza, where it was for some time employed on engineer service, but subsequently was returned to duty as heavy artillery by the chief of artillery. It was present at the surrender of Fort Morgan, Alabama, but not in time to participate in the bombardment. On the 1st of October portions of the regiment were stationed at Forts Gaines and Morgan, in Mobile Bay. From Aug. 20, 1862, until December 6th, the regiment was stationed at Metairie Ridge, guarding one of the ap proaches to New Orleans. This location was exceedingly unhealthy, and the command was so reduced that on the 6th of December, when it moved to New Orleans, only one hundred and ninety-one, out of an aggregate of seven hun dred and fifty-five, were fit for duty ; but the men soon recovered upon their arrival in the city. On the 23d of December, 1864, five companies were de tached for an expedition under Gen. Gordon Granger against Mobile, and were temporarily attached as infantry to the brigade of Gen. Bertram, with which they continued until Jan. 27, 1865, when they were returned to the regiment. On the 31st of March, Companies A and K were detached from the command at Fort Morgan and ordered to report to Gen. Granger at the front, each being equipped with a bat tery of ten-inch mortars. On their arrival they were placed in position under the guns of .the Spanish Fort, where they did fine execution at fourteen hundred yards' range. Upon the surrender of this fort the two companies manned and turned the captured guns, consisting of seven-inch Brooks rifles and one-hundred-pounder Parrotts, on the remaining rebel forts, Huger and Tracy, which soon after surrendered. In January, 1863, the regiment was with the expedition, under Gen. Weitzel, to Bayou Teche, which destroyed a rebel gunboat. In the early part of February it was stationed a few miles out from New Orleans, and on the 23d of the month accompanied an expedition to Poncha toula, where it had quite a sharp skirmish, losing two men * Capt. Bassett was coinmisioned major of a colored regiment in October, 1S02. He afterwards rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the sumo regiment, and was killed while iu command of it, during the disastrous Red River campaign. April 10th, Company B was placed on picket duty at"], [102, "94 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Navy Cove, and Company E was assigned to duty in gar risoning Fort Powell. Companies A and K rejoined the garrison at Fort Morgan, April 20th, and on the 9th of July the regiment was ordered to report to Gen. Sheridan at New Orleans, where it arrived on the 11th, and en camped at Greenville, four miles from the city. At that place it was furnished with new camp-equipage and wagon train, and placed under orders for Texas; but on the 5th of August orders were received for its muster out, which was completed on the 20th, and on the 30th it arrived at Jackson, Mich., and on the 5th of September was paid and disbanded. Its losses during the war were sixty-five men killed or died of wounds, and four hundred and fifty died of disease, \u2014 the heaviest loss by disease of any Michigan regiment during the war.

SEVENTH INFANTRY. The Seventh Regiment of Infantry was recruited during the summer of 1861, and rendezvoused at Monroe. It was mustered into the service for three years, August 22d, and, bearing upon its rolls the names of eight hundred and eighty-four officers and enlisted men, set out for Virginia, Sept. 5, 1861. The Seventh arrived at Gettysburg on the 2d of July, and immediately went into battle on Cemetery Hill. In this exposed position it remained until the close of the action, meeting and repelling some of the fiercest attacks of the enemy. So much had the regiment been depleted by its previous conflicts that only fourteen officers and one hundred and fifty-one men went into this fight. Of this small number twenty-one were killed (including the com mander, Lieut.-Col. Steele) and forty-four wounded, the total casualties being nearly half of the whole number Arriving there, it was stationed on the upper Potomac. It was one of the regiments detailed to go to Ball's Bluff, on the 21st of October, under Gen. Baker, and shared in the losses inflicted by the sudden and overwhelming attack of the enemy on that disastrous day. In the spring of 1862 it proceeded with the Army of the Potomac to the Penin sula. At Yorktown, West Point, Fair Oaks, and the \" Seven Days' Fight,\" the Seventh was an active partici pant. Retiring with the same army from the Peninsula, the enemy was again met at the second Bull Run, Aug. 30, 1862, and at South Mountain, September 14th. Three days later it stood face to face with the foe at Antietam. Here it was engaged in one of the most terrific struggles of the war, and bravely maintained itself throughout, though the victory it assisted to achieve was purchased at the cost of a list of killed and wounded embracing more than one half of its force present in action. engaged. Shortly after the Gettysburg victory the regiment was ordered to New York City to assist in preserving order during the enforcement of the draft. Returning to Vir ginia, it was engaged in skirmishing, marching, etc., until December 7th, when it went into winter-quarters at Barry's Hill. Here one hundred and fifty-three men re-enlisted as veteraos, and the regiment was sent home to recruit. After thirty days' furlough it returned to Barry's Hill. It remained there until the grand advance of the army took place, during the early days of May, 1864. From that time until the collapse of the Rebellion was rendered certain by the surrender at Appomattox, the Seventh was ever found in the fore-front of battle. In the campaign from May to November, 1864, it had lost forty-one men killed, one hundred and thirty-one wounded, thirty-six taken prisoners, and thirty reported as missing in action, some of whom were killed. After Antietam the Seventh continued with the Army of the Potomac, in its marches through Northern Virginia, until the 11th of December, 1862, when that army stood on the north side of the Kappahannock gazing across at the enemy's works at Fredericksburg. During the night of the 10th the Union pontoniers had partially constructed a pontoon-bridge across the stream, but at daylight the rebel sharpshooters soon drove them away. Volunteers were called for to cross the river and seize a foothold on the opposite shore. Lieut.-Col. Baxter, then in command, called on the Seventh for that duty, and as one man they responded to the call. Foremost of all the army, they sprang into the boats and pulled for the opposite side. The rebel bullets fell thick and fast among them and many were slain or wounded, among the latter being their gallant commander, but still they held on their way, and at length made good their landing. Close behind them came a Mas- sachusetts regiment. The two formed on the bank, dashed up to the heights above, drove the enemy from his en- trenchments, and captured several hundred prisoners at the point of the bayonet. The bridge was then completed, and a portion of the army crossed in safety. The subsequent disasters which befell the forces there assembled under Gen. Burnside cannot dim the glory gained by the Sev enth Michigan Infantry in the execution of this brilliant exploit. After the review at Washington, D. C, the regiment was ordered to Louisville, Ky., where it arrived June 23d. It was mustered out of service at Jeffersonville, Ind., July 5th, and reached Jackson, Mich., two days later, where it was paid off and disbanded.

Burnside, it participated in the stirring scenes there enacted during the fall of 1863. During the siege of Knox ville by the rebels under Longstreet the Eighth occupied the front line of works, and assisted to repel the fierce assault on Fort Sanders, Nov. 29, 1863. The regiment during this period endured many hardships and privations from want of sufficient food and clothing.

The regiment then re-enlisted as veteran volunteers, and on the 8th of January commenced its march across the mountains vid Cumberland Gap. Nicholasville, Ky., was reached January 19th ; a march of two hundred miles, through icy passes and over rough mountain-roads, having been performed in ten days. Arriving home, a large num ber of recruits was obtained, and on the 9th of March, 1864, the regiment left its rendezvous at Flint, and again proceeded to join the Ninth Army Corps in Virginia. Thenceforth its history was identified with that of the Army of the Potomac. In the battle of the Wilderness it lost ninety-nine men, killed, wounded, and missing; at Spottsylvania, forty-nine; at Bethesda Church, fifty-two; at Petersburg, June 17th and 18th, forty-nine men. At the Crater, Weldon Railroad, Ream's Station, Poplar Grove Church, Pegram Farm, Boydton Road, and Hatcher's Run, it was also engaged, losing numerously in killed, wounded, and missing. During the year ending Nov. 1, 1864, it had lost in killed, or died of wounds received in action, eighty six men ; died of disease, forty ; wounded in action, two hundred and eighty-seven ; missing in action, twenty-nine ; taken prisoners, thirty-seven ; while it had gained by re enlistment of veterans two hundred and ninety-nine, and by the joining of recruits, five hundred and forty-two. EIGHTH INFANTRY This regiment rendezvoused at Detroit. It was mustered into the service Sept. 23, 1861, and on the 27th of the same month, having on its rolls the names of nine hundred and fifteen officers and enlisted men, it set out for the front, led by the gallant Col. William M. Fenton, of Flint. At Annapolis, Md., ou the 19th of October, 1861, it embarked as part of the expedition which under Gen. T. W. Sherman was to operate against the enemy along the South Atlantic coast. From this time until the termina tion of the Antietam campaign the regiment was very ac tively engaged, participating in nine battles, occurring in four different States, viz. : Hilton Head, S. C. Nov. 7, 1861; Port Royal Ferry, S. C, Jan. 1, 1862; Fort Pu laski, Ga., April 14, 1862; Wilmington Island, Ga., April 16, 1862 ; James Island, S. C, June 16, 1862 ; Bull Run, Va., Aug. 29 and 30, 1862; Chantilly, Va., Sept. 1, 1862; South Mountain, Md., Sept. 14, 1862; and Antie tam, Md., Sept. 17, 1862. In the final campaign in Virginia the Eighth bore a dis tinguished part. It assisted to repulse the enemy when he assaulted Fort Steadman, March 25, 1865, and on the 2d of April was engaged in the attack on his position at Fort Mahon, when it carried the works in its front, and was the first regiment to place its colors on that rebel stronghold. It occupied Petersburg, April 3d, and soon after marched to City Point, whence it embarked on transports to Alex andria, Va. It was mustered out of service at Delaney House, D. C, July 30, 1865, and, arriving in Detroit, Mich., Aug. 3, 1865, was paid in full and disbanded. Its casualties at Wilmington Island were fourteen killed and thirty wounded ; at James Island, thirteen killed, ninety-seven wounded, thirty-five missing, and thirty-five taken prisoners. The alterations from the time of its en listment to Nov. 1, 1862, showed the following astonishing results : Number of men discharged,* two hundred and sixty; died of disease, fifty-five ; killed in battle or died of wounds received in action, eighty-nine; wounded in action, two hundred and forty-three ; deserted, ten ; taken pris- MEMBERS OF THE EIGHTH INFANTRY FROM BARRY COUNTY.

During its stay at that place the men of the Ninth were terribly afflicted with measles and other diseases, and as many as four hundred were on the sick-list at one time. The regiment remained at its winter cantonment until February, 1862. Alvan B. Durham, veteran, died of disease at Washington, D. C, May 4, 1865. John G. Dowd, veteran, enl.

Immediately after the capture of Fort Donelson it was ordered to Nashville, Tenn., and after a few weeks to Mur freesboro, Tenn , where it was on garrison duty nearly all the time until July 13, 1862. During that period, how ever, it ibrmed part of Gen. Negley's command, which marched as far south as the Tennessee River, opposite Chattanooga, and then returned to Murfreesboro.

On the 13th of July, at four o'clock in the morning, the six companies stationed at Murfreeaboro were attacked by three thousand rebel cavalry under Gen. Forrest. The Third Minnesota Infantry, with a battery, was encamped two miles northwest of the town. The first attack on the camp of five companies \u2014 one company was at the court house \u2014 was repulsed. Gen. Forrest then attacked the single company in the court-house. Col. Parkhurst sent to the commander of the Miunescta regiment for aid, which the latter, perhaps for good reasons, declined to give. The one company in the court-house held the foe at bay two hours, but was obliged to surrender. James I. Fullmer, disch. for disability, Oct. 26, 1862. George W. Peck, disch. for disability. Close R.

The enlisted men were paroled at McMinnville, but the officers were not released until several months later. In the latter part of December, 1862 (the prisoners taken at Murfreesboro having been exchanged and returned to duty) the regiment was detailed as provost-guard of the Fourteenth Corps, with Col. (afterwards General) Parkhurst as provost-marshal. Gen. Thomas remarked, when he made the detail, that he had fully acquainted himself with the conduct of the regiment in the defense of Murfreesboro, and that he needed just such a force for provost-guard.

When that gallant officer assumed command of the Army of the Cumberland, after Chickamauga, Col.

In the latter part of February, 1864, they again appeared at Chattanooga, with their numbers in creased to about five hundred men. The regiment was again ordered to act as provost-guard of the Army of the Cum berland, and during the summer and autumn participated in all the movements of that army in Georgia and Tennes see. It entered Atlanta on its evacuation by the enemy, aud was there engaged in provost duty until that city was abandoned by the Union forces, when it returned to Chat tanooga. It was largely recruited during the season, and, notwithstanding the muster out of non- veterans whose terms had expired, had eight hundred and ninety-seven enlisted men on the 1st of November, 1864. It remained in Chat tanooga until the 27th of March, 1865, when it was moved to Nashville. There it stayed on duty at headquarters and as guard at the military prison until the 15th of September, when it was mustered out of service.

The Twelfth Regiment of Michigan Infantry was mus tered into the United States service at Niles, March 5, 1862, and on the 18th of the same month proceeded to St. Louis, Mo. From there it was hurried forward to the Tennessee River, and reached Pittsburg Landing in time to take part in the battles fought there on the 6th and 7th of April. It was also engaged in the battle of Metamora. on the Hatchie River, Oct. 5, 1862. From the time of its organization to Nov. 1, 1862, it had lost forty-seven men killed, or died of wounds received in action, ninety two wounded in action, one hundred and six died of dis ease, and one hundred and six men taken prisoners at Shiloh. MEMBERS FROM ALLEGAN COUNTY. On the 24th of December, 1862, while one hundred and fifteen of the regiment were occupying a block-house at Middleburg, Tenn., they were attacked by a force of the enemy's cavalry three thousand strong.

The Thirteenth joined Gen. Buell's forces, and with him marched through Kentucky and Ten nessee, vid Bowling Green and Nashville, to Pittsburg Landing, which place it reached, after a forced march, near the close of the second day's battle, too late to take part in the conflict. From that time until the evacuation of Corinth by Beauregard, the Thirteenth was engaged in the arduous picket and pick-and-shovel duties performed by Gen. Halleck's army during the siege.

It shared all the hardships of that long march across the States of Tennessee and Kentucky, and soon after reach ing Louisville, in October, 1862, retraced its weary steps in pursuit of its old enemy, the rebel Gen. Bragg. It aided in chasing him and his motley forces out of Ken tucky, but was not present at any heavy engagement.

On the 29th it was deployed as skirmishers, and lost several in killed and wounded. On the 31st of December, 1862, and the 1st and 2d of January, 1863, the regiment was hotly en gaged in the battle of Stone River, having twenty-five killed, sixty-two wounded, and eight missing out of two hundred aud twenty-four who entered the conflict.

And when the corps marched into Atlanta, on the afternoon of November 15th, the city was already in flames, no more to be made a rebel stronghold. the 31st of December it recaptured by a bayonet charge two Union guns which had fallen into the hands of the enemy. After the victory at Stone River the Thirteenth was en gaged in building fortifications at Murfreesboro, and in scouting through the adjoining parts of Tennessee, until the 24th of June, 1863, when it advanced with Gen. Rose crans against Bragg. After various marches and counter marches in rear of the retreating forces of the latter general, the regiment, with its division, moved from Hillsboro', Tenn., to cross the Cumberland Mountains. By a four days' march, over mountain ranges rising three thousand feet above the valleys, along roads so steep that the artil lery and ambulances, and the baggage, supply- and ammu nition-wagons often had to be hauled up by hand, the divi sion reached the Sequatchie Valley. It then crossed the Tennessee River at Shell Mound, and, marching upon Chattanooga, the Thirteenth was one of the first regiments to occupy that place. On the following morning Gen. Sherman's army set out on the celebrated \" march to the sea\" with one day's rations in the haversacks and none in the supply-trains. This re nowned but comparatively easy achievement was accom plished by sixty thousand men,* veterans, all of them, and the flower of the whole Western army, who swept in a resistless mass through Georgia, brushing contemptuously aside the few feeble detachments of militia and conscripts which endeavored to oppose them, without delaying for a moment their own mighty and majestic advance. Having reached Savannah on the 10th of December, 1864, the regiment was on duty in the trenches before that city until the 21st of the same month, when Hardee's rebel forces evacuated the place. On the 17th of January, 1865, * The force under the immediate command of Gen. Sherman in his march through Georgia and the Carolinas was composed of the Fif teenth and Seventeenth Army Corps, or \" Army of the Tennessee,\" under Gen. Howard, as the right wing, and the Fourteenth and Twentieth Army Corps, or \"Army of Georgia,\" under Gen. Slocum, as the left wing, while Kilpatrick's division of cavalry guarded the front, fiiinks, and rear. On the 19th and 20th days of September, 1863, the regiment was in the midst of the hotly contested field of Chickamauga, where, although the Union troops, being outnumbered, were forced to retire from the field, the rebel loss far exceeded their own. The Thirteenth went into this battle with two hundred and seventeen officers and men, and of that number lost twenty-five killed, fifty seven wounded, and twenty-five missing, some of whom were probably killed. The total number of those killed or mortally wounded in action during the year ending Nov. 1, 1863, was fifty-one, while there were ninety-two others wounded, sixty-six who died of disease, and one hundred and sixty-two who were discharged for disability. The Fourteenth and Twentieth Army Corps formed the major por tion of the Army of the Cumberland during the Atlanta campaign of 1864, but at the beginning of Gen. Sherman's \" march to the sea\" the name of Army of Georgia was adopted, to distinguish Gen. Slo cum's command from the troops commanded by Gen. Thomas, who still remained in command of the Army and Department of the Cum berland, with headquarters at Nashville, Tenn. These four army corps already mentioned were composed of three divisions each, except the Fifteenth, which had four divisions, and each corps, having its own artillery, ammunition, ambulance, pontoon and supply trains, was a separate and well-equipped army in itself. When no enemy appeared the corps moved on parallel roads from ten to fifteen miles distant from each other. In case fighting was appre hended, the two corps forming a wing were massed upon one road. The Fourteenth Corps, commanded by Gen. Jeff. C. Davis, with Kilpatrick's cavalry, was usually to be found on the extreme left flank of the armies. Its First, Second, and Third Divisions were commanded respectively by Gens. Carlin, J. D. Morgan, and Baird, and their movements were made in the following order: Carlin, with the First Division, wculd take the advance for three days ; from two to five miles in rear of him was Morgan, with the Second ; while in the rear was Baird, encumbered and struggling to bring forward over swamps, creeks, and rivers the corps trains of six hundred wagons, to each of which was attached six mules, guided with single rein by a profane Northern Jehu, who did not seem to enjoy his position unless covered with mud from spur to visor. On the morning of the fourth day Carlin would fall in in the rear, taking Baird's position, Baird would move in the centre, while Morgan took the advance, and thus they alternated at the beginning of each fourth day. Meantime, foraging parties of from fifty to sixty men, detailed daily from each regiment, scoured the country in front and on the flanks for provisions. Indeed, so anxious were' these foragers to '* strike a fresh plantation\" before those of other commands that they usually left camp as early as two o'clock a.m., and throughout the day kept in advance of the main column of troops by a distance of from five to ten miles, very frequently being found in advance of Kilpat rick's cavalry. Whether on foot, on mules, or mounted on Southern thoroughbreds, jolting along in a loaded plantation cart, or riding into camp seated in a sumptuous barouche, the foragers of the Fourteenth Corps cared little for Wheeler's, Butler's, or Hampton's rebel cavalry, and when attacked by them, readily organized their skirmish line and reserve, without officers, and, advancing, cleared their way. Thus did Sherman's armies bowl \" down to the sea,\" and after the proud and defiant city of Savannah was within their grasp the same scenes were re-enacted in the march northwards through the Carolinas. On the 5th of November the Thirteenth, together with the Twenty-First and Twenty-Second Michigan Infantry and the Eighteenth Ohio Infantry, was organized into a brigade of engineers and assigned to duty at Chattanooga, being attached to the headquarters of the Department of the Cumberland. It was present at the battles of Mission Ridge and Lookout Mountain, but was not seriously en gaged. During the months of December, 1863, and January, 1864, it was stationed on the Chickamauga, engaged in picket duty and in cutting logs for building warehouses at Chattanooga. The Thirteenth re-enlisted as a veteran organization Jan uary 17, 1864, and on the 5th of February started home, arriving at Kalamazoo on the 12th. After the usual veteran furlough the regiment returned to the front on the 26th of March, with its numbers increased by over four hundred new recruits. Chattanooga was again reached April 20, 1864, and for five months from that time the regiment was stationed at Lookout Mountain, engaged in the construction of military hospitals and guarding the sick and wounded sent back from Sherman's army. It was then relieved from engineer duty and assigned to the Second Brigade, First Division, Fourteenth Army Corps. After a severe march through Northern Alabama, in pursuit of Forrest's and Roddy 's rebel cavalry, the regi ment joined its brigade at Rome, Ga., on the 1st of No vember. As the Fourteenth and other corps retraced their steps towards Atlanta, the towns on the route, bridges, tele-"], [109, "THIRTEENTH INFANTRY. 101 the regiment advanced with the Army of Georgia up the right bank of the Savannah River to Sisters' Ferry, where, after much labor and delay, it crossed into South Carolina. His presence was unknown to the Union troops in his front, and when Carlin's troops moved out on the morning of the 19th, they did so with buoyant spirits and the long, swinging stride so characteristic of this army. Johnston's army and line of earthworks were scarcely five miles dis tant from the place where Morgan encamped on the night of the 18th. Therefore, Carlin had hardly given room for Morgan to place his command on the road when his (Car lin's) advance struck the enemy,* and at once became hotly engaged. Morgan's troops hurried forward on the double quick and took position, by orders of Gen. Davis, on Car lin's right, while the two divisions of the Twentieth Corps came up with all possible speed and went into line on his lest. Thence it proceeded, via Barnwell Court-House,Williston, and Lexington, to near Columbia, S. C. ; there it crossed the Saluda River, and, moving up the west bank of the Catawba, crossed the latter river at Rocky Mount, where rains, mud, and swollen streams again hindered the Fourteenth Corps for more than a week. After making the passage of the Catawba, the command was hurried forward by forced marches to Cheraw, where, on the south bauk of Great Pe dee, the main forces were overtaken. From there to Fayetteville, N. C., skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry was a daily occurrence. The enemy under Hardee was driven out of the latter place and pursued to Averysboro', N. C, where, on the 16th of March, a sharp engagement ensued ; the enemy being driven from the field, losing heavily in killed and wounded, besides many prisoners, \u2014 among the latter being Col. Rhett and his famous regiment of young South Carolinians. At the beginning of the battle the First Division ad vanced with confident steps to what they expected would be but a repetition of their former easy victories, and at one time the Thirteenth Michigan gained a position within six rods of the enemy's intrenchments, but the storm of lead was too severe to be withstood. The brave Col. Willard G. Eaton, of Otsego, was shot dead at the head of his men, and at length the whole division was compelled to fall back to the shelter of a low acclivity within easy musket-range of the enemy's works. The Union forces operating in this field were those of the Fourteenth and Twentieth Army Corps, commanded by Gen. Slocum ; the Army of the Tennessee, or right wing, being some twenty-five or thirty miles to the east ward, moving on Goldsboro'. One division of the Four teenth Corps and of the Twentieth were guarding their re spective corps-trains, leaving but four small divisions \u2014 at the most not more than twenty thousand men, and one third of those shoeless \u2014 to engage such numbers as might oppose them. From Averysboro' the Fourteenth Corps took the advance, Morgan's Second Division leading, and Carlin's First coming next. Baird was guarding the train, while the two divisions of the Twentieth Corps were in the rear of Carlin. During the 17th and 18th of March, Morgan's skirmishers had several encounters with the enemy, but the latter rapidly retired whenever his columns were seen advancing, until late in the afternoon of the 18th, when the Confederates disputed his further progress with artillery, supported by infantry and cavalry. The battle raged with wavering fortunes all the rest of the day. Johnston, in the hopes of destroying before reinforce ments could come up a force much less than his own, forced the fight, but the men who here represented the Union arms were the surviving heroes of Donelson, Shiloh, Island No. 10, Corinth, Perrysville, Stone River, Chickamauga, Mission ary Ridge, and Lookout Mountain, besides the score of bat tles fought during the Atlanta campaign ; while the east ern troops of the Twentieth Corps had breasted the leaden storm on the Peninsula, at Chantilly, Antietam, Freder icksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg before joining the Army of the Cumberland. They were men who had been out two months from Savannah, receiving during that time no mails, letters, or tidings from home, and they did not piopose to be balked in their onward march now, or to assist in filling rebel prison-pens, and the oft-repeated as saults of the enemy were met by a withering fire and counter-charges which sent them hurrying to the shelter of the woods. Morgan's First Brigade, composed of the Tenth and Fourteenth Michigan Infantry, Sixteenth and Sixtieth Illinois Infantry, and Seventeenth New York Infantry, be ing in the advance, immediately formed line of battle and moved forward, when the enemy again retired. The regi ments of this brigade stacked arms on their color-lines and encamped for the night. Gen. Sherman, with his staff and escort, also established his headquarters in the midst of this brigade the same evening. Early on the morning of the 19th the general commanding set out to join the right wing, and Carlin's First Division of the Fourteenth Corps moved to the front, to take the advance for the three succeeding days. By this time Gen. Joseph E. John ston, one of the best officers in the Confederate service, had collected all the available rebel troops in Georgia, North and South Carolina, and was prepared with near forty thous and men to make one desperate effort to stop Sherman's advance toward Richmond, or at least to defeat his lest wing. He accordingly took up a strong position near the little village of Bentonville, which gave its name to the While Carlin's division and the Twentieth Corps were so warmly engaged on the open ground, Morgan was equally busy in the pines on the right, and his First Brigade, under Gen. Vandever, composed of the Michigan, Illinois, and New York Regiments previously mentioned, had the best fortune of any of the troops in the battle of that day. This brigade was stationed on the extreme right, and its right flank was guarded by an impenetrable swamp. During the intervals between the charges of the enemy, Vandever's brigade was enabled to erect log breastworks, the trees being felled and cut into the required lengths with hatchets, of which nearly every man carried one in his waist-belt. Late in the afternoon, during a desperate charge on Mor gan's left, one of his brigades gave way, and a column of * The rebels occupied low, swampy ground.

Wheeling to the left, they moved down in rear of Vandever's brigade, making it necessary for the Union troops to occupy the front side of their own works, from before which their immediate oppo nents had happily retired. Here a short sharp fight of a few moments' duration was ended by Vandever's men leap ing forward in a charge, and compelling the surrender of several hundred rebels. In this battle the Thirteenth Mich igan Infantry lost one hundred and ten officers and men, killed, wounded, and captured. During the long night which succeeded, Gen. Sherman was marching the Army of the Tennessee to the reinforcement of the almost over whelmed, hut not defeated, Army of Georgia. He arrived at daylight of the 20th, and a day or so later Johnston was driven from the field. Walter Wood, disch. for disability, Sept. 17, 1862. Milton B. Williams, disch. by order, June 13, 1865.

The Seventeenth promptly changed front under a heavy fire, and moved out with the Seventy-Ninth New York to protect the battery, lying in line of battle until nearly four p.m., exposed to a severe fire from Drayton's brigade of South Carolina infantry, posted in its immediate front. Being unable to reply to this fire, and having become im patient and anxious to advance', the order to charge upon the enemy was received with enthusiastic cheers. The reo*inicnt, being on the extreme right of Wilcox's division, moved rapidly forward through an open field upon the enemy's position, under a terrific storm of lead and iron from the stone fences in front and the batteries on the right; then, with cheer after cheer, sent up in defiant an swer to the peculiar rebel yell, the Seventeenth gallantly advanced to within easy musket-range without firing a shot. It then opened a murderous fire upon the enemy, and, steadily advancing the extreme right of the regiment, it swung round, obtaining an enfilading fire upon the rebels intrenched behind the stone walls. Unable to withstand this destructive fire, the enemy broke in confusion, and the left of the regiment charged over the walls with shouts of triumph, pursuing the fleeing remnants of Drayton's com mand over the crest and far down the mountain slope, gaining and holding the key-point of the battle-field. The splendid valor and extraordinary coolness of the raw recruits of the Seventeenth in this engagement gave the regiment much celebrity, and this conflict has since been mentioned in history as one of the most brilliant achievements of the war. The regiment suffered severely at South Mountain, having twenty-seven officers and men killed and one hun dred and fourteen wounded. Three days later, at Antietam, it was again hotly engaged, sustaining a loss of eighteen killed and eighty-seven wounded. Company G. Fred. Hosier, disch. by order, June 6, 1S65.

This gallant command, celebrated as the \" Stonewall\" regiment of Gen. Wilcox's division of the Ninth Army Corps, was organized at Detroit Barracks, in the summer of 1862, by State Inspector-General James E. Pittman. Its original commanding officer, Col. William H. Withington, was commissioned Aug. 11, 1862, and on the 21st of the same month the regiment was mustered into the United States service for three years. Company D embraced a large majority of the members of the regiment from Allegan and Barry Counties. Under the command of Col. Withington, the regiment left its rendezvous on the 27th of August, 1862, and pro ceeded directly to Washington. Scarcely had it arrived at that place when it was assigned to Gen. Wilcox's division, and in less than three weeks from the time of leaving Michi gan its members were gallantly battling for their country at South Mountain. After following Lee's defeated army through Northern Virginia, and camping for a while at Falmouth, the regi ment crossed the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg, but did not participate in the battle of that place. It remained in the Army of the Potomac through tbe winter, but in the spring was ordered to Kentucky. After a short stay in that State, it proceeded with the Ninth Army Corps to Mississippi, and joined Gen. Grant. It was stationed at Haynes' Bluff and Milldale, and was slightly engaged before Jackson on the 10th of June. On the evening of the 13th of September the regiment marched from Frederick City, Md., \u2014 where it had bi vouacked the night before with the rest of the Ninth Army Corps, \u2014 over the National turnpike 'in the direction of South Mountain, and about midnight rested for a few hours not far from Middletown. Before daybreak of the 14th Middletown was passed; the base of the mountain being reached about nine o'clock A.M. The enemy was found in force on each side of a gap, holding each crest of the moun tain, and strongly posted behind stone fences and other available shelter, with his batteries in commanding posi tions enfilading the main road. The regiment was then ordered to advance up the Sharpsburg road. It soon returned to Kentucky, and moved thence with Burnside's army into East Tennessee. It took part in numerous movements and counter-movements for which the forces in East Tennessee became famous, and on the 16th of November was acting as the rear-guard of the army, which was falling back towards Knoxville. While it was crossing Turkey Creek, near Campbell's Station, the enemy attacked in force, and a sharp engagement followed. The Seventeenth, with its brigade, steadily covered the rear of the army, having twenty-six officers and men killed and wounded during the fight. This movement was executed in common by the whole of Wilcox's division, which proceeded far up towards the crest of the mountain and moved to the support of a sec tion of Cook's battery, which had been sent up to open on the enemy's guns on the right of the gap. The division was about to deploy, when the rebels suddenly opened at two hundred yards with a battery, throwing shot and shell, killing several in the regiment, and driving back the bat tery ; the cannoniers of which, with their horses and lim bers, rushed back through the ranks of the infantry, causing a temporary panic among some of the troops, that might have resulted in the loss of the guns had the enemy taken advantage of it. That night the whole Union force moved into Knoxville, and from then until the retreat of the enemy, on the 4th of December, the regiment was busily engaged in the defense of that place, suffering greatly from want of rations, but gallantly performing its duty. After the defeat of the Con federates, the marching up and down the Tennessee Valley"], [115, "FOURTEENTH, SEVENTEENTH, AND NINETEENTH INFANTRY. 107 was resumed, and was kept up, with some intervals of rest, throughout the winter.

In one of these charges the colors of the Fourth Mississippi were captured by the Nineteenth Michigan. column found the enemy in force and strongly posted, at Thompson's Station, nine miles from Franklin. At the point where the railroad crosses the turnpike the rebels opened fire on the forces of Col. Coburn, who immediately formed his men, and ordered a section of the battery to occupy a hill on the left of the road, sending the Nineteenth Michigan and the Twenty-Second Wisconsin to support it. The Thirty-Third and Eighty-Fifth Indiana, with the other guns of the battery, took position on a hill at the right. The enemy had two batteries posted on a range of hills three-fourths of a mile in front and south of the position occupied by Coburn's troops. The Indiana regiments made a demonstration on the left of the enemy, to draw him out or charge his batteries, as circumstances might dictate. This movement was made under a most galling fire from the enemy's batteries, and when the position was reached two entire brigades of dismounted rebel cavalry were dis closed strongly posted behind stone walls and other de fenses. The fighting became still more desperate. The enemy, having gained possession of the hill on the east of the road, was sweeping the Northern ranks with canister, and, bravely as the Union troops fought, it soon became evident that the struggle was hopeless. Their ammunition was nearly ex hausted, and Forrest, who had already cut them off from Franklin, was advancing on their rear. Col. Coburn faced his command to the north to repel this new danger, and thus Forrest was held in check until the Union men had expended their last round of ammunition. Then the brave band fixed bayonets, determined to charge through the enemy's lines and escape; but just then it was discovered that still another line lay in reserve, and still another bat tery opened on them from an unexpected quarter. Escape was now hopeless, and to avoid a further and useless loss of life the command surrendered. Col. Gilbert had had his horse shot under him in the early part of the fight, and throughout all the fierce engagement had borne himself most gallantly. When he offered his sword to the Confed erate commander the latter declined to receive it, with the remark that \" so brave an officer, commanding so gallant a regiment,* deserves to retain his arms.\" As it was found impossible to advance farther under the severe and incessant fire, these regiments were ordered to return to their former position on the hill, supported by a squadron of cavalry ; but for some unexplained reason the cavalry failed to occupy the supporting position, as in tended. No sooner had the two regiments commenced to fall back than they were pursued by two rebel regiments, firing rapid volleys into the retiring Union force, which was at the same time under fire from the enemy's artillery. A part of the Nineteenth had escaped capture at Thomp son's Station. This small body, with those who had been left in camp at Franklin, were sent to Brentwood^organized with the remaining fragments of the brigade, and placed under command of an officer of another regiment. This force was surrendered to the rebel general Forrest on the 25th of March, 1863, without the firing of a gun. The enlisted men were soon paroled and sent North ; the com missioned officers were, exchanged on the 25th of May following. But as soon as they reached the hill the Indianians turned upon their rebel pursuers and drove them back on the run ; killing Col. Earle, of Arkansas. The enemy rallied, charged desperately, and was again handsomely repulsed ; but it soon became evident that Col. Coburn's command had here encountered the entire cavalry force of Bragg's army, eighteen thousand strong, consisting of brigades com manded respectively by Gens. Forrest, Wheeler, French, Armstrong, Jackson, Crosby, and Martin, all under the command of Gen. Van Dorn. The regiment was reorganized at Camp Chase, Ohio, and on the 8th of June, 1863, left Columbus to engage once more in service at the front. It reached Nashville on the 11th, and from that time was employed in ordinary camp and picket duty until July, when it formed a part of Rose crans' column advancing on Tullahoma. The regiment was ordered back to Murfreesboro on the 23d of July, to do garrison duty in the fortifications at that point and along Stone River, where Company D was captured on the 5th of October by a rebel cavalry force, under Gen. Wheeler. After having been plundered, the men were released on parole. The enemy, under Forrest, then advanced on the posi tion occupied by the Nineteenth Michigan and its com panion regiment, the Twenty-Second Wisconsin. At the time the attack was made the section of artillery posted with these regiments hurriedly left its position, and at the same time three companies of the Wisconsin regiment, with their lieutenant-colonel (Bloodgood), abandoned the field without orders, moving off by the left flank, and join ing the retreating Union cavalry and artillery. The Nine teenth Michigan and the remainder of the Twenty-Second Wisconsin, however, bravely poured in their fire, and held their assailants at bay fully twenty minutes. About the last of October the Nineteenth was ordered to McMinnville, Tenn., where it remained engaged in the construction of fortifications and similar duty until the 21st of April, 1864, when it was ordered to join its division and march with the strong columns of Sherman into Georgia. It reached Lookout Valley on the 30th, and moved forward with the army on the 3d of May, being then in the Twentieth Army Corps. Moving by way of Buzzard Roost aud Snake Creek Gap to Resaca, it was, Forrest, checked in his advance, made a circuit to the cast with his whole force, beyond the ground occupied by Col. Coburn, with the intention of turning his (Coburn's) left flank. The Nineteenth and Twenty-Second were then moved to the west side of the turnpike, leaving the Thirty-Third and Eighty- Fifth Indiana to protect the south ern acclivity of the hill. The four regiments had scarcely formed in line behind the crest when Armstrong's rebel brigade charged from the east and the Texans from the south. The battle now became terrific.

In the terrific engagement sought on the morning of De cember 31st, which was commenced by Cheatham's, Cle burn's, and McGown's rebel divisions of Hardce's corps, which fell unexpectedly on McCook, who commanded the right wing of the national forces, first Johnson's and then Davis' division was driven back in inextricable disorder. Their defeat was almost simultaneous with the attack, and upon Sheridan's division of McCook's corps \u2014 composed of Sill's, Roberts', and Shaefer's brigades \u2014 devolved the task of checking the impetuous onset of the victorious foe. This single division, outflanked and surrounded by panic-stricken fugitives, must give battle to three divisions of a triumphant and exultant enemy, and must at least hold them in check until the general in command could make dispositions to meet the terrible emergency.

Most nobly did Gen. Sheridan and his division fulfill their task. Four times they repulsed the rebel host. Sur rounded, outflanked, outnumbered, in danger of utter de struction, and pressed back into the cedar thickets in their rear, they fought on till one-fourth of their number lay bleeding and dying upon the field, \u2014 till two out of three of their brigade commanders were killed, \u2014 till every gun and cartridge-box was empty, and then they retired slowly, steadily, and in good order.

Sheridan was heard to say to his commanding general, with touching pathos, \" Here is all that is left of us, general.\" His men were even then clamoring for ammunition, and an hour later were again in line of battle. His division consisted of six thousand four hundred and ninety-five men. They lost in that fearful conflict among the cedars seventeen hundred in killed, wouuded, and missing, including seventy officers, two of whom were brigadiers, and the only remain ing brigadier fell before nightfall.

Of the thirty-five missing, twenty-one were known to be wounded. Among the wounded and captured was Col. McCreery, while Lieut.-Col. Morris B. Wells was left dead on the field. Gen.

On the 8th the regiment was engaged in heavy skir mishing during the entire day and night. On the suc ceeding day the enemy pressed Cox's lines strongly without making an assault, and at the same time attempted to turn his right, but failed on account of a prompt reinforcement, of which the Twenty-Eighth formed a part. On the morn ing of the 10th the rebels made a fierce and determined charge upon the left, breaking the lines, but were finally repulsed. The Second Brigade charged the rebels on the double-quick, driving them back, and taking over three hundred prisoners, among whom were several field-officers. About two p.m. the enemy made a heavy and desperate onset on the left and centre of Gen. Cox's lines, but again most signally failed by reason of reinforcements coming up so promptly from the right. The Second Brigade, among the first to arrive, fought most gallantly for about two hours, when the enemy retired from the field, leaving his dead and wounded and a large number of prisoners. In this spirited engagement the regiment lost seven men killed and thirteen wounded. John Strouse, must, out J line 8, 1865. Anthony Thompson, must, out June 8, 1865. Byron W.

On account of the numerous attempts made by the enemy in Canada to organize plundering raids against our northern border, authority was given by the War Depart ment to the Governor of Michigan, in the autumn of 1864, to raise a regiment of infantry for one year's service, especially designed to guard the Michigan frontier. Its formation, under the name of the Thirtieth Michigan In fantry, was begun at Jackson in November, 1864, and was completed at Detroit on the 9th of January, 1S65.

This regiment, every company of which contained men from Allegan and Barry Counties, was organized under the law of Aug. 3, 1861, authorizing the President to receive into service five hundred thousand volunteers. Its original members rendezvoused at Marshall during the months of August and September, 1861, remaining there in camp of instruction, busily preparing for their duties in the field, until the 17th of December, 1861. When the organization was completed, the companies were detached and stationed at different points along the Detroit and St. Clair Rivers, \u2014 at Fort Gratiot, St. Clair, Wyandotte, Jackson, Fenton, Detroit, and Detroit Bar racks. But the speedy collapse of the Rebellion put an end to Canadian raids, and the regiment, although the men were ready for service, had no active duty to perform. It remained on duty until the 30th of June, 1865, and was then mustered out. It was then, with an aggregate force of one thousand and thirty-two men and officers, commanded by Col.

By an act of Congress passed in 1862, regiments and independent companies which had been \" mustered into the service of the United States as volunteer engineers, pio neers, or sappers and miners\" were \" recognized and accepted as volunteer engineers, on the same footing, in all respects, in regard to their organization, pay, and emolu ments, as the corps of engineers of the regular army of the United States.\" The standard of organization thus estab lished allowed the regiment twelve companies of one hun dred and fifty enlisted men each, viz., two musicians, ten sergeants, ten corporals, sixty-four artificers, and sixty-four privates. During the spring and summer of 1862 the regiment was mostly employed in the repair or reopening of the rail roads between Nashville and Chattanooga, Nashville and Columbia, Corinth and Decatur, Huntsville and Stevenson, and Memphis and Corinth, and twice assisted in reopening the road between Louisville and Nashville. In the month of June, 1862, alone, it built seven bridges on the Mem phis and Charleston Railroad, each from eighty-four to three hundred and forty feet in length \u2014 in the aggregate nearly three thousand feet \u2014 and from twelve to sixty feet in height. After the battle of Pittsburg Landing it was engaged at that point eight weeks in the construction of steamboat-landings, etc., with only one day's rest. The alterations and casualties for the year, to Nov. 1, 1863, were: Died in action or of wounds, six; died of dis ease, fifty-eight ; discharged for disability, one hundred and eighty-nine ; discharged for other causes, fourteen ; deserted, twenty-seven ; officers resigned, ten ; joined as recruits, three hundred and seventy-two ; aggregate strength, nine hundred and sixty-five. In the months of November and December, 1863, and January and February, 1864, the regiment was engaged in building trestle-work and bridges on the line of the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad, and in the construction of store houses and other buildin\"*s o at Chattanooga, Tenn., and Bridgeport, Ala., for the quar termaster, ordnance, and other departments of the army. At the same time one battalion was engaged at Chattanooga in refitting saw-mills, where it continued during the months of March, April, and May, employed in running saw-mills, getting out railroad-ties, building hospital accommodations, and working on the defenses. Serious difficulties existed in the regiment during the first months of its service, owing to a misunderstanding as to the pay the men were to receive, it having been found after their organization that there was no law by which they could receive the pay expected. This trouble was finally remedied by an act of Congress, which act also pro posed to increase the regiment's strength from ten to twelve companies of one hundred and fifty men each, forming three battalions, each commanded by a major. Half the men, as artificers, drew seventeen dollars per month, and the others thirteen dollars per month. On the 1st of November, 1862, the regiment was en camped at Edgefield, Tenn., when the alterations and cas ualties to that date aggregated as follows : Died of disease, seventy-five ; died of wounds received in action, two ; killed in action, one ; wounded in action, seventeen ; discharged, one hundred and twenty-four ; taken prisoners, fifteen ; deserted, twenty; recruits received, sixty-seven. Detachments from the other battalions were engaged erecting block-houses on the lines of the Tennessee and Ala bama, the Nashville and Chattanooga, and the Memphis and Charleston Railroads. Two companies were at Bridgeport, Ala., building artillery block-houses. Two companies were at Stevenson, Ala., completing its defenses, while another battalion was stationed on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, building block-houses at various points between Decatur and Stevenson. The major portion of the regi ment was finally concentrated upon the line of the Atlantic and Western Railroad during the summer months of 1864, where it built and repaired railroads, block-houses, etc. The task allotted to this regiment during the fierce campaign of Sherman's army, in 1864, was one of great magnitude, and most nobly did its members fulfill their duty. But for such men as composed the Michigan Engineers and Me chanics, and the rapidity with which they repaired the rail road right up to the enemy's skirmish-line,* the more than Until June 29, 1863, the regiment was stationed at Edgefield and Mill Creek, near Nashville, at Lavergne, Mur freesboro, and Smyrna, and at a point near Nashville on the Tennessee and Alabama Railroad. During this time the regiment built nine bridges, besides a number of magazines and buildings for commissary, quartermaster, and ordnance stores, and also repaired and relaid a large amount of rail road track. At Lavergne, Tenn., on the 1st of January, 1863, it was attacked by the rebel Gens. Wheeler and Wharton, who, with a force of over three thousand cavalry and two pieces of artillery, were compelled to retire with loss, the loss of the regiment in this action being but one man killed and six wounded. On the 29th of June, 1863, the regiment moved south from Murfreesboro, and during the two succeeding months was engaged repairing and opening tbe railroad from Mur freesboro, Tenn., to Bridgeport, Ala. Of five bridges com pleted in July, the one over Elk River was four hundred and sixty feet in length ; that over Duck River, three hun dred and fifty feet long. During September and October detached companies were employed in building an immense * As Johnston's army fell back from one chosen position to another before the fierce attacks and flank movements of Sherman's veterans, the railroad was invariably destroyed by the enemy, and in a man ner, too, that would seem to require days to repair it. Imagine, then, the surprise and chagrin of the \"Johnnies,\" when, in the course of a very few hours, a locomotive bearing the legend *' United States"], [123, "FIRST ENGINEERS AND MECHANICS. 115 one hundred thousand Union soldiers in front would many times have gone to sleep without their usual rations of \"hard tack, sow belly, and coffee.\" army on its march to Goldsboro', N. C. It moved with the Fifteenth Army Corps to Banbury, S. C, thence with the Twentieth Army Corps to Columbia, S. C, thence with the Seventeenth Corps to Fayctteville, N. C, and thence with the Twentieth Army Corjs to Goldsboro', N. C, where it arrived March 23, 1865. It is estimated that during this campaign, besides making and repairing a great distance of corduroy-road, the regiment destroyed and twisted the rails of thirty miles of railroad-track and built eight or ten important bridges and crossings. At Edisto the bridge was constructed under fire from the enemy's sharpshooters. At Hughes Creek and at Little and Big Lynch Creeks the bridges and approaches were built at night. At the last-named stream the men worked in water waist-deep. A foot-crossing was made there in one night, nearly a mile in length, and the next day the space was corduroyed for the heavy army-trains and artillery to pass over. The regiment destroyed factories and rebel army supplies at Columbia, rebel ordnance and stores at Cheraw, and the old United States arsenal at Fayetteville, N. C, etc. At the clo^e of the Atlanta campaign, headquarters of the regiment were established in the latter city. The al terations and casualties for the year were reported as fol lows : Died of disease, one hundred and twelve ; trans ferred, thirty-six ; discharged for disability, etc., fifty ; re-enlisted as veterans, one hundred and forty-eight. On the 31st of October, 1864, the original term of the regiment expired, and such officers as desired to leave the service were mustered out, as were also the enlisted men whose, terms had expired. The re-enlisted veterans, together with the recruits who had joined the regiment, enabled it to maintain its organization entire and nearly its full strength. From the 1st to the 15th of November, 1864, the regi ment, with the exception of Companies L and M, was stationed at Atlanta, Ga., being employed in constructing defenses, destroying rebel works, depots, rolling-mills, foun dries, gas-works, and other rebel property, and in tearing up and rendering useless the various railroad-tracks iu the vicinity. Companies L and M, which had been detached from the regiment early in the summer of 1864 and placed upon the defenses at Stevenson, Ala., having completed those works, which consisted of a system of eight block-houses, were retained in the Army of the Cumberland. They as sisted to fortify and defend the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad for some weeks, and on the 28th of November, 1864, were moved to Elk River Bridge. For some time after that, when not interrupted by Hood's rebel army, they were engaged in building block-houses between that bridge and Murfreesboro, Tenn. During the most of the month of December a portion of the Engineers aud Mechanics was engaged in completing and repairing Fort Rosecrans, Murfreesboro, Tenn., while the rebels, under Hood, were investing Nashville. After the complete destruction of Atlanta,* the regiment set out on the morning of November 16, with the Four teenth Army Corps, as^part of the engineer force of Gen. Sherman's army ; going to Sandersville, Ga., and thence with the Twentieth Army Corps, to Horse Creek, where it received orders to join the Seventeenth Army Corps, with which it continued on to Savannah, Ga., reaching there Dec. 10, 1864. During this march the regiment was required to keep pace with the movements of the army, traveling over twenty miles a day, and meanwhile was en gaged tearing up railroad-tracks, twisting rails, destroying bridges, repairing and making roads, building and repairing wagon-bridges, etc. On the 10th and 11th of Decem ber the regiment built a dam across the Ogechee Canal under the fire of rebel batteries. A detachment, consisting of Company L of this regi ment, with several companies of an Illinois regiment which had been sent out to bring through from Stevenson, Ala., a railroad-train of supplies, was captured Dec. 15, 1864, after several hours' hard fighting. From that time until after the evacuation of Savannah by the enemy, the regiment was constantly at work tearing up railroad-track and destroying the rails of the several rail roads leading out of the city, and in constructing long stretches of corduroy-road for the passage of army-trains. On the 23d of December it moved into the city, aud five days later commenced work on the fortifications laid out by direction of Gen. Sherman. These works, constructed by and under the supervision of this regiment, were over two miles iu length, and included several strong battery-positions and lunettes. On the 1st of March, 1865, Companies L and M left Murfreesboro, Tenn., to rejoin their regiment, and pro ceeding by rail, vid Louisville, Indianapolis, Crestline, Pitts burgh, aud Philadelphia, to New York, they then took steamer to Beaufort, N. C, thence by rail to Newbern, and finally joined their comrades at Goldsboro', -N. C, March 25, 1865. Gen. Sherman's army began its last campaign April 10, 1865. By breaking camp at Goldsboro' and moving rapidly to the northward, Johnston's fleeing forces were pursued to, through, and beyond Raleigh. The Engineers and Mechanics marched with the Twentieth Army Corps, but proceeded no farther than Raleigh, where they remained until after Johnston's' surrender.t On the 30th April the regiment moved out on its homeward march with the Sev enteenth Army Corps. It crossed the Roanoke River at Monroe, aud, passing through the cities of Petersburg, Richmond, and Alexandria, Va., arrived at Washington, The regiment was again put in motion on the 3d of Jan uary, 1865 ; marching to Pooler Station, converting the rail road into a wagon-road, and then returning to Savannah.

On the 27th June it moved northward in the Gettysburg campaign, and for fifteen days it was almost constantly engaged in conflicts with the enemy.

In September, 1863, the War Department authorized the consolidation of the twelve companies into eight and the raising of a new battalion of four companies. These were speedily raised, and the new battalion was mustered into service at Mount Clemens, in December, 1863. This battalion went to Camp Stoneman, near Washington, in December, 1863, and remained there until the spring of 1864.

There was much dissatisfaction, but most of the regiment set out on the march ; reaching Camp Collins, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, on the 26th of July. Its head quarters remained there until about the 1st of November, when it was moved to Fort Bridger. There it was consoli dated with those men of the Sixth and Seventh Michigan Cavalry who had the longest time to serve ; forming an organization known as the First Michigan Veteran Cavalry.

River, capturing three pieces of artillery and seventy-five prisoners, and having eleven of its own men wounded. Allegan and Barry Counties were both represented by good men in the Second Cavalry. The companies com prising this fine regiment rendezvoused at Grand Rapids early in the fall of 1861. On the 28th of November, 1861, the Second proceeded to St. Louis, Mo., where it was en camped at Benton Barracks until early in the spring of 1862, when it joined the forces organizing under Gen. John Pope to operate against New Madrid and Island No. 10. Three hundred and twenty-eight of the men re-enlisted as veterans, and in April went home on veteran furlough. The rest of the regiment accompanied Gen. Sherman in his Atlanta campaign, having several sharp skirmishes with the enemy, but being ordered back from Lost Mountain to Franklin, Tenn., where it was rejoined by the veterans in July. During the summer and autumn the Second was busily engaged in marching through Middle Tennessee, fighting with the horsemen of Forrest and other rebel generals. After the capture of those rebel strongholds the regiment proceeded with Pope's \" Army of the Mississippi,\" vid the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Rivers, to Hamburg Landing, Tenn. It was engaged in the battle of Farming ton, Miss, May 5, 1862, and in the subsequent siege of Corinth during the remainder of that month. It pressed closely upon Beauregard's retreating columns when they fled south from Corinth, and sought them at Boonville, Blackland, and Baldwin, Miss. Thereafter, throughout the summer of 1862, the regiment was actively employed on various duties in Northern Mississippi and Western Tennessee. Its colonel was then Philip H. Sheridan, now lieutenant-general, who had recently been detailed from duty as a captain in the regular army to receive the colonelcy lately vacated by the promotion of Gen. Gordon Granger. Col. Sheridan commanded a brigade, consisting of the Second Michigan, Second Iowa, and Seventh Kansas Cav alry, and at its head made numerous excursions through the country around Corinth, to keep down guerrillas and learn the movements of the enemy. On the 5th of November, 1864, the regiment was at tacked at Shoal Creek, Ala., by a large Confederate force (a part of Hood's army, then advancing against Nashville), and was forced back with heavy loss. It steadily fell back, skirmishing almost constantly with the enemy, and at Franklin, on the 30th of November, it resisted his ad vance all day, having eighteen officers and men killed and wounded. After Hood's defeat before Nashville, the Second pressed hard on his rear, and at Richland Creek, on the 24th of December, charged repeatedly, driving the foe sixteen miles, and having seven men killed and wounded. After Hood's final retreat from the State the regiment remained mostly in Middle Tennessee until March 11, 1865, when it set out on a long raid through Northern Alabama to Tuscaloosa, and thence through Talladega to Macon, Ga., where it arrived on the 1st day of May, 1865. After remaining in Georgia on garrison duty until the 17th of August, the regiment was mustered out and sent home, arriving at Jackson on the 25th of August, 1865, where it was paid off and disbanded. Early in the autumn, however, Col. Sheridan was made a brigadier-general of volunteers and transferred to the Army of the Cumberland, and about the same time the Second Cavalry was sent to Kentucky. In December, 1862, and January, 1863, it was engaged in a movement into East Tennessee, the men being in the saddle twenty-two days and taking part in several sharp skirmishes. Soon afterward it moved into Middle Tennessee, and for several months its headquarters were at or near Murfreesboro, while it was almost constantly engaged in scouts and raids through that region.

The enemy was so demoralized by these movements that no attempt was made to follow. How many of the foe were killed and wounded was not known, but it was certain that at least eleven were dismounted, for eleven of their horses accompanied the Union force on its returning charge. After retreating a short distance, Capt. Botham halted and sent a dispatch to camp. About four o'clock in the afternoon he was relieved by the Second Michigan Cavalry, under the command of Col.

This regiment rendezvoused at Grand Rapids in the sum mer of 1861, and was there mustered into the United States service, November 1st of the same year. Company A, which proceeded to the front under the command of Capt. Gilbert Moyers, was an Allegan County company, and the same county was also represented in every other company of the Third. Barry had but few men in the regiment, and they were scattered among Companies E, K, L, and M. At the close of the year ending Nov. 1, 1862, the regi ment had lost one hundred and four men who died of dis ease, seven killed in action, forty-five wounded in action, and fifty-nine taken prisoners. Its battles and skirmishes to that date were New Madrid, Mo., March 13, 1862; siege of Island No. 10, Mo., March 14th to April 7th ; Farm ington, Miss., May 5th ; siege of Corinth, Miss., May 10th to 31st; Spangler's Mills, Miss., July 26th; Bay Springs, Miss., September 10th; Iuka, Miss., September 19th; Corinth, Miss., October 3d and 4th ; and Hatchie, Miss., October 6th. It advanced with Gen. Grant's army into Mississippi in November and December, 1862, and en gaged the enemy at Holly Springs, November 7th ; at Hudsonville, November 14th, where it captured an en tire rebel company ; at Lumkin's Mill, November 29th ; and at Oxford, December 2d ; and shared in the defeat of the Union cavalry at Coffeeville, December 5th. The fol lowing winter it was on active duty in North Mississippi and West Tennessee. Under the command of Lieut -Col. Robert H. G. Minty, previously major of the Second Michigan Cavalry, the regiment left its rendezvous Nov. 28, 1861, and proceeded to Benton Barracks, Mo., where Col. John K. Mizner soon after assumed command. It remained at St. Louis until early in the spring of 1862, when it joined Gen. John Pope's *' Army of the Mississippi,\" and actively participated in the operations which resulted in the capture of the rebel strongholds Island No. 10 and New Madrid. With Gen. Pope's army it then proceeded, vid the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Rivers, to Pittsburg Landing, where it ar rived soon after the battle of Shiloh, and took an active part in the advance of Gen. Halleck's army upon Corinth, Miss. Immediately after the evacuation of Corinth by Beaure gard the Third was ordered to Booneville, Miss., to ascer tain the position and strength of the enemy. While in the performance of this duty a small detachment of the regi ment was sent out in advance, under Capt. Botham. It ran on to a rebel force of all arms, drove them from their position, halted, and bivouacked for the night. The fol lowing morning, while eating breakfast, a Union scout dis covered the enemy in the vicinity. The men left their breakfast half eaten, mounted, and hurried forward. They soon found a small body of rebel cavalry, who fled before them. The Union horsemen advanced at a rapid pace, and soon came upon an entire regiment of rebel cavalry drawn up to dispute their further progress. There was no time for consideration. If the little command had then retreated, it would have been attacked and crushed by the elated Confederates. Capt. Botham knew it was essential for cavalry to get the advantage of its own momentum in a combat, and accordingly shouted the order to charge. The detachment dashed forward at the top of its speed, During the year 1863 the Third Cavalry was principally engaged in the arduous service of driving out the numerous bands of guerrillas which infested Western Tennessee and Northern Mississippi, and repelling the incursions of Con federate forces from other quarters ; its camp being most of the time at Corinth, Miss. There were few very severe battles in this kind of warfare, and few opportunities for winning martial glory amid the shock of charging squad rons, but it tested to the utmost the endurance, the forti tude, and the patriotism of the hardy sons of the West. Day and night, in sun and rain, the cavalry was kept in motion. Often, when all the camp lay locked in the deep slumbers of two o'clock in the morning, the silence would suddenly be broken by the stirring sounds of the bugle, and a moment later the officers would be heard going from tent to tent, arousing the half-awakened men with the"], [129, "FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD CAVALRY. 121 orders, \" Turn out here, Company B.\" \" Turn out, Com pany F.\" \" Get ready to march with three days' rations.\" \" Lively now ; lively, I say.\" appearing set of quarters and stables that the place was com monly called Michigan City, instead of Brownsville Station. In March, 1865, the regiment, as a part of the First Brigade, First Division, Seventh Army Corps, proceeded to New Orleans, and in April continued its course to Mobile. After the capture of that place the Third was on outpost duty in that vicinity until the 8th day of May, whe*n it marched across the country to Baton Rouge, La. In June it set out for Texas by the way of Shreveport, and on the 2d of August arrived at San Antonio, in that State. Its head quarters remained at San Antonio until the 15th of Feb ruary, 1866, while successive detachments were scouting the country, protecting the frontier against Mexicans and Indians. Then would follow a hurried drawing of rations, the filling of haversacks and saddle-bags with coffee, pork, and \" hard tack,\" and perhaps the cooking of a hasty meal for immediate consumption. Presently the bugles would sound '\u2022 Boot and Saddle,\" the horses would be speedily equipped, mounted, and ridden into line, the voices of a dozen cap tains would be heard in succession commanding \" Fours Right \u2014 Column Right \u2014 March !\" and away into the dark ness would go the Third Michigan, or the Seventh Kansas, or the Third Iowa, or any two of them, or all of them, as the occasion might seem to require. Nobody would know where they were going except the field-officers, and very frequently they didn't ; but all sorts of rumors would pass rapidly among the boys : \" Forrest is coming to attack the camp ;\" \" Roddy is out here ten miles ;\" \" Chalmers is raising the devil over at Holly Springs,\" etc. A ride would follow, perhaps lasting two or three hours, perhaps extending through three or four days and half as many nights, and sometimes embracing a period of one, two, or three weeks, during which the bold riders were generally compelled to live upon the coun try they traversed. In that half-cleared country there was seldom an opportunity for the dashing charge which one naturally associates with the idea of cavalry service ; but whenever they met the foe, which was quite frequently, both sides dismounted, and a lively skirmish with carbines against shot-guns ensued, which lasted until one party or the other retreated. The retreating party was usually, though not always, the rebels, for notwithstanding the best Confederate troops, after the battle of Corinth, in October, 1862, were taken away to other sections, leaving only un disciplined bands of what was called \"shotgun cavalry\" in Northern Mississippi and Western Tennessee, the \" chiv alry\" fought well. In February, 1866, the regiment was dismounted, mus tered out, and sent home ; being paid off and disbanded at Jackson, Mich., on the 15th of March, 1866, after a ser vice of four years and a half unsurpassed as to hardship and fidelity by that of any other regiment in the army. It is claimed to have captured during the time over two thou sand five hundred prisoners, besides those taken in co-oper ation with other regiments. OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN FROM ALLEGAN COUNTY.

It was justly proud of its fighting reputation, and accomplished an unusual amount of duty.

On the 26th of September, 1862, the regiment left Detroit for the seat of war in Kentucky, receiving its arms at Jeffersonville, Ind. It at once crossed the Ohio River, and was soon engaged with the redoubtable guerrilla Gen. John H. Morgan. It was in the advance on the attack on Morgan at Stanford, Ky., Oct. 14, 1862, and pursued him as far as Crab Orchard. It also led in the attack on Lebanon, Ky., on the 9th of November, five hundred and forty-three of its men pushing in Morgan's pickets at a gallop, entering the town two miles in advance of the infan try, and driving out the guerrilla leader with seven hundred and sixty followers. After a short stay at Nashville the regiment marched, on the 13th of December, to Franklin, Tenn., drove out the rebels, thirteen hundred strong, killed, wounded, and captured a number of them, and also captured their colors. On the 26th of December it moved in advance of the army towards Murfreesboro, and began the fighting at Lavergne. At Stone River, on the 31st, it charged the enemy three times, each time driving a brigade of rebel cavalry from the field, and having ten of its own men killed and wounded. The Fourth Michigan Cavalry, which gained such re nown in the Department of the Cumberland during the war for the Union, was recruited and organized during the summer of 1862 by Col. Robert H. G. Minty, previously lieutenant-colonel of the Third Cavalry. It rendezvoused at Detroit, and was there mustered into the United States service, Aug. 29, 1862. Of its twelve companies, of one hundred men each, Company L, which took the field under the command of Capt. Benjamin D. Pritchard,* was re cruited almost entirely from Allegan County, while the same county was also represented in the field and staff, non-commissioned staff, aud Companies A, C, D, E, F, and The Fourth was the first regiment to enter Murfrees boro on the morning of Jan. 5, 1863, and from the 9th to the 19th of the same month it was engaged in an im portant cavalry expedition to Harpeth Shoals, by which Wheeler's, Forrest's, and Wharton's mounted rebels were driven beyond Harpeth River. In this movement the men suffered terribly from lack of supplies, cold weather, and constantly wet garments. During the month of February the regiment was con stantly on the move, and captured one hundred and forty five prisoners, including two colonels and fourteen other commissioned officers. * Gen. Benjamin D. Pritchard was born in Nelson, Portage Co., Ohio, in 1835. He received an academical course of instruction in the public schools, and at the Western Reserve College, in his native State, where he continued to reside until 1S56, when he became a resident of Allegan, Mich. Engaging in tbe study of law, he com pleted his course in the law department of the University of Michigan in 1860, and soon after formed a law-partnership with Hon. William B. Williams, late member of Congress, and now commissioner of rail roads. He recruited Company L of the Fourth Michigan Cavalry in the summer of 1S62, and was commissioned its captain August 13th of the same year. From that time until the close of the war he per formed most gallant and efficient service, which is described at length in the accompanying history of his regiment. He was brevetted a brigadier-general of United States Volunteers, to rank from May 10, 1865, for faithful and meritorious services in the capture of Jeff Davis, and was mustered out of service with his regiment July 1, 1865. Numerous other expeditions were made from Murfrees boro during the spring of 1863, is all of which more or less prisoners were taken and stores destroyed. On the 22d of May following, the regiment, with two companies of United States cavalry, charged into the camp of the Eighth Confederate, First Alabama, and Second Georgia Cavalry, at Middleton, Tenn., and after a sharp engagement routed them, taking fifty-five prisoners and destroying their camp. The colors of the First Alabama were captured by the Fourth Michigan, and are now in the office of the State adjutant-general. He again resumed his law-practice with Mr. Williams, and in 1866 was elected, on tho Republican ticket, commissioner of the land-office of the State, and was re-elected in 1868. At Shelbyville, Tenn., on the 27th of June, 1863, the success attending the brigade commanded by Col. Minty was mainly accomplished by the brilliant and tenacious fighting of the Fourth Michigan Cavalry, then commanded by Maj. Frank W. Mix. Col. Minty, iu his report of this In 1878 he was elected State treasurer by tbe Republicans, over Alex. McFarlan, Democrat, and Herman Goescbel, National. Gen. Pritchard is still a resident of Allegan, and, besides attending to his professional duties, is president of the First National Bank of that battle, says: village. i"], [132, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICH [G AN. 124 immediately checked their advance, again causing them to deploy. The Fourth Michigan followed the Fourth United States, and the Seventh Pennsylvania the Fourth Michigan, one squadron of the Fourth United States, under Lieut. Davis, most gallantly covering the crossing of the Seventh Pennsylvania. One squadron of the Fourth Michigan, under Lieut. J. H. Simpson, on picket on the Har rison road, was cut off by the rapid advance of the enemy. They made a gallant resistance, and eventually swam the creek without the loss of a man. The artillery crossed the ford in safety, and I placed it in position to dispute the crossing of the bridge, from which Lieut. Davis' men had thrown most of the loose planking. \"At Shelbyville I found myself, with a force of fifteen hundred men, in front of formidable breastworks, with an abatis of over one fourth of a mile in width in front of them, behind which Gens. Wheeler and Martin had an opposing force of four thousand men and three pieces of artillery. I detached the Fourth Michigan, in com mand of Maj. Mix, well to the right, with orders to force their way through the abatis,* and assault the works, and if successful to turn to the left and sweep up the intrenchments, promising that so soon as I heard their rifles speaking I would make the direct assault on the Murfreesboro and Shelbyville pike. They did their work so well that as I entered the works on the main road they joined me from the right, having carried the works and taken prisoners from six different regiments. The fruits of that day's work were the whole of the enemy's artillery and six hundred prisoners, while over two hundred dead bodies were afterwards taken out of Duck River, into which I had driven Wheeler and his entire command.\" \"Here I was soon hotly engaged, and was holding the rebels in check, when I received a note from the officer in charge of my wagon-train (which I had sent back to Gordon's Mill), stating, ' Col. Wilder has fallen back from Alexander's Bridge; he is retreating towards Gordon's Mill, and the enemy is crossing the river in force at all points.' I sent an order to Col. Miller to join me without delay, and on his arrival I fell back to Gordon's Mill, skirmishing with the enemy, who followed me closely. \" With less than one thousand men, the old ' First Brigade' had dis puted the advance of seven thousand from seven o'clock in the morn ing until five o'clock in the evening, and during that time fell back only five miles. After two or three minor skirmishes the regiment entered Chattanooga, Tenn., on the 11th of September, 1863. On the 13th, Col. Minty's command \u2014 viz., the Fourth United States, Fourth Michigan, and Seventh Pennsylvania Cav alry regiments, and one section of the Chicago Board of Trade battery \u2014 marched from Chattanooga and reported to Maj. -Gen. Crittenden, commanding the Twenty-First Army Corps, at Gordon's Mills. The brigade was ordered to cross Mission Ridge into Lookout Valley on the 14th, and on the three succeeding days was employed in learning the enemy's whereabouts. On the 18th it was warmly engaged with a large force of the enemy's infantry, the combat being thus described in Col. Minty's report : \" On arriving at Gordon's Mill my men were dismounted, and with Col. Wilder's brigade of mounted infantry, and a brigade from Gen. Van Cleve's division, repulsed a heavy attack about eight o'clock p.m. We lay in position all night within bearing of the enemy, and were without fires, although the night was bitterly cold. At break of day Gen. Palmer's division relieved us. I then moved to the rear and procured forage for our horses and rations for the men, who had been entirely without since the previous morning.\" During the 18th the regiment lost fourteen men, killed, wounded, and missing. Among the wounded was Capt. Pritchard, then in commaad of a battalion. The next day it fired the first shots in the disastrous battle of Chicka mauga, and subsequently protected the left and rear of Rosecrans' army and the trains moving to Chattanooga. On the 20th, while assisting to hold the enemy in check until the shattered Union forces could retire from the field, Minty's brigade attacked and defeated Scott's rebel brigade of cavalry and mounted infantry, driving it back across the creek. The regiment bivouacked on the ground it had held, but the next day was compelled to share in the gen eral retreat. \"At six a.m. of September ISth I sent one hundred of the Fourth United States Csivalry towards Leet's, and one hundred from the Fourth Michigan and Seventh Pennsylvania towards Ringgold. At about seven a.m. couriers arrived from both scouts, with information that the enemy was advancing in force. I immediately strengthened my pickets on the Lafayette road, and moved forward with the Fourth Michigan and one battalion of the Fourth Regulars and the section of artillery, and took up a position on the eastern slope of Pea Vine Ridge, and despatched couriers to Maj. -Gen. Granger, at Ross ville; Col. Wilder, at Alexander's Bridge; Gen. Wood, at Gordon's Mill ; and Gen. Crittenden, at Crawfish Springs. The enemy's in fantry in force, with about two hundred cavalry, advanced steadily, driving my skirmish-line back to my position on the side of the ridge. The head of a column getting into good range, I opened on them with the artillery, when they immediately deployed and advanced a strong skirmish-line. At this moment I observed a heavy column of dust moving from the direction of Graysville towards Dyer's Ford. On the 30th of September it was driven by Wheeler's rebel cavalry near Cotton's Ferry, on the Tennessee ; but from the 1st to the 3d of October the tables were turned, and the Fourth had the pleasure of following its late pur suers with ardor and success. By the 1st of November, 1863, the service of the regiment had been so severe that only three hundred of the men were mounted. This bat talion was actively engaged on picket and scout duty in Southeastern Tennessee and Northern Georgia and Ala bama throughout the winter ; the number of mounted men being reduced by the latter part of March, 1864, to one hundred and twenty-eight. Meanwhile, the dismounted men had been employed iu various duties in the same locality, and also in Middle Tennessee. \" I sent a courier to Col. Wilder, asking him to send a force to hold the ford and cover my left, and sent my train across the creek. As the force from Graysville advanced I fell back until I arrived on the ground I had occupied in the morning. Here Col. Miller, with two regiments and two mountain howitzers, reported to me from Col. Wil der's brigade. I directed Col. Miller to take possession of the ford, and again advanced and drove the rebel skirmish-line over the ridge and back on their line of battle in the valley, where a force was in position which I estimated at seven thousand men, thirteen sets of regimental colors being visible. \"The rebel line advanced, and I was steadily driven back across the ridge. My only means of crossing the creek was Reed's bridge, a narrow, frail structure, which was covered with loose boards and fence-rails, and a bad ford about three hundred yards higher up. I masked my artillery behind some shrubs near the ford, leaving one battalion of the Fourth United States to support it, and ordered tbe remainder of that regiment to cross the bridge, holding the Fourth Michigan and Seventh Pennsylvania in line to cover the movement. The regiment, except the one hundred and twenty-eight mounted men, set out for Nashville on the 28th of March, 1864, where, under the supervision of Capt. Pritchard, the men received new horses and equipments, and were armed with Spencer carbines. On the 14th of April, under the command of Maj. F. W. Mix, the regiment joined the Sec ond Cavalry Division at Columbia, Tenn. Thence it ad vanced with eight hundred and seventy-eight men into \" Before the first squadron had time to cross, the head of a rebel column carrying their arms at 'right shoulder shift,' and moving at the double-quick, as steadily as if at drill, came through the gap not five hundred yards from tbe bridge.

Sherman's army, which was then advancing on Atlanta. rear of Sherman's army, \u2014 it was said to capture a brigade of Yankee cavalry situated at McAfee's. We succeeded in getting to the right place, where the enemy, Minty's brigade, was vigorously attacked by Williams' and a portion of Anderson's brigade. After a sharp con flict the enemy were driven from the field, Hannon's brigade having come up and attacked them on the flank. The Yankees fought des perately and fell back Blowly, with what loss we are unable to ascer tain, as they carried off their wounded and most of their dead. To one who was an eye-witness, but not an adept in the 'art of war,' it seemed very strange that the whole Yankee force was not surrounded and captured. Dibrell's brigade was drawn up a few hundred yards from and in full view of the battle-ground, with Martin's whole division immediittely in the rear. This is one of the best fighting brigades the l'ankees have, and to have captured or routed it would have added a bright feather to the plume of the successful hero ac complishing the feat. After he (Minty) had been driven from his first position, Martin's whole division was brought up, and lost several men of Allen's brigade. Brig. -Gen. Allen had his horse shot. The Eighth Confederate and Fifth Georgia of Anderson's brigade lost several killed and wounded. Williams' Kentucky brigade also lost several good soldiers.\" On the 15th of May the command attacked the enemy's cavalry at Tanner's Bridge, nine miles from Rome, Ga., routing and pursuing them seven miles, when, meeting a superior force with artillery, it retired ; this regiment having lost in the affair ten wounded and missing. From Woodland, on the 18th, seven companies, under Capt. Pritchard, were sent toward Kingston on a recon noissance. Meeting the enemy's cavalry, the detachment drove them several miles, until at length it was stopped by the rebel infantry. The opposing horsemen then threw themselves on the flanks and rear of the Michigan men, but the latter drew their sabres and cut their way out, with a loss of twenty-four in killed, wounded, and missing. Crossing the Allatoona Mountains and Etowah River, Col. Minty's command moved on to Dallas, where it was warmly engaged, and captured many prisoners. It also participated in all the flank movements which forced Gen. Johnston's rebel army back from one stronghold to another, resulting in the engagements at New Hope Church and Big Shanty. On the 9th of June tho regiment assisted in driving the enemy's cavalry, supported by infantry, to the base of Kencsaw Mountain, capturing a number of prisoners, and on the 12th again encountered the enemy at McAfee's Cross-Roads, where a line of rebel intrenchments was car ried. Col. Minty, in his report, after quoting this statement, added : \"According to the above, there was the following rebel force in the field: Kelly's and Martin's divisions, consisting of the brigades of Anderson, six regiments; Hannon's, five regimenrs; Allen's, five regiments; and Johnson's, five regiments ; and tbe independent bri gades of Williams and Dtbrell, composed of five regiments each; say in all, thirty-one regiments, of which the Fifth Georgia numbered over eight hundred. The entire force I had engaged was, of the Seventh Pennsylvania one hundred and seventy men, and of the Fourth Michigan two hundred and eighty-three; in all, four hun dred and fifty-three. These few men held their ground against the repeated assaults of the enemy for over two hours, and when I ordered them to fall back, they retired slowly, in good order. I beg to call the attention of the general commanding to the heavy loss sustained by this small force. In a loss of over twelve per cent., the very small proportion reported missing shows how steadily and stubbornly they fought.\" Skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry was daily con tinued until the 20th of June, 1864, on which day, at Lattimore's Mill, on Noonday Creek, two battalions of the Fourth performed one of the most brilliant feats of the war. A small detachment of the Seventh Pennsylvania cavalry had crossed the creek, and, becoming hotly en gaged with a superior force of the enemy, Capt. Pritchard, with two battalions of the Fourth Michigan, was ordered across to its support. This force had scarcely reached the position assigned it when a whole rebel division, eight times their own number, swept down upon the Pennsylvania and Michigan men, with the evident purpose of driving them back across the creek. They did not, however, pro pose to go immediately, so, dismounting and availing them selves of the protection afforded by the inequalities of the ground, they met their assailants with terrific and con tinuous volleys from their Spencer carbines. Again and again did the rebels bear down upon them, making des perate efforts to destroy the little force of Unionists, but being as often repulsed. At length, after holding their ground against the repeated assaults of the enemy for more than two hours, they retired slowly and in good order at the command of Col. Minty. In a note appended to this report, Col. Minty said : \" My loss in this engagement was two officers and sixty-five men. The Marietta (Ga.) papers acknowledge a loss of ninety-four killed and three hundred and fifty-one wounded. Two battalions of the Fourth Michigan repulsed three sabre charges made by the Eighth Confederate and Fifth Georgia, numbering over one thousand men, and one battalion led by Capt. Hathaway repulsed a chargo mado by Williams' Kentucky brigade by a counter-charge.\" Of the two hundred and eighty three officers and men of the Fourth engaged at Lattimore's mill, thirty-seven were killed and wounded, and three were reported missing, Lieut. T. W. Sutton being among the killed. Having crossed the Chattahoochee River, the regiment, under the command of Maj. F. W. Mix, participated in a constant succession of raids and fights until the 1st of August, 1864, during which many miles of railroad-track and many bridges were destroyed, thus impeding the oper ations of the enemy and facilitating those of Gen. Sher man, who had steadily advanced to the front of Atlanta. From the 1st to the 14th of August it was employed as infantry, occupying a portion of the trenches before the besieged city. The following extract from a letter published in the Memphis Appeal, at Atlanta, Ga.,* June 25, 1864, gives the rebel version of this fight, and shows very plainly the gallantry of Minty's brigade and the immense preponder ance of the rebel force : Col. Minty's brigade then received orders to report to Gen. Kilpatrick. At one o'clock on the morning of the 18th the command broke camp, and quietly moved out to the rendezvous of the expedition at Sandtown, arriving there at six A.M. The movement was commenced under cover of darkness, to prevent, if possible, any information \" On the 20th instant two divisions, Kelly's and Martin's, and one brigade, Williams', of our cavalry, went round to tbe left flank and '\u25a0 Tin' Memphis A/ipeal was published at half a dozen different places, to which it was successively driven by the victorious t'nionht*."], [134, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 126 \"The ground from which the start was made, and over which they charged, was a plantation of about two square miles, thickly strewn with patches of woods, deep water-cuts, fences, ditches, and morasses. At the word away went the bold dragoons at the height of their speed. Fences were jumped, and ditches were no impediment. The rattle of the sabres mingled with that of the mess-kettles and frying-pans that jingled at the side of the pack-mule brigade, which was madly urged forward by the frightened darkies who straddled the animals. Charging for their lives and yelling like devils, Minty and his troopers encountered the rebels behind a hastily constructed barricade of rails. Pressing their rowels deep into their horses' flanks, and raising their sabres aloft, on, on, on, nearer and nearer to the rebels they plunged. The terror-stricken enemy could not withstand the thunderous wave of men and horse that threatened to engulf them. They broke and ran just as Minty and his men were urging their horses for tho deci sive blow. In an instant all was confusion. The yells of the horse men were drowned in the clashing of steel and the groans of the dying. On pressed Minty in pursuit, his men's sabres striking right and left, and cutting down everything in their path. The rebel horsemen were -seen to reel and pitch headlong to the earth, while their frightened steeds rushed pell-mell over their bodies. Many of the rebels defended themselves with almost superhuman strength; but it was all in vain. The charge of Federal steel was irresistible. The heads and limbs of some of the rebels were actually severed from their bodies. It was, all admit, one of the finest charges of the war. The individual instances of heroism were many. Hardly a man flinched, and when the brigade came out more than half the sabres were stained with human blood.\" being obtained by the enemy, yet a rebel letter captured on the 20th, dated at Atlanta on the 18th, gave the number of Minty's command and the destination of the raiders. Gen. Kilpatrick's force consisted of the Third Cavalry Division, commanded by himself in person, and Minty's and Long's brigades of the Second Cavalry Division, in all some five thousand men, with two sections of the Chicago Board of Trade Battery. On the evening of the 19th the combined forces moved out toward the West Point Railroad, which was reached near Fairburn, where the first rebel assault was made. Ross' and Ferguson's brigades of rebel cavalry struck the Union column ot! the left flank with so much force as to cut the Seventh Pennsylvania in two, but it was immediately rein forced by the Fourth Michigan, when a vigorous and irre sistible attack was made on the enemy, driving him from the ground in great disorder. The rebels were pursued to Flint River, and finally into the town of Jonesboro', two thirds of the town being destroyed by fire. While this was being done the rebel cavalry was reinforced by a brigade of infantrv. Kilpatrick's main object being to destroy the railroad rather than to whip the enemy, except when necessary in the execution of his purpose, he left Jonesboro' and marched directly toward Lovejoy's Station, on the Macon road. At a point one and one-half miles from the station the command began destroying the railroad. In the mean time the enemy was hurrying forward heavy bodies of troops by rail from Atlanta and Macon, and ere much time had elapsed Kilpat rick was surrounded by from eighteen to twenty thousand rebel troops of all arms, commanded by Gens. Cleburn, Reynolds, Jackson, Armstrong, Ferguson, and Ross. The position of Gen. Kilpatrick's force and the overpowering numbers opposing him rendered his condition most critical, leaving him to choose between surrender and the imminent prospect of destruction in the effort to extricate himself. The command reached Lithonia on the 21st; having made a circuit around Atlanta and the rebel armies, and having been in the saddle, and almost constantly engaged, since early in the morning of the 18th. After the fall of Atlanta the regiment moved northward, and on the 4th of October, 1864, joined its division \u2014 the Second \u2014 at Marietta, Ga., with which it started in pursuit of Hood's rebel army, then on its way into Middle Tennessee ; having had numerous skirmishes with its rear-guard. One of the sharpest of these encounters occurred near Rome, Ga., on the 13th of October. A body of Union troops was occupying Rome, and a force of mounted rebels undertook to drive it out. While a brisk skirmish was going on, Minty's brigade crossed the Oostenaula River and made a sabre charge on the flank of the Confederates. The latter fled in the utmost confusion. The Unionists rode over a rebel battery, captured it in an instant, and then pursued the enemy several miles, capturing many prisoners, and sabring those who resisted. The Fourth Michigan alone took one hundred and twenty-eight pris oners, which was about the number of the mounted men in the regiment ; nearly all the horses having been worn out by the severity of the service. The regiment, in pursuit of Hood's forces, then recrossed the Oostenaula and marched, vid Rome, Kingston, Adairsville, Resaca, Summersville, and Galesville, Ala., to Little River, where, on the 20th, it en gaged Wheeler's cavalry; forcing the enemy to retire. He chose the latter alternative, and Minty's brigade was instantly formed in a line of regimental columns to lead the charge. The Seventh Pennsylvania was on the right, the Fourth Michigan in the centre, and the Fourth United States on the left, with Long's brigade in the rear, and the Third Division, under Kilpatrick, on the left of the road. The advancing enemy was immediately charged upon by Minty's men, who, with drawn sabres, burst through the ranks of the rebels like a whirlwind, chasing them off the field, opening the way for the safe passage of other commands and the accomplishment of the objects of the expedition. A cor respondent of the Cincinnati Commercial described this charge of Minty's brigade as follows : \" While the various regiments were being man\u0153uvred into position to meet the onslaught of the rebels, who were sweeping down upon them, the men had time to comprehend the danger that surrounded them, \u2014 rebels to the right of them, rebels to the left of them, rebels in rear of them, rebels in front of them ; surrounded, there was no salvation but to cut their way out. Visions of Libby prison, Ander 6onville, and starvation flitted through their imagination, and they saw that the deadly conflict could not be avoided. Placing himself at the head of his brigade, the gallant and fearless Minty drew his sabre, and his voice rang out clear and loud: 'Attention, column! forvard, regulate by the centre regiment, trot, march ! \u2014 gallop, march !' and away the brigade went with a yell that echoed away across the valleys. Meanwhile the dismounted men, whose horses had been killed and worn out by the arduous service of the past six months, were sent to the rear from time to time, and em ployed in garrisoning block-houses on the line of the Nash ville and Huntsville Railroad. On the 17th of September, 1864, Corp. Charles M. Bickford and seventeen men of the regiment, stationed in a block-house, were attacked by Wheeler's rebel cavalry, a force of several thousand, with artillery, but, although the assailants shelled the block house for over five hours, they could not compel the gallant"], [135, "FOURTH CAVALRY. 127 little squad to surrender, and finally retired, after having eight men killed and sixty wounded. The corporal was promoted to be a commissioned officer, and the names of his men were honorably mentioned in general orders. fifteen hundred men of the Second Division in the assault ing column. These moved forward under a terrific fire from the breastworks, which was followed by a swift suc cession of volleys from the Spencer carbines of the Unionists steadily aimed at the top of the parapet. After the fight at Little River, before mentioned, the mounted men of the regiment, then numbering but about one hundred, transferred their horses to the Third Brie*ade, and proceeded to Louisville, Ky. The dismounted men also concentrated at the same point. They remained there until the latter part of December, 1864, being in the mean time remounted and furnished with new Spencer seven shooting carbines. Col. Long, the division commander, was shot in the head at the beginning of the assault, and Col. Minty,* of the Fourth Michigan, assuming command, led the division against the works. Increasing their pace, the Unionistsf dashed forward with resounding cheers, swarmed into the ditch and over the breastworks, killed, captured, or drove away the rebels almost in an instant, and took possession of the enemy's main line in twenty minutes after the first ad vance. Three hundred and twenty-four out of the fifteen hundred assailants were killed and wounded in this brief period. The inner line of works was also taken by the Second Division by the time the Fourth Division arrived at the outer line. The result of the whole operation was the capture of one hundred pieces of artillery, two thousand eight hundred prisoners, and an immense amount of am munition and stores. On the 28th of December, commanded by Lieut.-Col. Benjamin, D. Pritchard, the Fourth again moved south ward, with twenty-six officers and six hundred and ninety six enlisted men. It proceeded by way of Nashville to Gravelly Springs, Ala., where it remained until the 12th of March, 1865. Here its members suffered severely for want of rations, and were obliged to live on parched corn for several days. On the latter day the regiment broke camp, and set out on Gen. Wilson's great cavalry movement through Alabama aud Georgia. Four divisions of cavalry stretched iu an almost interminable line as the command made its way southward over mountains, rivers, creeks, and swamps, building miles of corduroy-roads, etc. It crossed the Black Warrior River on the 29th of March by swimming the horses, losing one man and from thirty to forty horses. During the night the Locust was crossed in the same man ner, and on the 31st Shades Creek and the Cahawba River were crossed by passing the accompanying battery over the railroad bridge, which was temporarily floored with ties ; five or six horses and mules being killed by falling nearly a hundred feet from the bridge to the river. On the 7th of April the command moved eastward; passing through Montgomery and Columbus into Georgia. A portion of Minty's brigade, \u2014 the Fourth Michigan and Third Ohio, \u2014 commanded by Lieut.-Col. Pritchard, marched all the night of the 17th of April to save the double bridges over the Flint River, reaching them early in the morning of the 18th, when a gallant sabre charge was made by one battalion of the Fourth Michigan, which carried the bridges and captured every man of the rebel force left to destroy them. The Second Division, which was in the advance, after a rapid march of twenty seven miles on the 20th of April, was met some twelve or fifteen miles from Macon, Ga., by a rebel officer with a flag of truce, who informed Col. Minty that an armistice had been stipulated between the contending armies, and requested him not to enter Macon. Col. Minty immediately reported the matter to Gen. Wil son, and awaited orders. The general replied that he had no notification of any armistice existing, and that he should not stay out of Macon ; and ordered Col. Minty to move forward. The enemy's cavalry under Forrest was encountered and defeated at Mulberry Creek on the 1st of April, and on the 2d, Minty's brigade, being in the advance, started at four A.M. on the direct road to Selma ; arriving in front of that place at two o'clock p.m. This, the chief city of Central Alabama, was surrounded by two lines of bastioned in trenchments. The works were found to be stronger and more perfect than those at Atlanta ; consisting of an inner line of redans and redoubts, mounted with 12-pounder howitzers and 20-pounder Parrots. The main and outer line, which extended entirely around the city from river to river, consisted of twenty-five redoubts or bastions con nected by curtains, the parapet being about twelve feet high and surrounded by a ditch and well-built palisade, in front of which was swampy ground, partially covered with abatis. These works were defended by Gen. Forrest with a force estimated at nine thousand. Thereupon Col. Minty said to the rebel officer, \" I will give you five minutes start (taking out his watch) in return ing to Macon, and you had better make good use of it.\" The officer and his escort set out on the gallop. Col. Minty sat on his horse, watch in hand, until the five minutes had elapsed, when he returned the watch and gave the order : \" Forward ! gallop, march !\" The division dashed forward, in thundering column, toward Macon. Over hill and down dale it pursued its head long course. The flag-bearers were run down and passed ; some small detachments stationed along the road were swept away like chaff, and at six p.m. the division dashed The Second Division, in which was the Fourth Michigan, was ordered to assault the works on the Summerville road, and the Fourth Division those on the Plantersville road. About the time the assault was to take place, the rebel Gen. Chalmers attacked the rear of the Second Division. Three regiments were detached to oppose him ; the re mainder, including the Fourth Michigan, swept forward to the assault. Besides the men holding the horses, the force resisting Chalmers, and other detachments, there were about * It is reported that Col. Minty was the first man to get inside tho enemy's works alive. f In this charge the Fourth United States and Third Ohio were at first repulsed, but the Fourth Michigan, under Lt.-Col. Pritchard pressed steadily onward, and were the first to leap over the works."], [136, "128 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. \" Let them shoot,\" said Davis, \" if they choose ; I may as well die here as anywhere.\" into Macon, where it received the unconditional surrender of Gen. Howell Cobb and about two thousand men, with sixty-two pieces of artillery. Being there officially notified of the surrender of the rebel armies under Lee and John ston, Gen. Wilson stayed the farther advance of his corps. But no one was inclined to be his executioner, and the squad, with the two prisoners, moved back toward the tents. Mrs. Davis, when questioned, admitted that her companion was the ex-President of the Confederacy. Gen. Cobb was highly indignant at the unceremonious manner in which the Union officers possessed themselves of Macon, and gave it as his opinion that when the matter was referred to the proper headquarters the Union troops would be ordered to withdraw. On the other hand, Gen. Wilson replied in most emphatic language that when his troops left the city, under such circumstances, there would not remain one brick upon another. Meanwhile Col. Pritchard had taken the greater part of the force and gone to the assistance of Lieut. Purinton, in whose front heavy firing was heard. It proved to come from a most unfortunate rencontre with a detachment of the First Wisconsin Cavalry, which was also in pursuit of Davis, and the advance-guard of which began firing on Purinton's men before ascertaining who they were. After this error was discovered (which was not until several men had been killed and wounded), Col. Pritchard returned to camp and discovered that, besides Davis, his wife, and four children, his command had also captured two of his aides de-camp, his private secretary, several other Confederate officers, thirteen private servants, waiting-maids, etc., mak ing a total of about thirty persons. As he rode up, Col. Pritchard was accosted by Davis, who asked if he was the officer in command. The colonel said he was, and asked how he should address his interlocutor. On the 7th of May the Fourth Michigan, four hundred and forty strong, under Lieut.-Col. Pritchard, left Macon for the purpose of capturing Jefferson Davis and his party, who were known to be making their way toward the coast. Having struck the trail of the fugitives at Abbeville on the 9th of May, Col. Pritchard selected one hundred and fifty-three of his best-mounted officers and men, and moved rapidly by a circuitous route to intercept them. At Irwins ville, at one o'clock in the morning of the 10th of May, the colonel learned that a train, which probably belonged to Davis, was encamped a mile and a half distant. \" Call me what or whoever you please,\" said the rebel chieftain. Moving out into the vicinity of the camp, he sent Lieut. Purinton, with twenty-five men, to wait on the other side of it. At daybreak Col. Pritchard and his men advanced silently, and without being observed, to within a few rods of the camp, then dashed forward and secured the whole camp before the astonished inmates could grasp their weapons, or even fairly arouse themselves from their slum bers. A chain of mounted guards was immediately placed around the camp, and dismounted sentries were stationed at the tents and wagons. \" Then I shall call you Davis,\" replied Pritchard. After a moment's hesitation the former admitted that that was his name. He then suddenly drew himself up with great dignity and exclaimed, \u2014 \" I suppose you consider it bravery to charge a train of defenseless women and children ; but it is theft ; it is van dalism.\" Without stopping to inquire whether the distinguished prisoner considered himself a woman or a child, the colonel set out with his command for Macon, joining the rest of the regiment on the way. While this was going on, Corporal George M. Munger, of Company C, and Private Andrew Bee, of Company L, observed two persons in women's dress moving rapidly away from one of the tents. The lucky man of the expedition was one Michael Lynch,* a deserter from the Confederate army, who had enlisted in the Fourth Michigan. He secured a pair of saddle-bags containing five thousand dollars in Confederate gold. Although vigilant search was made for it by the officers, he managed to conceal it, got out of camp with it, and buried it. He was strongly suspected from various circumstances of being the person who had it, and the act ing adjutant-general of the brigade endeavored to persuade him to give it up, saying it would certainly be found, and then he would lose it, but if he would give it up he (the officer) would use his influence to have it, or a part of it, given back to him. \" That ought to be attended to,\" said one of the sol diers. \" Yes,\" replied the other ; and Munger immediately rode around in front of the two persons and ordered a \" Halt !\" \" This is my mother-in-law,\" said one of them ; \" she is going after some water; can't you let her pass?\" Her companion, a tall person, much bent, wrapped in a woman's \" water-proof,\" with a shawl over the head and a pail in one hand, remained silent. \" No, you can't pass,\" replied Munger. t At that moment other soldiers rode up, and the hitherto silent personage, seeing that further disguise was useless, straightened up, dropped the pail, threw off the water-proof and shawl, and disclosed a tall, thin, sharp- faced, sour-look ing man, with gray hair, gray whiskers under his chin, and one blind eye. No one at first seemed to recognize in this forlorn fugitive the renowned chief of the defunct Confed eracy. Mrs. Davis, however (for she was his companion), had her wifely fears aroused by the grim faces and clanking arms around her, and threw her arms around her husband's neck, exclaiming, \u2014 \" Well now, captain,\" said Lynch, with great apparent frankness, \" I haven't got that money, but if had it I shouldn't be green enough to give it up.\" \" Why, what could you do with it?\" queried the officer. \" What could I do with it ?\" replied Lynch ; \" why, I would bury it, and after I was discharged I would come back and dig it up. But then I haven't got it.\" And this was precisely what he had done, and what after his discharge he did do. \" Dun't shoot him ! don't shoot him I\" * A worthless, quarrelsome, unprincipled fellow."], [137, "FOURTH CAVALRY. 129 From Macon, Col. Pritchard, with twenty-five officers and men, was ordered to Washington, as a special escort for Davis and his party. While this party went to Wash ington (giving Mr. Davis into the custody of the com mandaut at Fortress Monroe), the rest of the regiment re turned, by way of Atlanta and Chattanooga, to Nashville, where it was mustered out and paid off on the 1st of July, 1865.

During the winter of 1863-64 the Fifth had its quar ters at Stevensburg, Va., and was employed mostly on picket duty along the Rapidan. In the latter part of February, 1864, it took part in the raid made by the cavalry under Kilpatrick to the outer de fenses of Richmond. The main body of the regiment continued in service as a brigade until tbe close of the war; being commanded successively by Gens. Kilpatrick and Custer, and gain ing, whether rightly or wrongly, the highest reputation of any cavalry brigade in the service. As three of the regiments of which the brigade was composed follow each other consecutively, and as all of them contained a considerable representation from Allegan and Barry Counties, we have grouped them together under the general title given above. As there are numerous matters, however, which concern the regiments separately, we have furnished separate sketches of these bodies; giving the fullest description of the operations of the brigade in the history of the Fifth Regiment, which had the largest representation from these counties. FIFTH CAVALRY. Company I, of this regiment, was wholly an Allegan County organization. It was recruited by ex-Congressman *This celebrated body was composed of the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Cavalry. It was organized in the fore-part of 1863, and"], [139, "THE MICHIGAN CAVALRY BRIGADE. 131 crossed the Rapidan, marched thence, vid Spottsylvania and Beaver Dan Station to Hungary Station, and moved down the Brook turnpike to within five miles of the city of Rich mond. Being attacked on the 2d of March by a superior force of the enemy, the Union cavalry was compelled to fall back on Gen. Butler's forces, stationed at New Kent Court-House. ensued. The Fifth Cavalry fought dismounted, and charged the enemy's position under a heavy fire ; routing him after a most stubborn resistance. The rebels lost heavily in this engagement, including their commanding officer, Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, who was mortally wounded by a private of this regiment. Having brushed aside all the forces opposed to it, the Union column pursued its way \" on to Richmond \" unmolested. A detachment of the regiment had also accompanied the forces commanded by the gallant Col. Ulric Dahlgren. They moved down the James River to within five miles of the rebel capital. The detachment of the Fifth, being in front, charged the enemy's works and captured his first line of fortifications. Following up its advantage, Dahlgren's command pushed back the enemy from one line to another, until a point was reached within two miles of the city, when it was found impossible to advance farther with so small a force. Meanwhile the rebels were gathering from all points, and in the endeavor to extricate itself from its perilous position the detachment of the Fifth became separated in the night, which was rainy and very dark, from the main portion of Dahlgren's command. On the following day this detachment cut its way through a strong rebel force posted at Old Church, and succeeded in rejoining the regiment near White House Landing. At Yorktown, Va., on the 11th of March, the regiment embarked on board transports for Alexandria, whence it marched to Stevensburg, arriving there on the 18th of April, 1864. The next day the command arrived within a mile and a half of Richmond, but found fortifications in front on which cavalry could make no impression. Gen. Sheridan then turned his course toward the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge. The rebels had destroyed the bridge, and a large force of them disputed his further progress. The ap proaches to the stream led through a swamp, along which not more than four men could ride abreast, and a well posted battery on the opposite side cut down the head of the Union column, completely checking its advance. The leading brigade vainly endeavored to force a passage. The next one likewise sailed. Gen. Sheridan then sent for Custer and his Michigan brigade, which at once hastened to the front. There the youthful general dismounted the Fifth and Sixth Michigan, and sent them forward into the swamp as flanking-parties, while with drawn sabres the First and Seventh Michigan breathlessly awaited the order to charge. The dismounted men drove the enemy from their first position, advanced through water waist-deep to the railroad-bridge, crossed it on the ties, and then plied their Spencer rifles on the rebel cannoniers with such effect that the latter were obliged to turn their guns on these assailants to prevent being entirely enfiladed. The moment they did so Custer gave the order to \" Charge,\" and the two mounted regiments, with brand ished sabres and ringing cheers, dashed forward at the top of their horses' speed. The rebels had barely time to lim ber their guns and retreat ; leaving the road again open for the advance of the whole corps. The command then pro ceeded, via Malvern Hill, Hanover Court-House, White House, Ayelitt's and Concord Church, to Chesterfield Sta tion, where it joined the main Army of the Potomac. Here a reorganization of the cavalry forces, under Gen. Sheridan's command, took place, and the Michigan Cav alry Brigade was thenceforth known as the First Brigade of the First Division, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac. On the 5th of May the brigade, commanded by the fiery Custer, again crossed the Rapidan, and soon became en gaged in the great battle of the Wilderness ; fighting mounted, the first three days, against the forces led by the renowned rebel cavalry leader, Gen. J. E. B. Stuart. On the 9th of May the cavalry corps set out, under Gen. Sheridan, on his great raid toward Richmond. Three divisions, numbering full twelve thousand men, turned their horses' heads to the southward ; the blue-coated column, as it marched by fours, extending eleven miles along the road, from front to rear. On the route they overtook a large body of Union soldiers, who had been taken prisoners at Spott- sylvania, released them, and captured the rebel guard. Toward evening, the same day, the Michigan brigade, followed closely by the rest of the column, dashed into the rebel depot at Beaver Dam Station, scattering, almost in an instant, the force stationed for its defense. All night long the men were busy destroying the immense amount of rebel supplies accumulated at Beaver Dam, worth millions of dollars, consisting of three long railroad trains, with loco motives, stores of goods of various kinds, and one hundred loaded army-wagons, the flames of which rose in lurid col umns through the darkness amid the cheers of the ex ultant soldiers. On the 28th of May the regiment was hotly engaged near Hawes' Shop, where it aided in driving the enemy from their position after a desperate hand-to-hand fight. The loss of the regiment in this action was very severe. Moving to Old Church Tavern on the 30th, it was engaged with its brigade in the routing of Young's rebel cavalry. On the 31st of May and 1st of June it was engaged, to gether with other cavalry regiments, at Cold Harbor, where it sought dismounted in advance of the infantry, and, although losing heavily, succeeded in capturing many prisoners. The Michigan brigade soon after set out under Gen. Sheridan to join Gen. Hunter, who was moving from the Shenandoah Valley to Lynchburg. On the Uth of June the command met at Trevillian Station a large force of the enemy, both infantry and cavalry. During that day and the next there ensued one of the severest cavalry fights of the war, the Union cavalry mostly fighting dismounted. The Michigan brigade did most of the fighting the first day, and lost heavily. The brigade battery was three times At daybreak the next morning the command moved forward, and after tearing up the railroad-track at Negro Foot Station it reached \" Yellow Tavern,'' ten miles from Richmond, on the 11th of May. There Gen. Stuart had assembled a large force of rebel cavalry, and a severe battle"], [140, "132 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. fighting dismounted, \u2014 and finally succeeded, with the rest of Sheridan's corps, in capturing the enemy's line of defense, and several thousand prisoners. From this time until the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, April 9, 1865, it was constantly engaged with the enemy, and, being in the ad vance, the flag of truce to negotiate the surrender was sent through its lines. captured by the enemy, and as many times recaptured by the determined efforts of the Michigan men. The rebels were finally driven from the field and pursued several miles ; six hundred prisoners, fifteen hundred horses, one stand of colors, six caissons, forty ambulances, and fifty wagons being captured by the victorious Unionists. Moving subsequently in the direction of Louisa Court- House, the regiment encountered a column of the enemy, but cut its way through with considerable loss in prisoners. Gen. Hunter failed to make the passage of the mountains. Gen. Sheridan, in consequence, then marched his troops to White House Landing, and soon after joined tho Army of the Potomac, south of Petersburg. After the surrender of Lee this regiment moved with the cavalry corps to Petersburg, Va. Soon afterward it made an incursion, with other forces, into North Carolina ; thence it marched to Washington, D. O, participated in the re view of the Army of the Potomac, May 23, 1865, and imme diately thereafter, with the Michigan Cavalry Brigade, was ordered to the Western frontier. The Fifth was sent by rail and steamboat to Fort Leavenworth, Kan., where the men having two years or more to serve were transferred to the First and Seventh Michigan Cavalry Regiments. On the 22d of June the regiment, as an organization, was mustered out of service. It arrived in Detroit, Mich., July 1, 1865, and was there paid off and disbanded. After serving on picket and scout duty in front of Rich mond and Petersburg during the month of July, 1864, the Michigan brigade was taken on transports to Washington, D. O, early in August, and thence marched to the Shen andoah Valley. Here it followed Custer in many a desperate charge, fully sustaining its old renown. At Middletown the Fifth Cavalry was attacked by a strong force of the enemy, but repulsed them, capturing sixty-five prisoners. Again, on the 19th of August, while a squadron of the reg iment were scouting to the front, they were attacked by a greatly superior force of the enemy under the guerrilla leader Moseby, and being overpowered were driven into camp with a loss of sixteen men killed.

As victors, it emerged into the open country on the 8th of May, and on the morning of the 9th started with Sheridan's corps on a raid to the rear of the rebel armies, the brigade leading this splendid body of twelve thousand veteran cavalrymen.

The Sixth assisted in destroying the immense rebel depot of supplies at Beaver Dam Station, fought in the thickest of the battle at Yellow Tavern, and gained imperishable honor at the crossing of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge.* Again, at Hawes' Shop, on the 28th of May, 1864, the regiment took part in a decisive charge on the enemy's lines. After a severe conflict the rebels were forced to retire, leaving their dead and wounded on the field. The Sixth lost heavily in this engagement. Of its members present, one-fourth were either killed or wounded in less than ten minutes. William H. Cook, Co. L, of this regt., was from Barry County. He was last reported as missing in action at Trevillian Statiou, Va., June 11, 1S64. SIXTH CAVALRY. Allegan County had but few members in the Sixth Cav alry, but Barry was represented in all its companies except I; Company K being almost exclusively from that county. The regiment rendezvoused at Grand Rapids. Its ranks were rapidly filled, and it was mustered into the United States service, under the command of Col. George Gray, on the 13th of October, 18G2. Mounted and equipped, but not armed, carrying on its rolls the names of one thousand two hundred and twenty-niue officers and men, it left the regimental rendezvous on the 10th of December following, and proceeded to the seat of war in Virginia. Engaging in the raid of Sheridan's forces towards Gor donsville, the regiment, on the 11th of June, participated in the battle of Trevillian Station, charging the enemy re peatedly, and capturing many prisoners, most of whom, however, were recaptured. From the time it crossed the Rapidan, on the 5th of May, until it passed the James, on the 28th of June, the regiment lost twenty-nine men killed. sixty wounded, and sixty-four missing. It was soon assigned to the Second Brigade of the Third Division of the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac (the Michigan Cavalry Brigade), of which a somewhat extended notice has been given in the sketch of the preceding regi ment, to which the reader is referred for details. Before the beginning of its first campaign Company K, by reason of discharges and resignations, had lost all its original commissioned officers except Lieut. Pendill. Early in August the Michigan brigade, with others of Sheridan's command, was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley, where it took an active part in all the skirmishes, battles, marches, and counter-marches that occurred during this part of the Shenandoah campaign, \u2014 a campaign which The regiment fought at Hanover, Pa., June 30, 18G3; at Hunterstown and Gettysburg, Pa., and Monterey, Cave towu, Suiithtown, Boonsboro', Hagerstown, Williamsport, * See history of Fifth Cnvalrv."], [142, "134 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. had made the names of Sheridan, Winchester, and Cedar Creek famous from one end of the country to the other. On the 17th of September, in pursuance of orders issued by Maj. -Gen. Dodge, the men of the Sixth whose term of service did not expire before Feb. 1, 1866, were consoli dated with the First Michigan Cavalry', and the rest of the regiment was ordered to Fort Leavenworth, Kan. It was there mustered out of service Nov. 24, 1865, and on the 30th of the same month it arrived at Jackson, Mich., where its members received final pay and discharge-papers. The actions in which the Sixth participated in the valley may be summarily catalogued as those of Front Royal, Leetown, Smithfield, Opequan Creek, Winchester, Luray, Port Republic, Mount Crawford, Fisher's Hill, Woodstock, and Cedar Creek. In December, 1864, it went into winter quarters near Winchester. Its total list of killed to No vember 1st amounted to fifty-five, while forty-four of its members had died of disease. BARRY COUNTY SOLDIERS. Field and Staff. During the last days of February, 1865, the regiment began its final Virginia campaign. After a long and event ful march under Sheridan, during which it helped to defeat the rebel Gen. Rosser at Louisa Court-House, to break up the Lynchburg and Gordonsville Railroad, and to destroy the locks, aqueducts, and mills on the James River Canal, it reached White House Landing on the 19th of March, and immediately took part in the succession of brilliant triumphs which ended at Appomattox Court-House on the 9th of April, 1865. After the surrender, the rebel Gen. Pickett, who was taken prisoner in one of these engage ments, spoke of a charge made by this regiment which he witnessed as being the \" bravest he had ever seen.\" Q.-M. W. H. Jewel), Assyria; com.

At that point the Sixth received orders to cross the Plains. These orders produced much dissatisfac tion among its members, as they, with all other volunteers, had supposed that with the collapse of the Rebellion their services would no longer be required. Remembering, how ever, their noble record as a regiment, adhering firmly to the high degree of discipline and faithful observance of orders which had ever distinguished them, its members marched forward by way of Fort Kearney and Julesburg to Fort Laramie.

It took part in minor actions at Thoroughfare Gap, Va., May 21, 1863 ; at Greenwich, Va., May 30th, and at Hanover, Pa., on the 30th of June. On the 3d of July at Gettysburg it was very hotly engaged, charging the enemy repeatedly, and having fifty-seven of its men killed and wounded, be sides twelve missing and twelve taken prisoners.

A. C. Litchfield. The command soon marched to Yorktown, whence it proceeded by transports to Alexandria, Va. During the year ending Nov. 1, 1864, the regiment had had no less than one hundred and fifty-nine officers and men killed and wounded, \u2014 a very heavy loss for a cavalry regiment. Having crossed the Rapidan with the Army of the Po tomac on the 5th of May, the regiment set out on the 9th in Gen. Sheridan's movement against the enemy's com munications. On the 11th it was in the battle of Yellow Tavern ; charging the enemy's cavalry and driving it from the field, and having eighteen of its own men killed and wounded. The operations of the Michigan Cavalry Brigade on that raid have been mentioned in the sketch of the Fifth Cavalry, previously given, and the Seventh took its full share in them all. The Seventh remained in camp near Winchester most of the time until the 27th of February, 1865, when it moved up the Shenandoah Valley, with its corps, to take part in Gen. Sheridan's celebrated march to the James River. On the 8th of March the regiment aided in routing a portion of Rosser's cavalry near Louisa Court-House, and captur ing the town. After destroying a large part of the Lynch burg and Gordonsville Railroad, and the locks, aqueducts, and mills on the James River Canal, the command reached White House Landing on the 19th of March, and was soon, with the cavalry corps, established on the left of the Army of the Potomac. The Seventh took an active part in the battle of Five Forks, and was engaged with the enemy almost till the moment of Lee's surrender at Appo mattox. After rejoining the army it attacked the rebel cavalry on the 27th of May, charging and driving one of their brigades several miles, and capturing forty-one men. The next day it was in a fight at Hawes' Shop, where fourteen of its men were killed and wounded. It also took part in the attack on the enemy's works at Cold Harbor on the 30th of May, fighting dismounted in advance of the in fantry. With the rest of the Michigan brigade and other regi ments, it then moved, under Gen. Sheridan, towards Gor donsville, and on the 11th and 12th of June had a hard cavalry fight at Trevillian Station, losing twenty-nine killed and wounded during the conflict. On the first day of the fight a small squad of the Seventh recaptured from a large force of the rebels a piece of artillery which had been taken from a Union battery. After a short stay in North Carolina the Michigan bri gade returned to Washington, and thence proceeded to Fort Leavenworth, whence it was ordered to cross the Plains and operate against the hostile Indians. There was much bitterness felt by the men at this extension of their service to another field from what was originally intended. Nevertheless, they crossed the Plains to the Rocky Moun tains, and were employed until November in guarding the overland stage-route from the Indians. About the 1st of November the regiment transferred two hundred and fifty men, whose term extended beyond March 1, 1866, to the First Michigan ; the remainder of the regiment returning to Fort Leavenworth, and being there mustered out of the service. It was paid off and disbanded at Jackson, Mich., on the 25th of December, 1866. The command then returned to the main army, and on the 31st of July the Michigan brigade set out for Wash ington and the Shenandoah Valley. On the 16th of August the Seventh Cavalry was in the battle of Crooked Run, where it had twelve men killed and wounded, and where, according to the official report, \" one battalion charged a brigade of rebel cavalry, routing them and cap turing nearly a hundred prisoners.\" On the 25th of August it was engaged near Shepherds town, with slight loss. On the 29th, its division being at tacked by infantry in force, it covered the retreat to Smith field, having fourteen killed and wounded. BARRY COUNTY MEMBERS. Field and Staff. Surg. Wm.

Twenty-three officers and men were killed and wounded in the Seventh ; among the mortally wounded being its commander, Lieut.-Col. Melvin Brewer.

When the rebel Gen. John H. Morgan made his celebrated raid through the States of Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio, the Eighth was one of the foremost in the chase, and, hanging closely on his flanks and rear, at length brought him to bay at Buffington Island, Ohio. Here, on the 19th of July, 1863, it immediately attacked and routed his forces ; capturing two hundred and seventeen prisoners, besides killing and wounding many others. Twice during this pursuit of Morgan the regiment marched forty-eight hours, halting but twice on each occasion, and then only for a few min utes.

Brown left its rendezvous for the field on the 17th of the same month ; its rolls showing the names of nine hundred and twenty-one officers and enlisted men. Company C was almost wholly from Barry County, while the same county was also represented in all the other companies except those of A, B, E, and I. Six men from Allegan County were dis -tributed among five different companies. (See roster.) The Eleventh proceeded to Lexington, Ky., and, after receiving arms and equipments, was employed during the months of January and February, 1864, in scouting; having its head quarters at Lexington. In April it moved to Louisa, Ky., and, with the Thirty-Ninth Kentucky Infantry, with which it was brigaded, was employed in protecting the eastern part of the State from rebel raids and incursions, which came in from Virginia, until the last of May, when it was sent on an expedition into West Virginia, under Gens. Bur bridge and Hobson ; but, hearing that the rebels, under Morgan, had invaded Kentucky, the division returned, and by forced marching overtook the enemy at Mount Sterling, Ky. Here, on the 8th of June, the enemy was routed with severe loss. On the 12th of the same month the rebels were again encountered at Cynthiana, and a second time defeated and dispersed.

This regiment contained a comparatively large number of men from the counties of Allegan and Barry, but they were scattered through several of the batteries of which the regiment was composed, and the histories of these bat teries are as unconnected with each other as are those of the same number of cavalry or infantry regiments. There fore the First Light Artillery cannot be described as a whole ; nor is it practicable, except in the case of Battery C, to give separate sketches of the several batteries, in each of which a few men only were found fiom these counties. Battery C, however, drew about forty men from the two counties (all but one, we believe, from Allegan), and of that we will therefore give a slight sketch. In the latter part of 1864 the regiment was transferred to Nashville, Tenn. ; thence by steamers it proceeded to Eastport, Miss., and on the 11th of February, 1865, it be gan a march, vid Florence, Huntsville, Stevenson, and Bridgeport, Ala., to Chattanooga, Tenn.

The village of Allegan is located on both sides of the Kalamazoo River, which pursues its winding course in such manner as almost to surround the business part of the village. The residence portion is built partly on the peninsula first alluded to, and partly on a plateau which rises from 20 to 50 feet above the surface of the river. The upper and lower sections of the village both have very irregular boundaries, and two or three ravines also diversify the landscape. Extensive views of the lower part of the town and of the surrounding country are obtained from the plateau before mentioned. Altogether the village has one of the most picturesque sites to be found in any por- tion of Michigan. It is amply supplied with shade-trees, among which are many native pines and oaks that add greatly to its beauty. George Ketchum, east half of northeast half of section 29, Nov. 29, 1833.

Nev ertheless, after Mr. Ely's interest passed conditionally into the hands of Judge Hubbard, as already mentioned, there was very little distinction between the two companies. THE ALLEGAN AND BOSTON COMPANIES. During the year 1833, Mr. George Ketchum, of Mar shall, Calhoun Co., and Messrs. Stephen Vickery and An thony Cooley, of Kalamazoo, purchased from the govern ment a tract of land now covered by the central portion of the village of Allegan. Stephen Russell and others bought lands at the same period, which were subsequently included in the village, but we are now dealing with the nucleus of the place. On November of that year they sold one undi vided third of their land to Mr. Elisha Ely, of Rochester, N. Y. (subsequently known at Allegan as Judge Ely), who agreed to have a race dug and a saw-mill erected there. In May, 1834, an arrangement was made for the convey ance of Mr. Ely's interest to his son, Alexander L. Ely, and a deed to that effect was executed. It was not recorded, as the elder Ely evidently retained some kind of a claim on the property. Yet the younger man acted as the virtual owner, and wa3 the principal manager of the enterprise. Mr. Sidney Ketchum continued for many years the agent of the Eastern capitalists, managing their interests in both \"companies.\" In 1841, F. J. Littlejohn was appointed resident agent under him. In 1835, Elisha and Alexander L. Ely removed to Alle gan, and Sidney Ketchum also spent much of his time there. In 1835 a plat of the village was made, and meas ures were at once taken to further the interests of the ham let. Work had, in fact, been begun in 1834, but only a little had been done. The race was dug, the dam built, and a saw-mill erected. The need of a school-house was apparent as laborers in the interest of the company arrived, which was soon after built, and tenement-houses followed in rapid succession. The most sanguine expectations were indulged in with regard to the future of the little village, and, with the prospect of a railroad, there was no limit to the value of property. It is credibly stated that Mr. A. L. Ely was offered $100,000 for his third interest in the property. He refused this offer, but proposed to unite with the other holders of the property and dispose of forty shares at $5000 per share ; stipulating that Judge Hubbard and Trowbridge should retain the title as trustees. A few shares were sold at exorbitant figures, the proceeds of which were devoted to the improvement of the property. During the summer of 1834 he and his other partners, Ketchum, Vickery, and Cooley, projected the village of Allegan, Mr. Oshea Wider, a civil engineer, having ascer tained that there was a fall of eight feet in the Kalamazoo River at the point in question. Before anything was done, however, an important change of ownership was made. In the summer of 1834, Hon. Samuel Hubbard, of Boston, one of the judges of the Supreme Court of Mas sachusetts, employed Mr. Ketchum, of Marshall, to buy some wild lands for him in Michigan. Mr. Ketchum made some purchases in Allegan County, and recommended Judge Hubbard to secure an interest in the village pro jected by Ely and his associates at the rapids of the Kala mazoo. The judge consulted some of his friends, and the re sult was that he and Edmund Monroe and Pliny Cutler, of Boston, and Charles C. Trowbridge, of Detroit, united in purchasing the interest of Messrs. Vickery, Cooley, and George Ketchum in the village tract, that interest being the one undivided two-thirds. Hubbard held the title for him self and the three other gentlemen named. Subsequently Judge Hubbard loaned Mr. A. L. Ely several thousand dollars, and Mr. Trowbridge took the title of Ely's interest, holding it for Hubbard's benefit, as security for his claim, so that Samuel Hubbard and C. C. Trowbridge appear on the records as proprietors of the village. In June, 1835, the lots in the village plat were placed on sale. Col. Joseph Fisk enjoyed the distinction of being the first purchaser, securing lots Nos. 282 and 283. This was the beginning of a period of inflation in Allegan, which in creased in 1836 and '37 (embracing in its course a \"wild cat\" banking project by which unsalable acres were made the basis of a bank of issue), and which finally culminated in one grand financial wreck, depriving the settlers of all available capital save their own indomitable courage and tireless industry. The first survey of the village embraced two tiers of blocks, and was (partly on account of the haste in which it was made) both ill planned and inaccurate. The proprie tors consequently employed Flavius J. Littlejohn to make a second survey in 1837 and '38. Yet even in this Mr. Littlejohn was forced to work in accordance with the lines already adopted, which will account for the irregularity of the present village plat. By direction of the company, Mr. Littlejohn repaired, during the winter of 1838, to Albany, N. Y., where he had a plate engraved and 500 copies printed for distribution. The plates were then placed in the hands of Mr. Trowbridge, one of the proprietors, who, later, had a second edition printed from them. Soon after the purchase by Judge Hubbard and his friends, he, Cutler, Monroe, Trowbridge, and A. L. Ely formed themselves into the \" Allegan Company\" for the purpose of developing the intended emporium. This was not, however, an incorporated company ; it was merely a firm, composed of the gentlemen named, who adopted that name for the purpose of convenience. The people gener ally spoke of it as \" The Company.\" About the same time, Hubbard, Monroe, Cutler, and Trowbridge, who had then purchased, or subsequently did so, over 20,000 acres of wild land outside of the village, in Allegan and other counties, assumed the name of the \" Boston Company\" in all their operations connected with those lands, in order to distinguish that part of their busi ness from the village matters in which Ely was concerned. This \" company,\" like the Allegan Company, was not in corporated. Yet, on account of both firms being composed The projectors of the village did not allow themselves to become discouraged, and in 1838 a railroad was surveyed from Allegan to Marshall, and an agent appointed to take charge of the work of construction. The sanguine parents of this scheme were no more fortunate than in their other"], [161, "149 ALLEGAN VILLAGE. projects ; the railroad enjoyed a brief existence only in the minds of the credulous directors. ground the previous year on a prospecting-tour. The proprietors of the village had already made a beginning, and found themselves much in want of labor to complete the system of improvements that had been projected. Mr. Ely returned to Rochester, aud brought back with him a small company, consisting of Leander S. Prouty, his wife, and a small boy ; Andy J. Pomeroy, who was appointed foreman of the work to be undertaken ; and J. Hoyt. The village had now become, during its brief existence, comparatively well settled, emigrants from the East having been attracted by the fame of its water-power and the en terprise which the proprietors had displayed in its early settlement. After the railroad project had failed, and the wildcat bank had spread disaster around, the condition of the community became more and more straitened. Nearly everybody owed the company. Mr. Prouty states that on their arrival at Detroit, whither they had come by lake from Rochester, they purchased a yoke of oxen and a wagon, the latter being well laden with household-goods. One team proving insufficient, they hired another on the route, to assist them in reaching Kalamazoo, for which they paid the exorbitant sum of $40. From that point they depended upon the river to reach their destina tion, and embarked upon rafts; Mr. Ely having purchased lumber with which to erect shanties on their arrival. A man named Sherwood took charge of one of the rafts, while Mr. Prouty revived the maritime experience of his younger days in commanding the other. Some one, about 1839 or 1840, suggested that the com pany set the people at work repairing the race and dam, which by this time were in a bad condition, and pay them in company orders. This was done, and very numerous and curious were the uses to which this locaf currency was put, some amusing illustrations on this head being given in a letter published in the Allegan .Journal, in 1878, from which the most of our information regarding the Allegan and Boston Companies is derived. The writer says: \" Everybody owed the company, therefore the ' company orders' were equal to gold. I spent some days with Mr. Doane Davis at his hotel. One evening there was a writing-class of young men and young women in tho dining-room. I was agreeably surprised. I said, ' Doane, how do these young people contrive to pay the master ?' 'Oh,' replied Doane, ' they pay in company orders ; they take them for their services, and, as he owes the company, they are gold to him.' Another evening there was a dance. Doaue's wagon brought the young people. The pipers came from some creek above Allegan. Doane got the party a nice supper. 'How's this, Doane?' 'All right,' said he ; ' I owe the company, the pipers owe the company, nnd it is gold to us.' ' Well,' I asked, ' how do you do for small ch.inge ?' ' Easily,' said Doane; 'Judge Ely has a little attachment to the saw mill, and there he turns out wooden bowls.'\" Before the little squadron had proceeded far on its journey Sherwood's craft capsized, and much of its freight was thrown overboard. By a desperate effort the pork and other valu able articles which comprised the cargo were secured, and, by the exercise of a very rigid discipline as commander, Mr. Prouty finally succeeded in bringing the party to their much-desired destination. The ladies of the company went ashore while the rafts were being repaired, and excited no little wonder and admiration among the Indians, many of whom had never before seen a white woman. Arriving at the spot where the city of Allegan was to be built, they at once erected a shanty on a bit of ground nearly opposite tho site of the Chaffee House, Wallace Crittenden, who had joined the party on the way, driving the first nail, and causing the forest first to re-echo to the sound of the hammer. This was in 1840. Company orders wer^e not current in the payment of taxes, and this fact presented the most serious obstacle to the financial schemes of the little com munity. Although the business of the country began to revive from this time, yet the fortunes of the Boston and Allegan Companies showed no improvement. One of the Boston partners failed in business ; another disposed of his share to a Mr. Jabez Fitch, who soon after died, and the company's affairs seemed involved in a labyrinth of embarrassments. An acre of ground was immediately cleared, and one of the party was dispatched to Otsego to secure a plow, their own having been left in the bed of the Kalamazoo at the time of the disaster to the raft. This ground they planted with potatoes and such seeds as had been brought from the East, raising crops which afforded them an ample supply for winter. Mr. and Mrs. Prouty were bo.th employed by the proprietors to keep house for the men in their employ, for which the former was to receive $12.50 a month, and the latter $5 for the same period. They occupied the shanties first erected until more comfortable and spacious log houses were built, into which they removed. A steamboat was built at Singapore by the proprietors of Allegan, about 1842, which was named the \" C. C. Trow bridge,\" and was intended to run on the Kalamazoo River. It only made two trips, however, and was then taken off. The early boats are mentioned in Chapter XIX. in the general history. In 1844 an inventory of unsold lands of the Boston Company was made, embracing in all about 20,000 acres. These were classified and appraised, and were then divided among the owners by lot. Provisions were scarce, and the supply brought with them was limited. Schoolcraft, forty miles distant, was the most accessible point at which they could be obtained, and thither Mr. Prouty repaired to supply his larder. He returned with a quantity of pork, which, for want of a more convenient method of conveyance, he was obliged to carry on his back. Fish aud game were readily obtained from the Indians, who were ever eager to \"swop\" those commodities for bread, potatoes, and other articles in more general use among the whites. In 1849 the Allegan village property not previously sold was disposed of at auction by the trustees, the proceeds being divided among the interested parties. Judge Hubbard had died during the interval, leaving Mr. Trowbridge, who still resides in Detroit, the sole survivor of the original partners Allegan at this early day presented all the aspects of an uncleared wilderness. Indians were numerous, the deer and wolf were as yet hardly conscious of the presence of the EARLY SETTLEMENTS. The settlement of the village of Allegan began in 1834, though Elisha Ely, of Rochester, N. Y., had beeu over the"], [162, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 150 Miss Mary Weare, and George Y. Warner to Mrs. Wil liams, both ceremonies being performed by the Rev. Wil liam Jones. settler, and the \" massasaugas\" were so abundant as to make it necessary for the laborers to protect their limbs with a covering of white-ash bark as a safeguard against their venomous bite. Mr. Prouty very soon proved him self a valuable man to the village company, and was given the position of foreman of the work being carried on, which position he held for fifteen months. At the expiration of this period he removed to township 1, range 13 (now Trowbridge), where he had previously entered 200 acres, on which he still resides. Indian wigwams at this time lined the bank of the river, Macsaubee, one of the chiefs, aud a few of his followers choosing the peninsula where are now the race and mills. Farther down the stream they raised a sufficient quantity of corn to supply their meagre wants. They were on cor dial terms with the whites, and especially kind in time of sickness. Macsaubee had several bright, intelligent sons and a very attractive daughter. The language of the aborigines was for a time entirely unintelligible to the settlers, and a half-breed whom Mr. Ely brought from the East did good service in interpreting between the people of the two races. Very soon, however, their language became somewhat familiar to many of the whites, and conversation with them was comparatively easy. An addition was made to the colony by the birth of a daughter to Mr. and Mrs. Prouty, who, though the earliest white infant in Allegan, was born in Otsego. Mr. Ely, in honor of the event, presented the little one with a village lot. That gentleman returned to Rochester in the fall of 1834, being replaced by his son, Alexander L. Ely, who very soon became prominently identified with the growth of the village. The next year his father resumed his resi dence in the county, and made it his permanent home. Mr. Prouty was succeeded by Mr. Keep and wife, who were the landlord and landlady at the boarding-house for a season, but, not being favorably impressed with the advan tages of Allegan, they soon departed. Rochester had another representative in Allegan in Horace Wilson, who arrived in 1835, when there were but two log houses in the place. He soon made himself acquainted with the characteristics of the country round about, and was for a while actively employed in pointing out desirable localities to speculators and pioneers. He also cleared off the main portion of the village, now occupied by imposing business blocks, felling the lofty trees which grew there with dauntless energy and industry. Col. Joseph Fisk, another Rochester pioneer, followed soon after, his advent occurring in the spring of 1835. At the time of his arrival there was but one family in the place, that of Leander S. Prouty, and but one other family in the four western ranges of Allegan County, that of Wil liam G. Butler, of Saugatuck. Col. Fisk came at the insti gation of Sidney Ketchum, then acting as agent of the Alle gan and Boston Companies and the proprietors of Allegan, who had pictured in a very attractive light the future of that place. He at once erected a log house on the site of the Allegan House, and then returned to Marshall for his family, bringing them by way of the Kalamazoo River. On his arrival the whole white population of the county numbered but sixty souls. On the site of his first log house he after wards built the Allegan House, and was its earliest land lord. In company with Alva Fuller he opened a store con taining a general stock on the east end of Hubbard Street, nearly opposite his residence, and ordered a supply of goods from New York. No less than three months were con sumed in transporting the goods to their destination, and the expense amounted to $2.50 per huudred pounds. Col. Fisk became the first owner of land in the village, aside from the company. In 1837, in connection with Sidney Ketchum, he built the first grist-mill, on the site now oc cupied by Oliver & Co.'s furniture-manufactory. Later he engaged in the purchase and shipment of grain, and em barked extensively in the construction of railways in this and other States. These trees were burned some time after chopping, when the fire, becoming uncontrollable, destroyed several dwell ings which had been erected, and the frame of the only church edifice in the village. Mr. Wilson seems to have been satisfied with this latest achievement, for he soon after left the allurements of village life for the less exciting pur suits of a farmer, locating in the township of Monterey. Among the pioneers of 1835, who by their public spirit and energy have done much to make Allegan the progres sive village it is, may be mentioned the name of Ira Chaffee, who came to that place from Ogdcnsburg, N. Y., in 1835, and at once engaged to Alexander L. Ely for a year at small wages. He proved himself so efficient that his wages were more than quadrupled the following year, when he was selected to superintend the erection of a dam and saw mill for other parties at Swan Creek, seven miles below the village. He was then occupied in running one of the com pany's saw-mills. At a later period Mr. Chaffee became engaged in various business enterprises of his own, and in 1841 he purchased the saw-mill built by the proprietors of the village, which he has managed continuously since that time. In 1872 he built the Chaffee House, an imposing structure, which in point of convenience and excellence of material ranks among the finest hotels of the State. Mr. Chaffee is still a resident of Allegan, and is actively engaged in business pursuits. In the spring of 1835 the first birth occurred in the settlement, \u2014 that of Joseph Allegan Fisk, son of Col. and Mrs. Joseph Fisk. The middle name was adopted at the request of Mr. Ely. The little one, however, hardly reached the age of one year, and his was probably the first death in the village. The same year (1835) also witnessed the first marriage, or rather marriages, in Allegan. On Christmas Day, Alexander L. Ely was united in wedlock to Doane D. Davis, David Anthony, and one Baker came in 1835, at the suggestion of Col. Fisk, and were engaged in building for him ; the former marrying the following year and making Allegan his home. During the earlier years of his residence he followed the trade of a carpenter. Later he was engaged as a contractor, and was actively interested in various enterprises of considerable importance. He was"], [163, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 151 also elected to several official positions, and during one term held the office of county treasurer. Mr. Davis, as the result of years of well-directed industry, left on his death a handsome estate to his widow, who bequeathed in her will a considerable legacy to the Baptist Church of the village, of which she was a member. subsequently elected a justice of the peace and a probate judge. He died, however, early in the history of Allegan. Elisha Moody improved a quarter section of land now embraced in the village limits, but soon after, becoming weary of the privations incident to a newly-settled country, returned to Rochester, whence he had come in 1835 at the suggestion of Mr. Ely. Elias Streeter, another New York pioneer, made his advent in 1835, accompanied by his three sons, \u2014 J. B., T. E., and A. L. Streeter, \u2014 all of whom are now residents of Allegan. On Mr. Streeter's arrival he engaged in labor for the proprietors of the village, but afterwards, preferring a more independent career, he embarked in the lumbering business on his own account. He established a first-class record ,as a hunter, and was also remarkably skillful as a trapper. On one occasion, while placing in position a heavy iron wolf-trap, several miles from home, his wrist was caught between its formidable teeth, which deeply mangled the flesh. The spring of the trap was so strong that he was unable to open the jaws with his remaining hand. In spite of the intense pain, he made his way to a sapling, which, having a hatchet with him, he cut down with one hand. Out of this he succeeded in making a wedge. He then by repeated efforts forced it a little at a time between the teeth of the trap, and finally, after much labor and great suffer ing, opened the jaws so that he could extricate his hand from their terrible grasp. Mr. Streeter died many years since, at his home in Allegan. Rev. W. Jones was the first divine who cast his fortunes with the pioneers of Allegan. He built a residence on the ground now occupied by the First National Bank, and held the earliest religious meeting in the little hamlet. His ser vices were much in demand on wedding occasions, when his genial nature contributed greatly to the pleasure of the occasion. Among the remaining settlers of 1835 were B. Eager, L. Fish, J. Weare, and a few others who soon removed out of the village and located themselves on farms. The year 1836 witnessed a great increase in the emi gration to Allegan. It has seemed to us as if the remark of an old settler, that \" everybody came in 1836,\" was almost literally true. Among the emigrants of that year the following are recalled : Flavius J. Littlejohn was born in Herkimer Co., N. Y., in July, 1804. He graduated from Hamilton College, in that State, in 1827, delivering the valedictory address. In the spring of 1836, finding his health failing, he removed to Allegan, with the purpose of devoting his energies to surveying and such other occupations as would admit of an active out-of-door life. He had been in the settlement but a year when the Allegan Company employed him to make a survey of the village, the preliminary survey of Oshea Wilder not having proved accurate, probably from want of the necessary facilities. He was engaged in this labor until 1838, as already mentioned. W. C. Jenner had formerly been a British subject. He made Allegan his home in 1835, bringing with him two sons, W. B. and T. C. Jenner. He was the first shoemaker in Allegan, and his skill in that occupation was in great demand. At a later period he and his son, T. C. Jenner, embarked in the dry-goods business at Allegan. He erected, on the corner of Locust and Hubbard Streets, a comfort able frame house, in which he resided until his death. The family have resided here ever since his arrival in 1835. His son, W. B. Jenner, still survives. After this, at the solicitation of friends, he entered into the practice of law. During the years 1842, 1843, and 1844 he was a member of the House of Representatives of Michigan, and in 1845 and 1846 he served as a State senator; was re-elected to the House in 1847; serving in 1848; being present during the first session held at Lan sing. While a senator he was the chairman of the Com mittee on Revision of the Statutes, and during his second year he was the president pro tempore of the Senate. John Askins was the first millwright who sought the wilds of Allegan. He followed the fortunes of Judge Ely, as did many other Rochester emigrants of 1835. Being also a skillful carpenter and joiner, he was employed in building the dam and saw-mill, and, a little later, found a wide field for his labors in the erection of buildings for the pioneers. He enjoyed the reputation of being the most skillful hewer of timber in the settlement. Mr. Askins still resides in Allegan. Though in a measure retired from the active pursuits of his early years, his hand has not yet lost its cunning. In 1852, Mr. Littlejohn actively resumed the practice of law; was later elected circuit judge, with jurisdiction over a field embracing twenty counties, which position he filled for eleven years. Judge Littlejohn from time to time purchased much land in various portions of the county, which was afterwards disposed of as the demand for de sirable locations increased. On his arrival at Allegan but four acres of the village site had been cleared of trees, and even that tract was still well filled with stumps, the only streets being narrow roads in which teams could barely pass. Not a single settler had ventured to locate between Allegan and Grand Rapids, and not an acre had been cleared. Judge Littlejohn, after a short illness, died on the 14th day of May, 1880, in the seventy-seventh year of his age. James Dawson was another of the settlers of 1835 who followed the calling of a carpenter and joiner, in which he is yet actively employed. He built a comfortable home on the corner of Monroe and Walnut Streets, and still occu pies it. Justus W. Bond, another Rochester man, which city he left in 1835 for the forests of Allegan, was early engaged as a painter and glazier. He still pursues his calling in the village. E. Parkhurst, on his arrival the same year, became Mr. Ely's accountant, and acted in this capacity during the early flourishing period of Allegan's existence. He was His father and three brothers, John, Philo B., and Silas F. Littlejohn, followed him to Allegan. The last named"], [164, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 152 John R. Kellogg came from the State of New York in 1836, located in Allegan, and engaged in real-estate busi ness. He was subsequently engaged in lumbering and other business, being always ranked among Allegan's most enterprising citizens. With him came two sons, Andrew J. and John G. Kellogg, the former of whom now resides in Detroit and the latter in California. followed his occupation of carpenter, and erected, in 1837, a spacious and, for those early days, an elegant residence on the site now occupied by Col. Fisk's house. Silas F. Littlejohn did not long survive his coming to Michigan. John Littlejohn settled in Allegan in 1S44, and soon became actively interested in various business enterprises. A more extended biography of this gentleman is given in the latter part of this chapter. A son, Philetus 0. Little john, who had formerly been extensively engaged in con tracting at the East, left his home in Virginia in 1852, and located in Allegan. For many years he took an active interest in public enterprises, but has recently devoted his time principally to the care of his landed property in Pine Plains. N. B. West, who is still one of the most enterprising business men of the village, was also a pioneer of 1836. He at first followed his trade as a carpenter for two years. After an absence of three years he returned in 1841, and engaged in the business which he has ever since followed, \u2014 that of a manufacturer of doors, blinds, etc. When Mr. West came there was but one tavern in the place, \u2014 the Allegan House,\u2014 and so great was the rush of travel that he was unable to secure quarters there. He accordingly repaired to the Exchange Hotel, then being built by Wm. Boone, where he found a comfortable bed in one of the stalls of the barn. The Exchange was soon after completed, and was speedily filled with guests. Lyman W. Watkins, Zadoc Huggins, and Andrew Her mants all left Genesee Co., N. Y., early in 1836 for Chicago. On their way they were induced to turn aside to Allegan by the promise of lucrative employment upon the works then in progress there. At Marshall, Messrs. Huggins and Watkins purchased a canoe, and made their way down the river to Allegan without difficulty. The former gentleman soon after purchased a farm in Monterey. Mr. Watkins worked for a while in the mill at Allegan, but for several years followed the calling of a boatman on the Kalamazoo River. He afterwards opened a grocery-store, and with it the first meat-market in Allegan. Still later he established a drug-store, which he conducted until his retirement from active business. Dr. 0. D. Goodrich enjoys the distinction of being the first physician who ministered to the ills of the settlers of Allegan. He arrived there in 1836, having left Oneida Co., N. Y., two years before, and at once began the prac tice of his profession. His circuit extended many miles in every direction, a large part of his time being spent in battling with that scourge of Michigan, the fever and ague. He has since that time, with the exception of a few years spent in Connecticut, been in active practice in Allegan, though of late years he has sought relief from professional labor whenever practicable. Rev. W. C. H. Bliss, one of the earliest preachers of the gospel to the little colony, was a former resident of Roches ter, N. Y., from which place he emigrated in 1836. He was a cabinet-maker as well as a minister, and opened the first cabinet-shop in Allegan, on the site of the City Hotel. Many of the early religious services in the village were held by him, the scene of the first having been a carpenter-shop near the site of the Allegan House. Afterwards, for many years, he fulfilled the duties of a circuit-preacher, traveling many miles on foot in the performance of his sacred func tions. Though in his seventy-eighth year, he still officiates at funerals, and occasionally preaches other sermons. Duncan A. McMartin, the present president of the Pio neer Society, arrived in Allegan in 1836, a weary pedestrian, en route for Illinois. He was, however, so favorably im pressed with this region and the cordial welcome of the set tlers that he determined not to leave. He still resides in the village, and with his accomplished wife, whose advent in the county dates back to 1833, takes great interest in all that pertains to its early history. Among the most public-spirited of Allegan's citizens who came in 1836 was Henry H. Booth. He had pre viously been a resident of Weedsport, N. Y., and was at tracted to Allegan by the rumors of its rapid growth which had reached the East. Most of his household goods had been shipped the previous winter by schooner, and, having been stored in Detroit, had been destroyed by fire. On his arrival Mr. Booth found there was not much to do at his trade of cabinet-making, and accordingly engaged for a while in teaming, which he found quite profitable. Subsequently he was elected county clerk, which office he filled accept ably for several years. He afterwards officiated as county judge, and was for several years the agent of the Boston Company in the sale of their lands. In 1856 he built Pine Grove Seminary, a capacious structure, the use of which he gave, free of rent, to the various instructors who occupied it for educational purposes. The building was purchased, in 1865, by School District No. l,and is now occupied by the Union School of Allegan. Mr. Booth died in 1867, in Allegan, where his widow still retains her residence. Alva Fuller came from the State of New York in 1836, and began life in Allegan in the mercantile business with Col. Fisk. He remained in Allegan several years, and then returned to his native State, where he purchased a farm. He had, however, become thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the West, and soon migrated to Illinois, where he now resides. From Auburn, N. Y., the same year, came Alby Ross man, who at once went to work at his trade as a machinist. In connection with Hyman Hoxie, another of the pioneers of 1836, he established a furnace and machine-shop, which establishment was conducted by Mr. Rossman nearly thirty years. An anecdote told by that gentleman forcibly illus trates the extreme scarcity of money at that period. That gentleman made a contract for the purchase of 500 bushels of charcoal, the agreement being that it should be paid for in trade, with the exception of 25 cents in money, to enable the seller to obtain a letter from the post-office. At a later period Mr. Rossman purchased 100 acres of land, on which he erected a spacious brick residence, where he now resides. Milo Winslow was a son of the Green Mountains who"], [165, ""], [166, ""], [167, ""], [168, ""], [169, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 153 left his native State of Vermont for Allegan in 1836. He early built a store on the site of the Allegan City Bank, a spacious building for that day, which he filled with a general stock of goods. He established a good trade, and was chosen the first treasurer of the county ; but his career was suddenly terminated by a melancholy fate. He embarked on a schooner for Chicago, where he intended to purchase goods. The vessel was capsized by the wind, and Mr. Winslow was drowned. with Judge Littlejohn, and was afterwards an active prac titioner. He also attained some local distinction as the cashier of the Allegan wildcat bank. Mr. Clarke subse quently removed to Detroit, where he has for years enjoyed a reputation for distinguished ability in his profession. George Y. Warner, a New Englander by birth, arrived in 1836, and engaged in the practice of law. He held several official positions, among them those of probate judge, Circuit Court commissioner, and prosecuting attorney. He afterwards cleared a farm in Trowbridge and resided upon it many years, but has since removed from the State. William A. Knapp, another pioneer from Rochester, N. Y., was induced by Alexander L. Ely to cast his lot in Allegan in 1836. He found one saw-mill completed on his arrival and another in process of erection, the Allegan Company at this time having a large number of men in their employ. He was at once engaged to assist in the mill, where he remained two years. Mr. Knapp afterwards pur chased a farm, but has nevertheless resided much of the time in the village, having for a number of years served as a public officer. Richard Cook came from Rochester, N. Y., early that same year, and was employed in excavating the race. Afterwards he purchased a farm in Allegan township, where his sons, John and George, now reside. From Wayne County, N. Y., came Wells Field (also in 1836), who located in the village. Col. Fisk had returned to the East and mustered a band of thirteen recruits, anionsr whom were his brother, Oramel Fisk, and Mr. Field. The latter gentleman had engaged on his arrival to take charge of Col. Fisk's store, recently opened, which he did for one year, at the expiration of which he leased the Allegan House, and became its landlord for a year. In 1840 he removed to a farm he had purchased in the township of Watson, upon which he remained ten years. He then re turned to the village, where he has since resided. Alanson S. Weeks, who also arrived in 1836, was the second painter and glazier in the village, which trade he combined with that of a chair-maker. His sons, W. C. and H. C. Weeks, though residents of the village, are ex tensive breeders of blooded stock, and have, on their fine farm near by, the largest herd in the county. J. B. and Leonard Bailey left the excitements of New York City for the wilds of Michigan in 1836, the former having been employed by New York parties to superintend the erection of a saw-mill on the Kalamazoo, fourteen miles below Allegan. Leonard Bailey was a carpenter, and had immediate charge of the construction of the mill. He at first placed his- family in Allegan, but ere long moved it to the locality of his business, where they remained until 1840. They then returned to the village, aud have resided there ever since, Mr. Bailey being actively employed in business in Allegan. Leonard Bailey engaged in the milling business, and has also held various official positions, being also a resi dent of Allegan. William Finn, a native of Madison Co., N. Y., also east his lot with the Allegan pioneers in 1836. He arrived when the village plat was not yet cleared, and only a few log houses and slab shanties offered shelter to the meagre popu lation. After a short time Mr. Finn returned to the East for a stock of provisions, which he purchased for $2000 and sold for $6000, \u2014 wildcat money, \u2014 narrowly escaping the loss of his capital. He afterwards embarked in the dry-goods business, and in various milling enterprises. He is still a resident of Allegan. Among the other arrivals during this eventful year were E. A. Murray, J. D. Stone, S. Marsh, L. Loomis, J. Hig gins, W. Porter, John J. Jones (formerly postmaster), T. A. West, W. H. Brown, W. Allen, E. G. Bingham, G. McCoy, J. P. Austin, D. Emerson, L. Wilcox, E. W. R. Dickinson, Z. Booth, H. Hoxie, J. L. Shearer, D. B. Stout, H. Annis, A. Johannot, J. Billings, I. Bush, W. Pullen, Ellis C. Miner, Philander Chaffee, T. M. Russell, J. J. Miner, G. Jewett, and G. Nelson. Yet these were only a part, for, during the year 1836, more than five hundred people halted for a time at least at Allegan. Many of them, however, did not become permanent residents of the village, merely making it a temporary abode until another abiding^place could be provided in other portions of the county. Jason Torry was another of the early carpenters, who left the State of New York in 1836 and migrated to Allegan. He was at first engaged in a pail-factory, but subsequently followed his trade until his removal to another portion of the State. Hiram Bassett, of Rochester, N. Y., worked in one of the sawmills when he first came, and was otherwise employed by Mr. Ely. He remained in Allegan until his death, in 1876. Among those who came early in 1836 was a man named Greeley, who followed the occupation of well-digging and boarded at Leander S. Prouty 's. He died the same year, his death being the first in the settlement. In 1836 also came William Waycott from the suburbs of Detroit, where he had followed the joiners' craft. Soon after his arrival he met a tragic fate, which caused much gloom in the little settlement. While engaged in raising the frame of J. B. Bailey's house, one of the timbers fell and struck Mr. Waycott with a force which made the blow instantly fatal. This melancholy event was the first violent death which occurred in the village. Among the pioneers of 1837 was Daniel D. Davis, who made his adveut in July of that year, most of his family having preceded him. For a while he followed his occu pation as a carpenter and joiner in summer, employing the winter months in the manufacture of wagous and sleighs. He bought two lots on the north side of the river, upon which he at first erected a shanty, and, later, a comfortable residence. He finally removed to land he had previously purchased on section 5, Allegan township, and engaged for Hovcy K. Clarke acted for a brief time as agent for the Boston Company. He then engaged in the study of law 20"], [170, "154 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. several years in its improvement, but later years found him again a resident of the village which he chose as his early home. VILLAGE PLATS. Very soon after the organization of the Allegan Com pany a preliminary survey of two tiers of blocks was made by Oshea Wilder. This was, however, so inaccurate that in 1837 the company employed F. J. Littlejohn to make a second survey of the plat. Thus surveyed, maps were en graved, which were distributed among the various purchasers of lots. Since that time the following additions have been made to the original village plat : Allerds' survey, Russell's fraction, Streeter's addition, Higginbotham's addition, Rus sell's addition, Stein and Green's addition, Cummins' ad dition, Briggs' addition, Davis' addition, Green's addition, Lee's addition, Lowe's division map of section 27, Lowe's second division map of section 27, Streeter and Andrews' addition, Riley and Thompson's replat of part of Block B, Streeter's addition, Rossman's addition, Goodrich's addition. E. C. Southworth, having removed from Little Falls to Allegan, soon established a factory for the manufacture of pails. He was also a merchant, and for a brief time the landlord of the Allegan House. He afterwards purchased a farm, to which he removed, but ultimately departed for California, where he is now engaged in mining. Among others who came in 1837 were R. W. Brooksi J. D. Leggett, G. H. Hill, L. Ross, J. Davison, L. K. Pratt, J. M. Thomas, A. Parkinson, T. N. West, L. Wins low, Asa Morse, N. and C. Dickenson, G. Benson, N. Briggs, J. P. Nolan, C. Austin, J. Weare, Jr., B. Pratt, W. C. Rowe, J. Hudson, W. F. Brown, G. H. Hull, J. Robinson, H. Hutchins, George Ely, A. Goodrich, A. D. Dunning, J. Doty, John F: Ely, J. and L. Eager, M. Van Norman, D. C. Ailing, T. Sands, J. P. Austin, A. Edgar ton, E. Flannagan, J. H. Wells, J. Smith, G. Morton, and H. and J. Allett. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. The village of Allegan was incorporated in 1838, the first president being William C. Jenner, who was re-elected for several successive years. The village records of the first twenty years have been lost or destroyed, and no re liable information can be obtained regarding the village officers of an earlier date than 1858. During that year the village obtained a new charter and an election was held, of which the following record was made in the village book : James Henderson, a native of Scotland, came to Detroit in 1835, and three years later removed to Allegan, where he assisted in the construction of the first flouring-mill. Subsequently he became a farmer, to which occupation he devoted the remainder of his life. He was a man of culti vated tastes, and devoted much of his leisure to intellectual pursuits. He resided in Allegan at the time of his death, which occurred in 1875. His son, Donald Campbell Hen derson, who came to Allegan with his father in 1838, has since attained much distinction as a journalist, and is well known throughout the State as the sounder and editor-in chief of the Journal. A sketch of Mr. Henderson's paper will be found in Chapter XX. of the general history. \"At an election held at the Old Court-House, in the village of Allegan, in the County of Allegan and State of Michigan, on Mon day, the Sth day of March, A.

One result of his enterprise was the building of the first flouring-mill of any con siderable size in the county. Infirm health obliged him to retire from business during the last ten years of his life. He died during a visit to Omaha in January, 1868. His surviving sons are P. O. Lit tlejohn, Esq., of Allegan, and the Right Rev. A. N. Littlejohn, D.D., Bishop of Long Island. Col. Littlejohn was twice married : first to Miss Amy Dewey; she died some seven years after their mar riage; and in 1823 he was again married, \u2014 to Miss Eleanor Newkirk, of Montgomery Co., N. Y., where she was born Nov. 23, 1799. She is a lady of rare personal excellence and remarkable industry and thrift, a faithful, true, and patient wife, an affection ate mother, and a valuable friend. She is now in her eighty-first year, and still evinces much of her former vigor and energy. A glance at her portrait is only necessary to recognize the force of character which she possesses. Col. John Littlejohn was born in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., Oct. 10, 1790. He received an academical education, and before he attained his majority he acquired much reputation as an accom plished and successful teacher in the schools of his native county. On the breaking out of the war of 1812 he offered himself as a volunteer, and soon re ceived a commission as lieutenant. He was wounded at the famous battle of Lundy's Lane, and was commended for his bravery by Gen. Scott, the com manding officer. After the close of the war he en gaged very actively in business connected with the construction of the Erie Canal, successfully execu ting large contracts, and winning an enviable name for integrity and energy of character. To him belongs the credit of building the most difficult link in the first important railroad in this country, \u2014 the inclined plane between Albany and Schenectady. He also took a conspicuous part in building the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, also the James River and Kanawha Canal. About the year 1840 he re moved to Allegan ; and, investing considerable capi-"], [172, ""], [173, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 155 Wells Field; Treasurer, H. C. Smith; Assessors, P. 0. Lit tlejohn, David D.

Booth erected, in a beautiful pine grove on the hill in the western part of the village, a large building for a private school, which he named \" Pine Grove Seminary.\" He gave the use of the building to the teachers, and kept it in repair. This school was taught for several years by Mr. and Mrs. Herman Perry, and later by Rev. L. F. Waldo. In 1865, Judge Booth sold the building to the school district, and it is now occu pied as the principal edifice of the Union School. 1868. \u2014 President, Ira Chaffee; Recorder, Frank J.

The present Union School, established in 1867, is now graded on the plan adopted by the State Association of School Superintendents, the work in the higher grades being especially adapted to those preparing to teach in dis trict schools. In the high school there are three courses of study provided, \u2014 the English course, the Latin course, and the German course, \u2014 each extending over a period of three years. In the year 1879 three students graduated in the English and four in the Latin course. At the present time more than one-half of the pupils in the high school are studying some other language than English. The school is provided with a fair chemical and philosophical appa ratus, and is also the possessor of a mineralogical cabinet of over two hundred specimens, presented by the editors of the Allegan Journal. The cost of superintendence and in struction for each scholar is, in the primary grades, $7.22 ; in the grammar grades, $9.08; and in the high school grades, $22.85. The cost of incidentals for each scholar in all the grades is $2.58. The average total cost of education per scholar is $11.87 a year. 1872.\u2014 President, John W. Stone; Clerk, Martin T.

A school was taught in Allegan village as early as 1835, and a school district was organized the following year. The first school, as nearly as recollected, was held in a building just west of the site of the Peck Block, the teacher being Miss Hinsdale, of Kalamazoo County, who did good service as a pioneer instructress in various portions of the county. In the fall of 1836, Miss Eliza Littlejohn taught a private school, and afterwards kept the district school for several successive summers. Miss Mary Parkhurst also taught a private school about 1838. In 1839 and 1S40 the educa tion of the youth of the village was intrusted to Miss Lavia Bingham. Among the earliest male teachers were Messrs. Speucer Marsh, G. Y. Warner, E. Parkhurst, and H. Mungei*. 1. The Central School, a wooden building formerly used as a private seminary, contains four large rooms, a recita tion-room, and the superintendent's office. Three of the large rooms have, within the past two years, been furnished with new and improved seats. 2. The North Ward building is of brick, and contains two large rooms. 3. The South Ward building is also constructed of brick, aud contains two large rooms, both on the ground-floor. 4. The West Ward building is of the same material, and contains two rooms, both on the ground-floor. 5. A room in the Exchange building has been leased during the past two years, and is used for primary scholars. The list of superintendents since 1867 is as follows: 1867-68, Wm. H. Stone; 1868-71, Silas Wood, graduate of Normal School; 1871-74, Albert Jennings, .Ph.B., graduate of Michigan University; 1874-77, Daniel P. Simmons; 1877-80, Edmund D. Barry, B. A., graduate of Michigau University. The first district school building was erected in 1836, standing a short distance southeast of the site of J. B. Bailey's residence. It was 26 by 40 feet iu size, and had a cupola with a bell iu it, \u2014 a bell which still does good service in behalf of the village fire department."], [174, "156 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

During that year the engine company was disbanded on account of the success of the Holly Water-works, and Alert Hose Company No. 1 was organized, George Geppert having been chosen as foreman. The officers for the year 1874 were the following: Chief, A. J. Kellogg ; Assistant Chief, Clark Nichols ; Foreman of Hook-and-Ladder Company, J. F. Clapp ; Foreman of Hose Company, George Geppert. By an ordinance of the board of trustees, passed December 3d of that year, the office of second assistant chief was created, and James D. Follett chosen to fill the position. The officers for 1875 were as follows: Chief, George Geppert ; 1st Assistant Chief, J. F. Clapp ; 2d Assistant Chief, Henry Rosa ; Foreman Hook-and-Ladder Company, Alexander Hurd ; Foreman Hose Company, L. G. Cady. During the year A. J. Kellogg, the late chief, presented the department with a large and elegant flag as a memorial of his connection with the organization. Chief Geppert was rechosen for the following year (1876), with Clark Collins as first assistant, and J. C. Van Valkenburg as second assis tant. He resigned, however, during the year, when S. D. Pond was chosen in his place. The board of trustees is composed of H. H. Pope, Di rector ; Judge D. J. Arnold, Moderator ; Ira Chichester, Assessor; J. W. Chaddock, H. B. Peck, and Dr. Henry F. Thomas. THE FIKE DEPARTMENT. The first fire-apparatus in the village of Allegan of which we can learn was bought in 1863, when Ira Chaffee, then one of the village trustees, was authorized to purchase a hook-and-ladder apparatus at a cost of $75. The follow ing year a hand-engine, together with three hundred feet of hose, was secured by direction of the trustees at a cost of $900, R. S. Updyke having been deputized to make the purchase. An engine-house was constructed the same year, at a cost of $398. In May of this year Alert Hose Company was divided, and two companies of 15 men each were formed; John Holmes being made the foreman of Alert Hose Company, No. 1, and George Lonsbury foreman of Rescue Hose Com pany, No. 2. W. R. Webster was elected foreman of the hook-and-ladder company. The citizens of the village, in token of their appreciation of the efficiency of the depart ment, presented it during the year with a handsome silver trumpet. In 1869 a conflagration occurred which destroyed the block of stores where the Chaffee House now stands, and other property, and it was felt that the efforts of the fire men were much impeded by the lack of co-operation between the companies. The village authorities determined to have a more thorough organization of the fire department, and a chief engineer was accordingly appointed ; A. Rossman being selected for that position. In 1870 the department was reorganized with the following officers : The list of officers for 1878 embraced the following: Chief, Samuel D. Pond ; 1st Assistant Chief, J. C. Van Valkenburg ; 2d Assistant, Jerry Crittenden ; Foreman of Hook-and-Ladder Company, W. R. Webster; Foreman of Alert Hose Company, John Holmes ; Foreman of Rescue Hose Company, A. Messenger. * President of Department, William Pollard ; Chief En gineer, A. Rossman ; Foreman of Engine Company, James Ganson ; Foreman of Hose Company, Edwin Wheelock ; Foreman of Hook-and Ladder Company, 0. T. Booth. The latter gentleman was the same year succeeded by A. E. Calkins. In 1871 other changes were made, and the fol lowing gentlemen filled the respective offices mentioned below : Chief of Department, Andrew J. Kellogg ; Assist ant Chief, D. D. Davis; Foreman of Engine Company, A. J. McCarthy ; Foreman of Hook-and-Ladder Compauy, A. E. Calkins. The present officers are as follows : Chief of Department, J. C. Van Valkenburg; 1st Assistant Chief of Department, Jerry Crittenden ; 2d Assistant Chief of Department, Clark Collins; Foreman Alert Hose Company, John Holmes; Foreman Rescue Hose Company, A. Messenger. HOLLY WATER-WORKS. In the fall of the year 1870 the question of adopting the Holly system of water-works in Allegan was very gen erally discussed by the taxpayers and voters of that village. Negotiations were opened by the village officers with Mr. Holly, and that gentleman submitted a proposition to fur nish the requisite machinery for such works, to be propelled by water-power, to the officers above mentioned. At the annual election of village officers in March, 1871, the whole question was duly submitted to the electors, with a further proposition to borrow $25,000 on time bonds (at not over ten per cent, interest), to be expended in purchasing the necessary machinery and putting it in operation. Three hundred and fifty-five votes were cast, of which 225 were for and the remainder against the measure. During the year the hook-and-ladder and hose companies were each presented with an elegant trumpet by Andrew J. Kellogg. The officers elected for 1872 were as follows: Chief of Department, A. J. Kellogg; Assistant Chief, A. E. Cal kins; President, W. J. Pollard; Foreman of Hook-and- Ladder Company, J. F. Clapp ; Foreman of Engine Com pany, A. J. McCarthy. In December, Assistant Chief Calkins died, being buried on the 18th of that month, when the department turned out in full ranks in honor of his memory. The following year the chief of department remained the same, with Clark Nichols as assistant and Joseph Killian as foreman of the hook-aud-ladder company. Bonds were at first issued for $12,500, payable in five equal annual payments, and were negotiated at ten per cent."], [175, "MRS. JOSEPH FISK. COL. JOSEPH FISK. COL. JOSEPH FISK. the Iowa State line ; also the branch to Kansas City, a distance of two hundred and fifty miles. In 1867 he built the road from Kalamazoo to Grand Rapids, a distance of fifty-seven miles. In 1868 he built the road from Allegan to Muskegon, and in 1871 the Allegan branch of the Grand Eapids and Indiana Railroad ; this road, twelve miles in length, he con structed in ninety days. The last contract of any note was for the building of the Lansing division of the Lake-Shore and Michigan Southern. The aggregate number of miles built exceeds one thousand. In all these enterprises, involving large expenditures and heavy responsibilities, and frequently attended with great risk, he has been eminently successful. Honesty and a firm desire to succeed have been the essential media of his success. In all his transactions he has evinced excellent judgment, and sterling honesty has been the basis of all his operations. This is high testimony, but it is only the reflex of the prominent traits of Col. risk's character, and what to the strange reader may seem to be the language of eulogy will be readily recognized by all who know him as a mere plain, uncolored statement of the salient points in his character and the features in his career. He has figured quite conspicuously in State and county politics ; was the first register of Allegan County, and subse quently was elected sheriff; for many years held the office of magistrate for Allegan township. But political life to him was devoid of charms ; he had no desire for political prefer ment, and when he accepted a nomination it was more from a desire to advance the interests of Allegan than for his own aggrandizement. Col. risk never enjoyed the advantages of a finished educa tion ; but, being endowed with a large amount of common sense, industry, perseverance, and ambition, he has succeeded in building a reputation as widespread as it is enviable. In deed, it may be truly said of him that his entire career is one worthy the emulation of the young, and a fitting example for all sorts and conditions of business men to follow. Col. Pisk's biography would not be complete without special mention of his estimable wife, who shared the privations of the early days, and whose portrait, so full of character, may be seen on this page. She is a woman of rare personal excel lence, a faithful, true, and patient wife, a careful and affec tionate mother, of pleasant manners, and beloved and respected by all who know her. She is one of the original members of the First Baptist Church of Allegan, and closely identified with its various religious aDd charitable enterprises. She has been the mother of sfx children, three of whom are living,\u2014 Julia A., now Mrs. James A. Lee ; Charles W., now residing in Texas ; and George D., connected with the Grand Haven Railroad. Among the truly representative men of Allegan County, few if any have been more intimately associated with its material development than Col. Joseph Fisk, the well-known contractor and builder, who has witnessed the transition of a small hamlet into one of the important towns in this part of the State, of a thin settlement into a busy and prosperous community, of a semi-wilderness into a fertile and highly productive region, and in his own person has typified so admira bly the agencies which wrought many of these changes, that no history of Allegan would be complete without some sketch of his life, labors, and character. Col. Fisk was born in Charlemont, Franklin Co., Mass., May 22, 1810. About 1816 the family removed to New York State, near the Massa chusetts line, and from there to Macedon, N. Y. About 1826 they again moved, locating at Williamson, Wayne Co., N. Y., where Joseph became acquainted with Miss Betsey Davis, whom he married in January, 1832. His early life, like that of most of our successful business men, was one of close applica tion, self-reliance, and self-denial. He acquired the trade of a carpenter and joiner, and obtained a liberal common-school education. In 1834 he emigrated to Michigan with his family, and settled in Marengo, Calhoun Co., where he remained until March 7, 1835, when he came to Allegan and purchased the first lot after the village was laid out and lots offered for sale. The colonel entered into the development of the little hamlet with the same energy and enterprise that has characterized his subsequent operations. Soon after his arrival he con tracted for the erection of ten or twelve dwellings for the Boston company ; he employed a large force of men, and for many years was engaged in the erection of buildings. In 1852 he took the contract for the construction of the Chicago break water, which he executed successfully, and which still stands as a monument to his mechanical skill, and which gave him a prominent position among the large and successful con tractors of the West. His career as a railroad contractor dates back to 1853, at which time he took a contract for build ing the Eel River road in Indiana, of about one hundred miles in length. In 1854 and 1855 he was connected with the construction of the Dubuque and Pacific in Iowa ; he also built a pile bridge across the bay at Milwaukee, Wis., a double track a mile and a quarter in distance ; also a structure of about the same length across Mud Lake on the Watertown road. From 1857 to 1863 he was engaged in Missouri ; he built the southwest branch of the St. Louis and Pacific, and was also engaged on the main line, and constructed twenty five miles on the Iron Mountain road. Immediately after the close of the war he was associated with Messrs. Champlin & Smith in the construction of the North Missouri road to"], [176, ""], [177, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 157 interest. The works were started with double turbine-wheels and attachments, and ten-inch mains up to the business centre of the village ; then, as the mains were extended in different directions from that centre, they were reduced to eight inches, and finally to six inches, in diameter. At the expiration of a year a vote was carried to raise $15,000 more by the same means, to be used in extending the mains, and in December, 1873, about $4500 more was voted for the same purpose. All the bonds so issued were arranged so that $2500 would become due on the 1st of September of each year. Thus far the payments have been promptly made. Chapin. The former filled the office of judge of probate for a term. After them came Robert Goble, who settled in Allegan, and was elected prosecuting attorney. Follow ing him was Gilbert Moyers. In the winter of 1855, William B. Williams settled in Allegan and entered upon the practice of his profession, subsequently filling the position of circuit judge. In the spring of the same year, Elisha B. Bassett, who had previously been judge of probate, and Hon. F. J. Littlejohn formed a copartnership in business, which was dissolved by the election of the latter to the circuit bench in the spring of 1858. In the year 1857, Joseph Thew entered upon practice at Allegan. The works have proved eminently successful. Double hydrants were early placed at suitable points along the lines of water-pipes. The hook-and-ladder and hose companies are well equipped and under constant drill, and all fires have been promptly and effectually checked. Between the years 1858 and 1866 quite a large number of gentlemen became members of the bar of Allegan vil lage, as follows : George H. House, Dan J. Arnold (present circuit judge) ; Hannibal Hart, John W. Stone, John N. York, James F. Stuck, first at Otsego and then at Allegan ; Henry C. Briggs and Benjamin D. Pritchard, both of Allegan ; Francis H. Ward, Lawrence L. Crosby, Alfred C. Wallin, H. N. Averill, Patroclus A. Latta, John P. Hoyt, J. Bird Humphrey, present judge of probate, and Philip Padgham, formerly prosecuting attorney ; Frank Bracelin,now of Muskegon ; Edwin B. Grover, not now in practice ; Albert H. Fenn, late prosecuting attorney; E. D. Steele and Daniel Earle. Along the line of pipes, water is furnished to all who desire at low rates, the tank at one of the railroad depots being thus supplied. The receipts about meet the current running expenses, including superintendence and repairs. The first supply-well proving inefficient, a second one, 40 rods distant, was sunk, and is now in use. Its diameter is 20 feet, with a depth of water of 12 feet. This is inclosed in a substantial circular building of stone. The works are sufficiently powerful to throw from a double hydrant, situ ated on an elevation 100 feet above the machinery and over half a mile away, two three-quarter inch streams 70 feet higher than the hydrant. Between 1870 and 1878 the following names were added to the numbers, as near as is possible to ascertain, to wit : B. F. Travis, R. B. Cowles, Mark D. Wilbur, William W. Warner, John H. Padgham, Lyman H. Babbitt, Frank S. Donaldson, of Allegan ; Edward J. Anderson, J. Lee Potts, Hiram B. Hudson. John E. Babbitt. Several whose names appear on the roll of attorneys have practiced but a brief time at the Allegan bar. THE BAR OF ALLEGAN. To make up a methodical and trustworthy record of the commencement, outgrowth, and entire membership of the bar of Allegan village requires patient research, and, in the absence of all reliable data, a heavy tax upon the memory of its older members. Of those who have devoted themselves to professional business, quite a number have filled various positions of public trust with credit to themselves and their profession. Many of them are yet young in years, and give promise of extended usefulness in the future. There has always ex isted an unusual degree of amity and goodfellowship among the members of the Allegan bar. In matters of practice they have ever evinced great courtesy and liberality towards each other, and a deference towards the court which is in striking contrast with what is occasionally exhibited else where. George Y. Warner and F. J. Littlejohn were the first resident lawyers of Allegan County ; the former reach ing Allegan in the early spring, and the latter on the last of June, 1836. In the succeeding year Hovey K. Clarke was added to the number. In that year the first regular term of the Circuit Court was held in the school-house near the base of the western hill. At that period, and for a decade thereafter, the business in the Allegan courts was largely conducted by attorneys from Calhoun and Kalamazoo Counties ; chief among these were Gordon and Bradley from the former, and Stuart, Balch, Miller, and Mower from the latter, county. As advocates, quite a number rank high in public esti mation, while as jurists, learned in the law, their arguments have frequently commanded the marked attention of the highest courts of judicature. Although serving for a while as prosecuting attorney, the attention of Judge Littlejohn was chiefly directed to other pursuits. He later filled various official positions, and obtained a distinguished place upon the bench and at the bar of Allegan County. For the above facts, the historian is indebted chiefly to Hon. F. J. Littlejohn. A list of all the lawyers who have either practiced or been admitted to the bar in Allegan county is given in Chapter XV. of the general history. The present members of the Allegan village bar are as follows : Flavius J. Littlejohu, William B. Williams, Joseph Thew, Benjamin D. Pritchard, J. B. Humphrey, Albert H. Fenn, Horace H. Pope, Hannibal Hart, Philip Padgham, William W. Warner, J. H. Padgham, Patroclus A. Latta, Frank S. Donaldson, Hiram B. Hudson, John E. Babbitt, Frank B. Lay, C. Y. Bennettare, D. H. Pope. Mr. Warner was judge of probate for one term, and his practice at the bar was also interrupted by other avocations. The attention of Hovey K. Clarke was also for a brief space attracted by other objects, he having been chosen to the cashiership of the wildcat Allegan bank. He is now a very able lawyer at Detroit. Next in order came De Witt C. Chapin and Theodore"], [178, "158 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY OF ALLEGAN. profession at Huron, Huron Co., Ohio, which at that time was a new country. Here he remained two years, during which time he aided in the organization of the first church, and was one of the ten original members. In March, 1836, at the earnest solicitation of the Hon. Elisha Ely, one of the pioneers of Allegan, he decided to remove there, which he did in May of that year. Shortly after his arrival his wife and child were taken sick, and this, in addition to other hardships and privations, rendered his first experience in the county bitter indeed. There was but one house within ten miles of Allegan. North and south of the village was an unbroken wilderness, and west not a dwell- ing until the shores of Lake Michigan were reached. Pio- neer life and its attendant privations, in connection with his arduous duties as a physician, made sad inroads upon his health, and in September, 1845, he was obliged to relinquish his practice and make an effort to recover his health. He went to Berlin, Hartford Co., Conn., residing there and at New Haven until September, 1855. Eight years of this time were spent in the employ of the New York and New Haven Railroad Company. During his resi- dence in the East he investigated the principles of hom\u0153- opathy, and adopted its practice, and upon his return to Allegan he again established himself in his profession, and became the first hom\u0153opathic physician in the county. May 15, 1832, he married Miss Emeline Dickinson, of Berlin, Hartford Co., Conn. She was an estimable woman in all respects, and highly esteemed by all who knew her. She died Sept. 30, 1872, leaving two sons and one daughter. In 1873 the doctor was married to Jane E. Shepard, real izing again the fulfillment of those words of Holy Writ, The medical profession was represented in Allegan very soon after the settlement of the hamlet, the various mala rial fevers incident to the opening of a new country having made the presence of the physician indispensable. The subjoined sketch gives a brief record of the various mem bers of the profession who have practiced in the village since 1836. Dr. R. M. Bigelow was the first physician to locate in Allegan. He began the practice of medicine there in the year just mentioned, but after a residence of nearly four years removed to Otsego, where he entered into partnership with Dr. L. B. Coats. In 1847, Dr. Bigelow joined one of the first trains that went to California, and resided on the Pacific coast until his death, the date of which is not known. Just previous to the removal of Dr. Bigelow from Allegan, Dr. Sawtell opened an office there. He re mained but a year or two, however, after which he also set out for the land of gold. His subsequent history is un known. OSMAN DEWEY GOODRICH, M.D This gentleman, the pioneer physician of Allegan, and whose name is prominently associated with the history of the medical profession, was born May 10, 1808, in New Hartford, Oneida Co., N. Y. His parents, Leonard and \" Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favor of the Lord.\" She departed this life April 24, 1879. The pioneer life of Dr. Goodrich was one of hardship and privation. In the practice of his profession he was fre quently obliged to ford streams, following an Indian trail to the rude home of the early settler who was so unfortu nate as to require his professional services. He has not only witnessed the transition of a wilderness into a highly prosperous agricultural section, of a hamlet into a busy aud enterprising village, but in his own person has typified many of the agencies that have wrought these changes. He has made an enviable reputation as a citizen. He pos- sesses the necessary qualifications of the physician other than knowledge, \u2014 geniality of disposition blended with firmness, kindness, and compassion. He will long be re membered for his genial faith iu the Christian religion, carrying its precepts and teachings into his every-day life. He is now the only pioneer physician remaining in Allegan County. I>R. 0. D. GOODRICH Susannah Goodrich, were among the pioneers of that county, having' emigrated there in 1800. The elder Good rich was a fanner, and reared a family of five children, three sons and two daughters, \u2014 Osn-an D. being the fourth. He remained upon the farm until he attained his seven teenth year, after which time some three years were spent in efforts to regain lost health. He commenced the study of medicine under the tuition of Dr. Uriel H. Kello\"\" of New Hartford, and in 1834 graduated at the Berkshire Medical Institute, at Pittsfield, Mass. In July followin\" his graduation he established himself in the practice of his In the year 1846, Dr. Goodell settled in Allegan. He remained but a short time, and then moved to Ohio. Dr. H. S. Lay may also be counted one of the pioneer physicians, as he came to Allegan in 1849. He was born in Niagara Co., N. Y., in the year 1828, and at the age of twenty-two years commenced practice in Allegan ; with the exception of two years' residence in Dansville, N. Y., and four years in Battle Creek, Mich., that place has since been his home. While in Battle Creek the doctor was physi-"], [179, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 159 the class of 1863.

The doctor re entered college in the winter of 1877, and graduated from the Detroit Medical College with the class of that year. Dr. W. H. Bills was born in Wyoming Co., N. Y., March 24, 1846, and came to Allegan during the fall of 1872. He obtained his literary education at the Middle bury Academy, in the State of New York, and commenced the study of medicine in 1865, graduating from the Buf falo Medical College Feb. 22, 1870. He began the prac tice of medicine in Pentwater, Mich., the same year, resid ing there two years. He then removed to Allegan, where he has since remained. Dr. Elliott commenced the practice of medicine in Allegan in 1855. He remained until the spring of 1861, when he entered the army as a surgeon. At the close of the war he removed to Titusville, Pa., and from there to Buffalo, N. Y., where he still resides. Dr. Lovejoy came to Allegan in 1857, but after a residence there of about three years he removed from the county. Dr. J. K. Wilson, a graduate of the University of New York, came to Allegan in 1858. He practiced medicine there until 1877, when he also left the county. Dr. F. M. Calkins, son of Dr. A. R. Calkins, was born at Allegan, Mich., on the 19th of September, 1852. He began the study of medicine with Drs. Calkins and Ams den in 1871, and graduated from the Long Island Col lege Hospital, at Brooklyn, N. Y., on the 25th of June, 1874. In 1878 he entered into partnership with Dr. W. H. Bills,* which business connection still exists. Dr. J. J. McConkie, a graduate of Columbus College, Ohio, came to Allegan in 1867, where he soon established a large and lucrative practice. Failing in health, the doctor concluded to go farther north, and in 1879 he purchased a large tract of land in Grand Traverse County, in this State, whither he at once removed. Dr. James A. Mabbs was born Oct. 29, 1851, at Ran som, Hillsdale Co., Mich. He commenced the study of medicine in 1871 with Dr. J. J. McConkie, and graduated from the Chicago Medical College in 1875. He imme diately returned to Allegan and entered into partnership with his former preceptor. In 1878 the doctor removed from Allegan, and at present is practicing at Fillmore, in the same county. Dr. Edwin Amsden, a son of Dr. Elihu Amsden, came to Allegan in May, 1868. He was born in Gainesville, N. Y., in December, 1827, and studied at Buffalo, N. Y., under Professor Austin Flint, now one of the most eminent phy sicians of New York City, graduating from the Buffalo Medical College in 1853. He served three years in the war for the Union as surgeon of the One Hundred and Thirty-Sixth Regiment New York Volunteers. Soon after coming to Michigan, Dr. Amsden entered into partnership with Dr. A. R. Calkins, which association continued until just previous to Dr. Calkins' death. Dr. F. R. Hynes, a hom\u0153opathic physician, came to Allegan in 1877, and engaged in practice, in which he still continues. Dr. Charles Russell was born in Byron, Ogle Co., 111., in September, 1843. He began the study of medicine with his father, Dr. J. M. Russell, of Hastings, Mich., in 1863, and graduated from the medical department of the Uni versity of Michigan in 1866. Immediately after receiving the degree of doctor of medicine he associated himself with his father in practice at Hastings. In 1879 he removed to Allegan, where he is now in practice. Henry F. Thomas, M.D., was born on the 17th of De cember, 1843, in the township of Tompkins, Jackson Co., Mich. He entered Albion College in 1859, and remained two years. In 1862 he enlisted in the Seventh Michigan Cavalry as first sergeant of Company D, and in 1S64 re ceived a lieutenant's commission. He participated in all the numerous battles and raids of that regiment, related in Chapter XXXI. of general history, including its arduous service in the Far West after the close of the war. Dr. Thomas graduated from the medical department of the University of Michigan in 1868. He began the practice of his profession in the spring of 1868, at Constantine, St. Joseph Co., Mich. From there he removed to Allegan in June, 1869, and has remained there to the present time. Dr. Thomas was a member of the House of Representa tives of Michigan in 1873, and of the State Senate in 1875. In the spring of 1879 he was also elected president of the village of Allegan. The present resident physicians of Allegan are H. S. Lay, M.D., E. Amsden, M.D., H. F. Thomas, M.D., W. H. Bills, M.D., F. M. Calkins, M.D, and Charles Russell, M.D., of the regular school ; 0. D.

Y., May 19, 1822, and died in Allegan, Mich., March 17, 1873. In 1833 he removed with his father to Bichland, Kalamazoo Co., Mich. At this place his father died iu 1S37. He then entered the family of his older brother, Chauncey W. Calkins, and continued his literary studies. At the age of nineteen he began the study of medicine in the office of Drs. Coats & Biglow, of Otsego, Mich., and graduated from the Geneva Medical College, N. Y., in 1845. Soon after, he opened an office in Allegan, where he was married, in November of that year, to Miss Lucy Maria Winslow, who was the mother of his two sons, the younger Dr. 0. E. Goodrich, son of Dr. 0. D. Goodrich, was born in Allegan, June 22, 1844. He graduated at the Hahne mann Medical College, at Chicago, in 1866, and practiced medicine at Allegan until 1878, when he retired from the profession. Dr. A. B.

Calkins, follows his father's profes sion in the same place. For nearly thirty years Dr. Calkins practiced medicine in Allegan, often fording streams and following an Indian trail through the forest to the rude home of the pioneer. Ambitious to succeed in his pro fession, full of energy and vigor, daunted by no difficulty, deterred by no obstacle, he became skillful both as a phy sician and surgeon. by good roads, and the log dwellings replaced by attractive farm-houses. Full of generous impulses, courteous, genial, and social, he was prized while here and mourned when gone. Active and busy to the last, his life was another sacrifice to the profession which, when once adopted, leaves a man no longer his own master. An affectionate husband, a watch ful, indulgent, and loving parent, an obliging friend, and an upright citizen, it is well to cherish his memory. Sympathetic and kindly in his nature, he was ever a welcome visitor at the bedside of suffering humanity. He displayed an active interest in every work that promised, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. This body was organized April 23, 1836, a meeting of those interested having been held at the house of William C. Jenner. Its first members were Alexander L. Ely, Julia S. Austin, John Littlejohn, William C. Jenner and wife, Sarah Jenner, Thomas C. Jenner, William B. Jenner, and Silas F. Littlejohn. The following day Mary A. N. Ely was received upon profession, and Milo Winslow, George Y. Warner, Mrs. Hannah \"Winslow, and Mrs. Mary Ann Littlejohn by letter, making in all fourteen members. From that date to the present time more than 500 persons have been enrolled as members ; many of them have died or been dismissed, but the present membership numbers more than 160. The little band of worshipers of 1836 met for a while at the residence of William C. Jenner, where the Rev. William Jones officiated as minister, but soon afterward the Allegan Company erected for their use a small edifice, which was donated to the society. It had been occupied, how ever, only two or three Sabbaths when it was destroyed by fire, caused by the clearing of land now embraced in the village. The society then assembled on Sabbath in a car penter- and joiner-shop, later in a chamber of Mr. Jen ner's house, and finally in a school-house, which also did duty as a court-house. Silas F. Littlejohn also opened his house for worship during one wiuter. ABRAM R. CALKINS, M.D. in his opinion, the elevation and welfare of mankind, and was helpful in every society of which he became a member. To the church he gave his presence, his counsel, and his means. In the school board he labored for the physical and moral as well as the intellectual advancement of the young. To the society of Freemasons he was a valued acquisition. In politics he was a Republican, positive and firm in his opinious. The church then determined to erect a house of worship of its own, and it did so in 1842, at a cost of $850, under the ministry of Rev. Samuel Newberry. The building was repaired and renovated in 1853, and was enlarged under the pastorate of Rev. John Sailor. On the night of Sept. 18, 1874, the edifice was totally destroyed by fire. The church was not disheartened, and the members at once de voted themselves to the work of erecting a new edifice. A little more than one year from the destruction of the old building the congregation occupied a much more spacious and imposing structure, which had been built at a cost of $10,000, and which was free of incumbrance, except a trifling indebtedness, which was soon after liquidated. He entered the army in 1862, and was appointed surgeon of the Seventeenth Michigan Infantry; participated in the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. He served in the army for a year, when the severe sickness of his wife induced him to resign his position. She died before his return. At the time of his death he was a member of the County and State Medical Societies, and also of the Amer ican Medical Society, having been sent by the State Society as a delegate to that body at its meeting in Philadelphia in 1872. Dr. Calkins was thrice married, the second time in June, 1855, to Miss Helen G. Bingham, and again in April, 1863, to Mrs. Lottie S. Smith, who survives him. From the small beginning seen in 1836 the church has not only become self-supporting, but has been active in the cause of charity, and given liberally of its substance to both foreign and domestic missions. The following is a list of the pastors from the organiza tion of the church to the present time: Revs. William Jones, 1836-37; Augustus Littlejohn, five weeks; George W. Elliott, three months ; Luke Lyons, 1837-39 ; Hervey Hyde, 1840-41; Samuel Newberry, 1842-45; E. F. Waldo, 1846-48; William Page, 1849-50; Charles M.

It appears that the members of the society resident in Allegan were formerly connected with the Plainfield Church, a commu nication having been sent by the Allegan Baptists to that organization on the 26th of December, 1840, to be consti tuted a branch of that church. In January, 1841, the names of the following persons were enrolled as members of a branch of the Plainfield Church : Joseph Fisk, A. Ross, John R. Kellogg, Noah Briggs, J. Ross, Hannah Davis, E. Colburn, Wm. Finn, Betsey Fisk, Daniel Leggett, Jona than Peabody, H. Munger (pastor), H. Ross, John G. Colburn, Rhoda Munger, H. Fisk, Mary Ann Stone, S. Briggs, Aurelia Fuller, Chester Wetmore, John Griffith, Frederick Day, Amanda Griffith, Nancy Ross, Leonard Ross, Fanny Day, Mary Jane Kenyon, Lemuel Wilcox, Samuel Wilcox, Ph\u0153be Ross, Levi Wilcox. The society, however, soon effected a separate legal organization, aud Rev. H. Munger was settled as the first pastor, Joseph Fisk being selected as church clerk. Noah Briggs and John G. Colburn were appointed deacons, and the following were elected as a board of trustees : Chester Wetmore, Wm. Finn, Lyman Fisk, one year; Daniel D. Davis, Elias Streeter, Alvah Fuller, two years; T. M. Russell, Noah Briggs, Joseph Fisk, three years. The present elders are D. A. McMartin, John 0. Nor throp, Henry Cook, Henry Dunning, W. B. Jenner, George Knapp, L. G. Stedman. The trustees are Ira Chichester, H. H. Pope, H. B. Peck, John S. Bidwell, H. P. Dun ning, Henry Rosa, John Stegeman. THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. This church was organized by the Rev. Mr. Williams, of the North Ohio Conference, in the spring of 1836, the Methodists being then under the supervision of the Con ference just named. The original class consisted of seven members, namely : Mrs. Weighty Wilson, Enoch Baker and wife, Miss Clarissa Wilson, Miss Streeter, and Mr. Torrey, all of whom are dead with the exception of Mrs. Baker. Enoch Baker was chosen as the first class-leader. Among those who very early united with the church were Spencer Marsh, who died in 1877, Rev. William C. H. Bliss and wife, who came from Rochester, N. Y., in the spring of 1837, aud Rev. William Brown, who has been an active local preacher for more than forty years. The first board of trustees was organized and the society legally incorporated in the fall of 1837. The little con gregation first assembled in a school-house which stood near the present grocery-store of Mr. C. W. Hall, on Hubbard Street. The first church edifice was erected in 1839, on the site of the present one, which was completed in 1853. This latter building was enlarged in 1866, during the pas torate of Rev. E. Marble. From that time on the church pursued the even tenor of its way without any very remarkable incidents, but with steadily increasing prosperity. A house of worship was erected, and the church greatly increased and grew in numbers. In September, 1877, Mrs. Hannah J. Davis, widow of David Doane Davis, died and bequeathed her estate, valued at more than $60,000, to the First Baptist Church, of which she was a member, and for charitable purposes. Included in this bequest was a spacious and completely furnished residence, which is generally used as a parsonage, though the church is now without a pastor. The officiating board of trustees is as follows : Joseph Fisk, Ralph Pratt, F. S. Day, C. W. Calkins, G. M. Smith, F. H. May, Charles E. Pratt, John H. Colburn, George E. McCarthy. F. H. May, Clerk; C. W. Calkins, Treasurer. The following are the pastors who officiated prior to 1856, with the exception of a few which it was not possi ble to obtain : Revs. Williams, Todd, F. Gage, Erchen brach, D. Bash, Edward L. Kellogg, C. Mosher, Parker, William C. H. Bliss, A. J. Eldred, F. Glass, J. H. Peit zel, and S. A. Osborn. Since that date the following is a complete list of the ministers in the order of their suc cession : Revs. D. Bush, 1856; S. A. Dunton, 1858; D. R. Latham, 1860; A. Y. Graham, 1861; N. S. Otis, 1862; James Billings, 1864; E. Marble, 1865; H. C. Peck, 1867; II. P. Henderson, 1868; George W. Sher man, 1870; James Hamilton, 1872; R. C. Crawford, 1874 ; L. M. Edwards, 1876 ; and the present pastor, Rev. W. A. Hunsberger, 1879.* The society is in a very flour ishing condition. Besides the church property on the cor ner of Trowbridge and Walnut Streets, it owns an excellent parsonage on the corner of Trowbridge and Pine Streets. Connected with the charge in Allegan is a Sunday after- PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH. The first service was held in Allegan by Rev. W. N. Leyster in 1842. The next service was not held until ten years later, and was conducted by Bishop Littlejohn, now of New York. In 1858 a series of services on week-day evenings was inaugurated by Rev. L. N. Freeman, of Kalamazoo, and sufficient interest was manifested to war rant their continuance for a period of more than a year. Durin\" this time 17 persons were baptized and 11 con firmed. Rev. J. Bice Taylor removed to Allegan in Octo ber, 1859, as the first settled rector, and remained nearly four years, the services at that time having been held at the court-house. The parish was organized as the Church of the Good Shepherd, and admitted iuto union at the Di ocesan Convention in 1860. The society began the erection of the present church in 1867, and first occupied it on Palm Sunday, March 21, 1869. Rev. Henderson Judd, who had been installed as rector the year previous, remained six years. He instilled a spirit of labor into the hearts of his parishioners, and under his ministry the church rapidly in- noon appointment at Mill Grove, where there is a prosper ous church of 54 members, making a total of 198 members connected with this pastorate. There is a church edifice at Mill Grove belonging to the society, erected maiuly through the liberality of Mr. Alonzo Vosburgh, worth about $1400. The church is entirely free from debt.

He was succeeded by Rev. Walter Scott, who began his labors May 8, 1875, and is still the rector. The church roll embraces 80 communicants, and the parish generally is in a healthy condition, with large prospects of usefulness. A flourishing Sabbath-school is also connected with the society. The officers are as follows : William B. Williams and D. J. Arnold, Wardens; Augustus Lilly, Almeron E. Calkins, and P. Padgham, Vestrymen ; George R. Stone, Treasurer; Joseph M. Killiam, Secretary. which was dedicated Jan. 7, 1865. Ten years afterwards a comfortable parsonage was added to the church property. The present membership is 158, the pastor being Rev. John Sailor. SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH* The Seventh-Day Adventist Church of Allegan was duly organized on the 7th of December, 1861. In 1863 it completed the plain but neat house of worship which is located on Cutler Street. This building is capable of seating about 300 persons. When the church was or ganized it numbered but nine souls. As this embraced individuals in moderate .circumstances, it was only by dint of much sacrifice and strenuous effort that they were en abled to complete and pay for their house of worship, which was dedicated in the summer of 1864. Elder J. N. An drews (now missionary to Switzerland) conducted the ser vices. At a meeting held Dec. 7, 1861, Horatio S. Lay was elected elder, and James M. Foster clerk. About one year later, or on Nov. 12, 1862, the elder elect was duly ordained by the laying on of hands and prayer, Elder James White, of Battle Creek, Mich., and Elder Moses Hull, of the same place, officiating. GERMAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. A mission in connection with the German Blethodist Episcopal Church was established in Allegan County as early as 1856. In that year Rev. G. Berthrams, of Lan sing, visited the German population of the county and expounded the Scriptures to them in their native tongue. He was succeeded by Rev. H. Krill, and he by Rev. Jacob Krebill, who, however, confined their labors principally to Salem and Monterey, where societies connected with this church were organized. In the year 1864, Rev. V. Jahrens was installed as pastor of the little flock in Allegan, and organized a church with only five members, namely: Daniel Ellinger and wife, Frederick Ruute and wife, and Maria Ellinger. These labored earnestly, however, among their friends, and they soon enjoyed the satisfaction of witnessing a slow but healthy growth. The same year ground was purchased for a church edifice, which was built the next year, being dedicated on the 1st of December, 1865. A parsonage was also secured for the pastor. The congrega tion was ere long placed in charge of Rev. Henry Maertz, who also had the superintendence of the societies at Salem, Monterey, and Hopkins. The membership of the German Methodist Church in Allegan County now numbers 160, over whom Rev. C. A. Militzer is the pastor, with his residence in Allegan. The various societies are in a very flourishing condition, and subscribe liberally for benevolent purposes. There is also a successful Sabbath-school, with 145 scholars. Dr. H. S Lay having removed to Battle Creek, Mich., the church was left without an elder for several years, the regular services being conducted by leaders who were chosen from time to time. In the mean time Henry H. Pierce, formerly deacon of the church at Monterey, having re moved to Allegan, was chosen to fill that office in the latter place. On the 13th of July, 1878, James M. Baker, having been previously selected for that purpose by the church, was duly ordained as elder. In 1867, Elder J. N. Loughborough, now a missionary to England, spent some weeks in Allegau, during which time he delivered a course of lectures on the prophecies. As the result of his labors some 10 or 15 members were added to the church. About the same time, also, several persons in the vicinity of Douglas (Saugatuek township), having embraced the faith, were also admitted into member ship with the church at Allegan. Subsequently, however, a Seventh-Day Adventist Church was raised up at Douglas, and letters were granted to all the members of the Allegan Church residing in that vicinity to enable them to become members. The membership of the Allegan Church was thus reduced to about its present number, 33. Like most Seventh-Day Adventists' Churches, this one has been com pelled to sustain itself without the aid of a local pastor, their ministers being largely employed in spreading the faith of the church throughout all lands. CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. The Congregational Church had its inception during the year 1858, when a little band of ten persons of that creed, anxious for the establishment of a church of their own, was gathered on the 10th of June of that year at the house of H. H. Booth, in the village of Allegan. On Sunday, the 20th of the same month, their first service was held in Pine Grove Seminary, Rev. Mr. Wolcott offi ciating on the occasion. Mr. Andrew Oliver was chosen clerk of the society. Preaching after this was irregular, though the customary weekly service was maintained with out intermission. Elder W. H. Littlejohn, who is a resident minister of the place when not laboring in other parts of the State, frequently addresses the members of this church on the Sabbath, and they are occasionally visited by other minis ters of the denomination. They have a thriving Sabbath school, numbering 30 members, of which J. M. Baker is superintendent. Besides a weekly prayer-meeting, they have organized a tract and missionary society for the dis- In 1858, Rev. D. Wirt was called to the pastorate, preaching his inaugural sermon on the 6th of November of that year. He was succeeded by Rev. L. H. Jones, and he by Rev. L. F. Waldo. Rev. E. Andrus was next installed as pastor, who was followed by Rev. R. Apthorp. After him Rev. L. F. Bickford filled the pulpit, being suc ceeded by Rev. D. E. Hathaway. The congregation erected a house of worship after they had become fully established, * By Elder W. II. Littlejohn."], [185, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 163 tribution of publications which set forth the reasons of their faith, and a branch club of the American Health and Temperance Association, for the advancement of the health and temperance of the community The latter institution is both unique in its character and radical in its work. All members of the association are expected to sign one of three pledges. The first obligates them to abstain from the use of alcohol in all its forms; the second, from that of alcohol and tobacco ; and the third, from alcohol, morphine, opium, tobacco, tea, and coffee. None but the signers of the third pledge are eligible to office. This club was organized Aug. 20, 1879. It is not denominational in its character, the rights and privileges of its membership being extended to all who are in sympathy with its objects. EUREKA CHAPTER, No. 50, R. A. M. The dispensation for Eureka Chapter bears date May 23, 1867, and the charter January 8th of the following year, the charter members being A. J. Kellogg, George D. Smith, George Geppert, Zara Clifford, H. S. Butler, R. S. Updyke, A. B. Case, W. J. Pollard, F. B. Schorno. Its first stated communication under the dispensation was held at Masonic Hall, Aug. 16, 1867. The first convocation was held at the same place, Jan. 23, 1868, for the purpose of electing officers, the result being as follows : A. J. Kel logg, M. E. H. P.; R. S. Updyke, King; G. D. Smith, Scribe ; B. B. Sutphen, Treas. ; F. J. Higgins, Sec. Its present officers, elected Dec. 2, 1879, are W. H. Pollard, M. E. H. P. ; B. B. Sutphen, King; J. P. Barclay, Scribe ; G. R. Stone, Treas. ; J. M. Killian, Sec. The regular con vocations are held on the first Tuesday of each month, and the organization is in an exceedingly flourishing condition. The regular weekly services of the church are held on Saturday, or the seventh day of the week, in obedience to what its members regard as the only Sabbath law which God has ever promulgated. The Seventh-Day Adventists are firm believers in the near coming of Christ; but, unlike those known as First-day Adventists, they do not now, and never have, indicated the exact time at which Christ will come. ALLEGAN LODGE, No. 105, I. 0. 0. F. Allegan Lodge, No. 105, was instituted Nov. 8, 1866, by William Oaks, Grand Master of the State, its charter members being Allen Wood, Sherman P. Stanley, A. F. Howe, S. H. Priest, James Caskey, Sr., and James Caskey, Jr. Its first officers were James Caskey, N. G. ; Sherman P. Stanley, V. G. ; A. F. Howe, Sec. ; Allen Wood, Treas., the charter bearing date Jan. 14, 1867. Its present offi cers are Richard Baker, N. G. ; Richard D. Thompson, V. G. ; Allen Wood, Ree. Sec. ; H. D. Hunt, Per. Sec. ; Joseph W. Ely, Treas. It has upon its list 81 active members, and enjoys much prosperity. GERMAN LUTHERAN CHURCH. The German Lutheran Society was organized in the year 1869 under the direction of Rev. John Bowman, the first board of trustees being composed of Michel Eckert, Gustav Meske, and Fred Sthuman. The pastor was Rev. Christian Metzger, under whom the society increased in number and became so prosperous as to warrant the erection of a church edifice, the previous services having been held in the court house. To this end a building committee was appointed, consisting of Samuel Ellinger, Gustav Meske, and Michel Eckert. The work progressed rapidly, and in 1874 the edifice was completed at a cost of $1600, many willing hands aiding in the work. Rev. Mr. Metzger was succeeded by Rev. Frederick Frankenstein, and he by the present pastor, Rev. Albert Schernberg. The trustees are Francis Meyer, Michel Eckert, and Julius Schermer. MAY LODGE, No. 10, I. 0. 0. F. (DAUGHTERS OF REBEKAH). This was organized Sept. 2, 1875, by George W. Griggs, G. M.,its first officers being William J. Frost, N. G. ; Mrs. Eliza Baker, V.

G. ; George Davis, Sec. ; Mrs. Ida Osborn, Treas. ; Mrs. B. B. Cronk, Per. Sec. The lodge holds its meetings in Odd-Fellows' Hall, on Locust Street, the second Friday of each month, and enjoys much prosperity. It numbers on its roll 42 members. SECRET SOCIETIES. ALLEGAN LODGE, No. Ill, F. AND A. M. In the month of April, 1858, a few members of the Masonic order, resident in Allegan, met to petition the Grand Master for a dispensation to organize a new lodge. The petition was granted, and on the 4th of August the lodge was opened with the following as its first officers : T. N. Hudson, W. M. ; J. B. Streeter, S. W. ; J. W. Nichols, J. W.; H. C.

In December, 1875, the \" Women's Crusade Band\" was the only temperance organization in the village, and the temperance-workers concluded to form a society which, while offering ample facilities for aggressive work, should include both men and women, and also present social advan tages to reformed men. Accordingly, early in January, 1876, J. W. Scott, of Pontiac, held two meetings, the main points discussed having been the relative merits of different plans of organization for work. The majority seeming to favor the organization of a lodge of Good Templars, a meet ing was held at the Presbyterian church, January 24th, and a lodge was organized known as Allegan Lodge, No. 938. The following officers were chosen : Worthy Chief Templar, R. C. Crawford ; Worthy Vice Templar, Mrs. H. A. Pope; Sec, D. P. Simmons; Assistant Sec, Grace B. Sailor; Treas., H. B. Hudson; Financial Sec, Charlotte Askins; Marshal, S. N. Pike; Deputy Marshal, Ruth Bur gess; Inside Guard, Charles G. Agrell; Outside Guard, H.

OTHER SOCIETIES. THE ALLEGAN LITERARY AND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. This association was organized in June, 1871, a meeting having been called at the office of A. H. Fenn the previous March for the purpose. Dr. E. Amsden was appointed chairman, and J. B. Humphrey secretary. A. S. Butler, who was foremost in the enterprise, stated the object of the gathering. After a free discussion and interchange of views, a committee was selected to draft a plan for a per manent organization. It consisted of A. S. Butler, John W. Stone, William J. Pollard, H. C. Weeks, and J. B. Humphrey. The meeting then adjourned subject to call. On the 23d of May a meeting was held in Empire Hall, at which a constitution and by-laws were adopted, 50 mem bers and 2 life members (A. S. Butler and C. W. Hall) having joined the association. Annual members were to pay $1 each per year, while life-members paid $25 once for all. J. B. Humphrey was made chairman of this meeting, and held office until the regular annual gathering in June. Papers were circulated the same evening, and 60 persons who wished to engage in the work signed their names to the roll. The lodge now began steadily to increase in num bers and influence. Proposals for membership followed in regular order, the largest number initiated at a single meet ing having been 20. At the end of three months the number had increased to 178, and at the end of six months to 216, this being the maximum number during the exist ence of the lodge. At this time, and until the meeting of the Grand Lodge, in October, 1878, Allegan Lodge was the banner lodge of the State. At the end of the first year the books showed 181 names in good standing, which de creased slowly to 116 at the end of the second year. This number became 103 at the next report, and suddenly fell, Nov. 1, 1878, to 51, when the minimum number was reached. Since that time the list has slowly increased until the present, when 65 working members are enrolled upon the books of the lodge. The present officers are William H. Bierce, W. C. T. ; Rev. John Sailor, W. C. ; Henry Marsh, P. W. C. T. In 1871 occurred the first regular annual meeting for the election of officers. The following gentlemen were chosen : President, A. S. Butler ; Treasurer, B. D. Pritch ard ; Corresponding Secretary, J. B. Humphrey ; Record ing Secretary, M. T. Ryan ; Librarian and Collector, H. C. Weeks; Executive Committee, J. W. Stone, E. Amsden, C. W. Hall. In July there were on the books 129 annual members and 4 life-members, Joseph Fisk and William B. Williams having been added to the latter class. The asso ciation gave a course of lectures in the fall and winter which netted nearly $400 profit. The lecturers were Will M. Carlson, E. B. Fairfield, B. F. Taylor, Rev. Mr. Milburn, the blind preacher, Fred. Douglass, Mrs. Mary A. Liver more, M. D. Wilber, Josh Billings, W. E. McLaren, and Theodore Tilton. The first meeting of the lodge was held in Odd-Fellows' Hall. After some changes in location the present hall, in the Union Block, was secured, and dedicated March 12, At the annual meeting in June, 1872, the following officers were elected: President, Dr. E.

In the summer of 1879 the musical portion of the com munity gave encouragement to the efforts of a number of young men, and as a result the Allegan Valley Band was formed in September, 1879, its leader being J. D. Wood beck. In June, 1875, the association organized under the stat ute as a stock company, all life-members being entitled to a share upon completing their payment of $25.

THE OLD ALLEGAN BANK. The Allegan Bank was one of the celebrated wildcat in stitutions of over forty years ago. It was organized in the fall of 1837, and issued its first paper promises to pay near the close of that year, Alexander L. Ely being the presi dent and Hovey K. Clarke the cashier. Its capital stock consisted of real-estate mortgages. The banking-house was an upper room over a store on Brady Street. The bills issued by the establishment not only passed readily in the home market, but soon extended through a large part of the State. The ready confidence of the credulous public was secured by a couple of incidents of otherwise trivial importance. The library contains about 900 volumes, which, with book-cases and fixtures, is valued at about $2000. Present officers : President, E. Amsden ; Vice-President, Mrs. Elizabeth Booth; Clerk, Edwy C. Reid; Correspond ing Secretary, Mrs. O. T. Booth ; Treasurer, H. B. Peck ; Librarian and Collector, Mrs. S. E. Bingham ; Executive Committee, John M. Mendell, H. H. Pope, George W. Lonsbury, William W. Warner. THE WOMAN'S LYCEUM. The Woman's History Class of Allegan was organized on the 1st of February, 1875, with twenty ladies present. A leader, assistant leader, and secretary were chosen, a com pact by which every member was pledged to discharge all duties imposed by the vote of the class was signed, and ap pointments were made for weekly meetings at the homes of the members. Study began with the earliest known history of the world ; the mythology of different nations followed*. This was succeeded by histories of Egypt, Ph\u0153nicia, the Jews, Ethiopia, Carthage, the Punic wars, Persia, Assyria, Lydia, Damascus, and Palmyra. Next followed the history of Greece, the battles of Thermopyl\u00e6, Salamis, Platea, and Mycale, the Peloponnesian wars, histories of Macedonia, Sicily, Pontus, Armenia, Cappadotia, Rhodes, Bactria, Parthia, and other lesser countries, interspersed with essays on various subjects, readings from the poets, etc. Soon after the bills were issued a citizen had occasion to use a small sum at the East. His Allegan money would not answer, and the emergency admitted of no delay. He applied to the president of the bank as a friend. The latter had a small sum in Eastern funds, which he exchanged with him for Allegan bills. Rumor seized on the occurrence and magnified the amount a hundredfold. Within a few days it was currently reported and believed at Kalamazoo that the Allegan Bank redeemed its bills in Eastern funds on demand at the counter. The news was soon prevalent in all the settled parts of the State, and, as few or none of the Michigan banks redeemed their bills, those of the Allegan Bank were eagerly sought after. The other occurrence which gave the bank a high stand in\" was the visit of inspection made by the State commis-"], [190, "166 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. sioner early in 1838. Just before the day appointed for that event, the president of the Allegan Bank, knowing that two of his neighbors had a considerable sum in gold coin, designed for the entry of lands, effected a temporary loan of the gold and placed it among the bank assets. It was counted by the commissioner with great complacency the succeeding night, and the same gold preceded him to the bank of Singapore, at the mouth of the Kalamazoo, where the official also counted it as a part of the assets of that bank. Yet the credit thus obtained was of very short duration, for, notwithstanding the favorable report of the commissioner, both of these banks collapsed within a few months without any available assets whatever. water-power. During the summer and fall of 1879, under the immediate supervision of J. B. Streeter, a new crib of timber 60 feet square and from 12 to 16 feet deep, filled with gravel, has been put into the north side of the dam. This substantial work, with a bridge 120 feet long and 10 feet wide, the necessary coffer-dam, and a pier of slabs 25 rods long, and a solid pier in the dam centre 12 by 12 and 16 feet deep, are the later improvements that secure an average head of 11 feet, with a waste fully equal to the water used. The work was done at a cost of a trifle less than $1400. The power is estimated by run of stone, the recent im provements having made a single run of stone equivalent to 20 horse-power. The following list embraces the order in which the power was utilized by various proprietors, together with the owners' names and the amount of power owned by each of them, the whole power being equal to 40 run of stone : ALLEGAN CITY BANK. This bank was established in 1860, by Augustus S. But ler, with whom H. B. Peck was subsequently associated, the firm being Butler & Peck. In 1873 this firm was suc ceeded by that of II. M. & H. B. Peck, who are the present owners, the former being the president and the latter the cashier. It is a bank of deposit and exchange, and pos sesses, by its capital and extensive connections, excellent facilities for the transaction of a large banking business. Its president is also vice-president of the Kalamazoo City Bank. 1st. The mill built by the Allegan Company, in 1835, now owned by Ira Chaffee, with 4 run of stone. 2d. The furniture-manufactory of Oliver & Co., for merly a grist-mill, built at an early day by the Allegan Company, representing 4 run of stone. 3d. Furnace of Tomlinson & Co., established by Ross man & Hoxie in 1836, with 1 run of stone. 4th. Schoolcraft Mill, built by the Allegan Company, now occupied by Peck & Streeter as a site for a saw-mill, with 6 run of stone. FIRST NATIONAL BANK. The First National Bank of the village of Allegan was organized in June, 1870, the earliest board of directors being B. D. Pritchard, T. C. Jenner, W. H. Nickerson, G. B. Robinson, and Z. L. Griswold. Its first officers were B. D. Pritchard, President; T. C. Jenner, Vice-President; and G. B. Robinson, Cashier. It was organized with a capital stock of $50,000, and at once commanded the con fidence of the business community. The present board of directors is composed of B. D. Pritchard, N. B. West, Ira Chichester, I. P. Griswold, E. G. Truesdell, and J. H. Hart. The officers are B. D. Pritchard, President; Ira Chichester, Vice-President ; F. G. Truesdell, Cashier ; Leon Chichester, Teller. 5th. The Nichols & Ely mill, the site now owned by Messrs. Chaffee & Fisk, representing 4 run of stone. 6th. Pail-factory built early by Ezra Southworth, and now owned by J. Ambler ; 1 run of stone. 7th. N. B. West's sash-, door-, and blind-factory, estab lished in 1842 ; power equaling 3 run of stone. 8th. Leonard & Davidson's sash- and blind-factory; site owned by P. Leonard. Not in use ; 1 run of stone. 9th. John Littlejohn's grist-mill, built in 1840, after wards known as the Kellogg Mill, and now the property of Wetmore Bros. ; 4 run of stone. 10th. S. N. Pike's mill, first built in 1855 as a saw mill, and now used as a grist-mill ; 3 run of stone. MANUFACTORIES AND MILLS. ALLEGAN WATER-POWER ASSOCIATION. 11th. A. E. Calkins' grist-mill, formerly built for a shingle mill, representing 2 run of stone. In 1834 the erection of a dam and the excavations for a race were begun at Allegan by the proprietors of the vil lage, under the superintendence of Martin Barber. Soon after, a saw-mill was erected and put in operation, which was speedily followed by other saw-mills and a grist-mill, which were managed by Mr. Ely, or changed hands as the varying fortunes of the Allegan Company made transfers necessary. 12th. Mill built by S. N. Pike in 1849, and now owned by J. M. Mendel & Co., having 3 run of stone. 13th. Eagle Foundry, built by Fisk & Calkins, and now owned by L. W. Watkins, with 1 run of stone. The Allegan Manufacturing Company leases a cable power from the above. 14th. Allegan Water- Works, 2 run of stone. 15th. J. M. Heath's wood- works, 1 run of stone. The dam not proving in all respects equal to the demands upon it, F. J. Littlejohn was authorized to reconstruct it, which he did by digging 20 feet or more for a more solid foundation and filling in with timber, stone, and other material, at an expense of about $4000. It was a\"ain re paired by the owners in 1847, under the immediate direc tion of Elias Streeter, at a considerable expense, and subse quently by Ira Chaffee, who devoted much time and labor to the improvement of the dam and the increase of the * The original race, built by the Allegan Company, ex tended over a length of 36 rods, an extension of the same number of rods having been added very early by the Boston Company to enable them to furnish a water-supply to the Schoolcraft mill. The owners of these establish ments have organized themselves into an association, and obtained a charter under the title of the Allegan Water- Power Association, with the following officers : N. B. West, President; George Oliver, Secretary; J. B. Streeter, Treas-"], [191, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 167 urer and Superintendent: who are also a board of trustees, in connection with J. M. Mendel and A. E. Calkins. purchased by J. Tomlinson, the present proprietor, who became associated with Mr. Heath, who still retains an interest in the business. The establishment manufactures machinery of all kinds used in milling, agricultural imple ments, and engines, besides doing much job-work. A mar ket for these products is found in Wisconsin, Illinois, In diana, and Michigan. When run to its fullest capacity 25 men are constantly employed, though the present demands upon the foundry will not furnish labor to that number. The owners also do a considerable business in the manufac ture of pumps, for which there is an extensive sale in the northern portion of the State as well as in the immediate vicinity. Grain-separators are among their wares, for which they have established an enviable reputation. N. B. WEST'S MANUFACTORY OF SASH, DOORS, AND BLINDS. This business was first established in 1842 by West, Davis & Higgins, who were succeeded by A. & N. B. West. The senior member having died in 1852, the enterprise has since been conducted by N. B. West, the present proprietor. A water-power representing 60 horse-power, or 3 run of stone, is employed in running the mill. Sash, doors, and blinds are principally manufactured, and a planing-mill is kept in constant operation. A portion of the stock is shipped to Ohio, though a market is principally found in adjacent portions of the State. When first established, there was no enterprise of a similar character in Western Mich igan. During the active season 20 hands are employed in various departments of labor, but there is no present de mand for so large a force. The building has been three times burned and rebuilt. KIRSHMAN k ROSA'S WAGON-FACTORY'. The business of manufacturing wagons and sleighs which is carried on by this firm was first established by Kirsh man & Parker in 1865. T. J. Parker succeeded, but after he had conducted it a brief time the present firm became proprietors. They make their wares principally to order, keeping comparatively little stock on hand. The demand for the goods is found principally at home. FURNITURE-FACTORY OF OLIVER & CO. The business of manufacturing furniture was first estab lished by Wilkes & Richards, who were succeeded in 1855 by the present firm. They produce furniture of all de scriptions, together with a variety of coffins and caskets. The manufactory is located on the banks of the Kalamazoo River, from which they derive their water-privilege. This is equal to 80 horse-power, or 4 run of stone, which they own. Sixteen men are employed in the workshops and saw-mill, and the business at one time reached $20,000 a year in sales, but is not at present so active. Chicago was then the point of destination, and the trade was exclu sively wholesale. The sales are now principally effected through agencies established at Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Plainwell, Vicksburg, and other convenient points. A con siderable wholesale trade in extension-tables is enjoyed by the firm. There is also a tannery, owned by the heirs of T. C. Jen ner, and leased by John Kugler, which is run by horse power, and is actively engaged in the manufacture of leather. Philander Chaffee is extensively engaged in the manufacture of pumps, for which there is a considerable local demand, and J. M. Heath in the production of fruit dryers, emery-wheels, etc Messrs. Peck & Streeter's ex tensive saw-mill and broom-handle and heading-factory, one of the most important enterprises of the kind in the place, was consumed by fire during the preparation of this work. FENN A PERKINS* MANUFACTORY', FANNING-MILLS, Etc. This business was established in 1873, and managed by the Allegan Manufacturing Company until October, 1877, when Dickenson & Fenn became proprietors. Two years later the former gentleman disposed of his interest to Mr. Perkins, of the present firm. Besides doing a general job bing business in the shops they manufacture fanning-mills, milk-safes, feed-cutters, etc. The fanning-mill made by them is modeled after the Messenger pattern, and possesses so many excellences as to make it deservedly popular among the farming community. A market for these articles is found principally in adjacent portions of the State. In addition, the firm do much in the way of dressing and fin ishing lumber for other parties. ALLEGAN WAGON- AND CARRIAGE-FACTORY. This establishment is owned and managed by E. B. Born, who first engaged in business in October, 1854. He at first rented a building, but, as his patronage increased, erected in 1857 a shop on Water Street, which embraces a wood-, blacksmith-, and paint-shop, together with a sales room adjoining. Connected with this are also a salesroom in Ganges and another at Plainwell, where a large assortment of the wares of his establishment may be found. The work done by him has a deservedly high reputation for excellence and finish, and is executed under the personal supervision of the proprietor, who is assisted by his three sons, one being iu each department of the business. ALLEGAN AGRICULTURAL WORKS. This enterprise was established in 1874 by a stock com pany for the purpose of manufacturing railway-cars, con tracts for which were promised by certain companies on the completion of the works. A panic having occurred in financial circles which affected the railroad interests, it was then converted by the company and a few additional stockholders into an establishment for the manufacture of agricultural implements, in which cultivators of an improved pattern, as well as other utensils used in farming pursuits, are produced. A portion of the building, which is a spa- J. TOMLINSON'S FOUNDRY, This foundry was first established by Rossman & Hoxie in 1836, and after the death of the latter gentleman the Smith Bros. became partners. They were succeeded by Winslow Feek, under the firm-name of Rossman & Feek, which firm continued until 1865, when Mr. Rossman dis posed of his interest to John M. Heath, and the firm be came Feek & Heath. In 1870 the share of Mr. Feek was"], [192, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 168 has more recently been made from the Eastern market, and much of the flour is shipped to Pittsburgh, New York, and other Eastern points. Much modern machinery is employed in the manufacture of flour, which is of a superior quality. The mill is at present leased by William A. Knerr. cious one and located near the depot, is used by the Grand Haven Railroad Company as a repair-shop. SPRING-BED MANUFACTORIES. Among the manufactures of Allegan, the spring-bed in dustry holds a prominent place. An inferior grade of this necessary article has for several years been made, but with the invention of the celebrated \" 140-spring\" or \" Peerless\" bed an article was produced which has proved excellent in quality and correspondingly popular. Allegan, having shipping facilities and an abundance of basswood timber, has proved a favorable point for this industry. About 10,000 of these beds were made and readily sold during the last year, the South and West affording a market for them. Amsden Brothers and C. E. Smith & Co. are the leading manufacturers in Allegan. KALAMAZOO VALLEY FLOURING-MILL, This mill, which was built in 1878 by A. E. Calkins, is located on the west side of the race, and manufactures flour principally for shipment, though a limited amount of custom-work is done. The mill, like most other enter prises of a similar character in Allegan, is run by water furnished by the Kalamazoo River, the supply of which is equal to 3 run of stone, or 60 horse-power, this share of the water-privilege being owned by Mr. Calkins. The capacity of the mill is 300 barrels per week, in addition to much feed and grain, which is shipped to the northern portion of the State. Machinery has been placed in the mill for the manufacture of flour by the new process, the demand for it being found principally in Portland, Me., whither it is shipped. WETMORE BROS.' FLOURING-MILL. This mill was built in the year 1840 by Col. John Littlejohn, and in 1850 sold to John R. Kellogg, who, three years later, rebuilt and -enlarged it, adding much that was modern in the way of machinery and increasing its capacity by another run of stone. In 1858 Mr. Kellogg sold to A. and H. G. Case, who managed the mill successfully for a period of years and then disposed of the property to Amos Smith Brown, of Breedsville. The latter gentleman continued its owner until his death, in 1873, when it was purchased by Wetmore Bros., the present owners, under whose management it has been greatly improved. It has a water-privilege equal to 80 horse-power and the latest improved water-wheels. There are 5 run of stone, which give it a capacity of 100 barrels of flour and 300 bushels custom-work daily. The market for the flour produced is found principally in the Eastern States. IRA CHAFFEE SAW-MILL. This mill is without question the oldest on the banks of the Kalamazoo Biver, the original structure having been built by the Boston Company as early as 1835. It was later owned by Southworth & Streeter. In 1841 the present proprietor purchased the interest of Mr. Streeter, and the firm became Southworth & Chaffee. With their milling enterprise they combined a mercantile business until 1850, when the senior member of the firm disposed of his interest and embarked for the Golden State. The business was then conducted by Mr. Chaffee, who has managed it since. It has a water-privilege equal to 4 run of stone, together with one of the best sites upon the river. The mill is principally employed in sawing logs, and has an almost unlimited capacity. It has frequently produced 300,000 feet per week, and can accomplish even more when run to its utmost limit. J. M. MENDEL & COMPANY'S MILL. This mill was built by S. N. Pike as early as 1849, and after a brief ownership by the builder was sold to Henry Dumont, who in turn sold to Pollard & Abbott. They disposed of it to Julius Tomlinson. Feek & Wet more became their successors, from whom the property was purchased by the present proprietors in 1870. The mill is three stories high, and is run by a water-supply equal to 3 run of stone, which is owned by the firm. The capacity of the mill is 100 barrels per day, though not run at present to its fullest limit. Both flour and feed are ground, the market for the former being found princi pally in Vermont. In the machinery are embraced most of the modern improvements for making a superior quality of flour. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. JUDGE HENRY H. BOOTH. The subject of this memoir, from all that can be gathered from his associates in life, stood far up the scale in all that pertains to true manhood, and among the many self-made men who have lived and died in the county of Allegan, no one is more justly entitled to a prominent place in these biographical sketches than Judge Booth. Yet, perhaps, no one among them all cared less or strove less for what men commonly call success in life, or fame and fortune, than he, and, perhaps, no one among them, laying aside mere selfish considerations, cared more or strove more than he for what he thought to be the best good of his fellow-men. In his character there seemed to be a strange mingling of manly sternness and womanly tenderness ; kiud and gentle almost to a fault, yet, when he thought the occasion required, he S. N. PIKE'S FLOURING-MILL. This mill is located adjacent to the saw-mill of Ira Chaffee, and was built by the present proprietor in 1855. It is run by water, and has a power equal in capacity to 3 run of stone, or 60 horse-power, which is owned by Mr. Pike. The mill has been twice destroyed by fire, and each time rebuilt. Both custom- and merchant-work are done, and it is possible to produce 400 barrels of flour a week exclusive of custom-work. The market for products of the mill was formerly found in Chicago, but a demand"], [193, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE. 169 could rebuke with severity. In his life and aims he was more the philanthropist than the philosopher. His motives were not always quite understood by those with wliom he had daily intercourse, yet they knew that he was always purely good at heart and true, and if what he said and did did not always meet with their approval, yet he always com manded their highest esteem. He will long be remembered for his genial faith in the Christian religion ; he became a member of the Congrega tional Church at the time of its organization, and was an earnest and devoted supporter of it during his life. In his domestic relations his life furnishes a bright example of all that adorns the character of a devoted husband and a warm-hearted, faithful friend. As an energetic, enterpris ing, and useful citizen he had no superiors and few equals. Oct. 30, 1834, he was married at East Bloomfield, N. Y., to Miss Ruth Elizabeth, daughter of Anson Munson, Esq., one of the prominent citizens and pioneers of that place. Her portrait, so full of character, may be seen on another page. She is a woman of rare personal excellence, of a deeply religious nature. She was one of the first members of the Congregational Church of Allegan, and closely iden tified with its various charitable and religious enterprises, and a worthy counterpart of her husband in all the salient points of his character. Judge Booth was born in Dorset, Bennington Co., Vt., April 3, 1803. His father, Zachary Booth, was a saddler by occupation, and reared a family of three children, the judge being the only son. But little is known of his boy hood days. He was early taught to rely upon his own resources, and received a common-school education. He acquired the trade of a cabinet-maker, and at the age of twenty-one he removed with his parents and sisters to Weedsport, N. Y., where he followed his trade, maintaining the family. Here he became an earnest worker for the church, and in those early days of temperance reform he became an earnest advocate of the cause, frequently deliver ing temperance lectures. In October, 1836, he emigrated to Allegan County with his family. He first engaged in the produce business, in which he remained one year, buying his stock in the country and hauling it to Allegan himself. The following year he was deputy county clerk, and so well did he dis charge the duties of the office that he was elected for the succeeding term, and was again re-elected. Upon the ex piration of the term he was called to fill the office of county judge, and it is stated that during his term of office, which extended over several years, not an appeal was taken from his decision. As a jurist he manifested clearness of per ception, sound common sense, and indefatigable persever ance, and had he received a legal education he would no doubt have obtained celebrity as a lawyer. Previous to the expiration of his judgeship he was appointed agent of the Boston Company, in whose employ he remained up to within seventeen months of his death, which occurred June 22, 1867. MR. AND MRS. DAVID D. DAVIS. David D. Davis was born in Hartford, Washington Co., N. Y., Feb. 24, 1814. His father, William Davis, was a carpenter and joiner by occupation, and reared a family of eight children. But little is known of David's early life. He received a common-school education, and at the age of twenty came to Michigan, in company with his brother-in law, Col. Joseph Fisk, of whom he learned his trade, \u2014 that of carpenter and joiner. The year 1834 he spent at Ma rengo, Calhoun Co., and came to Allegan in June, 1835. May 18, 1836, he was married to Miss Hannah J. Robin son ; they immediately returned to Allegan. Mr. Davis and his wife were among the pioneers of the village, and contributed much to the development of its wealth and that of the county. Being very energetic and extremely indus trious, and withal saving and judicious in his investments, they were highly successful in the accumulation of property. They first lived in a log house built where the wing of the Allegan House now stands. Their second home was on the corner of Monroe and Walnut Streets, and while living there they built the beautiful residence on the corner of Cutler and Walnut, where Mr. Davis died Dec 17, 1871. He was a man of much strength of character and determi nation, and emphatically a self-made man. His life was comparatively uneventful, and marked by few changes save such as occur in the lives of most successful business men. One very marked feature in the life of Judge Booth was the deep interest he took in educational matters. He was ever ready to assist others to obtain through competent teachers what he secured only by labor and privation. In 1856 he built the Pine Grove Seminary wholly at his own expense and purely as a benevolent enterprise. He em ployed the most experienced teachers, the school soon obtained an enviable reputation, and up to the time of his failing health he exercised a watchful care over its interests. After his settlement in Allegan he followed his trade for many years, and his savings were judiciously invested in real estate. He never engaged in any speculative enter prise, but steadily pursued the path he had marked out. He took a deep interest in all matters pertaining to Alle gan. He held several positions of trust and responsibility, notably among the number that of county treasurer. For years he was a member of the board of trustees of the Baptist Church, and took a deep interest in its welfare and prosperity. In social life he was noted for his hospitality and good nature. He possessed in a rare degree that quality of bear ing and manner, united with a comeliness of person and a fine presence, which not only favorably impressed the stranger, but endeared him to those who enjoyed his society. He was genial, patient, and forbearing, and was actuated by those higher motives which are always recognized and felt when systematically and constantly exercised, as they were during his long life. Edward Buck, of Boston, who had an intimate acquaintance with him, says, \" He was a valu able man in any community, a man of great energy and sympathy, and in business matters prompt and active.\" Mrs. Davis was a woman of more than ordinary ability and discernment, and a worthy counterpart of her husband in all that pertained to energy, industry, and thrift. She o.)"], [194, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 170 great interest in political matters, and filled several positions of trust ; he served on many important committees, and took a prominent part in the conventions of his party. He was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention of 1872, where he took a prominent part in the nomination of Horace Greeley. He was the founder of the Allegan Liter ary and Library Association, and was elected its first presi dent. He was a prominent member of the Masonic frater nity, and at the time of his death was Worshipful Master of the Allegan Lodge and member of the Knights Templar Commandery at Kalamazoo. In 1861, Mr. Butler was married to Miss Cornelia, daughter of the Hon. Flavius J. Littlejohn, of Allegan, who still survives him. From all that can be learned of his associates, he was a man far up the scale in all that pertains to true manhood. He was energetic and prompt in business, and in all respects a worthy citizen and a useful member of society. He met his death Aug. 11, 1873, by the overturning of a stage while on a pleasure excursion in New Hampshire. was possessed of deep religious convictions, and was con verted when twelve years of age ; she united with the Bap tist Church, and continued an earnest Christian and zealous Baptist until her death. She was one of the thirteen who constituted the first membership of the Baptist Church df Allegan. By her labors, counsel, and pecuniary assistance she did as much as or perhaps more than any other of its members in bringing it from its beginning to its present standard ; nor was her work confined to her own church. With the means at her command she aided weak churches, and her contributions to charities were numerous. She was fearless in advocacy of what she deemed right, and out spoken in opposition to what she thought wrong. In her death, which occurred Sept. 30, 1877, the Baptist Church lost its strongest supporter and one of its most constant workers, temperance an earnest advocate, and the poor a friend. In the disposition of her estate Mrs. Davis left eight thousand dollars to the Kalamazoo Theological Semi nary ; five thousand dollars to the Nashville (Tenn.) In stitute for Colored Students; five hundred dollars to the Baptist State Mission ; and, with the exception of the above mentioned legacies and six thousand dollars, she bequeathed the balance of her estate, which was valued at about sixty thousand dollars, to the First Baptist Church of Allegan. LYMAN W. WATKINS. Lyman W. Watkins, one of the pioneers of Allegan village, was born in Chester, Vt., March 10, 1817. In 1819 the family removed to Bethany, Genesee Co., N. Y., where they remained until 1829, when they went to Titusville, Pa., where the elder Watkins died at an advanced age; but little is known of his history farther than that he served his country in the war of 1812 as a private soldier. He was a farmer by occupation, and an exemplary man in all respects. He reared a family of eleven children, \u2014 four boys and seven girls. Lyman im proved his meagre facilities for education, and at an early age was obliged to rely upon his own resources. At the age of nineteen he decided to try his fortune in the West, and in May of 1836 came to Allegan. He was first employed by Alexander Ely, and did his first work upon what was known as the big mill. For several years he was engaged in the lumber trade, and about 1844 he purchased the steamboat \" Pioneer,\" which he ran for several years, when he engaged in the manufacture of lath ; this business he carried on for some time, when he went into the grocery trade, but soon changed his stock to that of drugs, in which trade he was engaged about twenty years. The life of Mr. Watkins has been comparatively uneventful, and marked but by few changes save such as occur in the lives of most business men. His name has not been known in official circles, with the exception of eight years in which he served his fellow-townsmen as magistrate, but among those men who have, by their own industry and energy, developed the resources of Allegan County, he occupies a con spicuous position. In November, 1845, he was married to Miss Sylvania Snedaker. Five children were born to them, all of whom died in infancy. In his religious and political affiliations Mr. Watkins is a Presbyterian and a Democrat. All in all, he is one of those gentlemen whose identification with any community is always productive of good. AUGUSTUS S. BUTLER. Augustus S. Butler was born in Gaines, Orleans Co., N. Y., in 1834. Iu 1840 his parents emigrated to Michigan, and settled in Adrian, where they remained till 1847, when they removed to Lansing. At the age of thirteen young Butler became a clerk in a store, and walked twenty-six miles to hold the position. Ever prompt, ready, and accurate, he gave unbounded accept ance in this position, and in 1854 was given a clerkship in the office of the Secretary of State, discharging his duties to the entire satisfaction of all. For several years he compiled the Legislative Manual. In 1856 he assisted in the compilation of the land abstracts of Ingham County. He removed to Allegan in 1857, and compiled for the Hon. John R. Kellogg the abstract of land-titles for Allegan County, a work in which he was engaged for three years. From his boyhood he took a deep interest in public affairs. Frank in the expression of his sentiments, he always made his views manifest on all the great questions of the day. In 1860 he was deputy United States marshal, and assisted in the collection of the census for Allegan County. In 1861 he formed a copartnership with Wolcott H. Littlejohn, in the book and stationery business, opening the first store of that kind in the county. In December, 1862, Mr. Butler opened the first banking establishment in the county in the Ebmyer building, occupying a small space in the store of A. B. Case & Co., at a rental of twenty-five dollars per year, and with a capital of two hundred and fifty dollars. He rapidly acquired the confidence and patronage of the business men, and the enterprise proved to be highly re munerative. In 1868 he formed a copartnership with H. B. Peck, which continued for five years. Mr. Butler took"], [195, "ALLEGAN VILLAGE 171 Photo, by C. G. Agrell, Allegan. ALANSON S. WEEKS. Alanson S. Weeks, son of Samuel and Susannah Weeks, was born at Wheelock, Caledonia Co., Vt., Jan. 10, 1812. He received such an education as the meagre facilities of that day afforded, and at the age of fourteen he was appren ticed to the trade of a painter and chair-maker, serving his time with one Ira Church. In the spring of 1834, in com pany with his brother, Corydon, he started for Michigan ; their conveyance was a horse and buggy ; the journey occu pied some four weeks, and was devoid of any incidents worthy of mention. They arrived in Detroit on the 12th of August, 1834, where they attended the funeral obsequies of Governor Porter, the last of the territorial Governors of Michigan. lessons of morality, industry, and thrift, and to him they re largely indebted for the enviable position they hold mong the representative men of Allegan County. The eldest son, William C., enlisted as a private in the spring of 1862, in Company I, Fifth Michigan Cavalry. He participated in many of the decisive battles of the war, and was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He was severely wounded in the battle of Five Forks, where he lost a foot ; he was taken prisoner, and was confined in \" Libby Prison\" from March, 1864, to August of the same year. In July, 1865, he was mustered out, and returned to Allegan, where he has since resided. In 1868 he was elected register of deeds; he discharged his duties with credit to himself and to the satisfaction of the people, and in 1871 was re-elected to the same position. He has been closely identified with the interests of Allegan, and was elected president of the village in 1876. The second son, Harrison S., entered the military academy at West Point at the age of eighteen, grad- uating with honor at the age of twenty-two, and was com- missioned as second lieutenant in the Eighth United States Cavalry. He is at present stationed at Fort Union, New Mexico. The third son, Harold C., learned the business of a druggist, but by reason of ill health turned his attention to real estate. In 1S70 he bought the abstract records of Allegan County, and is at present associated with his elder brother, William C. In connection with their abstract business, they are extensively engaged in agricultural operations and breeding Durham cattle, their stock being from some of the best herds in Kentucky. They own a fine farm of several hundred acres, about two and a half miles from Allegan village. In his political affiliations the elder Weeks was originally an Old-Line Whig, but identified himself with the Republican party upon its formation ; the three boys each cast their first Presidential vote for the immortal Lincoln, and are the staunchest of staunch Republicans. Socially, Alausou S. Weeks is genial and courteous, winning the re- After a short rest they started West, their point of desti nation being Kalamazoo, then known as Bronson. Here Mr. Weeks remained during the autumn and winter, work ing at his trade. In the spring of 1835 he made his first visit to Allegan, and, being favorably impressed with its natural advantages, decided to make it his home. He pur chased a farm on section 5, in the town of Trowbridge, and returned to Kalamazoo, where he remained until the spring of 1836, when he purchased property in the village of Al legan and made a permanent settlement. The following year (1837) he was married to Miss Harriet N. Peckham. She was also a native of Vermont, and was born in 1819 in Frank lin County. About 1827 her father removed to Canada, and in 1836 she came to Michigan in company with her brother-in-law, J. P. Austin. She was a noble type of the pioneer woman, and endured cheerfully all the hardships and deprivations of the early days. She died in 1855, at the age of thirty-six years, leaving her husband and four chil dren to mourn her loss, the youngest being a babe of two months.

He is everywhere known as a man of unquestioned integrity and honesty. He has many of the virtues and but few of the faults of humanity, and is one of those whose identification with any community is always productive of good. He has witnessed and has been identified with the many changes in Allegan history, and while his life has been comparatively uneventful, the position he holds among those who in the early days laid the foundation for the present wealth and prosperity of Allegan County, and the part he has taken in its development, are creditable alike to himself and his posterity. who for several years held the position of county surveyor, instructed him also in the art, and he has surveyed much of the county of Allegan. With the exception of the year 1860, he represented his township on the board of supervisors from 1858 to 1866, inclusive. During his service occurred the great civil war, and his duties were arduous in his position. The war widows and families of diseased or disabled soldiers received his earnest attention, and all have cause to remember him with gratitude in those trying days of warfare and suspense. For ten years in succession he held the office of county treasurer. In 1866, Mr. Chichester was married to Ann Mary Ives, daughter of Friend Ives, one of the most prominent citizens of Allegan. In January, 1867, Mr. Chichester located in Allegan with his family, and is at present residing in that city. Although yet young in years, he has arisen to prominence, and is one of the most respected and influ ential citizens of his county. IRA CHICHESTER. This gentleman is one of a family of seven children,\u2014 three sons and four daughters. He was born in the town of Unadilla, Otsego Co., N. Y., March 6, 1824.

Aside from his farm labors he engaged in teaching school, and won a reputation in life for honesty and strict integrity. He removed from Unadilla in 1835, and settled in the town of Otsego, in the same county, four miles below the village, upon a farm he had purchased. His wife died in 1837. He finally came to Michigan, and died in Gun Plain, Allegan Co., in 1856. ELIAS STREETER. in Rochester, N. Y., with the family of Judge Ely in lumbering interests, he was readily persuaded to follow their fortunes in Michigan, whence he removed in 1835, where little else than a wilderness presented itself on his arrival. His native place was the township of Phelps, N. Y., where his parents, Thomas and Ruth Streeter, resided at the time of his birth. His early life was un eventful, though it is probable that careful home-training developed those qualities of fortitude and perseverance which enabled him in after-life to fill so successfully the role of pioneer. He early engaged in lumbering pursuits in the Empire State, and, in 1825, married Miss Julia The early advantages of Ira Chichester were extremely limited. His education was obtained in the district schools of the time, and, in common with the other members of the family, he experienced the various phases of pioneer life, and endured its many hardships and privations. After arriving at the age of manhood he acquired proficiency in the trade of the carpenter and joiner, and also employed a portion of his time in teaching school.

On his arrrival in Michigan he engaged again in lumbering, and was also actively interested in building and furthering the interests of the village of Allegan, having been employed by the Boston Company. Mr. and Mrs. Streeter had a family of five sons and five daughters, eight of whom are still living. Mr. Streeter's death occurred at the home of his son, James B. Streeter, in Allegan, July 22, 1868, in his seventieth year. The portrait accompanying this sketch is the filial tribute of this son to his memory.

The usual vegetables also find a congenial soil, and large crops of them are produced. The amount of improved land, by the census of 1874, was 9446 acres, divided among the 221 farms. The official valuation in 1877 was $1,118,205, and the equalized valu ation $1,120,000, including personal property. The pro gress of improvement in the township was for years some what retarded by the fact of its lands having been held by non-residents. These have since been cleared and ren dered productive. The township of Allegan maintains an important posi tion on account of its containing the county-seat, which is also the business centre of a large circuit of country. It is bounded on the north by Monterey, south by Trow bridge, east by Watson, and west by Pine Plains, and is described in the United States Survey as township 2 north, of range 13 west. It was surveyed by Lucius Lyon in September, 1836. It has many high elevations and deep ravines, some of the former commanding extended views of the surroutiding country. On the west and south sides are level stretches of pine-land, and a considerable portion of the tract along the northern boundary is also level, and even shows some traces of the swampy land which was formerly to be seen there. The Kalamazoo River follows a circuitous course through the township, entering it from the south and flow ing northwesterly, making its exit near the centre of the western boundary. There are fertile bottom-lands along its course, embracing some of the richest soil in the township, and the banks in many instances are very precipitous. Almost all varieties of timber abound in the township of Allegan. Elm, ash, cedar, and tamarack are found in the swampy portions, while beech and maple flourish in other localities. Lofty pines were formerly seen in abun dance on the southern border, some of which were of gigantic proportions. Fruit-culture has more recently absorbed the attention of many of the residents. Large orchards of apples are seen on every side, some of which have produced fruit of very superior quality and size. Plums are grown to a limited extent, and peaches have been gathered which are pronounced quite equal in flavor to those produced in the celebrated Michigan fruit-belt. Many acres are now covered by these trees, and so much interest has been awakened in the subject as to have in duced farmers to devote their land to the culture of the peach as well as the apple. Much interest is also mani fested in the improvement of stock, many specimens of the choicest varieties of horses, cattle, sheep, and swine being found in the township. The Kalamazoo division of the Michigan Central Railroad, the Grand Haven Railroad, and the Allegan and Southeastern Railroad all traverse this township. They are described at length in Chapter XIX. of the general history. Several creeks of greater or less length flow into the river, most of them from the north. The surface of Alle gan is also dotted by a number of lakes of varying size. The most important of these is Miner Lake, which em braces portions of sections 11, 12, and 13, and covers an area of nearly a square mile. It is a favorite resort of pleasure-parties, and the sportsman with his fishing-rod finds ample employment along its shores. The larger por tion of Dumont Lake is also claimed by Allegan township. It lies on portions of sections 4 and 5, and is in some lo calities remarkable for its depth. Wetmore Lake is located on section 3, and Littlejohn Lake, the only one near the southern boundary, is on section 31. The couuty-farm is located in Allegan township, and con sists of 100 acres of the best quality of land, 90 of which are improved. The buildings are spacious, and in most respects well adapted for the accommodation of the unfor tunate inmates. One of the buildings is a two-story structure, with basement, built in 1869, for the keeping and treatment of the insane, in which the officers have had encouraging success. There is also a neat two-story build ing, erected two or three years since for the care and in struction in school of the poor children thrown upon the couuty, of sufficient size for the accommodation of 30 The soil varies in different localities, being generally a strong clay mixed with sand, though the pine-lands are composed principally of sand.

Action 9.\u2014 Bought from 1835 to 1836 by 0. B. Ely, A. L. Ely, Ches- ter Wetmore, B. F. Lamed, Lewis Huttleston. The first settler in the township of Allegan outside of the village was Elisha Moody, who came in June, 1836, and located on section 21, where he had entered 160 acres. He made some improvements, such as erecting a cabin and clearing a few acres ; but either the location was unsatis factory or the life of a pioneer was unpleasing to Mr. Moody, for during the following year he disposed of his property to Elisha Dickenson, who immediately moved on to it and became the second settler in the township. He, too, seems to have been of a restless nature, for he soon divided the property into parcels, sold it, and left the township. Section 10.\u2014 Bought from 1835 to 1852 by Alexis Packard, Alanson Edgerton, 0. C. McCracken, Chester Wetmore, John W. Edger, Ira Agan.

McRay, James Carter. The third settler, and the first permanent one, was Chester Wetmore, who came from Otsego Co., N. Y., in 1835, and after remaining one year in Gun Plain removed to the township of Allegan, having entered 480 acres of land on sections 3 and 4. He built a scow, in which, with bis family, he floated down the Kalamazoo to Allegan village, from which point he cut his own road to the place he had chosen for his home. He had gone there himself a few weeks before and built a log house, but it was still with out doors or windows. Mr. Dickenson was his nearest neighbor, and he was about three miles distant. Action 15. \u2014 Bought from 1835 to 1837 by Peter Dumont, Edward Pimlcy, Jonathan Peabody, John Askins and Benjamin Eager, Benjamin Scott. Section 16. \u2014 Bought from 1839 to 1864 by Justen Ely, John Wilson, Albert Wilson, N. B. West, O. B. Bellinger, Oka Town, O. Smith, C. S. Wilson, E. A. Murray, Charles Southwell.

Hastings, Samuel Hubbard, Thomas Burch, Alex. H. Edwards. Mr. Wetmore devoted his energies to the clearing of his land, employing two men to help him. At the end of the year he had the satisfaction of seeing 25 acres improved, and a portion of it under cultivation. With Mr. Wetmore came his two sons, who are now the proprietors of the large flouring-mill of Wetmore Brothers in Allegan.

Gris- wold, William Briant, Edward Pinley. William Allen came soon after from New York, and located as a tenant upon a farm that had previously been entered by Justus Ely, and on which a small clearing had been made. Mr. Ely was a resident of Allegan village, and was principally engaged in lumbering. Section 23. \u2014 Bought from 1835 to 1837 by Wilson Coggswell, Alphonso Blakesley, Enos Northrop, Stephen V. R.

Finding profitable employ ment in the village, he remained there two years, when he built a log house on his place, moved into it, and began improving his land. In the spring, squaws were busy in the vicinity making sugar. The method they pursued was not such as to tempt an epicurean palate. Game of various kinds is said to have been cooked in the sap, which was afterwards reduced to sugar, packed into \" mococks\"* and sold to the settlers for potatoes and meal. In the family of Mr. Peabody occurred probably the earliest death in the township, \u2014 that of one of his infant children, in 1837. reason no very marked progress was made in the improve ment of the township for several years. Mr. Griswold was given the contract for buildin\"* the first school-house in his neighborhood, a very early school having previously been taught in a barn built by him, by Miss Olivia Wetmore. In the school-house just mentioned was held the first Sabbath-school in the township, Mr. Gris wold having been the superintendent. Like many other old residents of the township, Mr. Griswold retired to the village to spend the declining years of his life. Peter Dumont, a brother-in-law of Chester Wetmore, came in the spring of 1837, having remained at Gun Plain during the two previous years. He entered 160 acres on section 4. His family remained with Mr. Wetmore until a log house was constructed, to which they removed. Mr. Dumont cleared 30 acres and built a barn, but, finding a purchaser of the place in Rev. W. C. H. Bliss, removed to another farm which he purchased on section 0, where he died in 1852, and where his sons John B. and Robert now reside. Wolves were plenty at this period, and the bounty for killing them was large enough to be a material object to a skillful hunter. An instance is related of one settler who paid for his farm from the proceeds of wolf-scalps. Peter M. Higginbotham may, with some justice, contest the honor of being the earliest settler. He arrived from Oneida Co., N. Y., and entered land on section 15 early in 1835, before the settlement made by Moody. There he built a shanty, and remained sufficiently long to begin the work of clearing. He then returned to the East, where he stayed during the following winter. The next spring we find him again with axe in hand felling the forest. It was not, however, till the spring of 1837 that he brought his family from New York and took permanent possession. It consisted of his father, his mother, and his brother, John B. Higginbotham. Another brother, H. S. Higginbotham, came in 1839 and located on section 21, his land being now embraced within the village limits. This brother is the only surviving member of the family. Peter Higginbotham was undoubtedly the first to begin a clearing in Allegan township, outside the village, but not the first to take up his permanent residence in it. In 1841 Mr. Higginbotham removed to section 21, where he resided until his death. The first public religious services in the township, out side of the village, were probably held in the school-house on section 21. Elder Munger is recollected as an early preacher, as were also Rev. William Jones and Rev. W. C. H. Bliss. The latter gentleman has already appeared as having purchased the farm of Peter Dumont. For a time the week was occupied by Mr. Bliss in physical labor, and the Sabbath in pastoral work in various parts of the county. His services were in constant demand on funeral occasions, and at intervals he performed a marriage ceremony, though his annual income was not materially increased by the fre quency of these latter events. When Mr. Bliss became a circuit-preacher, he traveled twenty-two hundred miles in one year in fulfilling the duties of his position. Though advanced in years, he still occasionally officiates at religious gatherings, and still occupies the homestead ou which he first settled. Niram Abbott came from Elmira, N. Y., in 1835, to the,, village, and a year later began improving his place on sec tion 30. This was the first farm improved near the village, and Mr. Abbott while clearing it continued his residence in Allegan. He built a comfortable home for that period, but in a short time moved to Monterey. Even this did not content him, and in 1839 he emigrated to Illinois, finally moving to Minnesota, where he died. His daughter, Eliza beth S., now the wife of H. S. Higginbotham, was the first little white girl in Allegan township, out of the village. Z. L. Griswold left his early home in Batavia, N. Y., in 1835, and located 160 acres on section 22 on the 8th of June of that year. While entering his land at Kalamazoo, Mr. Griswold met Elisha Moody and recommended a tract adjoining his own, which he (Moody) immediately exam ined and purchased. Three weeks later Mr. Moody had built a log house upon it and established his family in it. When Mr. Griswold returned the following year he found Elisha Dickenson in possession of the Moody place, with whom he remained three weeks, paying $5 per week for board. Meanwhile, he erected a shanty on his land, moved into it, and went to keeping bachelor's hall. He chopped 11 acres, which he planted principally with pota toes, the seed of which cost from $1 to $1.50 per bushel. Few of the settlers devoted themselves entirely to the im provement of their land, but worked for the Allegan or the Boston Company's* in chopping and drawing logs. For this Corydon Weeks emigrated from Vermont in 1834, and located in Allegan village. After a brief residence there he settled upon the farm now occupied by Charles S. Wil son. Later, he removed to Ohio, but, finding the attractions of Michigan superior to those of the Buckeye State, he returned and purchased 40 acres on section 17, where he now resides. Joseph Bush came from Rochester, N. Y., in 1835, and became a resident of the village. In 1837 he purchased of William B. Jenner 40 acres on section 9, to which he removed. During the first year he was absent much of the time helping to build schooners for the lake traffic, he being by trade a ship-earpenter. Mr. Bush had been a soldier in the regular army, and had been engaged in the Black Hawk war. For years Mrs. Bush accompanied her husband, and endured the hardships of camp-life and its privations. John J. Miner, one of a numerous family, most of whom located in Watson, entered 80 acres on section 13, in Alle gan township, in 1836. He improved this land and ren- * See Chapter X. f See preceding chapter on Allegan village."], [200, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 176 She is still teaching in the county. Mr. Pullen, under a contract with the highway commissioners, cut alone twelve miles of road through the township. dered it a productive farm, but ultimately removed to the village, where he died, and where his widow still resides. Clement Miner, a brother, also has a home in Allegan. Jwhn Wilson, another pioneer from Monroe Co., N. Y., came in 1836, and made the village his residence for three years. At the expiration of that time he purchased 40 acres on section 16, which he soon after disposed of, and bought 80 acres on another portion of the same section. On the first tract he built a cooper-shop, probably the only one anywhere in that region. He has since removed to the village, but still retains his farm. Among the men employed by A. L. Ely in cutting the race at the village were Daniel and James Bracelin, who came from Washtenaw County in 1835. After the demand for laborers in the village had subsided, Mr. Ely induced them to purchase each 40 acres on section 33. Daniel then engaged to clear a piece of timbered land for Mr. Ely, which was subsequently known as the Bracelin lot. The brothers found no roads near their places, and were not greatly impressed with the advantages of the situation. James sold to Ely and Daniel exchanged his lot for 80 acres in Watson, whither they both removed soon after wards. George Muma came from Upper Canada in 1837, and was employed by Z. L. Griswold to clear a portion of his farm, upon which he resided. He subsequently settled upon section 16, and afterwards upon section 17, where he owned 80 acres. His latest purchase was in Pine Plains. James Green came from Wayne Co., N. Y., in 1838, and took up his residence on section 23, but subsequently retired to the village, where, at the advanced age of ninety-seven years, he is still vigorous and active. John and Ephraim Brownell were pioneers from Monroe County in 1837. Unlike most of the emigrants from that county, who were attracted to the village by the prospect of employment, they proceeded directly into the woods, and each located himself upon an 80-acre tract on section 6. Afterwards their brother, Richard Brownell, came and chose a farm on section 6, subsequently removing to section 7. The two brothers who first arrived are still residents of the township, Richard having since died. William A. Knapp, who was one of the early pioneers of the village, became, in 1844, a resident of an 80-acre tract on sections 9 and 16, on which he resided until he again removed to the village, in 1863. When he began the clearing of his land not a house had been erected be tween his farm and Allegan. Like many other settlers who have removed to the village, Mr. Knapp still retains his farm. Asa Morse, another Monroe County man, arrived in 1837 and remained a year in the village, after which he removed to a 40-acre lot on section 9, to which he added 80 addi tional acres on the adjoining section. He still owns the farm on which he settled, but lives in Allegan village. Three of Mr. Morse's children died soon after his arrival of scarlet fever. There were but few neighbors, but these all came in turn to spend the nights in watching by the bedside of the little sufferers. Philo Van Keuren removed from Orange Co., N. Y., in 1836, and made the village his residence for a number of years, following the occupation of a boatman on the Kala mazoo River. In 1846 he purchased 160 acres on section 24, upon which he built a substantial framed house, and cleared 10 acres the first year, keeping bachelor's hall in the mean time. The first school building in the neighbor hood was built on Mr. Van Keuren's land. Later, a build ing was erected by the district on the northwest corner of the same section. Mr. Van Keuren has continued to James Lowe came to Allegan from the banks of the Hudson, in the State of New York, in 1838, and entered 320 acres of land on sections 22 and 27. He was for a while engaged in land-speculations, and afterwards re turned to his native State, where he remained until 1840. He then settled upon his purchase with his family. He also owned valuable land in St. Joseph County. Mr. Lowe died in 1842. Mrs. Lowe, though lest with a large family and a farm to supervise, overcame all obstacles, and by giv ing her personal efforts to the improvement of the land succeeded in rendering it very productive. reside upon the land he originally purchased. Among those who came at a later date and have aided greatly in the advancement of the township, though not among its pioneers, may be mentioned the following : Charles Wilson, a former resident of Rochester, arrived in the county in 1838, but did not purchase land until 1852, when he secured a farm embracing portions of sec tions 9, 10, 15, and 16, which had been owned by Justin Ely. From Wayne Co., N. Y., came William Pullen in 1837, who remained one year in the village and then purchased 240 acres on sections 24 and 25, upon which he settled. While in the village he prepared a house of planks ready for erection, which he removed with a team to its destina tion (although there was no road but an Indian trail), where it was speedily put up. Twenty-two acres were chopped over the first year, but the brush was so green that it would not burn. Mr. Pullen, however, made a vir tue of necessity, and planted potatoes and corn among the logs and bushes, obtaining a very respectable crop. Mr. Pullen's house afforded an early resort for the children, who availed themselves of the instruction of Miss Harriet Blackman, who taught at the early age of fourteen years. The same year came Allen Wood, who had arrived in the village three years previous, from Monroe County. He purchased 80 acres and built a house, but it was not until two years later that he became a permanent resident. In 1869 he removed to the village, where he now resides. Gustav Maskey is a native of Prussia, but came to this country in 1852, making his way directly to Michigan, where he has since resided. He located upon 80 acres on section 26, now within the village limits. George E. Jewett came originally from Maine, and located at Saugatuck, where he remained several years. In 1853 he purchased 320 acres on section 8, in Saugatuck, a portion of which he afterwards sold to his brother, Na- thaniel Jewett, leaving 200 acres, which he now owns."], [201, "ALLEGAN TOWNSHIP. 177 Alanson Lilly came from Ohio in 1853, and purchased a farm on section 16. Although his arrival occurred at a comparatively late period, the land he purchased and that immediately surrounding it was still an unbroken forest. He began the labor of clearing at once, and very soon had the larger portion of it under cultivation. commissioners, by William Forbes, county surveyor, on the 6th and 7th days of March, 1838. A road was next surveyed leading from the village of Allegan to the village of Edwardsburg, Cass Co., Mich. The survey was made on the 25th of November, 1837, by H. P. Bamum. From this time roads were surveyed as settlers appeared and the demand for them increased. Philip Vahue was a pioneer from Cattaraugus Co., N. Y., and located in this township in 1854. With him came 0. G. and C. S. Vahue. All three settled on sections 8 and 9. Watson Brown moved from Massachusetts in 1848, and purchased 80 acres on section 24, which he made his permanent home. SCHOOLS. A school was taught in the township before the erection of a school building, at the house of Chester Wetmore, on section 21, the earliest teacher being his daughter, Miss Olivia W. Wetmore. Meanwhile, Mr. Wetmore had erected a new barn, which, being spacious and clean, was devoted for a time to the uses of a school. EARLY ROADS. Previous to 1S36 no roads had been surveyed in the township. At the foot of State Street, near the site of the Allegan House, in Allegan village, was a ferry From it, on the opposite side of the river, a rough road had been marked out and partially cleared, which ran to Pine Creek, then to Otsego, and thence to Kalamazoo. This road had not been surveyed, and could be regarded as little else than a mere track. In 1841 the first school-house in the township, outside of the village, was built on the Dickenson farm, on section 21 ; the school being taught by the lady before mentioned, and her earliest pupils being Joseph H. Wetmore, Rhoda M. Wetmore, Albert D. Wetmore, Lucy J. Wetmore, Wil liam A. Bliss, Henry Bliss, and Chester Ross. The first school district in the township was organized in 1836. Others soon after followed, until the territory is now divided into seven whole and four fractional districts. The directors of the various districts are H. H. Pope, Winslow Feek, Brewster Peabody, Lewis Blaisdell, W. 0. Hudson, Sylvester Campbell, Emerson Allen, and J. B. Adams, the village being included in the school report of the township. The whole number of children receiving in struction is 897, of whom 35 are non-resident pupils. Three male and 23 female teachers are employed, to whom the total amount in salaries paid is $4861.20. Eight school buildings adorn the township, three of which are built of brick, and the total value of school property in Allegan is $24,650. The earliest legal road was surveyed by Flavius J. Lit tlejohn in September, 1836, and is described as a public road leading from the village and county of Allegan south easterly to the village and county of Kalamazoo, in Michi gan. It followed substantially the course of the road above described, the record showing the following courses and distances : \"Beginning at a stake near high-water mark in the centre, and at the foot of State Street, in the village of Allegan ; thence south across the Kalamazoo River to a stake on the south bank thereof, the same being north 54 degrees west and 42 links distant from a beech-tree, marked as a witness-tree, and also south 73 degrees 30 minutes west, distant from an oak-tree marked as a witness-tree; thence south 14 degrees 30 minutes east 5 chains 10 links to a stake north 60 degrees east and 12 links distant from a maple-tree marked as a witness-tree; thence south 50 degrees east 94 chains 68 links, to a pine-tree marked with a blaze, three hacks, and a cross, as a sight-tree ; thence south 67 degrees 45 minutes east 184 chains 87 links, to a stake north 31 degrees west of and 21 links distant from a maple witness-tree, and also north 24 degrees east of and 25 links distant from a maple wit ness-tree; thence south 60 degrees 30 minutes east 46 chains, to a stake upon the east line of township 1 north, of range 13 west, 21 chains from the southeast corner of section line of said town, and 97 links north of a marked tree on said section line. Note. \u2014 The above courses are given after allowing 4 degrees 30 minutes for the variation of the needle.\" BURIAL-PLACES. The largest of the township cemeteries is located within the limits of the village. One and a half acres of land, situated on the north half of the southwest quarter of sec tion 29, was early donated by Alexander L. Ely as a burial place, with the stipulation that a lot be reserved for the interments of his family. When it ceased to be used for this purpose, by the terms of the bequest the remains of himself and his family were to be exhumed and the lot was to revert to his heirs. An effort was made in 1869 to remove the burial-ground to section 32, where 40 acres had been purchased for the purpose. On an examination of the terms of Mr. Ely's bequest, the project was found to be impracticable, and the land purchased was disposed of for agricultural purposes. Six acres adjoining the old cemetery was then secured from W. B. Williams in 1873, and added to the original tract. This not only affords additional space, but contributes greatly to the attractiveness of the spot. The commissioners of highways at this time were Enoch S. Baker, Elisha Moody, and Elisha Ely. The second road in the township was also surveyed by F. J. Littlejohn, and is described as \" a State road from the county-seat of Allegan County to the county-seat of Van Bureu County (Paw Paw), in the State of Michigan,\" the portion running through Allegan township only having been recorded. It was surveyed in March, 1837. A half acre of ground was purchased Aug. 30, 1847, described as lying on the road known as the Miner road, running east from the Grand River road to the township of Watson, being on the north side of the northwest quarter of section 22, and being about 60 rods east of the Grand River road. This ground was deeded by Gerry Pardec to The next road was known as the Pine Creek road, and was surveyed July, 1837, probably by the same person, under the direction of John Billings, George Y. Warner, and F. J. Littlejohn, commissioners of highways. A portion of the road was discontinued, as may be seen by reference to a profile of a road-survey, by order of the 23"], [202, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 178 B. L. Griswold, R.

By an act of the territorial council of 1833, the territory of the county of Allegan was constituted the township of Allegan, and attached to Kalamazoo County for judicial and legal purposes.* By an act of the State Legislature of 1836, those townships situated in ranges 13 and 14, Al legan County, were constituted the township of Allegan, em bracing in all eight survey-townships of that time and eight civil townships of the present day, \u2014 namely, Trowbridge, Allegan, Monterey, Salem, Cheshire, Pine Plains, Heath, and Overisel. Various portions were successively set off from Allegan until that township was reduced to its present limit of six miles square. At the first town-meeting after the division, held pursu ant to notice in the village of Allegan, in April, 1836, Joseph Fisk was chosen moderator, Joseph Allen and Elisha Moody were made clerks, and the following officers were elected : Supervisor, Alexander L.

CASCO.* The north and middle branches of Black River, flowing from the north and east to section 31, there join in form ing the main stream, but neither affords any very desirable water-power. Both, however, are of ample volume to serve the demands of lumbermen in log-running, and the north branch was some years ago navigated by keel-boats to a point about niue miles above South Haven. Along the lake-shore the land generally rises in high, abrupt bluffs, and presents a picturesque front to travelers on passing vessels. The lake-shore region is, of course, the favorite fruit-growing district, and the southwestern portion of the township resembles a vast peach-orchard. South Haven is the principal market, and the chief place for shipping fruit, although in the eastern part qf the township the Chicago Casco, -the southwestern township of Allegan County, includes survey-township No. 1 north, in range 16 west, and the fractional township No. 1, in range 17, containing in all nearly 40 full sections. On the north is the town ship of Ganges, on the south the Van Buren county-line, on the east the township of Lee, and on the west the waters of Lake Michigan. Casco holds a prominent place among the fruit-growing towns of Western Michigan, and in the culture of peaches especially is making very rapid advances. With an as sessed valuation in 1879 of $285,000, the township then rauked next after Saugatuck and Fillmore in that particular. * By David Schwartz.

His house was a halting-place for all who journeyed that way, and served many a weary traveler as a welcome place of entertainment. Although McDowell brought his family to Casco by land, he sent his household goods by lake to Saugatuck, whence they were conveyed, in charge of Alexander Henderson, to McDowell's landing pla\u0153in a scow, which was towed along the lake-shore by men walking on the beach. John Thayer built a cabin on section 2, and brought his family in shortly after the McDowells made their settle ment. With him also lived James Donnelly, who became a settler upon a 10-acre tract which he bought of Thayer. Ofletus, one of the sons of John Thayer, who was the first person to be married in the township, took for a wife Clarissa, a daughter of James W. Wadsworth, of Ganges. Their daughter, Eutheria, now a resident of Wisconsin, was the firsts white child born in the township, and Mrs. Hayes, and West Michigan Railway receives much freight from this source. On the 17th of May, 1869, the town agreed by a vote of 113 to 103 to raise $5000 in aid of the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad, but at a subsequent meeting recon sidered and defeated the resolution. On the 25th of Oc tober, 1869, a resolution to aid the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad was defeated by a vote of 109 to 2. Two attempts to raise money for the erection of a town house have also met with failure. Casco has no village, but has two post-offices, one church edifice, and three others in process of erection. THE EARLY COMERS IN CASCO. Until the autumn of 1844 the township of Casco had not heard the ring of the pioneer's axe, and until the spring of 1845 had received no permanent white settlers. It was John Thayer and his two sons who led the way in the peaceful invasion of Casco, and it was upon section 2, where Thayer had bought land, that they first made a clearing, in the fall of 1844. While engaged in this work they made their home at Levi Loomis', in Ganges, where Thayer's family abided until the summer of 1845. the mother of Mrs. John Thayer, was the first white per son who died in the same territory. She was buried on Mr. Thayer's farm, where her remains rest to this day. The McDowells and Thayers remained for five years the only white families resident in Casco. H. J. Cox, who now lives upon section 6, was a young unmarried man when he came to Casco, in 1845, to work for Mr. McDowell, and, although he continued to live in the neighborhood, he could hardly be called a permanent resident until several years afterwards. The next comer was Garret Updike, who made his appearance in 1850 ; following him were the Shcffers, Mungers, Hollisters, L. D. Cook, Joseph Dow, W. W. Ock ford, M. F. Rose, J. Emmons, W. P. Davis, Ezra Brown, the Bardens, E. H. McLouth, the Thomas brothers, D. H. Cady, the Beeds, Crosby Eaton, A. B. Avery, John Flint, the Buys, John Faben, Thomas Idelles, R. Bowles, W. Crates, the Hamlins, L. W. Osborn, and Andrew Brown, all of whom settled in the township between 1850 and In April, 1845, before the Thayers had taken up their residence in the township, Mortimer McDowell aud William B. Reynolds came in and began at once to make a clearing on section 18. Timothy McDowell, a resident of Western New York, had bought 320 acres of land in Casco, and had sent his son Mortimer and his brother-in-law Rey nolds out to put up a cabin and make a small clearing pre paratory to the coming of the rest of the family. While doing this, Reynolds and young McDowell lived at A. N. Crawford's house, in Ganges, walking thither every night aud back the next morning. By June they had put up a cabin and cut up the timber on half an acre of land, and on the 17th of that month Timothy McDowell, with his wife and three\" children, having come by wagon from their New York home, appeared and took possession of their new abode, thus becoming the first actual residents of the township of Casco. 1860. In the year 1850, Clark M. Sheffer bought a tract of land on section 36, in fractional township 1, range 17, but did not make a permanent settlement there until 1852, al though he lived there in a shanty and peeled considerable bark. Reynolds, after thus assisting in giving the McDowells a good start, went to Kalamazoo and engaged in railroad work. He died in Minnesota in 1879. Mortimer Mc- Dowell still lives in Casco, as does his mother. His father, who was Casco's first supervisor, and who, during his sub sequent life, was a prominent citizen of the township, died in 1876. In 1851, Joseph Dow, who had been living a year at South Haven, came with his son to a place on the same section, which he had bought of J. C. Hale, erected a log cabin, and began to make a clearing. To get nails for the construction of his cabin Dow had to send to Paw Paw, near thirty miles distant. As to roads, there was a toler able highway northward to McDowell's (his nearest neigh bor in that direction) ; the one leading to South Haven was a mere path marked by blazed trees. It was not until some years afterwards that the lake-shore road southward from Mr. Dow's place was made a deceut thoroughfare. When Mr. McDowell came West he brought a pair of fine horses, which he expected to use on his farm, but a survey of the wild country to which he had come quickly satisfied him that his horses would be sadly out of place, and he accordingly exchanged them for a yoke of cattle. In a country where there were no roads horses and wagons were almost useless property, but oxen were nearly invalu- In 1852, Mr. Dow brought the rest of his family to his home in the woods, and in the same year Clark M. Sheffer and his brother, S. G. Sheffer, made permanent settlements close at hand. East of these there was then nobody in the township save Smith and Thayer, on sections 1 and 2. The nearest places for the settlers of Casco to go to mill were Lawrence aud Allegan, and both were so far away that a able. Not long after Mr. McDowell came the lake-shore road was opened between his house and Saugatuck, but south from his place the lake-beach was the only highway as far even as St. Joseph. In front of his residence a ravine led to the lake-shore, and of that ravine McDowell made a"], [207, "Residence of the Utc IS. U N DERM A N , Casco, Auegan Ce Mich"], [208, ""], [209, "CASCO TOWNSHIP 181 journey to either was always regarded as a most unpleasant task. came hither in 1802 from Otsego, and settled upon a tract of new land previously owned by Linus Bathrick. Amoug the later comers on the lake-shore may be mentioned J. J. Goodemote, T. A. Bixby, M. H. Bixby, D. E. Histed, C. H. Wigglesworth, H. Griffin, A. D. Healy, H. W. Bishop, E. D. Farnum, H. J. Lindeman, Charles Johnson, Wil liam Carter, Daniel Lutz, and N. D. Fitch. The woods were so dense that one of Dow's sons, who had gone but a short distance from the house after a pail of water, completely lost his bearings while watching the movements of some deer which had come near him. When he recognized the fact that he was lost, he climbed a tree and tried to \" look out,\" but the attempt was a failure. After a time his brothers missed him and went to seek him, finding him only after a protracted search. The first burials on the lake-shore were made in family lots. William Darling laid out the cemetery on section 18. John McDowell, who died a prisoner at Andersonville, built the fence, and, in view of the few deaths with which the town had been afflicted, he was led to remark, \" I guess we'll have to kill somebody to start this graveyard.\" The Dow boys used to take firewood home along the lake-shore in a scow, towing the vessel by means of a horse on the beach. One day, however, a sudden squall of wind swamped the scow, set the cargo afloat, and came near pulling the horse into the lake. That ended the business of \" towing on the lake.\" EASTERN CASCO. The whole eastern part of the township was exceedingly backward in the matter of settlement, and not until about 1865 did the pioneers take hold of that portion with a will. Thenceforward, however, that section was rapidly peopled, and, although there is yet some uncultivated land there, the tract is generally well improved, and is highly valued as a farming district. There were originally large tracts of pine and hemlock timber, and some swamp land in that region which repelled settlers and retarded the progress of the town. At length, however, a few sanguine pioneers located themselves on the tract in question, reclaimed the lowlands, and soon proved that no part of the township offered better inducements to the farmer than existed there. They quickly received accessions to their numbers, and ere long the sec tion which had been called the poorest in the township was known as one of the most valuable. The next settlers on the lake-shore after Dow and the Sheffers were L. D. Cook and Andrew Hollister, who lo cated themselves, in 1852, on section 24, in range 17. At that time there was a stage-route between South Haven and Saugatuck, which went along the beach from the former place to McDowell's, and then followed the lake-shore road. The stage-driver was John H. Billings, an early settler in the town of Ganges, and for many years a well known knight of the whip in the western part of Allegan County. In 1852, Sylvester Munger and F. L. Hollister came into the township, and in 1853 W. W. Ockford and M. F. Rose. The year 1854 brought among others J. Emmons and W. P. Davis, and in 1855 Richard Barden, a Kala mazoo pioneer of 1837, joined the Casco settlement, locating himself upon section 8, where he now resides. The land was entirely in a state of nature, and the east-and-west road which now passes his place was only underbrushed. The only settler between Mr. Barden's farm and the lake was Eli Weind, who lived upon the farm now occupied by S. H. Hamlin, with whom Mr. Barden and his family re sided until his own necessary improvements were completed. E. H. McLouth and Levi Thomas also came in 1855, as did Reuben and J. B. Thomas ; D. H. Cady in 1856, and J. V. Sheffer and S. and A. Reed in 1857. When Crosby Eaton (now representing his district in the Legislature) came to Casco from Massachusetts, in 1858, and located on section 5. in range 17, there was no one south of him to the couuty-line. In 1858, too, John Flint, a Kalamazoo County pioneer of 1836, and a merchant in Galesburg for fourteen years, bought the Earl mill, on section 9, and car ried it on several years. Among the other settlers of 1858 were Cornelius Buys and his brother; and among those of 1859, L. W. Osborn and Reuben Walker. In 1S60 ad ditions to the settlement were made in the persons of An drew J. Munger, N. Q. Munger, S. H. Hamlin, S. M. Hamlin, and others. N. Q. Munger says that the lake shore region was pretty wild even when he came in. He lived with his family the first winter of his stay in the barn of his brother Sylvester, and when he built his cabin he could not find a clear spot large enough to put it on without cutting down a few trees. He says it was a common thing for him to shoot deer from his cabin door. As an illustration of the esteem in which Eastern Casco was held only a little over twenty years ago, Thomas Idelles, who located there late in 1858, says that en route from Saugatuck to his new home he stopped at a settler's house to rest, and upon indicating his destination was cheered by his host's exclaiming that if he went there and stayed he would starve, \" as sure as preaching.\" Mr. Idelles made his settlement in October, 1858, upon 80 acres in section 12 that he had bought of David Gideon, a land-speculator living in Wisconsin. On section 2 Idelles found John Thayer, with whom he lived until his own cabin was put up. On section 12 he found John Faben, who had effected his settlement in 1856. On section 1 were James Smith and Ezra D. Brown, but on sections 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, and 14 there had been no move made towards settlement. George Crates, on section 36, was the solitary settler in the southeast portion of the town. South of Idelles, in 1858, to the county-line and west to the centre of the township, the only settlers were George Crates, E. V. Bodfish, and James Emmonds. Ezra D. Brown, already mentioned, served through the war of 1812, and in 1S54 located the land-warrant which he had received for his services on a quarter of section 1 in Casco. His widow, now living in Casco, says that except John Thayer they had no white neighbors nearer than five miles, their nearest being the McDowells and Crawfords. \" There were indeed Indians and wolves for neighbors,\" she continued, in her remarks to the writer, \" and the wolves especially were so neighborly that they never let a night H.

Johnston, now living on section 16, made a settlement there. Samuel Clover was also on section 14, and in 1865 Jacob Berry (who came to Michigan in 1856) located on section 22. In that year, also, William M. Ruel and George Whitney became settlers on section 14. In 1866 came W. L. Zook, in 1867 J. Cady and Peter Black, and in 1868 Henry Dow and L. A. Spencer. S. W.

In 1860, Isaac Stelar came in to make a settlement on section 26. While building a cabin, he lived, with his family, beneath the shelter of a bark roof put up against a log. In 1860, Henry Overhiser came to Michigan from Indiana, and in March, 1861, located himself upon 40 acres on section 1, which he had bought of W. W. Ockford, a previous settler on section 16. At that time the settlers in Eastern Casco included James Smith and E. D. Brown, on section 1 ; John Faben and Thomas Idelles, on section 12; Thomas H. Janes and James Carthrop, on section 11 ; John Thayer and his two sons, on section 2 ; Isaac Stelar, on section 26 ; Daniel Matthews, on section 35 ; and John Brewer, on section 36. There was no settler on sections 14, 23, 24, or 25. In March, 1864, Overhiser moved to his present location, on section 14, at which time the only road near him was the north-and-south road passing by his land, and that was only underbrushed. TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION. Casco was a portion of Ganges until 1854, when it was set off under its present name, Timothy McDowell, E. K. McLouth, and S. G. Sheffer being appointed a board to preside at the first town-meeting. John Thayer suggested the name of Cornfield for the new town, because he thought the country a great corn-growing district. Others suggested Wheatland, and still others Winfield (in honor of Gen. Scott), while L. D. Cook, a warm admirer of Lewis Cass, wanted to call the new township by his uame. \" Political feeling,\" says Mr. Cook, \" prevented the honoring of Gen. Cass in that way, but I was bound to preserve a portion of the name anyhow, and so I prevailed on the people to name the township Casco.\" In 1861 a road was cut out through sections 1 and 2, but between sections 1 and 36 the territory was entirely unprovided with a highway, except an underbrushed road through sections 11 and 12. Whenever a settler started on a journey with his ox-team, before the war, he always carried an axe with him, aud expected to clear his owu way as a matter of course. The township records were entirely destroyed in 1869 by the fire which burned Linus Bathrick's house, and none of the details regarding township business previous to that time can be obtained. The names of the supervisors can, however, be given from 1855, and are as follows: One of the early grist-mills owned by John Faben con sisted simply of a hemlock-log mortar and a spring-pole pestle, but settlers were glad to use it, as it saved them a trip of 20 miles to Allegan. The first year of his settle ment Mr. Idelles bought Indian corn of Messrs. McDowell & Barden and had it pounded at Faben's mill, but when his own corn began to grow he improvised a still cheaper mill by perforating a tin pan, and then he and his family regaled themselves on bread made of grated green coru. 1855, Timothy McDowell; 1856, Richard Barden ; 1857-59, William P. Davis; 1860, Crosby Eaton; 1861, William P. Davis; 1862 -63, John Willett; 1864, A. J. Munger; 1865-68, Crosby Eaton. The following persons served the township from 1869 to 1880 as supervisor, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace : Indians were plentiful in Eastern Casco even as late as 1858, their favorite camping-grounds being near the big springs on sections 11 and 22. Hunting, fishing, and trading with the whites employed their time, and, although averse to work, they were seldom beggars. Seott Lake, in Lee township, was the most popular fishing-place. They remained in the vicinity until 1861, when they passed away from the neighborhood. SUPERVISORS. 1869-76, Crosby Eaton; 1877-78, II. Overhiser; 1879, M. Bugden.

To show what some settlers had to begin on, it may be told of Henry Overhiser that when he bought his land on section 1 he turned his horse, harness, and saddle in as part payment on it, and then, with nothing left to him in the way of capital but his bare hands, he managed to clear his land by logging for others, giving two days of his own work for one of a man with a team. JUSTICES. 1869, S.G. Sheffer; 1870, Thomas Idelles; 1871, S. M. Hamlin ; 1872, G. W. Spencer; 1873, J. G. Potter; 1874, Thomas Idelles; 1875, Joseph Snyder; 1876, T. W. Brainard; 1877, E. D. Farnuni ; 1878, J. S. Marr; 1879, W. A. Webster. The votes cast at the election in 1869 were 103; in 1870 there were 208, and in 1875 they reached 241. The cemetery on section 2 was laid out in 1859. The first tombstone placed in it was erected over the grave of Henry Overhiser's son. In the spring of 1861 the wife of James Carthrop died, and those who recollect the event say there was not a horse-team at the funeral, for the simple reason that there was not one in the township, or at least in that part of it.

David Flora's steam saw-mill on section 13 has been doing a good business for six or eight years, and on section 16 William Hawkhead's steam grist-mill is a great local con venience. CHURCHES. In the earlier days of Casco religious worship was en joyed by the pioneers either in South Haven or Ganges (at Packard's Corners). In the eastern part of the township meetings were held in a log school-house, after 1859, by Free-Will Baptists and Adventists. Prayer-meetings were frequent, but it was only on rare occasions that a preacher happened out that way. Linus Bathrick, a Methodist local preacher, was the first of that denomination to hold services in that quarter. A union Sunday-school was or ganized in the Idelles school-house in 1861, through the efforts of John Thayer, and since that time it has been regularly maintained. Since 1877 Henry Overhiser has been the superintendent. The average attendance is 48. A United Brethren class was organized in the Idelles school house in 1865, with 7 members, and for a few years in creased largely in strength. Thomas H. Janes was the first class-leader, and Rev. Mr. Balding the first pastor. Towards 1875 the membership became so reduced that the class was dissolved. One of the most direful calamities ever known in the western part of Allegan County was the burning, in Feb ruary, 1869, of the three children of Linus Bathrick, of Casco. Mr. Bathrick, who was a Methodist exhorter, went with his wife one evening to a prayer-meeting some miles away from his home, leaving in the house his three young children, the oldest of whom, ten years of age, was idiotic. She was confined to a sofa ; the others were put to bed. The household lamp was left burning, and the door was locked. During the absence of the parents the house took fire (no one knew how), and the sleeping itinocents were all burned to death. The awful tragedy caused a gloomy sen sation throughout the county, and in Casco is yet a fresh and mournful incident of local history. It was at that fire, too, that the township records were destroyed ; Bathrick being the township clerk. EAST CASCO METHODIST CLASS. Immediately after that event a Methodist class was or ganized in the Berry school-house with 6 members : Lonson Overhiser, Herrenia Overhiser, Wilson Rozel, Corisande Bailey, Oscar M. Frude, and Alonzo Herrington. Lonson Overhiser was chosen the first class-leader, and still serves as such. The class, now including 12 members, worships in the Idelles school-house, but will late in the summer oc cupy a church edifice now in process of erection opposite the hall of the East Casco Grange. Although to be called a Methodist church, this edifice will be built by contribu tions from members of other denominations, and will be free to all desiring to use it for evangelical worship. The stewards of the class are W. W. Johnston and A. G. Pease. In 1862 a man named Patterson, living on section 20, was killed by the caving in of the earth while digging a well on his place, and in 1870 William Fox lost his life in a similar manner while digging a well for William Hada way. Hadaway himself was killed three years afterwards by the fall of a tree. FOREST FIRES. The forest conflagrations which in the fall of 1871 raged fiercely through Allegan County worked much destruction in Casco. Timber, fences, and even sheep, were burned up, while the occasional destruction of a house or barn in creased general dismay. \" Fighting fire\" was for many a weary day the only occupation thought of, and indeed the only means by which hundreds of homes were saved from the flames. Many people buried their valuables and other goods in the ground, fearing the country was doomed to destruction, and the excitement, as may be imagined, mounted to fever-heat. The charred forests still tell the story of the great fires, while those who participated in the events of that time preserve the most vivid recollections of the ex citing contest with the flames. A UNITED BRETHREN CLASS. Another class of United Brethren was formed in the Buys school-house, Dec. 10, 1865, by Rev. S. C. Buck, with a membership of 22. Austin Hamner was chosen the first class-leader, but was succeeded in a short time by John Patterson. The first steward, according to the records, was Elisha Fields, who was elected Feb. 18, 1866. Before the organization Rev. Mr. Balding used to preach to the United Brethren of the vicinity. The first pastor of the class was Rev. S. C. Buck, who was succeeded by Eev. Robert Linn, but in 1873 returned for a second term. Rev. R.'H. Watson, who was Mr. Linn's successor, was followed by Rev. J. W. De Long, the present pastor. The mem bership is 38, the class-leader is James Barden, the steward is Henry Ridley, and the trustees are Henry Overhiser, George Bowles, and Samuel Hadaway. The class is in the Ganges Circuit, which includes also two classes in Ganges and one in Cheshire. Meetings are now held in the Hada- MILLS. Stephen Earl put up a saw-mill on section 9 in 1858, but almost immediately sold the property to John Flint and Daniel Harris. There was then considerable pine, hemlock, and whitewood timber in that vicinity, and for six years the mill did a flourishing business. Aster that it passed into the possession of J. D. Clute & Co., for whom L. C. Manning acted as manager. At a later period they erected a grist-mill with two run of stone, beside the saw-mill.

This class was organized in the McDowell school-house in the fall of 1865 by Rev. William Paddock. The first members were W. W. Sly (Class-Leader), H. A. Fowler, (Steward), Mrs. H. A. Fowler, A. J. Munger (Steward), Mrs. A. J. Munger, Henry Patterson and wife, Mrs. W. W. Sly, C. H. Hamlin and wife, Linus Bathrick and wife, and Elizabeth Barden. Among the pastors have been Rev. Messrs.

Carel, of South Haven, who preaches once a fortnight to the West Casco class. The membership is now 31. The stewards are H. A. Fowler and A. J. Munger; the trustees are A. J. Munger, L. W. Osborn, and H. A. Fowler. G. Plummer, T. J. Royal, Reuben Hodson, L. C. Seymour, L. C. Cady, James Usher, J. W. Chase, C. S. York, and S. B. Phelps. FRUIT-FARMING. Casco has been and is making rapid strides forward as a peach-growing township, and, although there are in the town no such mammoth peach-orchards as those of R. M. Moore and Williams & Son, of Saugatuck, there are quite a number containing each from 2000 to 2500 trees. Of course the peach district is adjacent to the lake-shore, and in the southwestern corner of the town the cultivation of that fruit is almost the exclusive industry. The limits of peach-culture iu Casco can scarcely be fixed, since the busi ness is yet in its early growth, but it is certain that it must speedily become very extensive. THE CHURCH OF GOD. This body was organized in March, 1874, in the Buys school-house, by Elder B. D. Bright. The first members were Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester Munger, Mr. and Mrs. James Fiteh, Mrs. Burroughs, Mr. and Mrs. Levi Thomas, and Mr. Manning. Sylvester Munger and Mr. Manning were chosen the first deacons. Elder Bright preached until 1878, when he was succeeded by the present minister, Elder Jasper Moffat. The church membership now num bers 30. The deacon is Albert Updike, and the ruling elders are Charles Willett and Levi Thomas. Preaching is at present enjoyed once a fortnight. The congregation worships in a church edifice which was built in 1874, directly after the organization. Among the prominent peach-growers may bo mentioned Histed & Wigglesworth, Mrs. J. S. Lindeman, H. A. Fowler, T. A. Bixby, M. H. Bixby, Mortimer McDowell, J. J. Goodemote, Clark M. Sheffer, A. D. Healy, L. W. Osborn, S. H. Hamlin, and J. V. Sheffer. It was only eleven years ago that the cultivation of peaches in Casco for shipment first began to be thought of. Iu the season of 1879 thousands of bushels were shipped to Chicago and other markets, and the indications promise that the shipments of 1880 will exhibit an increase of 100 per cent, over those of 1879. EAST CASCO GRANGE, No. 338. SCHOOLS. This grange was organized on the 16th day of March, 1874, with about 40 members, and in the fall of that year a grange hall was built on section 15. The first officers were as follows: Alva Cady, M. ; C. O. Wood, O. ; Jesse D. Chaplin, L. ; W. W. Johnston, Chap. ; L. A. Spencer, Sec. ; Marshall Bugden, Treas. The membership is now 48, and the officers are as follows: C. O. Wood, M.; James Bailey, O. ; L. A. Spencer, L. ; Mrs. Marshall Bugden, Chap. ; J. Cady, Sec. ; Robert Adkin, Treas. ; Joseph Bailey, Steward ; Edward Haggar, Asst. Steward ; Warren Ockford, Gatekeeper; Miss Nancy Overhiser, Ceres; Miss Katie Pease, Pomona ; Miss Emma Morrison, Flora ; Mrs. Warren Ockford, Stewardess. In 1849, Mary Platt, of Ganges, taught a school in that town, near Mr. Crawford's, whither Mr. McDowell used to send his children. That school lasted but three weeks, and then Mr. McDowell engaged Miss Platt to teach his chil dren at his house. After Garret Updike came, in 1850, his children also went to school at McDowell's to Miss Platt, who taught there during the winters of 1849 and 1850. In 1851 the first school-house in the township was built on the place now occupied by N. Q. Munger, the first teacher there being Austin Collins, the second Miss Laura Gardner, and the third Bliss Susan McDowell, now Mrs. William Plummer. A log school-house was built on sec tion 11 in 1859, and in the winter of 1860 and 1861 Charles Emerson taught the school there. Scholars were so few that it was the exception and not the rule when Mr. Emerson had any in attendance. He would often call school in the morning when none would be there to hear him. In that case he would busy himself until noon in clearing land near the school-house, which belonged to him. If no pupils appeared at noon, he would devote the afternoon to the same work. In that way he chopped four acres while waiting for scholars who wouldn't come. MICHIGAN LAKE-SHORE GRANGE, No. 407. This organization was formed in April, 1874, with a membership of 70, at Richards' Hall on the lake-shore, which, although still the place of meeting, is likely to be soon replaced by a grange hall. Of the first officers chosen L. W. Osborn was M.; C. F. Cook, O. ; Hamilton Pat terson, Chap. ; Albert Seymour, Sec. ; Mortimer Mc- Dowell, Treas. The membership on the 1st of March, 1880, was 65, and the officers: W. A. Webster, M. ; W. G. Plummer, O. ; S. M. Hamlin, L. ; German Richards, Chap. ; C. A. Seymour, Sec. ; E. E.

Mr. and Mrs. McDowell were the parents of six children, the eldest having died at the age of seven, and the youngest at the age of ten months. These little ones were buried in Chautauqua Co., N. Y. Two sons, John and Warren, died after reaching mature years, the former having fallen a victim to the horrors of Andersonville prison. Mr. McDowell's death occurred at his home in Casco, Feb. 5, 1877. He was one of the most influ ential and affluent residents of the township, and had been for years a director of the South Haven First National Bank. Aside from his high char acter as a business man, he was an exemplary and esteemed citizen. This gentleman may with truth be spoken of as one of the most enterprising of the pioneers of Casco. His birth occurred in Oneida Co., N. Y., in 1801, and was of excellent New England extraction. He was married in 1825 to Miss Emeline Rey nolds, at Lockport, N. Y. During the year 1845 both he and his wife became interested in the new country in the West, which resulted in their removal to the present township of Casco, Mich. The family of Mr. McDowell were the earliest settlers within its boundaries. No pioneer had yet entered its dense forests, and no post-office nearer than Saugatuck was accessible. To reach this point required a journey of fifteen miles. Mr. McDowell brought much energy to bear in the pioneer labor that awaited him, and ultimately had the gratification of seeing luxu-"], [216, ""], [217, ""], [218, "Residence of H EN RY OVERH I SER, ESQ ., C a-sco Ik.

For twelve terms he has been supervisor, for six years superin tendent of schools, and for two successive terms representa tive in the State Legislature. The latter election was es pecially complimentary to his character as a citizen. Mr. Eaton has been twice married, \u2014 in July, 1851, to Miss Ellen M. Woodman, of Auburn, Me., and in No vember, 1855, to Miss Sarah J. Wilson, of Calais, Me. POST-OFFICES Casco's first post-office was established on the lake-shore in 1856, being called New Casco. Upon the removal of that office in 1861 to Ganges. Timothy McDowell obtained the establishment of another post-office in the township, called West Casco, and was himself appointed postmaster. He was succeeded, in February, 1871, by N. Q. Munger, whose successor was J. S. Richards, the present occupant of the office. Spring Grove post-office, on section 3, was established in the spring of 1878, with Sanborn Marr as postmaster, and still remains in his charge. The mails are brought to both offices three times a week. REV. CHARLES JOHNSON The subject of this sketch was born in Lincolnshire, England, in 1825, and in early life emigrated to Michigan, which with brief exceptions has been his home ever since. He passed the years of his minority on a farm in Genesee County, but, as the pioneer life of those days afforded very limited facilities for mental improvement, on reaching his majority he went to Ohio, and spent several years in edu cational pursuits, teaching a portion of the time in that BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. State and Kentucky. Returning to Michigan, he again engaged in teaching at Flint, Fenton, Saginaw, and Milford. At the latter place he also became pastor of the Baptist Church, in connection with his charge of the Union School. This continued several years, when he resigned both po sitions to become teacher in the State Reform School at Lansing. After three and a half years spent in that work he became pastor of the Baptist Church at Flint, but again returned in the early part of 1867 to become superinten- dent of the Reform School, and remained at Lansing that position till the spring of 1875, when he spent the summer at Lakeside Fruit Farm, his present home. In the fall of the same year he became superintendent and chaplain of the Iowa Reform School, which position he held till the spring of 1878, when he resigned to be pastor of the Baptist Church of South Haven, in this State, and removed with his family to his farm, which is situated near that village, South Haven being his post-office address. HENRY OVERHISER The father of Mr. Overhiser was a native of New York State, and born in 1804. He early acquired something of a reputation for pedestrian exploits, having frequently walked a distance of three hundred miles. Henry was born Jan. 2, 1835, in Steuben Co., N. Y., and was the sixth in a family of thirteen children. His early life, to the a\"e of nineteen, was spent at home, and at the end of that time he acquired the trade of a carpenter. In Febru ary, 1855, he was married to Miss Sarah McKee, of Black ford Co., Ind., a former resident of Ohio, where she was born in 1836. Her grandfather was an early pioneer of that State, and fell a victim to the brutality of Indians on the Ohio River iu 1811. Henry soon after purchased a portion of his father's farm, and two years later removed to Rush Co., Ind. He made successive removals after this until his final settlement upon his present farm in Casco in 1804. This land was then unimproved and its immediate neighborhood destitute of highways. The ground was, how- HON. CROSBY EATON The father of Mr. Eaton was born in the town of Seabrook, N. H., in July, 1789, and removed with his parents at an early date to the State of Maine, the land on which they lo cated having been at that period wholly destitute of any mark of civilization. Here Crosby was born, Dec. 3, 1823. He exercised his industry upon the farm at an early age, and later taught the district schools of the neighborhood until his twenty-first year, when he migrated to Massachusetts and became overseer in a cotton-mill. He was subsequently employed by Dr. J. C. Ayers & Co. as superintendent of their patent-medicine manufactory. Mr. Eaton in 1858 accomplished what he had previously long desired, \u2014 a resi dence iu Michigan. He purchased a farm in Casco, Mich., which has been devoted to grain and fruit-raising, in which pursuit he has been eminently successful. He is a Repub lican in politics, an active political worker, and has filled 24"], [220, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 186 a home for his mother in Calhoun County, where she still resides, though married a second time. W. M. Ruell was married in June, 1866, to Miss Celia, daughter of David and Nancy James, who was born in Calhoun County, Oct. 14, 1842. They have had three children, \u2014 Frederick James, born May 5, 1870 ; Florence E., whose birth occurred Feb. 1, 1873 ; and Mary F., born Feb. 27, 1877, who died the same year. Mr. Ruell after his marriage sold his property in Calhoun County and removed to the present home in Casco, which embraces one of the most desirable farms in the township, consisting of one hundred and twenty acres under a high state of cultivation, with an orchard of two thousand trees. Mr. Ruell's political predilections were formerly Democratic, though recent events have made him an advocate of the principles of the Greenback party. He is an influential member of the \" grange,\" and has held minor offices in the township, though not ambi tious for such distinctions. With little else than energy and fidelity to duty as his original capital, Mr. Ruell has gained both a competency and an honorable name among his associates. ever, soon cleared and the wilderness transformed to pro ductive fields. Mr. Overhiser is a Republican in politics, having cast his first vote for Abraham Lincoln. He has filled the offices of supervisor and treasurer with acceptance, having been elected to the latter office ten successive years. Both Mr. and Mrs. Overhiser are members of the Church of the United Brethren, though kindly disposed towards other orthodox denominations. Eight children have been born to them, in the following order : Lonson M., Nov. 9, 1855; William A., Jan. 11, 1857; Olive J., April 26, 1859 ; Ida May, Oct. 13, 1861 ; George G., Dec. 14, 1864 ; Charles H., Jan. 1, 1867 ; Mary Ann, Oct. 19, 1869 ; and Minnie B., April 22, 1874. Of this number but one is deceased, George G., whose death occurred Sept. 14, 1866. THOMPSON A. BIXBY. Mr. Bixby may recur with commendable pride to his New England origin. The Green Mountain State had for years been the home of the Bixby family, and Guilford, Wiodham Co., the birthplace of members of the present branch. Thompson A. Bixby was the eldest in a family of five children, and was born Oct. 26, 1836. His early years were spent with his father, where the intervals of rest after arduous labor were employed in study, attending school at Westminster Seminary, Vt. His thoughts had long been directed towards the West, where he ultimately found a home. A brief time was spent in Kalamazoo, after which, in connection with his brother, he purchased, in the fall of 1866, the present home of sixty acres. It abounded at that time in a luxuriant growth of hemlocks, but has since been converted into a productive fruit farm, upon which peaches are made a specialty. Mr. Bixby was married Dec. 15, 1870, to Miss Sarah Dow, of Casco, who was a native of Connecticut, and born Sept. 27, 1839. Her parents were pioneers to Michigan in 1852, and are still residents of Casco having erected the earliest frame house in the town ship soon after their arrival. Mr. and Mrs. Bixby have had six children, born as follows : Willard J., Aug. 2, 1872, who died Sept. 27, 1872 ; John E. and Josie E., born April 18, 1875; Blanche S., July 15, 1878; and Grace A. and Glen A., July 14, 1879. The mother of Mr. Bixby died in 1849, and in 1873 his father (Ezekiel Bixby) be came a resident of Casco, having been extended a welcome to the cheerful family circle of his son. His death occurred May 21, 1880, aged seventy-four years and eight months. Mr. Bixby is a Democrat in his political preferences, though not an active partisan. ALBERT D. HEALY. Nelson K. Healy, the father of Albert D., was a native of Massachusetts, and became a Michigan pioneer in 1838, coming to the State when twenty years of age, and choos ing Mendon, St. Joseph Co., as a location. The mother was a pioneer of 1835, and a former resident of Pennsyl vania. Mr. and Mrs. Healy were married during the year 1843, and their son, Albert D., was born Oct. 5, 1844, at Mendon. Until his eighteenth year he was a member of the home-circle, where farm labor, varied by attendance at the public school of the neighborhood, occupied his time. He soon after acquired the trade of a painter, and embraced fourteen States in the area over which he followed this vocation. Mr. Healy was married Oct. 16, 1872, to Miss Amanda, daughter of William and Susan Ellis, of Coving ton, Ky., who was the seventh in a family of twelve chil dren. Mr. Ellis was a Virginian by birth, while Mrs. Ellis was a native of Kentucky. Mr. and Mrs. Healy have two daughters,\u2014 Fanny E., born Aug. 1, 1875, and Mina Myr tle, whose birth occurred March 19, 1878. Their residence, a sketch of which is given on an adjoining page, is known as the \" Gothic Ridge\" farm, and embraces thirty-two acres of land. It is devoted principally to the cultivation of choice varieties of fruit, and its proprietor has achieved a reputation as a successful fruit-grower. He has seventeen acres covered by peach-trees, eight hundred and eighty plum-trees, and six acres embracing various other fruits peculiar to the climate. The attractive residence upon this ground was built from designs made by its owner. Mr. Healy's political affinities have been since the beginning Democratic, though his business affairs preclude the possi bility of devoting his time to public interests. W. M. RUELL. The parents of W. M. Ruell were of English birth, his father having left his early home when eighteen years of a\u00bbe. W. M. was the eldest in a family of four children, and was born in Pittsford, Monroe Co., Nov. 22, 1838. He was left fatherless at the tender age of ten years, and at once turned his youthful energies in the direction of labor for the support of the remainder of his family. At the age of seventeen he emigrated to Michigan and purchased ISAAC S. LINDERMAN. Tompkins Co., N. Y., was the scene of Mr. Linderman's birth, which occurred May 23, 1819, his father having"], [221, ""], [222, "&OTHIC RIDGL FRUIT FP A.HEA"], [223, "M\u00bb Casco, Michigan P\u00bbop.?."], [224, ""], [225, "CHESHIRE TOWNSHIP. 187 been Henry Linderman, also a native of New York State, who died in 1856. The mother removed to Illinois, and survived her husband many years. lina. He was again afflicted in the loss of his second wife, who died in September, 1870, leaving two children. In 1872 he was united to Miss Eleanor Holmes, of South Haven, a former resident of Pennsylvania, who has one daughter. Mr. Linderman removed to Casco in 1868, and died Oct. 16, 1878, at his residence in the township. Mrs. Linderman still resides upon the estate, which by the energy of her husband had been converted into a most productive fruit-growing farm. Mr. Linderman's early opportunities were limited, his time having been chiefly occupied in labor. A quick in telligence, however, and keenness of observation compen sated in a great measure for the lack of educational advan tages. He married, when twenty-two years of age, Miss Catherine Smith, of Newfield, N. Y., whose parents were also natives of the Empire State. They had six sons, all, with a single exception, living. Mrs. Linderman died Sept. 20, 1862, and in April, 1864, Mr. Linderman was married to Miss Permclia N. Gregory, whose birthplace was South Caro- Mr. Linderman, though not actively interested in church matters, was inclined towards the creed of the Universalists. He was an exemplary citizen, and enjoyed the esteem of neighbors and friends whose intimate relations afforded them an insight into his manly character. CHESHIRE.\" The township of Cheshire, which comprises survey township No. 1 north, in range 14 west, is located on the south line of the county, which is also the base-line of the United States survey, being bounded on the north by the township of Pine Plains, south by Van Buren County, east by the township of Trowbridge, and west by Lee. Its surface is slightly undulating, with some small hills, but it is almost entirely composed of arable ground. There was formerly considerable swampy land, but most of this has been transformed by the labor of its owners into the most productive portion of the township. The soil may be described as a gravel and clay loam, with a fair proportion of sand in the northern and western portions. Much drainage has been done, and the crops produced by the strong clayey soil bear ample evidence to the value of this species of improvement. In 1873 the number of acres of wheat harvested was 1023, which yielded 10,921 bushels of that grain, while 807 acres, which were planted with corn, produced 33,496 bushels, this crop being in some localities especially prolific. Various other grains are also grown with success. The soil and climate are well adapted to the raising of fruit, which is likely in time to prove one of the most profitable products of the township. All kinds of timber flourish in Cheshire. In the north part beech and maple timber abounds, the trees attaining large size, while else where the ground was originally shaded by an ample growth of basswood, oak, walnut, butternut, elm, and ash. The pine is of good quality, and has always been in much demand. In the low and swampy land the usual luxuriant growth of tamarack is discovered. Cheshire is adorned with many very beautiful lakes, which give variety to the landscape and greatly enhance the attractions of the township. The most important of these is Swan Lake, located in the centre of the township, and lying principally upon section 16. It is surrounded with fertile fields and excellent timbered land, and its shores and waters, moreover, offer many allurements to the sportsman. Advent Lake is situated on the east side of sections 11 and 12, while northwest of it are Silver and Mud Lakes. Eagle Lake, so called from its fancied resem blance to that imperial bird, lies on the county-line, part of it extending into Van Buren County, but the larger portion being in section 35, in Cheshire. Duck Lake, on section 36, is very properly named. Its surface, when the writer visited it, was almost literal!}- covered with wild ducks, and these birds have long made it a favorite haunt. EARLY SETTLEMENTS. Until the year 1839 not a tree in Cheshire had fallen be fore the pioneer's axe. In that year two residents of Mon roe Co., N. Y., Simeon Pike and the Rev. Jonathan Hinckley, left their native State for Michigan. The latter settled at Breedsville, in Van Buren County, while Mr. Pike entered 40 acres of land on section 31, in Cheshire, and later acquired an additional 40 acres in Bloomingdale. Little Lake lies on sections 20 and 29, and a second Mud Lake is found northwest of Eagle Lake. The town ship has also several considerable streams flowing through it. Their waters nearly all find their way eventually to the Kalamazoo River, Swan Lake being the general reser voir and Swan Creek the medium through which they are conveyed to that stream, into which the creek empties, after passing through the northwest corner of Cheshire, in the township of Pine Plains. Horace Humphrey and Joseph Peck, in Columbia, were his nearest neighbors for two or three years, they having settled the year before he did. His family, consisting of his wife and three children, remained with these neighbors until a comfortable house had been erected on his land ; aster that he cleared a small tract and devoted it principally to \"\u2022rain and other supplies for family use. His time was, however, chiefly given to the management of Alex. L. Ely's * By E. O. Wagner."], [226, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 188 a cordial welcome on their arrival. For months Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Ward were the only white women seen in this portion of the township. Before Mr. Eaton's arrival his farm had been occupied by a settler named Tyler, who probably came as early as 1848, but died soon aster. grist-mill, where he was employed until it was consumed by fire. He then repaired to Paw Paw and engaged in the milling business there ; his family meanwhile remaining in Cheshire. After the burning of the mill he was obliged to make a pilgrimage of twenty-three miles to convert his grain into flour. Mr. Pike spent his latter days upon the farm, where he died in 1861, aged sixty-five years. His oldest son, Osteen G. Pike, now lives in the township, on section 27. Harvey Munger, better known in this and adjacent por tions of the State as Elder Munger, one of the pioneers in ministerial work in Allegan County, became a resident of Cheshire in 1850, having previously resided in Allegan. He purchased 200 acres on section 34, and after a residence of ten years removed to Van Buren County. He called together a little band of worshipers of the Baptist faith, who convened in the school-house, the list of which em braced the names of A. B. Eaton and wife, Miss Anna Palmer, Miss Mary Ann Piersons, Miss Rhoda Cooley, and Elder and Mrs. Munger. The elder ministered to this little flock several years, after which they became a portion of the Bloomingdale Church. A Sabbath-school was es tablished in 1851, which, though held at the house of Harvey Howard, in Bloomingdale, was chiefly sustained by the residents of Cheshire, Mr. A. B. Eaton having been superintendent. The next settler was Samuel Goodell, who came from Monroe Co., N. Y, in 1840, and located upon 160 acres on section 32, having remained with Horace Humphrey while erecting a log house, to which he soon after removed. He immediately began clearing his farm, on which he remained until his death. His brother Nathaniel Goodell purchased land near him, but subsequently removed to Monterey, where he now resides. The township for several years had few accessions to the small band of early pioneers. As late as 1844 the only tax-payers whose names appear on the records are Samuel Goodell and Simeon Pike. In the spring of 1847 came Samuel Lane, from Monroe Co., N. Y., who entered 80 acres on section 33, which he cleared, and on which he remained six years. He then removed to the town ship of Bloomingdale, Van Buren Co. At about the same time came Washington and Matthew Merchant, who located in the northeastern portion of the township and remained several years. They then moved away, and little is now remembered about them, as their location was' a very iso lated one. Marcus Lane, whose early recollections cluster around the beautiful valley of the Mohawk' in the State of New York, came to Cheshire in 1850, and purchased 128 acres on section 33. He stayed with his brother, Samuel Lane, while erecting a house of his own, to which he subsequently brought a wife. To the raising of this house the neigh bors for a long distance around were summoned as usual. They responded readily, but a part of them withdrew on the announcement that no whisky would be given them. Mr. Lane, however, preferred to maintain his temperance principles at the risk of unpopularity, and with the aid of the remaining few succeeded in erecting the frame. Mr. Lane, when he came West, intended to go to Illinois, but has found Michigan a field of labor both congenial and profitable. Cyrus W. and James G. Lindsley with their families came to the township in 1850, where they built a saw-mill on a small creek running through section 27, which is the outlet of Eagle Lake. Subsequently, C. W. Lindsley built on the same stream a shingle-mill, which he owned until his death, in 1873. James G. Lindsley purchased land on section 22 and erected a saw-mill, the saw of which worked back and forth horizontally, cutting off the top of the log first. Mr. Lindsley entered the army, where he died in 1863. Dustin Murch, formerly a resident of Orleans Co., N. Y, located 80 acres on section 18 in 1849. He had already erected a shanty when his family arrived, to which they removed. The following spring a band of Indians located near him on sections 20 and 29, close to Little Luke, many of whom proved industrious farmers and met a fair degree of success in their agricultural pursuits. They numbered 8 or 10 families, aud were of the tribe that settled in Way land. Was-sa-to was the most prominent among them. In the year 1848, Caleb Ward purchased 120 acres of land on section 31 from D. S. Heywood, who had bought it of the government. Previous to the purchase, however, Mr. Heywood had made an arrangement with Melvin Hog mire to clear off a part of it, receiving for his labor a por tion of the land. Mr. Hogmire at the time of the sale had cleared about 30 acres, and Mr. Ward purchased his interest also in the land, and entered upon the cleared tract at once. His son, Emmet Ward, lives on the farm his father Elizur Hogmire arrived the same winter, and located one mile south of Mr. Murch, where he engaged in the manu facture of shingles. bought. A settler named Buck, a man of advanced years, came from New York and located upon 240 acres on section 9, in 1849. He was an eccentric character, and was well known throughout the county, where he occasionally per formed the functions of a preacher. He removed several years after to Illinois, and died there. Richard Ferris left Van Buren County in 1854, and purchased 560 acres on sections 17 and 19, in Cheshire. Even then there was but one house between his land and the village of Allegan. He accepted the hospitality of Dustin Murch while erecting a shanty, aud soon after built a saw-mill on Swan Creek, which was the second mill in Cheshire. He carried it on until it was burned, in 1860. Three years later it was replaced by another, situated eighty rods west of the site of the first one. Mr. Ferris still re sides upon his original purchase, and has established a good record as a successful farmer and a public-spirited citizen. A. B. Eaton was an emigrant from Niagara Co., N. Y., in 1849, who purchased a farm of 120 acres on section 34. There was already some clearing done, and a shanty had been erected. His nearest neighbor was Reuben Ward, in Van Buren County, with whom Mr. Eaton's family found"], [227, ""], [228, "Residence of MARCUS LANE, CheshireTp, Allegan Co., Mich."], [229, "Residence of A.

The pioneers of Cheshire had principally settled in the southern portion of the township, the central and northern lands remaining comparatively unoccupied. Mr. Torry found not only his own purchase uncleared, but the larger portion of the neighboring land in the same condition. On section 4 a settler named Oliver had made some improvements, and on the southeast quarter of the same section, William Gates, who had come from Ohio a short time previous, began the clearing of 40 acres, upon which he erected a log house. Mr. Buck's house afforded him shelter until his own could be completed. Mr. Gates resided for many years upon his land, and finally removed to Monterey, where he still re sides. Mr. Torry afterwards removed to section 5, where he purchased a small farm, which he still cultivates. Jeptha Waterman came from New York in 1856, and became the owner of 40 acres on section 39. He, too, entered the army, and in 1865 sacrificed his life to the Union cause, having died while receiving medical care in a hospital. Mrs. Waterman now resides upon section 18. COLORED CITIZENS. A considerable proportion of the population are of the colored race, who merit notice in a history of Cheshire. As a class they stand well for both sobriety and industry. Many of them have farms upon which comfortable houses are built, and the land of which is improved and well main tained. They also have two church organizations, to which a liberal support is accorded, and of which mention is made farther on. They are by no means the least influential of the citizens of the township, and have won much credit for the ambition they display in their farming pursuits and the good reputation they have established in all their social relations. The first colored men to settle in the township were C. Tomison and K. Taylor, who located on the south west quarter of section 28. The land owned by the colored people was mostly bought of the Indians when they de parted. Richard Blanchard settled in 1855 upon 160 acres on section 8. He was a former resident of New York, but had emigrated from Chicago to the forests of Cheshire. He was known as a public-spirited citizen, and became an active expounder of the faith of the United Brethren. Sylvanus Stewart, another Ohio pioneer of 1856, pur chased of H. H. Booth 80 acres of land on section 20, for which he paid $4 per acre. He still resides on the same farm, which he has made one of the most desirable in the township. POST-OFFICES. The first post-office in the township was kept by Jonathan Howard, on section 32. Afterwards William Heywood was appointed postmaster, and the office was kept at his resi dence for many years on section 22, until its discontinuance in March, 1879. It was re-established in June of the same year. The office is now located on section 23, Timothy Church being the postmaster. The mail arrives semi- Warren Dowd, a former resident of Wyoming Co., N. Y., settled upon 80 acres on section 8 in 1856. He had pre viously learned the trade of a shoemaker, and for a while worked for W. C. Jenner, of Allegan. In that occupation he was accustomed to repair to the village on Monday morning and remain until Saturday night, and then return to Cheshire with supplies for his family on his back. A well improved farm and a substantial residence are the re wards of his industry and enterprise. weekly. EARLY PURCHASES. The following are the original purchases of land in the township : John F. Dowd, a brother of Warren, came the same year from Wyoming Co., N. Y., and remained two years with Richard Ferris. He, meanwhile, purchased 40 acres on section 16, to which he subsequently added 40 more.

Another emigrant from Wyoming County was John Brason, who located himself, in 1860, upon 145 acres on section 16, one mile north of John F. Dowd, who was his nearest neighbor. After building a substantial framed house and planting an orchard, he sold his place and moved across the road to another, on section 17, where he still resides. His latter purchase was made from the Indians, whom he taught to cultivate their land and to raise wheat. This greatly delighted them, and made them regard Mr. Brason in some degree as a benefactor.

On account of the small population, no school was taught in Cheshire previous to 1852. The first one was located in the south part of the township, near the \" base-line.\" A very simple structure of boards served as a shelter for the children for a period of two years, when a more spacious and comfortable building was erected, which is still in use.

All of the school buildings of Cheshire are comfortable and a few of them are decidedly elegant, confirming the reputation which the township has established for the ex cellence of its educational appointments. One of the former superintendents introduced the normal-school system, and awakened sufficient interest to encourage the opening of evening-classes, which for a while were well sustained and did much to inspire a love of study among those who were attendants. EARLY ROADS. The writer is informed that the earliest road in Cheshire was a short one which ran from the base-line on the south bounds of section 34, through Mr. A. B. Eaton's land, and between Mud and Eagle Lakes. It is doubtful, how ever, if this was an officially surveyed road, and certainly no record of it has been preserved. The first recorded road in the township was surveyed by James G. Lindsley,"], [233, "CHESHIRE TOWNSHIP. 191 The township is divided into seven entire districts and one fractional one, which are managed by the follow ing board of directors : S. S. Stout, B. W.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. The white people of Cheshire generally attend church in other townships or worship at the school-houses in this one, but the colored people have two organizations of their owu. MARCUS LANE. Among the early settlers and good practical farmers of Cheshire township none have a better record for personal integrity and high moral worth than he whose life and character forms the basis of these lines. Coming to Mich igan in 1851, he stopped at Allegan County with a brother, and assisted him in clearing off a piece of ground and get ting in a crop of corn, which was planted among the roots, logs, and stumps, but the result of this labor was eighteen hundred bushels of corn. It was not Mr. Lane's intention to make Michigan his home, having started for Illinois; but, meeting his brother in Buffalo, he was induced by him to come and see Michigan. After a short stay here he de cided upon making it his permanent home, purchased forty acres of land, and erected a log house. The lumber used for this was brought from Pine Grove, with a creek between his cabin and the lumber. Going with an ox-team, he, on his return, found the waters so high that he must swim his oxen in order to cross. This he did. Such were pioneer experiences. Few these latter days comprehend the hard ships through which the pioneers of the State passed. Neither can they understand the strength of the bonds of sympathy and fellowship which united these first dwellers in the woods. After his cabin was completed another diffi culty arose, but, remembering it was said \" That it is not good for man to be alone,\" he returned to New York, and, Sept. 25, 1851, married Harriet F., daughter of George and Mirze Miller. Two weeks after their marriage this young couple started to their home in the wilds of Mich igan. Upon their arrival they took an inventory of their stock of this world's goods with which to begin life, and found, besides a few household effects, one cow and three dollars. But with a hearty good will both went to work to make a home, and how well they succeeded can be seen. Mr. Lane engaged in buying and selling land, owning at times several hundred acres. Their home farm now con sists of one hundred and forty-eight acres. Although be ginning with such small capital they have always had plenty to supply their wants, yet could look around them and see their neighbors almost destitute, at times being obliged to Regular Methodist services were first held among them some years ago at the house of William Thompson, by Rev. Johnson Burden, a colored preacher, though occasional meetings, conducted by Elder Burke, had previously been held at the same place. Elder Rhodes also frequently ad dressed the colored citizens of the township at the resi dence of Mr. Thompson. An effort was made by Elder Burden, after the society had become thoroughly organized, to build a house of wor ship, and the present structure was accordingly erected. It is not yet completed, the members of the church preferring to finish it as their means shall permit rather than to con tract a debt. They have now a surplus in the treasurer's hands, and with an occasional donation seem likely soon to accomplish their desire, \u2014 a completed and dedicated church edifice. The trustees who superintended the erection of the building were William Thompson, Jesse F. Ridgley, and Ezekiel Howard. The pastors in rotation have been Elders Johnson Burden, John Jordan, L. D. Crosby, John Myers, and Lewis Ratliff, the present incumbent. The membership embraces 50 names, and shows good prospects of a considerable increase. A flourishing Sabbath-school is also held during the summer months. The present board of trustees is composed of William Thompson, Jesse F. Ridgley, M. C. McCully, Matthew Russell, James T. Russell. THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. Another organization among the colored population of the township was known as the Church of God. The writer is informed that, owing to a difference of opinion on the part of the Cheshire congregation from the denomina tion, that body seceded and took the name of the Church of the Living God. The pastor is Samuel Smith, who is ac credited with great fluency of speech, and also with a ver satility of mind which enables him to promulgate such doc trine as may be most pleasing to his hearers, rejoicing in very great freedom from creed or form. Several brethren of the congregation are also fluent in exhortation. The services are held in a log structure on section 21."], [235, "CHESHIRE TOWNSHIP. 193 subsist on leeks and potatoes for weeks at a time. Mr. and Mrs. Lane have a family of seven children, viz., George M., the first white male child born after the organization of the township; Wm. C, Almon B., Herschel D., Jennie M., Edwin E., and Lena M. George M. married Miss Mary Fry, and is engaged in the grocery business in Chicago. Wm. C. married Miss Belle Bagley ; is living on a fine farm in Bloomingdale. The others are at home with their parents. Mr. Lane was born in Hume, Allegeny Co., N. Y., March 15, 1827. He had the misfortune to lose his mother in 1831, when an uncle, Wm. Hill, took him into his family, where he found a pleasant home until he was twenty-seven years of age. His uncle being engaged in farming and dairying, Marcus assisted during the summer and attended school in the winter months. After arriving at his majority he returned to his native county, engaging two years in the dairy business with bis brother William. Some time during these two years he lost the use of three fingers, caused by a cut received at the hands of one Hiram Turner. Later in life Mr. Lane has been engaged in farm ing principally, but in connection with this has spent five years in a saw-mill, lumbering, and in mercantile business in partnership with Cooley & Munger. At this time Mr. Lane owns a saw-mill. In politics he is a Republican, and has held several offices of trust in his township. In relig ion is a Baptist, and has ever been willing to devote a por tion of his time and money for the spread of the gospel.

They have had four children, viz.: William M., Mary E., Marcus A., and Joseph G., who died Dee. 8, 1879. The others are living at home with their parents. Mrs. Ferris was born in England Jan. 1, 1826, remaining there until she was twenty-two years old. Richard Ferris, son of Leonard Ferris, was born in Wayne Co., N. Y., Aug. 7, 182 i. His father being engaged in farm ing, Richard worked at home on the farm until he was eigh teen years of age. During the winter months he attended the district school near home. One winter he attended a select school in Mishawaka, Ind., taught by a blind man. The winters of 1848 and 1849 he was at Notre Dame Univer sity, near South Bend, Ind. His educational advantages were superior to many young men of that day. Mr. Fer ris made several changes in his business and place of resi dence before his final settling in this State. These changes are as follows: in 1843, went to Mishawaka, Ind., working in a mill-yard; in 1844, hired out by the month in Cass Co., Mich. ; returning to Mishawaka the latter part of the same year, he engaged in a saw-mill as a sawyer; in 1850, came to Lawrence, Van Buren Co., Mich., working in a saw-mill in summer, and teaching in winter in the village of Lawrence ; in 1851, returned the second time to Misha waka, this time buying an interest in a saw-mill ; in Au gust, 1851, returned to Michigan, and here bought an in terest in a saw-mill at Lawrence, on Brush Creek ; in 1854, moved to Cheshire township, Allegan Co., purchasing five hundred and sixty acres of wild land. Here he commenced clearing, and erected a saw-mill for the purpose of sawing up the lumber. This mill burned down in 18(50. A new one was erected in 1863. He spent a part of his time at tending to his farm, but since 1876 he has devoted his time exclusively to farming. He is now living on the same tract of land he purchased when first coming into the town ship ; he now owns five hundred and twenty acres. Mr. Ferris is a Republican, and is an active member of the party. He has filled the offices of township clerk and school inspector for several years. In 1870 he was elected to the lower house of the Legislature. He is of Irish and A. B. EATON A. B. Eaton was born in Cornwallis, N. S., May 12, 1818, and was the second son of Stephen and Mary Eaton. When he was but five years old his father moved to New York City. Remaining there but a short time, they went to Euclid, Ohio. At the end of two years returned to New York State, settling at Clarence, Erie Co., N. Y. ; thence, after three years' stay, to Porter, Niagara Co., N. Y. At the age of twenty-one, when most young men want to begin life for themselves, A. B., no exception to this general rule, bought a piece of land in Wilson township. In 1849, Mr. Eaton became interested in the West, and as many were emigrating from New York to Michigan he fell into line with them, and landed in Cheshire, Allegan Co. To-day we find him living on the same farm he then bought. It con sisted of one hundred and twenty acres. He has since added forty acres. Mr. Eaton has been twice married. His first wife was Maria B., daughter of Amon and Patta Palmer. Three children were born of this union, viz. : 0. P., Mary E., and Washington Irving, who died Jan. 2, 1876. 0.

The son has man aged the business lor the past fifteen years. Having been in Michigan since a small boy, he has witnessed some of the development of the State, much of it being an unbroken wilderness upon their arrival here. Well he remembers the hard labor done by these men who were making for them selves homes in these wilds, going to their daily work with their rifles, axes, and their ox-teams. On the 19th of May, 1808, Jonathan Howard was born ; Rome, N. Y., was the place of his birth. Removing to Monroe Co., N. Y., he there remained until the fall of 1854, when he came to Michigan. Jan. 28, 1833, he mar ried Miss Emeline Whipple, who was born Dec. 4, 1809, and died March 17, 1836 ; by this marriage two children were born, \u2014 a son and a daughter. The daughter, Adeline, is living in the State of New York. The son, J. M., lives on the old homestead in Cheshire. Both father and son have been enterprising men in their township, the father serving six years as postmaster. They are staunch Republicans. Their real estate consists of one hundred acres of land, \u2014 eighty in Allegan County, and twenty in Van Buren County. J.

He was sent for in 1839 to assist in repairing Bailey's mill, on section 10, in Clyde. It was after the failure of Green & Mitchell, the company owning the Bailey mill, that Harris located on section 1, on the Allegan road, and there opened a tavern, in connection with which he kept the blacksmith shop already spoken of. Harris carried on the tavern-stand nine years, and then traded the place to one Dr. Coats for land in Otsego, whither he removed and engaged in farming. The Coats family conducted the tavern business a couple of years, and then sold to the Phillips family, who disposed of it in turn to George B. Smalley. Township 2 north, range 15 west, was organized in 1860, and named Clyde after the place of the same name in New York State. It is bounded on the north by Manlius, on the south by Lee, east by Pine Plains, and west by Ganges. The Chicago and Michigan Railroad passes in almost an air-line between north and south, having in the town two stations, \u2014 Fennville and Sherman. These are small but growing villages. Clyde is just beginning to develop as a fruit-producing township, and gives encouragement to be lieve that in the near future the peach-culture will be a large and valuable industry. In January, 1880, about 200 acres were set to fruit, \u2014 mainly peaches, \u2014 of which latter J. W. McCormick had 13 acres; Bathrick & White, 12 acres; William H. McCormick, 10 acres; while W. H. Silcox, S. Atwater, H. Hutchins, and others were likewise prominent as peach-growers. On section 1 also lived one Bushnell, a neighbor of Har ris, who died there at an early date, and was buried on his farm. His widow soon afterwards left the town. There was also a man called Marmaduke Wood, a resident upon section 1. Wood worked hard to make a living, but after an experience of four years concluded that he couldn't do it, and, selling out, moved to Illinois. The great tracts of lowland in Clyde, heretofore neglected and worthless, are in a fair way to be redeemed to agricul ture Efforts upon a liberal scale, looking to effective drain age, have thus far been attended with satisfactory results, and it may therefore be regarded as a simple question of a brief time as to the ultimate reclamation, of the major portion at least, of what is now a waste region. The first school taught in the neighborhood was a sub scription school in Manlius, in a log house erected by the people in the vicinity, on the town-line, about eighty rods east of the present Fennville school-house. This was in the winter of 1846, and the teacher was Laura Hudson, now Mrs. Harrison Hutchins. The first birth was that of Mary, daughter of Chas. T. Billings, Dec. 21, 1848, now living with her father. The first marriage was that of Helen A. Billings to Stephen Atwater, in 1862, and the first death that of Jacob Baragar, Feb. 2, 1847. THE EARLY COMERS IN CLYDE. Doubtless the first invasion by white men of the territory now occupied by Clyde was effected by Jacob Bailey and a company of laborers he brought with him for the purpose of setting up a saw-mill on section 10, in the interest of a New York land-owning firm, known as Green, Mitchell & Co. Bailey's advent occurred in 1837, and from that time until 1840 he carried on the mill and cleared land with considerable activity. In 1840, however, the company ceased operations in Clyde, and Bailey, with his men, mill, and all, disappeared from the neighborhood. Shortly after that, James Harris located on section 1, upon the Allegan and Saugatuck road, where he opened a blacksmith-shop, and Robert G. Winn temporarily located upon a place on section 6. Harris and Winn were for five or six years the only white inhabitants of the township. FENNVILLE. The first clearing upon the site now occupied by Fenn ville was made in 1860 by Henry Blakslee, who did but little, however, before he entered the army, in 1861, not long after which he was killed in action. In 1862, Elam A. Fenn, an early settler in Manlius, where he had put up a saw-mill, erected, in company with Levi Loomis, a saw-mill just west of where the railroad-track now passes through Fennville. The mill was soon destroyed by fire, and then Emerson & Co., of Rockford, 111., who owned considerable land near there, joined Fenn in rebuilding the mill, and engaged him to clear their land and cut their lumber. In 1870 the railway-line was run east of Fenn's mill, and David Walter, a shoemaker Avho came to Clyde in 1854, boarded the railroad laborers at his house, near Fenn's. The next settler was Charles T. Billings, a New Yorker, who in 1846 located upon 40 acres on section 6, where he still resides. When Billings came, Harris was living on section 1, but Winn had moved from section 6 into New ark, whence he subsequently went to Ganges, his present home. Walter Billings, who made a location upon section 5 in 1847, remained only a few years. In 1849, Harrison Fry came on, and moved into the shanty earlier occupied by Winn on section 6. Fennville was then in the woods, but in 1871 was platted by Emerson & Co., and given its name in honor of the saw mill man. The village site was then in Manlius, opposite the mill. In the fall of 1871, when the village consisted of the stores of Pardee Grizzell and Stephen Atwater '\u25a0' By David Schwartz. 196"], [239, "CLYDE TOWNSHIP. 197 the post-office, and a half-dozen houses, everything, includ ing the saw-mill, was burned to the ground. After the fire the restoration of the village was effected upon Wilson's addition, previously laid out by M. C. Wilson upon the property occupied by Henry Blakslee in 1860. There the business portion of the village is now located. The first house in the addition was built by M. C. Wilson, upon the ground now occupied by David Signor's hotel. Stephen Atwater was the first to build a store there, and presently Dr. Asa Goodrich, of Ganges, came and opened a drug shop in Atwater's store, while he also practiced the healin\"* art.

CLYDE CENTRE. Settlements in Clyde were confined until quite recently to the northwestern portion. Sherman, in the south, was settled in 1867, and in 1872, Eggleston and Hazleton, in terested with Stockbridge and Johnson; extensive land owners, put up a large saw-mill at the place now called Clyde Centre, employing in the woods and at the mill about 75 men. They erected a number of houses, including a large boarding-house for their laborers, opened a store, caused a railway-station and post-office to be established there, and carried on their business prosperously until 1877, when, the timber-supply being about exhausted, they removed the mill elsewhere, and Clyde Centre was accordingly relegated to obscurity. James Bathrick and James E. White were among the first hands employed in the mill, and when it was removed they bought farming-land on section 20, where they have since been engaged in agricultural pur suits, particularly, however, at present in the business of fruit-growing. A post-office was established in 1866 for the benefit of the people near the saw-mill, and called \" Fenn's Mill.\" Elam Fenn was the first postmaster, and, until the comple tion of the railway, received a mail three times each week by way of Manlius. Previous to 1866 the latter place was the post-office for the people at Fenn's Mill. When the village was laid out, the name of the post-office was changed to Fennville. Succeeding Fenn, the postmasters have been Stephen Atwater, Wm. Seiver, George Smead, and J. W. McCormick, the present incumbent. o'u\"'uS' W. A. Briggs, whose parents settled in Manlius in 1851, located at Clyde Centre in 1874, and lives there now. There is at the Centre a Free- Will Baptist Church organ ization, which worships in the school-house and has a small membership in the thinly-settled neighborhood. Fennville is fast rising to importance as a shipping-point as well as a trading-place. During the season of 1878 the railway-shipments included 5000 barrels of apples, 55,000 baskets of peaches, and 25 cars of wheat. During the season of 1879 shipments included 137,000 baskets of peaches, 4000 barrels of apples, and 60 cars of wheat. The outlook for 1880 promises a material advance in busi ness over the figures for 1879. TOWNSHIP OKGANIZATION. Clyde, originally a portion of Pine Plains, was set off by the county supervisors Oct. 12, 1859, and named by Ralph Parish, who had come from Clyde, N. Y. At the first town election, held April 2, 1860, 13 votes were cast by the following persons: Ralph Parish, George G. Smalley, E. H. Heath, David Walter, Charles T. Billings, Stephen Thayer, John Withrow, Henry Davidson, E. B. Wells, Richard Purdy, Robert Hayes, Frank Seymour, Jeremiah Stafford. Besides Dr. Asa Goodrich, Fennville's physicians have been Drs. C. F. Stimpson, Hull, McCullough, Andrews, and Meaghan. The two latter are now the resident physi cians. SHERMAN. In 1867, Alonzo Sherman and Ezra L. Davis came to Clyde, with about 20 men, and set up a saw-mill on section 32. They also opened a store, and called the place Sher man. Davis remained only a few years. Mr. Sherman has continued uninterruptedly to follow the saw-mill business at the place ever since. When the railway was opened, in 1871, a post-office was established at Sherman and called Bravo, its present name. The appellation is supposed to have been suggested by some one who wished thus to indi cate the spirit that must have animated the pioneers of the place in starting a village in the woods. Chandler Eaton, the first postmaster, was succeeded, in 1873, by the present incumbent, Eugene D. Nash, who has also been the railway agent since that time. The following persons have been chosen annually since 1860 as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace : SUPERVISORS. 1860-64, Ralph Parrish; 1865, E. A. Fenn; 1866-79, J. AV.

DORK; The township of Dorr, designated in the original sur vey as township No. 4 north, of range No. 12 west, is situated upon the northern border of Allegan County, east of the centre. The adjoining townships are Byron, in Kent County, on the north, Leighton on the east, Hopkins on the south, and Salem on the west. its station being Dorr Centre. The latter, running in the same general direction, intersects sections 1, 12, and 13; its station in this township being Moline. EARLY HISTORY. ORIGINAL SURVEYS. The general surface, except through the centre from north to south, and a narrow belt on the east border, where a considerable extent of swamp-land exists, is rolling, and presents many beautiful landscapes. Deputy United States Surveyor Lucius Lyon ran out all the township and sectional lines of Dorr. He was here first in 1826, when he traced the northern, eastern, and western boundaries. On the 3d of May, 1831, he re appeared upon its borders and blazed the southern line, and during the months of May and June of the same year com pleted the work by subdividing the township into 36 sections. Originally the township was heavily timbered. About two-thirds of the southwest quarter was covered with pine, and another small tract of pine was found southeast of the centre, the remainder being of the deciduous varieties, such as beech, maple, oak, ash, white-wood, elm, lynn, tamarack, etc. FIRST AND OTHER EARLY LAND-ENTRIES. That portion of the public domain lying within the present township of Dorr was first thrown open to purchasers in the summer of 1835, and the first persons to avail themselves of the opportunity were two well-known residents of Otsego, \u2014 Hull Sherwood and Almerin L. Cotton, who on the 31st day of August, 1835, purchased individually certain por tions of section 31. One or two other lots were entered during the same year, and a large amount in the years 1836 and 1837 ; but a considerable portion of this township re mained vested in the general government until after the year 1844. The soil compares favorably with that of other townships, and is of the same nature as that found throughout the State, viz. : alternating belts of sand and clay loam on the uplands, with alluvial deposits in the swamps and lower portions. A system of ditching will ultimately reclaim nearly every acre of the present waste-lands in the town ship. The lakes and water-courses are unimportant ; sec tions 11, 29, and 30 are each dotted with a small lake of from 15 to 20 acres in extent. The stream known as Big Rabbit River cuts the extreme southwest corner. Its tributary, Red River, enters the township from the north east corner, and, after pursuing a very sinuous course, finally leaves it, near the centre of the west border. Following is a list of the first and other early entries made upon each section : The people of Dorr are chiefly engaged in the pursuits of agriculture, their soil being well adapted to grazing and the culture of fruit, grass, corn, and the various cereals. Abundant harvests annually reward the husbandmen for their toil, and an appearance of general prosperity prevails. Neat farm-houses, commodious out-buildings, handsome and well-managed farms grace the landscape in many portions. For the improvement of their live-stock the people have thus far been mainly indebted to the Messrs. Averill, Bates, and Gilbert.

Store goods were unreasonably high, and only to be obtained at distant points, and Orrin Goodspeed's children frequently wended their way to school in the snow barefooted.

In September, 1850, he committed suicide by shooting himself in his own house, and his is believed to have been the first death to occur in the township.

Sterling, who settled upon section 10, was also one of the prominent early settlers. He built the first framed house in the town, and, as he served for many years as justice of the peace, his house was a well-known place of resort for early litigants. Frequently his court held open till midnight. Meantime, his good wife would pre pare supper for those assembled, of whom about one-half paid for their entertainment. Squire Sterling would earn perhaps $1.50 in fees, while next morning it required two or three hours' hard work to clear up, and arrange household matters again. The first settlement was made in this township in Octo ber, 1845, by Nathaniel Goodspeed and his son Orrin. They came from Warrensville, Cuyahoga Co., Ohio, with their own conveyances, drawn by one horse and one ox-team, and also brought in twelve head of cattle. The father was a widower. Orrin's family consisted of himself, his wife, and sons, George, Cyrus, Daniel, and William. Their lands, purchased while en route, at Marshall, Mich., were situated on the north sides of sections 1 and 2, were entered in the name of Nathaniel Goodspeed, and, except one other, were the first purchases made upon those sections. The father erected a small log cabin, near the present residence of Orrin Goodspeed, and the latter lived with him that winter, establishing himself the same season iu another log house, on section 2. For the first years settlements tended towards the north east quarter of the township, and the families coming in were principally Americans. But soon after 1850 several Germans began improvements in the northwest portion, and their numbers have been increased by others, until to-day they own at least one-fourth of all the lands in the town ship. They are good citizens, and most excellent farmers. Among those not already mentioned who were settled here prior to June, 1853, were Benjamin Truax, Stephen Per kins, William H. Lock, Cyrus C. Babbitt, Robert Sproat, James Clark, David R. Averill, David R. Averill, Jr., John L. Barney, Dudley Miller, Byron Nelson, Jason J. Morrill, Thomas A. Morrill, George Krauss, Levi Swartz, Anton Harrish, Jacob Bart*, Nicholas Kline, George H. Sessions, William Kite, aud Norman Miller. Thus situated, they passed the winter of 1845-46, and a very severe one it was, too, especially for their cattle. Their nearest neighbors were seven miles distant, to the northeast, while on the south nine miles had to be traversed through the forests ere a settlement was reached. Not a particle of hay or straw could be obtained for their live stock ; but by a vigorous and daily use of the axe, their cattle were enabled to eke out a scanty subsistence through the winter by \" browsing.\" In the spring and summer of 1846, 18 acres were cleared"], [244, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 200 Inspectors ; Orrin Goodspeed, Erastus Congdon, Jonathan Brewer, Highway Commissioners; William H.

CIVIL HISTORY. From the 23d of March, 1836, until the spring of 1842, the territory comprised within the present limits of Dorr formed part of Otsego township. Watson was formed in 1842, and included within its boundaries the present townships of Watson, Hopkins, and Dorr. TOAVNSHIP OFFICERS.

We find that the teachers licensed in 1857 were Helen Leonard, Mary Miller, and Mary Smith, and that there were 162 children of school age residing in the township. The teachers of 1858 were Jane Sooy, Ellen M. Styles, Reuben A. Wilson, William P. Wilson, C. D. Wood, and Peter Reausek. In 1859, Charles Winchester, Effie M. Baker, William Pep per, John W.

DORR CENTRE. Dorr has two villages within its borders, named respect ively Dorr Centre and Moline. The former is situated in the central part of the township, and is a station on the line of the Kalamazoo division of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. EDUCATIONAL. It contains about 200 inhabitants, a Congregational church edifice, Masonic lodge-rooms, steam saw-, flouring-, and shingle-mills, two hotels, numerous stores, and several small mechanical shops. Wheat, flour, pork, lumber, and stave-bolts are the principal articles of shipment. The first school district organized* wherein schools were taught and attended by children from this township was * Upon the organization of Dorr (including Hopkins), in 1847, township No. 4 north, of range No. 12 west, was known as school district No. 2. 26"], [248, "202 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Among the business and professional men at present residents of the village are Messrs. Frank Neuman and Lyman W. Ehlis, hotel proprietors ; Barris & Neuman and Ewing & Sproat, grain-dealers ; Edward Byles, lumber manufacturer; E. S. Botsford, Fritsche & Co., Joseph Neuman, and John Sommer, merchants; L. N.

Evarts, clergyman. their lodge-rooms at Dorr Centre, Wednesday on or before the full moon. MEDICAL. Dr. Benjamin J. V. Stone, who .subsequently became an army surgeon and died at Alexandria, Va., March 3, 1865, was the first resident physician in the township. He had a large practice, and was very successful. Dr. Max Snitzer, a German, who settled in the north west part of Dorr, was also an early physician, and prac ticed extensively among those of his nationality. Dr. Theodore Cole, a graduate of the Michigan Univer sity, of the class of 1869, first practiced in St. John, Clinton Co. From thence he removed to Dorr Centre in March, 1870, where, to the present time, he has been engaged in an extended and successful practice. Drs. H. P. Evarts and J. H. Smith have each practiced here some six or seven years. Improvements were first made on the village site by Mr. Frank Neuman, an energetic German, who came from the Fatherland in 1855, to Dorr Centre in 1856, becoming its first settler, and in 1857 erected the first framed house. He also established the first wagon-shop, and was the first in many other enterprises. On the 27th of September, 1869, as proprietor, he caused to be surveyed and laid out the original village-plat, to which an addition was made by Joseph Neuman the same day. As already noticed, the Neumans are among the most prominent and successful business men of the village at the present time. RELIGIOUS. THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OF DORR, whose church edifice is situated in the northeast quarter of the township, was organized Aug. 27, 1857, in a small school which stood near the present church site. The original society was comprised of 11 members, viz., Brad ley Gilbert, Martha J. Gilbert, Nahum Snow, Sarah Snow, Lauren C. Gilbert, Judith Gilbert, Edward Averill, Mary B. Averill, William A. Smith, Elizabeth Smith, and Sarah Smith. William A. Smith was chosen the first deacon, and Nahum Snow the first clerk, \u2014 positions which both held many years, the latter until his death, in March, 1876. In February, 1858, Rev. James A. McKay accepted the pas torate, and remained four years. The following September the First Congregational Church of Grand Rapids pre sented this church a communion-service, which is still in use. Rev. N. K. Evarts became their pastor in the autumn of 1862* MOLINE. This small village, situated on the east side of Dorr township, was started by Alfred Chappell, John L. Shaw, and Edward P. Vining, July 16, 1872. It is a station on the line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, seven teen miles south of Grand Rapids, lumber and farm prod ucts being the principal articles of shipment. The village was projected in 1870, and now contains about 100 inhab itants. Among those doing business here are B. Gilbert, postmaster and merchant ; Balch Bros , saw-mill proprietors ; Alfred Chappell, station and express agent ; W. M. Pierce, merchant; 11. J. Rogers and Charles H. Wademan, black smiths. A Sabbath-sehool was established at the beginning, of which Mrs. Elizabeth Smith was the teacher and superin tendent. The growth of the church has been steady and healthful, marked by no unusual events or divisions. Be fore the war its members indulged in the hope of soon erecting a church edifice, but at the call of their country all the able-bodied male members joined the Union armies, and the subject of building a house of worship was dropped. Meetings were continued in the school-house, and the question was not again revived until 1870. When some of the people were disappointed in the location of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad station, an effort was made to consolidate the Hilliard's Church with this, and to gether build a church edifice at Dorr Centre. On the 18th of November, 1872, the place of meeting was changed to the Centre. The consolidation failed, but the church edifice at the Centre was commenced in 1873. However, owing to an alleged failure on the part of the contractor, the building committee would not accept the structure, and litigation followed. MASONIC. P. S. Pullen Lodge, No. 307, F. and A. if.\u2014 The origi nal members of this lodge held their first meeting in the grist-mill at Dorr Centre, July 1, 1871, and inaugurated measures for the building up of a lodge and lodge-rooms. On the 21st of February, 1872, the first regular communi cation was held in their new hall, and the officers first in stalled were as follows: J. M. Burnett, W. M. ; William J. Sproat, Sec. ; E. J. Boynton, S. W. ; Otto R. Fritsche, J. W.; Harmon Campbell, S. D. ; Eli Driskell, J. D. ; Fred. Custer, Tyler. Other charter members were Phi letus S. Pullen, Frank Neuman, Ferdinand Neuman, A. G. McConough, Charles L. Christie, John MeNeal, Thomas Carruthers, and William H. Reid. The subsequent Masters to the preset t time have been J. M. Burnett, to 1875, inclusive; Eli Driskell, 1876-77; Henry P. Evarts, 1878 ; George W. Shriuer, 1879 ; William J. Sproat, 1880. Other present officers are Eli Driskell, S. W. ; Alfred Enimons, J. W. ; George W. Shriner, S. D. ; J. W. Pullen, S. D. ; P. S. Pullen, Treas.; Lyman E. Parker, Sec. ; and Andrew Truax, Tyler.

State lands, and during the same season became the first settlers within its limits. From the time of his settlement here until the present Orrin Goodspeed has been one of the most prominent citi zens, and by habits of industry and economy is now the possessor of a most beautiful and fertile farm, embracing the lands purchased by his father in 1845. Soon after, the subject of building a church edifice in the latter neighborhood was again brought forward, and finally resulted in the completion and dedication of the present beautiful house of worship in 1876. It cost $2500, has sittings for about 250 people, and a membership of 100. To Mr. and Mrs. Orrin Goodspeed were born twelve children, viz. : George N., Feb. 14, 1838; died at Chatta nooga, Teon., Jan. 9, 1865, while serving his country as a member of the Michigan Engineers and Mechanics.

This organization was formed Nov. 11, 1875, and its original members were Adrian De Clark and wife, William H. Ewing, H. T. Pomeroy and wife, Antoinette Kelly, Christina Patterson, Horace Barton and wife, N. K. Evarts and wife, and Mary J. Byles. LAUREN C. GILBERT. Lauren C. Gilbert, the tenth child in a family of seven teen children, was born in Chester, Geauga Co., Ohio, March 17, 1830. His ancestors were early settlers in the vicinity of Boston, Mass., and numbers of them served in the Con tinental army during the war of the Revolution. Rev. N. K. Evarts became the first pastor in 1875, and has continued to the present time. The church edifice was commenced in 1873 ; it was completed soon after, and is the one mentioned in the sketch of the other Congrega tional Church. The society numbers 24 members. Joel Gilbert, the father of Lauren C. Gilbert, was a native of the State of Connecticut, and married Miss Crisilda Crocker. He emigrated westward, and successively became a pioneer in Genoa, Cayuga Co., N. Y., and in Chester, Geauga Co., Ohio, finally locating upon lands in the latter State now owned by E. O. Lyman. OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. It is probable that Rev. F. Glass, a Methodist divine, presided over the first religious meetings held in this town ship, in 1849. Two classes of this denomination exist at the present time, and are connected with the Byron Circuit. A society composed of United Brethren is located mainly in the eastern part of the township. When nine years of age, Lauren C. Gilbert began work for E. O. Lyman, and remained with him \u2014 the proceeds of his labor being paid to his father \u2014 until twenty years old. He then remained at home for a short period, and on the 3d of March, 1852, married Miss Judith Wisner, of his native town. In the autumn of 1853 he removed to his present place of residence in the township of Dorr, pur chasing eighty acres, the lands originally occupied by Ed ward Moore, and of which but sixteen acres were then improved. Additions to his first purchase haA'e been made from time to time, until he now owns in this and Leighton townships four hundred and sixty acres. The major por tion of the home-farm is under a high state of cultivation, and the whole embellished by a tasteful residence, commo dious farm buildings, fruit- and shade-trees. In the northwest quarter the German Catholics have a large congregation, composed of members of from 40 to 50 families. Their church edifice \u2014 the largest house of wor ship in the county \u2014 is situated near the county-line, and on the highway dividing sections 5 and 6 of this township. They also have a well-conducted private or parochial school in the same vicinity. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. ORRIN GOODSPEED. In August, 1861, he enlisted in the First Regiment of Michigan Cavalry, participated in all its campaigns, and, with his regiment, was mustered out of service at Salt Lake City, Utah, March 10, 1866. Orrin Goodspeed was born in the township of Mentor, Geauga Co., Ohio, Aug. 6, 1816. His father, Nathaniel Goodspeed, a native of Cattaraugus Co., N. Y., married a widow, Mrs. Miller, aud became an early settler in Ohio. To Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert six children have been born, viz.: Wallace B., Sept. 2, 1854 ; Samuel J., April 8, 1857 ; Lauren D., April 16, 1S62 ; Oliver L., Feb. 3, 1867; Frederick C, Dec. 12, 1870; and Nellie S., June 11, 1872, who died Oct. 22, 1874. Orrin, their only child, grew to manhood in the latter State, and on the 9th of March, 1837, was married to Sally M. Curtis, of Northfield, Ohio. As farmers the father and son passed an uneventful life in the Buckeye State until the autumn of 1S45. When journeying with their own conveyances to the northern border of the present township of Dorr, they purchased a quantity of Politically, Mr. Gilbert is a Republican.

MARY M. GROVER. BENJAMIN GROVER. resided upon the same until his death, which occurred in April, 1879, at the age of eighty-nine years. His wife died suddenly of apoplexy in 1845. Benjamin Grover was born in Bennington, Wyoming Co., N. Y., Feb. 9, 1826. He was an adopted son of Benjamin and Mabel Grover, and passed his boyhood and early days of his manhood in that section. He married, in 1851, in Darien, Genesee Co., N. Y., Miss Mary M., daughter of Sebra and Dura Weaver, who had removed with her parents from Wel lington, Tolland Co., Conn., in 1828. She was born Feb. 2, 1827. In September, 1853, Mr. Grover came to Dorr, Allegan Co., all this section being then a wilderness, and the woods the abode of all kinds of wild animals. He purchased first eighty acres, upon which his widow still resides; he afterwards added one hundred and twenty acres, which is now in possession of their son. Mr. and Mrs. Grover were the parents of the following children : Flora A., born Oct. 13, 1851 ; died Feb. 17, 1865. Jerome A., born Nov. 3, 1852; married Caroline Burgman Jan. 1, 1876. George C, born Feb. 18, 1853 ; died March 17, 1854. Infant son, born and died Dec. 22, 1857. Delew B. Grover, born Oct. 14, 1860 ; died June 15, 1867. Mary C. Grover, born July 16, 1867 ; died Aug. 26, 1867. Charles H., the third child, the only son, and the only surviving member of his father's family, remained under the parental roof assisting his father in farm labor until 1852, when he married Miss Armina N. Inman, March 31st of the same year, a young lady who had engaged in teaching in Spencer, Ohio, for several years, and where her parents still reside. In the autumn of 1858, Mr. Daugherty removed to the present township of Dorr, where he has since successfully engaged in the pursuits of farming and lumbering, and is now conspicuous as one of its most prominent citizens. An elegant farm-residence, erected in 1875, surrounded by necessary out-buildings and one hundred and fifty well cultivated acres, silently yet eloquently attest to the facts of which we speak. He enlisted in the First Michigan Engineers and Mechanics in the fall of 1864, joined his regiment at Atlanta, Ga., soon after, served as regimental inspector of elections, in November of the same year participated in the memorable march through Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia, in 1864-65 was present at the siege of Savannah, Ga., the battles of Averysboro' and Benton ville, N. C, the grand review at Washington, D. C, con tinued with his regiment until its honorable muster out of the service, and during all that time was never in an ambu lance or absent one day from his company. Benjamin Grover was not a member of any church, believing that to the just and those willing and ready to be judged and meet their God, no other creed or baptism was necessary. His death occurred Feb. 9, 1875. He was much respected as a neighbor, citizen, and man in the community in which he lived. Mrs. Mary M. Grover is a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In his political convictions Mr. Daugherty is a Republican, and represented his party in the State Convention held at Detroit, May 12, 1880. He has also served his townsmen in many other official capacities. (See township civil list.) CHARLES H. DAUGHERTY. Charles II. Daugherty was born in Penfield, Monroe Co., N. Y., Nov. 22, 1829. His father, a native of Ireland, emigrated to America when quite young, and settled in the State of New York, where he married a lady of Scotch parentage. About 1833 he remoA-ed to the State of Ohio, purchased a farm in Spencer township, Medina Co., and To Mr. and Mrs. Daugherty have been born four chil dren, who all survive, viz.: Julia 0., Sept. 27, 1853; Chester C, April 12, 1856; Eugene A., Dec. 21, 1858; and Stella S., April 6, 1868."], [253, "205 FILLMORE. Toavnsiiip 4 north, range 15 west, now called Fillmore, and previously a portion of Manlius, lies on the northern border of Allegan County, and is bounded on the north by the Ottawa County line, on the south by Manlius township, on the east by Overisel, and on the west by Laketown. Tbe population of the township in 1874 was 1720, and is composed now, as it has been since 1847, almost exclusively of Hollanders, who, in the year last named, were numbered among the earliest settlers, and who have gradually acquired the territory. Two railways, the Chicago and West Mich igan Bailroad and tbe Grand Haven Railroad, pass through the township, only one of which, however, \u2014 the latter, \u2014 has a station in it, that being known as Fillmore, where there is a small, but bustling, village. There is also in the north west a village called Graafschap, which lies on both sides the line between Fillmore and Laketown. Between the west and northeast there is a narrow belt of lowland, which is being gradually reclaimed by effective drainage to valuable usefulness. In that region, especially of late, heavily over grown with timber, may be observed the desolation wrought by the wide-spread forest-fires that passed through Western Allegan in the autumn of 1871. novelty of the proceedings wore off, they declined, as a general thing, to give their attendance, so that towards the last Mr. Smith bad barely a dozen willing to be instructed. In 1844 he received the appointment of government mis sionary to the Indians, and set about the establishing of an Indian colony. To that end, he induced several Indians to purchase land in town 4, and to encourage the project still further the government appointed Isaac Fairbanks, in 1845, to be an \" Indian farmer,\" charged with the duty of in structing the savages in the business of farming. Mr. Fairbanks came, in 1845, to township 4 from near Kala mazoo, settled upon section 3, adjoining Mr. Smith's place, and assisted the latter in civilizing the sons of the forest ; but somehow the scheme was not a success. In 1848 the Indians mo\\Ted farther north, to the Mackinaw. Smith accompanied them, and at latest advices, in 1878, was still living there. Previous to Isaac Fairbanks' advent, Anton Schorno, a German, who had been living at Singapore, in Newark town ship, settled in township 4, on section 26, in 1842, where he lived until his death, in 1879. In 1844, Daniel La moreux located on section 34, whence, however, he soon removed to township 5. Settlements in the northern part of the township, near the county-line, following that of Isaac Fairbanks, were made by Benjamin Fairbanks on section 2, and by Homer E. Hudson, who came with Dominie Van Raalte, the founder of the Dutch colony at Holland, and started a nursery upon the Smith place. Not succeeding in the venture, he soon changed his location to Holland. George Harrington, who conveyed Van Raalte to Holland and assisted in the erection of the first house at that place, bought a place on section 3, in township 4, and in that year \u2014 1847 \u2014 made a settlement upon it. He was at first en gaged in teaming, and hauled many loads of supplies for the Dutch colony between Holland and Grand Rapids, Allegan and Kalamazoo. The town is liberally supplied with excellent schools, and in the matter of school buildings has just reason to be proud. Equally abundant are the conveniences for religious worship. Water-power there is none, and manufactures have therefore received but little attention. Agriculture is profitable, however, and the farmers are, as a rule, thrifty and prosperous. THE FIRST SETTLERS IN FILLMORE. The first five white settlers in Fillmore were George N. Smith, Anton Schorno, Daniel Lamoreux, Isaac Fairbanks, and Benjamin Fairbanks, who ranked as to priority in the order named. All save Schorno and Daniel Lamoreux are still living, \u2014 Smith, in the Mackinaw country, Isaac Fairbanks, in the village of Holland, and Benjamin Fair banks, in California. Darwin Drew made a settlement near Schorno's, but did not stop long. The first Dutch settler in that quarter was John G. Kronemeyer, who, in the winter of 1847-48, located with Behrend Seeman on section 23. Their neigh bors in the north, on the road to Holland, were Isaac Fairbanks and George N. Smith. That road, which had been underbrushed by Schorno, was subsequently, in 1849, fairly constructed ; being called the Bee-line road, by which name it is yet known. In 1847 a log school-house was put up on section 26, and there a Miss Boies, of Sauga tuck, taught nine scholars, four being children of Krone meyer and five of Schorno. Three daysafter Kronemeyer be^an to make a clearing on his place his left arm was broken by tbe fall of a tree. As soon as a surgeon could be fetched from Zeeland he had the required atten- George N. Smith was a Congregational minister, and was sent out by the Congregational Church, in 1841, as a mis sionary to the Indians in Western Allegan. He bought. some land on section 3, in town 4, and with the assistance of Indians put up a log house and made a small clearing. He then built a second log house on his place, and into that building he used to gather such Indians as could be per suaded to come, taught them from school-books during the week, and preached to them on Sundays. At the outset the redskins took kindly to the project, and came in con siderable numbers to school and to church, but when the \u2022 By David Schwartz."], [254, "206 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BAERY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. tion, but it was not until the next day. He was of course compelled to lie idle for a time, but it was a sore trial for him to do so, since upon the labor of his hands alone the support of his family depended. Becoming at last im patient over his enforced quiet and being resolved to work at all hazards, he resumed his chopping operations with one hand only, and after that fashion, until he got over the in jury (four months after he was hurt), he wielded his axe with his strong right arm and carried his lest in a sling. The incident serves to illustrate how pressing were the needs of the hour, and how stubbornly the pioneers faced misfortunes disheartening enough to prostrate any but the stoutest energies. Kronemeyer and two of his young sons went out once in search of wolves, the presence of which had been reported hard by, and after a persevering tramp captured seven of these animals in a bunch on section 15. As the bounty on wolf-scalps from State, county, and town amounted then to something handsome, they were well paid for their day's work.* Apropos of wolves, a daughter of Mr. Bonselaar, seeing in her father's yard what she took for a fox, ran hastily to obtain a pitchfork, and succeeded in pinning the animal to the ground, when she was some what astonished to find that she had brought a wolf, instead of a fox, to grief. Had she known at first that it was a wolf she might possihly have hesitated before venturing upon the attack. At that time the settlers about there used to go to mill at Allegan, and, traveling by ox-team, could not at best com- plete the round trip in less than two days. Garret De Witt moved to Holland in 1848, and thence to section 10, in Fillmore, upon land which had until then not known the ring of the woodman's axe. His neighbors were Isaac Fair- banks, James Vanderbett, T. Sluiter, Stephen Fairbanks, the Nies family, on section 1, and the Schaaps, on sec- tion 2. Aster De Witt, the comers to that neighborhood in- cluded John Fork, H. Schuttmaat, Mr. Oldemeyer, and Mr. Overbeck. The Garvelinks were early settlers in Holland, \u2014 in 1847, \u2014 and after the elder Garvelink's death his sons moved to Fillmore, where their father owned land. One of his sons, \u2014 Jan W., \u2014 who lives on section 8, has been con- spicuously identified with township affairs since 1857, having been supervisor fourteen years, town clerk two years, and justice of the peace twelve years. After 1856 the Hollanders gradually extended their settlements to every portion of the township, and at this time comprise almost the entire population of Fillmore, \u2014 indeed, it would be difficult to find in the town a dozen families not Hollanders. In 1859, along the town line road between Fillmore and Manlius, Christian Arzt, Jacob Illg, and Frederick Kern were settlers on the Fill more side, while there were also Hollanders on the Man lius side. Later, the Dutch began to people both sides of the line quite freely, and where the Chicago and West Michigan Railway crosses it they have a village called East Saugatuck, which lies on both sides the town-line, but chiefly in Manlius. In 1859 the town-line road, although \" chopped out\" previously, had become thickly grown over, and was then at best a mere cattle-path. THE DUTCH COLONY. In the summer of 1847 the settlements by the Dutch at Holland began to penetrate into Fillmore and Laketown on either side the line between the two towns. Amon*1* those who located on the Fillmore side were A. J. Neerken, Lukas Tinholt, D. Mantingh, and others. Henry Schro- tenboer and wife, accompanied by Dirk Lenters, came in 1848. The former lived near Graafschap until 1856, when he removed to section 20, where he found Lenters already located. The latter had been living here and there until 1855, when he made his Fillmore settlement on sec- tion 20, as the pioneer in that vicinity. There came into the neighborhood shortly after, J. H. Tencate and William Plassman, and these four families were for some time the only residents thereabout. The country was so heavily timbered, and in many places swampy, and in coming in they found it a matter of such difficulty to make roads for wagons, that they brought their goods in afoot upon their backs. Lenters used to walk nine miles to Sauga- tuck after flour, and walk back again, lugging 100 pounds of the commodity upon his back. For some time the only road these settlers had was an Indian trail passing between Manlius and Holland, and even at that late day wolves and bears were sometimes seen, although they gave no trouble. TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION Fillmore was set off from Manlius in 1849, and named in honor of the then Vice-President of the United States. The name was suggested by the wife of Ralph R. Mann, at whose house Isaac Fairbanks called to enlist the influence of Mr. Mann in favor of a petition asking for the separa- tion of town 4 from Manlius. \" What will you call the new town?\" asked Mrs. Mann. \"We haven't decided upon a name,\" replied Mr. Fairbanks, whereupon Mrs. Mann exclaimed, \" Call it Fillmore,\" and Fairbanks, adopt- ing the suggestion, so christened it. By some mischance the records of township elections from 1849 to 1851, inclu- sive, have been lost, but as to the officials elected at the meeting in 1849, it is known that Isaac Fairbanks was chosen Supervisor; Benjamin Fairbanks, Clerk; Anton Schorno, Treasurer ; and Isaac Fairbanks, Anton Schorno, George N. Smith, and George Harrington, Justices of the Peace. The officials for 1850 included Isaac Fairbanks, Supervisor ; A. Schorno, Treasurer ; B. Fairbanks, Clerk. Those for 1851 cannot be clearly ascertained. The first election was held at the house of Isaac Fairbanks, on which occasion six votes were cast, by Benjamin and Isaac Fair banks, George N. Smith, George Harrington, Anton Schorno, and Darwin Drew. The next settlers in that vicinity were John Often, Peter Allen, Garret Brower, G. J. Weavers, John Deiters, J. H. Glupker, John Glupker, Jacob Deiters, J. II. Seiblink, J. J. Dekker, J. H. Lammen, B. Camps, and H. Bonselaar. Berend Timmerman moved from Overisel in 1852 to sec tion 24, in Fillmore, where his son Hendrick now lives. A list of those who were chosen annually, from 1852 to 1880, to be supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace, is hereto appended : * See Chapter XI. of the general history."], [255, "FILLMORE TOWNSHIP. 207 SUPERVISORS.

There was built there shortly aster the completion of the railway, in 1870, Telman, Hoffman & Wagenar's saw-mill, now carried on by H. Telman. In 1875, Telman, Hoffman & Lemmers built a fine grist-mill, with three run of stone, which, owing to litigation, was stopped in January, 1880. The first store opened at Fillmore Centre was that of Hen drik Kronemeyer, who began to trade there in 1874. The post-office was established in 1873, and G. Wagenar ap pointed postmaster. In June, 1874, he was succeeded by Hendrik Kronemeyer, the present incumbent. The village now contains three stores, and in railway shipments it makes a very satisfactory exhibit. The town-board in 1849 was composed of Isaac Fair banks, George N. Smith, and Benjamin Fairbanks, and a settlement with Manlius on road and school moneys, etc., was effected May 8th of that year. In 1850 the township now called Overisel was set off from Monterey and attached to Fillmore. In 1857 Overisel was detached and given separate jurisdiction. In 1850 the town board was com posed of Isaac Fairbanks, Anton Schorno, and Benjamin Fairbanks; in 1851, of Isaac Fairbanks, Anton Schorno, and George Harrington.

DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH AT GRAAFSCHAP. The first religious organization formed in the township of Fillmore was located at the village of Graafschap. The church was organized in 1848, and in the same year being incorporated as a society, purchased of G. Henevelt 81 acres on the east side of the Fillmore and Laketown line, which they laid out as the village of Graafschap, and upon which they built a log church, meetings having, however, been held for nearly a year before that time in the houses of settlers. The officers first chosen were Jans Rut gers, Stephen Lucas, Lambert Tinholt, and Henry Salmink, as elders, and Johannes Van Anroy and Mathias Naaye, as deacons. Upon the organization of the church, a call was sent to Rev. H. G. Klyn, in the province of Zeeland, kidgdom of the Netherlands, who came on at once to take charge, being accompanied, moreover, to America by- Adrian Zwemer, now pastor of the same church. Mr. Klyn, who served as pastor two years, now resides in Keokuk, Iowa, at the venerable age of eighty-six, and is still engaged in preaching. His successor at Graaf schap was Rev. Martin Ypma, upon whose retirement, in 1853, there was a vacancy in the regular succession for"], [256, "208 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. some years, although the pulpit was meanwhile supplied by the church at Holland. During Rev. Mr. Ypma's term the church parsonage was converted into a church, the old log cabin was abandoned, and a new parsonage was built. ship nearer home, and that year a church edifice was erected. The first elders chosen were G. Dalman, William Oonk, Garret Wildering. The deacons were Jacob Fork, Peter Knaber, and Frank Lucas. The first pastor was Rev. R. C. Knipers, who remained in charge until 1877, and was succeeded by Henry E. Dascher, the present pastor. About 70 families attend the church and enjoy public wor ship every Sunday. The church elders are William Oonk, Henry Dalman, William Kooyers, and Garret De Witt. The deacons are Jacob Fork, John D. Bloomers, Garrit Rooks, and J. W. Wildering. The Sunday-school, which is in charge of the pastor, has 8 teachers and 70 pupils. In 1S57 differences on religious opinion arose in the con gregation, and as a result about three-fourths of the mem bers decided to effect a new departure as the True Re formed Church of America. Being in the majority, they retained the church property, while the minority con tinued the original church organization at such times and in such places as they best eould for two years thereafter, and, although they were without a regular pastor, managed to enjoy preaching pretty regularly. In 1859 the present house of worship was built, and, in 1861, Dominie Peters, a graduate of the New Brunswick Seminary, was employed as the first pastor subsequent to the church division, in 1857. His successors were Dirk Broek in 1865, Dominie Ogger in 1871, William Van Derkley, who served until De cember, 1875, and Adrian Zwemer, the present pastor, who entered upon his pastorate in July, 1876. Mr. Zwemer remembers preaching, while he was a student at Holland, to the congregation in Mr. A. J. Neerken's house, in 1857-, when but 7 families worshiped with the church. Now the congregation includes 74 families. The present elders are G. Henevelt, A. J. Neerken, Albert Bekman, Herman Strabbing, and Hendrik Zuidweg. The deacons are Be rend Lugers, Stephen Speet, Garret Zalmink, Hendrik Joldersma, Hendrik Brinkman. The Sunday-school, in charge of the pastor, employs 12 teachers, and has the names of 85 scholars on its roll. Connected with the church is a Sabbath-school on section 2, in Laketown, at which 25 children usually attend, and which is in charge of Frederick Zwemer and George Henevelt. TRUE REFORMED CHURCH ON SECTION 28. This was organized in 1 868 by members of the Graafs chap church living in the southwestern portion of Fill more. A church edifice was built in 1868, and, being de stroyed in the forest fires of 1871, was rebuilt in the spring of 1872. The first elders and deacons were Dirk Lenters, John Leiblink, John Lohrman, H. Bruhn, and E. Bruhn. The first pastor was Rev. John Staat, whose successor, Rev. Mr. Skabus, was followed in 1875 by the present pi.stor, Rev. William Von Leyung. The average attendance is 90 families. The elders are R. Pastma, H. Helms, H. H. Dobben, and A. Kunnen. The deacons are Dirk Lenters and Henry Garvelink. EAST SAUGATUCK DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH. This church was formed Dec. 23, 1868, by a council com posed of Revs. A. C. Van Raalte, J. G. Nykerk, D. Broeck, and Elders G. J. Walderdenk and G. Henevelt. Twenty two members presented themselves at the organization, which was effected in a log school-house, on the town-line, in Manlius, where meetings had previously been held. Ed ward Sprick and A. Boesel were chosen elders, and H. S. Berksman and H. Dalman deacons. Directly after the organization a church edifice was built on the town-line, in Fillmore. Preaching was supplied until 1873, when Rev. J. F. Zwemer, now in charge, was employed as pastor. From a membership of 22 in 1868 the church has increased to a present strength of 1 1 0 families. The elders are Ed ward Spriek, G. Van Tubergen, J. Lankhorst, and J. Heeringa. The deacons are H. Neuwenberg, John Lub bers, B. Vandenberg, and John Eisen. The Sunday school has 12 teachers and 80 scholars. TRUE REFORMED CHURCH AT GRAAFSCHAP. After the division of the Dutch Reformed Church at Graafschap, in 1857, those who pronounced for the True Reformed Church retained, as has been stated, the church property, including a church, a parsonage, and the property upon which the village was laid out. They used the old parsonage for public worship until 1861, when they erected the commodious edifice now in use. Subsequent to the division, Rev. Mr. Bush occupied the pulpit for several years, preaching once in three weeks. There were other minis ters also until 1864. when Rev. D. Vanderwerp was called to be the first pastor. He preached every Sunday until 1872, after which, until 1874, the dependence was upon supplies. In 1874 Rev. H. W. Trealing was called, and remained until 1877. In April, 1879, his successor, the present pastor, Rev. R. T. Knipers, took charge. The church has prospered from the outset, and has now an aver age attendance of 150 families. The elders are Henry Lamping, Jacob De Frel, John Bouws, Egbert Fredericks, Henry Lubbers, H. H. Broenne, R. Brill. The deacons are Cornelius Lokker, Lueas Tinholt, G. Mokma, John Slink. The Sunday-school, in charge of the pastor, has 9 teachers, and a membership of 200. SCHOOLS. George N. Smith and Benjamin Fairbanks were chosen school inspectors at the election in 1849, and on the 5th of May organized districts No. 1 and No. 2. The organization of No. 3 is unrecorded, but on the 22d of June, 1852, it was ordered that No. 3 should contain the southeast quarter of the town. No. 4 was formed Aug. 21, 1851, fractional dis trict No. 5 in 1854, and fractional districts No. 6 and No. 7 in 1867. In 1853 the school children between the ages of four and eighteen numbered 206, including 40 in district* No. 1, 70 in No. 2, 20 in No. 3, and 76 in No. 4. The first record of the appointment of teachers appears in 1853, when Phineas A. Hagar, Harriet H. Hudson, Constance Bing ham, Mathew Janse, and Gracia P. Briggs were engaged.

News of the assault coming the next day to the ears of the town authorities, and a rigid search for Bergman failing to disclose his presence, the impression straightway pre vailed that his assailants had murdered him and made away with the body. They were arrested, on the charge of murder, and upon preliminary examination were held for assault with intent to kill. Being tried, they were found guilty of assault and battery, and were each fined $25. With the result of that trial, however, the good people of Fill more were not satisfied. Bergman had not been found, nor was he likely to be found, and the murder-theory, taking a fresh start, gained ground rapidly, until the public was more than ever convinced that Bergman had really been foully dealt with. The excitement was wide-spread and intense. At a town-meeting it was voted to offer a reward of $500 for the production of Bergman, dead or alive, and for a time nothing was talked of but the Bergman mystery and the evident determination of the townspeople to probe the affair to the bottom. A. Kirschman. THE BERGMAN MYSTERY Fillmore was somewhat agitated, in 1877, over what was known as the Bergman mystery, and to this day the subject is a matter of lively recollection. Some time before the year named, Bergman left Fillmore and his wife, and, as no word came from him, after a reasonable lapse of time his wife married again. Not long after that Bergman made his appearance in Fillmore, but, unlike Enoch Arden, was un willing to release the right to his spouse without protest. Husband No. 2 persuaded him, however, to waive his claim in consideration of a donation of $25, and, the bargain being thus peacefully concluded, Bergman abandoned himself to the delights of single blessedness. Meanwhile, Bergman was peacefnlly earning his bread in the State of Georgia, all unconscious of the solicitude exer cised on his behalf, and glad, no doubt, to be thus far from the muscular moralists of Fillmore. By chance his presence in the flesh in Georgia became revealed to the Fillmore people, and thereupon, satisfied that the man was not mur dered after all, they returned to tranquil contentment, saved their offered $500, and blessed their stars that the affair had turned out so happily at last. Unhappily for him, certain youthful but high-spirited citizens of Fillmore resolved to rebuke the heartless barter ing a wife away for a paltry $25, and so, coming upon Bergman in the shades of night, they assailed him most grievously, and wounded him sorely by means of divers and sundry blows. So disconcerted was Bergman at such treatment, and so frightened moreover at the prospect of GANGES.* the number of trees reached 84,000, of which 30,000 were four years old and over. The largest growers in the town ship have about 3000 trees each, while those who have 2000 each are quite numerous. The fruit of Ganges is mainly sent away at Fennville, on the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad, although considerable amounts are for warded by ships every season from the Ganges piers, from Douglas, and from South Haven. Tins township, organized in 1847 and named by Dr. Coats, a member of the Legislature from Otsego (who for some unknown reason selected the name of the holy river, of India), is known on the United States survey as town 2 north, in range 16 west, and is bounded north by Sauga tuck, south by Caseo, east by Clyde, and west by Lake Michigan. It is an excellent farming township, and near the lake the land is devoted chiefly to the cultivation of peaches. This branch of industry has come into prominence in Ganges within the past six years, and, as it continues to expand from year to year, the town seems likely to gain from this source no inconsiderable wealth. There is some lowland in the southeastern portion of the township, through which the north branch of the Black River flows, but it is being rapidly reclaimed. During the season of navigation communication by water with lake-ports is easy, while the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad is also near at hand. The township refused in October, 1869, by a vote of 167 to 21, to raise $30,000 in aid of the road just mentioned, but in NoA'em ber of the same year agreed, by a vote of 106 to 31, to donate $15,000. The railroad company did not, however, run its line through the township. Carefully-compiled statistics gave the number of peach trees of all ages in the township, in the spring of 1879, as 63,985, and according to the best estimates about 20,000 more Avere set out during the year, so that by Jan. 1, 1880, * By David Schwartz. 27"], [260, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 210 f) lend a helping hand to incoming settlers. He owned one of the two pairs of cattle in the settlement, and was always ready to loan them without reward to his less fortunate neighbors, frequently to his own serious inconvenience. He showed an unwearying determination to assist those who needed assistance whenever possible, and he is remembered for his kindness to this day. He was for a time coffin-maker in general to the surrounding country, and for that work never charged a penny. Once, when asked how much he received for making a coffin, he replied, \" Well, sir, when I get so that I'll have to charge for making a coffin I'll quit the business.\" THE PIONEERS. Harrison Hutchins, a New Yorker, led the way in the fall of 1838 to the settlement of Ganges, and where he then settled he lives to-day. He had come West in 1836, and while residing in Allegan had purchased 160 acres of land in Manlius in 1837, and the same amount on section 1 in Ganges. Meanwhile, in Allegan, in the fall of 1838, he put up a log cabin, 16 by 18 feet, on his Ganges tract. In November of that year he brought his sister and her three children to his house (he being himself unmarried), and began life as a pioneer. In December, 1838, John H. Billings, with a family For ten years after the advent of Mr. Loomis settlers came very slowly. In the south part of the township they did not begin until 1843, when A. N. Crawford located upon the lake-shore, and in 1845, when Timothy McDowell settled in Casco, the people of both townships were so few that Loomis and Hutchins went from near the north line of Ganges to assist in raising McDowell's barn. consisting of a wife and five children, came with Cyrus A. Coles to Ganges, to locate upon lands which Coles had pre viously entered. They moved into Hutchins' cabin, and, although the house had but one room, the two families, which, including Coles, numbered 13 persons, managed to live in it from December, 1838, to February, 1839. Mr. Billings then moved his family into his own cabin, on sec tion 3, where he had bought land of Coles. In that same month (February, 1839) James W. Wadsworth, who had come to Manlius, near the Ganges line, with James McCor mick, in December, 1838, made a settlement upon sec tion 2. A. N. Crawford, alluded to above, who had lived in Cal houn County eight years, was the first settler on the lake shore ; and when he located upon section 30, in 1843, his nearest neighbors on the north were Levi Loomis in Ganges and James Hale in Newark (now Saugatuck), each more than six miles distant, while there was nobody south of him to the base-line. The next settlers in that locality were Nelson Root, who stayed only a year, W. R. Clark, H. F. Bostwick, and Orville Hudson. Mr. Bostwick's widow and A. N. Crawford are the oldest living members of the little pioneer band who first located in that portion of Ganges. The neighborhood then consisted of the families of Hutchins, Billings, Wadsworth, and McCormick, the latter being nearer to the Ganges people than to his fellow townsmen of Manlius. Wadsworth was the only one of them all who boasted the ownership of a pair of cattle. Cyrus Coles was a bachelor, but intended to make a settle ment upon his land in section 3. He did not, however, like the idea of pioneering alone, and, after helping to roll up \"Wadsworth's cabin, returned to the East. Subsequently he married there and brought his wife to his Ganges farm, where he still resides. C. 0. Hamlin made a settlement in December, 1846, upon land in section 32 that he bought of Nelson Root. Hamlin set up a blacksmith-shop, which proved to be a great convenience to the country around, and to which people often brought their horses for shoeing from Singa pore and Manlius. In February, 1839, when Hutchins, Wadsworth, and Billings were the only residents in the town, Ganges was entirely a forest, with the usual accompaniments of Indians, wolves, deer, etc. The Indians were all friendly, and much given to trading with the whites. The wolves were so numerous as entirely to prevent the keeping of sheep ; while the deer were also plentiful, furnishing the settlers with venison in lieu of the mutton of which they were deprived. In 1845, John B. Goodeve, of New York, bought of one Bascom some land on section 4, in township 2 (now Ganges), and with his wife and two children started by land for Michigan. On the way they were joined in Ohio by A. S. Collins and family, and all came to Ganges in company. Collins bought 40 acres of Goodeve, and while they were building Goodeve's house both lived with their families in an abandoned log cabin on James Wadsworth's place. In the spring of 1846, however, they both had houses of their own. As evidence regarding the character of the timber, Mr. Goodeve says that from a piece of 5| acres he cut logs enough to make 50,000 feet of lumber and over 400 cords of hard-wood. After that he cleared the balance of the land, and when his men came to \" log\" for him they remarked that the number of logs upon the ground indicated that there hadn't been a stick hauled away. The three families already mentioned were for two years the only white inhabitants of Ganges. In 1841 they were joined by Levi Loomis. That gentleman came from New York in 1838, and with his brother Lyman \u2014 both carpen ters \u2014 had worked at Singapore, at the mouth of the Kala mazoo, during the intervening period. Levi Loomis was noted during his stay in Singapore as a skillful hunter, and in the slaughter of deer was especially successful. In 1841 he purchased 160 acres on section 11 in Ganges, and made his home upon it. He continued, however, to do consider able carpenter-work, erecting many houses and helping to build a number of mills in the county. Mr. Loomis was a lonely settler in the midst of a densely-timbered tract, al though he could reach his nearest neighbor by a mile's travel. As may be imagined, roads in such a country were not easily made. There was a tolerably good road on the lake shore, but nowhere else in the township. The nearest neighbor to Collins and Goodeve was David Updike, who had, a few days before their coming, moved upon a place on section 8, now occupied by S. I. B. Hutchinson, and first settled by a German. Their next nearest neighbor was James Hale, in the present township of Saugatuck. He was himself a worthy neighbor, always willing to"], [261, "Residence of CHARLES 0. HAMLIN. Ganges, Allegan Co., Michigan"], [262, ""], [263, "GANGES TOWNSHIP. 211 Amos Hale, who had lived at Singapore from 1844 to 1846, located in the last-named year in Ganges. His widow married E. S. Collins. Besides those already named, the residents of Ganges in 1845 included Mr. Baragar, Mr. Bankson (on the present O'Brien place), Mr. Stewart (on section 11), Thomas Carter, G. F. Hughes, Mr. Roach, and S. M. Thompson. Among those who came soon after wards were Amos Hale, Samuel Weaver, Benjamin and Nathaniel Plummer, Roswell Daily, Orlando Weed, Richard Mack, William Dunn, Thomas Wilson, Charles M. Link, Wm. Dornan, William Warren (whose wife's son, G. D. Dean, now living on section 21, came when a lad with his mother), Larned Cook, W. R. Clark, Jonathan Warrick, Orville Hudson, T. Tracey (who died 1879, aged eighty nine), J. R. Kelley, Harrison Fry, the Bardens, Nyes, and others. Russell Hall himself fell ill and died, his being the first death in what is now the township of Ganges. Rev. L. Gage, of Plainwell, a Methodist circuit-minister, preached Mr. Hall's funeral sermon, which was the second sermon preached in the township. Mr. Hall was buried on Mr. Hutchins' place, and there, for some years afterwards, was the only burial-ground the township had. PHYSICIANS. At that time there was no physician to be had short of Allegan. Dr. Chauncey B. Goodrich settled in the town ship soon afterwards, however, and until his death, in 1879, was almost continuously in practice in the western part of Allegan County, in which he was for many years the only physician. Dr. E. E. Brunson has been practicing in Ganges since 1875. Richard Mack located upon section 31, where he had bought 120 acres of his brother-in-law, A. N. Crawford. Peter Sargent, an early settler in Clyde, removed to section 1, in Ganges, where he now lives. Nathan Slayton, who had visited Ganges soon after 1841, settled ultimately on section 10, where he lived until his removal to Kansas, in 1870. Walter Billings, who had come to Michigan in 1 834, living meanwhile near Detroit, in Allegan, and in Clyde, moved to Ganges in 1851, where he now lives upon a place he bought of James Wadsworth. MILLS. The pioneers of Ganges were not very well off with re spect to grist-mills. Saw-mills were convenient enough, but there was not a very pressing demand for lumber by the early settlers of Ganges, who generally rolled up log houses as the cheapest and most expeditious method of providing homes. The nearest grist-mill was at Allegan, and a journey thither, over the roads of that day, iuvolved a trip of two days, and sometimes more. Occasionally a family which had used up the last of its stock of bread would be in sore need before the journey to mill and back could be accomplished, although some neighbor was gener ally found to supply the deficiency. Mrs. Plummer remem bers that when the family of Ralph R. Mann reached their new home in Manlius they found themselves without bread, and, learning that Mr. Plummer was their nearest neighbor, five miles or more distant, they sent a messenger on foot to the residence of that gentleman to ask the loan of a loaf of bread. Fortunately, the Plummers had the bread to spare, and willingly supplied the wants of their distant neighbors. Among other early settlers may also be mentioned H. J. Atwater, S. W. Loveridge, William Goodwin, John Stil son, Hiram Lee (a blacksmith), who sold his place to Rufus Dowd in 1862, A. A. Johnson (a salt-water sailor, from Maine, who bought a place on section 9, of Nathan Plum mer, in 1854), Simeon Staring, Charles McVey, William Dunn, Philander Taylor, S. I. B. Hutchinson, W. A. Sey mour (who bought the W. R. Clark place), J. Gardner, R. J. Knox, William Darling, E. Penfold, W. McCarthy, R. C. Eaton, Joseph Trigg, and Joseph Johnson. ROADS. The first highway of any consequence in the township was the lake-shore road, which was laid out about 1843 by Mr. Chichester, the county surveyor, and ultimately run through to South Haven. The first highway commissioners chosen in Ganges were Roswell Daily, Nathan Slayton, and John Thayer. In 1847 the town was laid out into six road districts. Previous to that twelve roads, including the Breedsville road, had been laid by Newark township in the territory subsequently called Ganges. After 1847 town roads were rapidly constructed. DROWNED IN THE LAKE. Mention will be made in the history of Saugatuck of a calamity on the Kalamazoo River in 1841 whereby three children of John H. Billings, together with Mrs. Billings, were drowned. Three other children of Mr. Billings, in the boat on that occasion, were saved, but one of them, Ozias by name, seemed born under an adverse star, for he subsequently lost his life in Hutchins' Lake, in Ganges, while crossing on the ice. He was warned that the journey was a risky one, but boy-like he persisted in making the venture, and before he had proceeded far felt the ice giving way beneath him. He struggled bravely to save himself, but in vain, and soon went down beneath the icy waters of the lake. FIRST BIRTH AND DEATH. Singularly enough, the first birth and death in Ganges both took place in the family of one who was not a settled resident of the township. In 1840, Russell Hall, a brother in-law of Harrison Hutchins, had a piece of land in Man lius from Mr. Hutchins, and while making it ready for a residence was living in the house of that gentleman in Ganges. While he was living there, in the year before named, his son, Daniel H. Hall, was born, he being the old est white native of the township. He now lives in Kansas. The same year, and while still living in Hutchins' house, TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION. Township No. 2, in range 16, was a portion of the civil township of Newark until 1847, and when Ganges was formed in that year it included survey-townships No. 2 and No. 1 now known respectively as Ganges and Casco, the latter bavin\" been set off iu 1854.

Plummerville, so called, was founded in 1846, by Benja min Plummer and Orlando Weed, who came from Sauga tuck and set up a saw-mill on the creek near there. 0. R. Johnson and a Mr. Noyes soon started a tannery near by. Plummer opened a store, and, in company with Mr. Robin son, built a lake-pier, four hundred feet in length, at which considerable lumber and cordwood was shipped. Mr. Weed went to California in 1849, and then Mr. Plummer carried on the saw-mill alone until about 1858. The tannery flourished until 1875. John and Loren Baldwin, now living on section 8, and Charles M. Link, a resident of sec tion 5, were employees in Plummer & Weed's saw-mill, which was the first one of any kind erected in Ganges. The second was put up by G. F. Hughes, a short distance south. Mr. Plummer, who was one of the pioneers of Saugatuck, where he located in 1834, still resides at Plum merville, which, however, has ceased to show any of the characteristics of a village. The officials chosen on that occasion were the following : Supervisor, A. H. Hale ; Clerk, S. H. Weaver ; Treasurer, Levi Loomis ; Justices of the Peace, N. D. Plummer and G. F. Hughes ; School Inspectors, Daniel Platt and A. H. Hale ; Directors of the Poor, J. W. Wadsworth and Na than Slayton; Assessors, J. W. Wadsworth and J. B. Goodeve ; Commissioriers of Highways, Nathan Slayton, Roswell Daily, J. B. Goodeve ; Constables, John Lutz, Henry Baragar, S. H. Weaver, and 0. C. Thayer ; Path masters, District No. 1, Henry Baragar ; No. 2, David Updike ; No. 3, N. D. Plummer ; No. 4, C. 0. Hamlin ; No. 5, Timothy McDowell. At the same meeting $300 were voted for ordinary township purposes, and $250 for roads and bridges. PIER COVE. At the election in 1848 there were 38 votes ; in 1855 there were 62 ; in 1858 there were 147 ; in 1867 there were 155 ; in 1871 the number advanced to 205, and in 1875 declined to 164. The village known as Pier Cove was laid out by Deacon Sutherland, in 1851, upon section 5, where he had located in 1849. The first improvement of any consequence was a steam saw-mill, erected by Abbott, Squires & Co. Franklin Nichols set up a turning-lathe directly afterwards, and sub sequently transformed it into a grist-mill, which has been in continuous operation to the present time. Mr. Sutherland built a pier into the lake, sixteen feet wide and three hun dred and twenty-three feet in length, and on subsequent occasions made additions which brought the total length up to two hundred feet and the width to forty feet. A store was opened by Mr. Cranston, a tavern was built by J. J. Gardner and George Dunn, and several other residents located in the young village. Business reached such a volume presently that the village boasted of four stores, a population of 20 families, and such brisk times at the pier that it was no rare thing to see a half-dozen vessels loading there with lumber, cordwood, etc., at the same time. Affairs prospered until 1867, when, the supply of timber becoming exhausted, the saw-mill was discontinued, ship ments ceased, and the place relapsed into quietude. It has now a store, post-office, and a population of a dozen families, and during the proper season of navigation does something in the way of shipping fruit. A list of those chosen annually from 1848 to 1880 to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace is given below. SUPERVISORS. 1848, A. H. Hale; 1849, C. B.

The name of the office remained Pier Cove until 1874, when it was changed to Ganges. erland, Almira Hudson, Charlotte Collins, Mrs. Sutherland, Eunice Crawford, and Bathsheba Rockwell. The first deacon was Marcus Sutherland, and the first clerk Levi Loomis. Among the pastors who served the church during the first twenty years of its existence were Elders Austin Harmann, C. P. Grosevenor, Silas Bowker, Abner Webb, E. O'Brien, and William Munger. New Casco post-office was established in Casco township in 1856, when Lawrence Hyde was appointed postmaster. Wm. P. Davis was the second appointee, and Wm. 0. Packard the third. During the administration of the latter gentleman the location of the office was changed to Pack ard's Corners, in Ganges. After Mr. Packard, Wm. Chase wa3 the postmaster, he being followed by Gco. T. Clapp, the present incumbent. Early in 1879 the name of the office was changed to that of Glenn, which it now bears. Worship is held at present in the Lewis school-house, although a movement is afoot looking to the speedy erec tion of a church edifice. Rev. J. E. Platt, the present pastor, has been in charge since 1877. The membership is 54. The deacons are Harrison Hutchins and G. W. Loveridge. The trustees are Glenn O'Brien, Gillette Spen cer, and Edward Hutchins. Peach Belt post-office, on the northern line of the town ship, was established Feb. 1, 1879. Walter Billings was the postmaster until December of that year ; in January, 1880, John Hoover was appointed. THE SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH. The Second Baptist Church was organized Sept. 22, 1868, by members of the First Church and others, aggre gating, all told, 17 persons. The first pastor was Rev. Silas Bowker ; the first deacons were William P. Sherman and J. H. Barden, and the clerk Levi Loomis. The present deacons are Levi Loomis, William P. Sherman, and 0. P. Carman. Weekly Suuday services are held by Rev. J. E. Platt, in the \" Sherman\" school district. The membership is now 38. CHURCHES. METHODIST CLASSES. The first sermon preached in Ganges was delivered by Rev. L. Gage, of Plainwell (a Methodist circuit-preacher), in James Wadsworth's house, during the year 1840. After that Mr. Gage generally preached in Ganges once in four weeks. His circuit covered a wide stretch of country, extending from the Kalamazoo Circuit to the lake-shore. He was a tireless worker, and for that reason came to be known as \" the breaking-up plow.\" Gage organized a class which worshiped at times in Wadsworth's house and barn, and also in an old log house on Harrison Hutchins' place. Subsequently a second class was formed, a mile and a half south of the town line, in what was known as the \" White School -House.\" This latter was afterwards united with the Pier Cove class. UNITED BRETHREN IN CHRIST. A United Brethren class was formed at the Pier Cove school-house by Rev. Mr. Foote. in 1861, with a member ship of 24. The first class-leader was Lorenzo Weed. Until 1875, services were held in the school-house. The class had at one time a membership of 50, but it now num bers only 35. Among the immediate successors of Mr. Foote were Rev. Messrs. Buck, Baldwin, and Linn. The present pastor is Rev. Mr. De Long, of Casco, who preaches at Pier Cove once in two weeks, and similarly to a class worshiping in the Sherman school district. The charge is in the Ganges Circuit, which includes six appointments. The church now used by the Pier Cove class was built in 1875. The present class-leader is Arthur Howland, the trustees are Elisha Weed, Robert Linn, Edwin Goodwin, and John Goodwin, and the Sunday-school superintendent is Edwin Goodwin. The Methodist class now worshiping near Pier Cove was organized about 1 852. The first members were V. Wads worth and wife, E. S. Collins and wife, Wm. Corner and wife, Jas. W. Wadsworth and wife, Charles Goodeve, Mr. and Mrs. Roswell Daily, Mr. and Mrs. Nathaniel Plum mer, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Dunn, Mrs. Samuel Weaver, Mr. and Mrs. Simmons. Meetings were at first held at the houses of Nathaniel Plummer aud E. S. Collins, and at the Wadsworth school house until 1867, when the present church edifice was built. Among the earliest pastors were Rev. Messrs. Bliss, Boyington, Erkenbach, Mosher, Campbell, Eidridge, and Earl. The present pastor is Rev. N. M. Steele, who preaches at Pier Cove once a week. David Hoover is the present class-leader. The trustees are Wm. Dunn, E. T. Collins, Philander Taylor, Wm. Corner, James Gardner, David Hoover, Wm. Ferguson, V. Wadsworth, and John Wadsworth. The Sunday-school superintendent is Wm. Corner. There is also a class at Packard's Corners, known as the South Ganges class. Its membership is 11, and its leader German Richards. THE WESLEYAN METHODIST CLASS OF PEACH BELT. This church was formed by Rev. Mr. Burnell, in the Billings school-house, with 14 members, Charles Atwater being the class-leader. Rev. Mr. Grinnell, of Ganges, is now the pastor, and is in charge of the Peach Belt Circuit, which includes Laketown, Peach Belt, and Mack's Land ing. The church stewards are William Ledig, Walter Bil ling, and Mr. Frazier. Meetings are held in the Billings school-house once in two weeks. SCHOOLS. School district No. 1 was formed in April, 1847, and had for its first teacher Isaac Stewart, who had previously been teachin\" a school in James Wadsworth's house. Districts 2 3 and 4 were organized July 20, 1847. Among the early district school-teachers besides Stewart were Mary Platt, Samuel II. Weaver, Helen E. Seymour, Frances THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH. This body was organized as a branch of the church in Allegan, July 16, 1853, by Elder Harvey Munger.

Mr. Penfold is of English extraction, and was born in Sussex, England, May 21, 1828. Having become im pressed with the superior advantages accorded artisans and laborers in the New World, he, at the age of twenty-one, bade adieu to the mother-country and embarked for America. Aster a brief residence in New York State Mr. Penfold returned to England, and was united in marriage to Miss Caroline Gratwick, who was born Dec. 31, 1827, and was a native of Sussex County, as were also her parents. Two children add to their happiness, \u2014 Henry J., born Oct. 11, 1856, and Charles E., whose birth occurred Nov. 21, 1862. An adopted daughter, Miss Hattie, is also a member of the pleasant family circle. TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES. During the winter of 1877-78 a strong temperance movement was started in Ganges with the organization in school district No. 10 of a Red Ribbon Club. The cause prospered steadily from the outset, and in February, 1880, was encouraged by four Red Ribbon Clubs in various portions of the town, with a promise of much increase of strength. Mr. Penfold returned again with his bride to America, where, in connection with his brother Henry, who had meanwhile lest his native shore, Edward engaged in labor in New York State. During the year 1855 they removed to Michigan, where he purchased 40 acres of land in Gan ges. This was soon transformed from a wilderness into fruitful fields, and two years later sold and a more exten sive farm purchased, upon which his present residence stands. During one of the big fires in that year of fires (1871), and on the day Chicago was burned, his log house and the lumber and shingles for a new one, and two barns, together with all utensils, were burned. THE SAUGATUCK AND GANGES POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY. This society was organized Sept. 30, 1871, at the village of Douglas, as the Lake-Shore Agricultural and Pomological Society. It then embraced members from the twelve west ern towns of Allegan County. The officers chosen at the organization were D. W. Wiley, President ; J. J. Holmes, S. R. Lewis, James McCormick, B. F. Dressier, R. C. Eaton, and R. B. Newnham, Vice-Presidents ; C. A. En sign, Secretary; E. W. Perry, Corresponding Secretary; J. S. Owen, Treasurer ; H. H. Goodrich, J. P. Leland, Alexander Hamilton, and J. F. Taylor, Directors. The charter members numbered 85. During the late war both Edward and Henry Penfold were actively engaged in the contest, the latter of whom sacrificed his life for the cause. In 1877, Mr. Penfold, accompanied by two neighbors, visited again his native land for a brief period. They revived many pleasant associa tions, but returned fully impressed with the advantages of a republican over a monarchical government. Mr. Penfold is regarded as a public-spirited citizen, and his career has fully justified the estimate in which he is held. His wife and his eldest son are exemplary members of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. A report, issued in 1878, set forth the following facts in regard to the society and the fruit business : \" The society believed they had the fairest part of the State for their field of labor, and that within its limits was contained all that the farmer or fruit grower could desire. From the commencement of this society, when there was not fruit enough raised in this vicinity for home consumption, till tho present time there has been a constant and steady increase in the agricultural and pomological productions not surpassed by any other locality, and equaled by very few. \"The high price of fruit, and especially of peaches, during the first years of this society gradually gave prominence to pomology in its discussions. The remoter towns paid less aud less attention to it till the membership was confined mostly to the towns of Sauga tuck and Ganges. These two facts being discussed, it was decided to change the name of the organization, and accordingly the change C. O. HAMLIN. C. O.

Loomis, who were the parents of four sons and a daughter. Their son, Levi, was born in Madison Co., N. Y., Sept. 6, 1810. On the death of his mother he found a home with a family friend, \u2014 Dr. Foot, \u2014 with whom he remained five years, his time having been principally occupied in school duties. He later engaged in labor, and with the proceeds liquidated the indebtedness upon his father's farm. Sub sequently, having learned the trade of a carpenter and joiner, he, in June, 1835, removed to Michigan, landing in Detroit on the 23d ; July 3d he went to Marshall ; on the 4th went to Grand Rapids ; thence to St. Joseph, and crossed the lake to Illinois. He returned to St. Joseph on the 28th, and commenced work on the steamboat \" Royalon.\" On the 8th of September ho quit work on account of the ague. He sailed on the lake from May 1st to June 19th, being towed from St. Joseph to Swan Creek, Allegan County. He built a mill, thirty-five by fifty, doing all the framing and laying foundation, and within three weeks, with the help of a millwright, had it in running operation. He remained there until the 10th of May, 1837, when he returned to the East, and was married to Miss Sally Ann Skinner May 25th, same year, and returned to Michigan, crossing the State in a wagon, going from Allegan to the mouth of the Kalamazoo River on a raft. Of their eight children five are married and living near their parents' home. C. 0. Hamlin, like most boys of his time, passed his boy hood days with little advantages of schooling, and less time for play and recreation, hard work being the portion of nearly all in those days. At the age of twenty he commenced life for himself, working on a farm for the first years by the day and month. Then he learned the blacksmith's trade, and at the age of twenty-five he married, in Stark Co., Ohio, Dec. 14, 1837, Miss Margaret M. Fisher, daughter of Reuben and Lavina (Knox) Fisher, both natives of Crawford Co., Pa., where Miss Margaret was born, Aug. 2, 1820. Mr. Fisher's death occurred in Michigan in 1851 or '52, and Mrs. Fisher's in Kalamazoo, in 1873. After the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Hamlin they com menced housekeeping in the town, Mr. Hamlin working at his trade. Here they remained for nine years, and in the spring of 1846 started westward with their family of five children, traveling in the usual way of those days, by wagon, stopping first at Battle Creek for some six months ; then moved to aud settled on the farm where they now live, con sisting of one hundred and sixty acres on section 32, and which only had a small improvement when they pur chased, and, though Mr. Hamlin has continued working at his trade, being the only blacksmith in that vicinity for many years, still has managed his farm with success and profit. The early home of Mr. and Mrs. Loomis after their mar riage was Singapore, where they erected the first dwelling in the hamlet. Mr. Loomis followed for a period of years his calling of a millwright, assisting to build a mill fifty by one hundred and twenty feet. In the spring of 1839 he moved to Saugatuck, then to Kalamazoo ; left there in January, 1840, for a farm of eighty acres which he had purchased in 1839, which was then uncleared land, and is the site of the present homestead. Eighty acres has since been added, and the whole farm placed under a high state of cultivation. Aster becoming a farmer he was not satisfied, but built a mill at Fennville ; built and supplied it from his farm ; but fire wiped it out, and about four hun dred thousand feet of lumber, worth about six thousand dollars. He then went back to his farm satisfied. Much of this land is devoted to fruit-raising, ten acres being de voted to apples and twelve to peaches. This has proved exceedingly lucrative. He may justly be said to have been the pioneer in the peach-growing interest in the western portion of the county. Mr. Loomis was formerly a Whig in his political convictions, and has fallen very naturally into the Republican ranks. He is not in any sense an office-seeker, though several minor offices in the township have fallen to his lot. He was the earliest assessor in Saugatuck, and, with the assistance of Mrs. Loomis, made the first assessment-roll in the township. Both he and his wife are members of the Baptist Church, and are, in their daily walk and conversation, exemplars of the faith they profess. Mr. and Mrs. Hamlin are the parents of the following children, who have grown to manhood and womanhood, viz. : Harvey R., born Dec. 10, 1838 ; Melissa L., born April 13, 1810 ; Jarret H., born Sept. 13, 1841, died Dec. 12, 1861, in the army; Malinda M., born May 7, 1843 ; Maria O., born Dec. 22, 1844 ; Caroline F., born Oct. 23, 1848 ; Emeline M., born Aug. 2, 1850 ; Ida A., born Sept. 1, 1852, died May 22, 1873; Viola A., born Aug. 12, 1854; Charles F., born March 31, 1862; besides these, three have died in childhood. In addition to the home-farm of one hundred and sixty acres, Mr. Hamlin owns other land in the township to the amount of one hundred and twenty five acres. He has always followed mixed farming, but, like many others of this towuship, has of late years inter ested himself in fruit-raising, and with success. Politically, Mr. Hamlin is a Republican, but never seek ing the emoluments of political work, leaving for others who wish them the offices and honors. Their family are all grown to manhood and womanhood, and, with the exception of one son and one daughter, have left home seeking fortunes for themselves. Mr. Hamlin built the first pier on this portion of the lake. It is now known as the Clapp Pier, and was built by him in 1860. Two of their sons were soldiers in the war for the pre servation of the Union, one of whom sacrificed his life iu 1864. With this affliction, together with the loss of two other of their children, their lives have been saddened, though many occasions for thankfulness are still gratefully recognized by them. LEVI LOOMIS. Mr. Loomis is the direct descendant of Revolutionary stock, one of his ancestors having been a soldier of the war of 1812. His parents were Josiah and Rebecca (Sheen)"], [272, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN 216 MRS. BENJAMIN PLUMMER, BENJAMIN PLUMMER. BENJAMIN PLUMMER Few residents of the county of Allegan are more familiar with its pioneer history or more closely identified with its early interests than is Benjamin Plummer, who, in 1834, became a settler within its boundaries. He was born Nov. 20, 1802, in Maine, having been the oldest child of David and Hannah Ames Plummer, both natives of New Hamp shire. son, has the honor of having been the first white child in Saugatuck, where his parents removed in 1834. After a residence of twelve years in the latter township, where all the deprivations incident to pioneer life were endured, they removed to Ganges, their present home. Both lumbering and farming engaged Mr. Plummer's attention here, as had been the case previously. His original purchase was one hundred and fifty acres. This, by division among his chil dren, has been reduced to fifty, which is now cultivated. During the ravages in 1853 of the cholera in Michigan, Mr. and Mrs. Plummer were severely afflicted in the loss of four children in one week. This severe dispensation has marked an era in their lives which is otherwise fraught with many happy memories. Mr. Plummer's political career has not been an eventful one. He is a staunch Republican, though not an office-seeker. They were for a brief period residents of Pennsylvania, after which they removed to Wayne Co., Ohio. His father having died in 1828, the mother accompanied her son to Michigan, where her death occurred in 1857. Mr. Plummer, in 1827, married Miss Elvina Andrews, who was born in Onondaga Co., N. Y., in 1805, her parents having been natives of Connecticut, and pioneers to Ohio in 1824. Mr. and Mrs. Plummer's family circle embraced seven children, four of whom are now living.

The life of William Dornan presents a conspicuous example of the power of industry to overcome obstacles. He was born in Columbiana Co., Ohio, March 30, 1820, his father, a native of Pennsylvania, having moved from that State to Ohio a short time previous to William's birth. The subject of our sketch was afflicted with the loss of his mother at an early age, her death occurring in 1830, and soon after William drifted from the parental roof and became, as soon as possible, independent of other aid than that afforded by his own hands. His father's death occurred in Indiana in 1845 or '46. In religious convictions he is in fellowship with the Methodist Church, of which he is a member. S. I. B. HUTCHINSON. The subject of this biography is descended from Revo lutionary stock, his maternal grandfather, Joseph Beecher, having been a captain in the war of 1776. Mr. Hutchin son was born May 18, 1809, in Chenango Co., N. Y., and until his twentieth year was engaged in labor incident to farming pursuits. In May, 1829, he became impressed with the advantages aiforded by the State of Michigan to young men of energy, and bade adieu to the scenes of his early life. Arriving at Monroe, Mich., he pursued the trade of a brickmaker for a period of three years. This calling frequently necessitated travel over a wide range of territory, and Mr. Hutchinson remembers traversing the ground now covered by the city of Toledo when not a dwelling marked the site of the present thriving commer cial centre. In 1834 he located a farm in Emmett, Cal houn Co., upon which he soon after removed and lived the solitary life of a bachelor. In the fall of 1847, William was married to Miss Nancy McClurg, a former resident of his native town, her parents having removed to Ohio from Pennsylvania in the fall of 1844. Mr. Dornan visited Michigan on a prospecting tour previously, but did not remove his family thither until 1851. He then located on section 20 in Ganges township, clearing up the farm of eighty acres first purchased, and, selling that, bought one hundred and sixty acres on sections 20 and 29, which he still owns, and where he lived until within a short time, now living on section 7, having recently purchased a fruit-farm of thirty-seven acres, a sketch of which can be seen upon another page. Mr. Dornan was severely afflicted by the loss of his wife in 1870, who left a family of six boys and two girls, all of whom are, with the exception of the youngest, still living. He was a second time married, to Mrs. Simpson, Nov. 23, 1873, who was a native of Pennsylvania, her maiden name being Mary Jane Riheldaffar ; she came to Michigan with her first husband in 1858. In May, 1842, he was married to Miss Charlotte Hughes, daughter of John and Elizabeth Hughes, of England, her birthplace. She came to America when seven years of age, and became a resident of Calhoun County in 1840. Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson have had four children, two of whom are now residing in Douglas, Allegan Co. The re maining two are deceased, the so.p having repaired to Cali fornia in pursuit of health, where he died in 1879 ; the daughter's death occurred in 1870. Mr. Hutchinson, in 1862, disposed of his extensive farm in Calhoun County, embracing three hundred and twenty acres, and removed to his present residence, the land of which has been devoted principally to the raising of choice varieties of fruit. Mr. Dornan is an advocate of the principles of the Greenback\" party, being formerly a Democrat, though but little interested in political matters, being wholly absorbed in his farming and business interests, although spared much of the responsibility of the farm management by the ability and judgment of his sons, who have been remark ably successful in all the departments of agriculture to which their attention has been directed, his crop of wheat last year of thirty acres averaging over forty bushels per acre, some going as high as fifty-five. In common with many of the pioneers of the State, Mr. Dornan's advantages for education were limited, and he has experienced many of the privations of pioneer life, but the inherent quality of self-reliance he possesses in an He is a firm advocate of the principles of the Republi can party, though not an active partisan in politics. In religious opinions both Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson are lib eral, with a profound respect for the convictions of others. 28"], [276, "gun plain; As an agricultural district, Gun Plain stands in the front rank among Allegan County townships. Indeed, for many years succeeding its first settlement it took the lead of all others as regards the number of acres of improved land, value of live-stock, and farm products. The township bearing this name embraces the territory designated in the United States survey as township No. 1 north, of range No. 11' west, and is situated in the south east corner of Allegan County. Barry County joins it on the east, and Kalamazoo County on the south, while the townships of Otsego and Martin, in Allegan, form respec tively its western and northern boundaries. Its population in 1850 was 587 inhabitants ; in 1860, 1068 ; and in 1874 (the time of taking the last enumera tion) it had a total of 2466 inhabitants. With 784 voters, it has now (1880) an estimated population of 3500 inhab itants. Except those portions bordering upon its water-courses and the beautiful tract known as \" Gun Plains,\" which are comparatively level, the surface is generally rolling, and in a few instances hilly, the highest points attaining an alti tude of one hundred and fifty feet above Lake Michigan. ORIGINAL SURVEYS AND FIRST LAND-ENTRIES. The township boundary-lines were run by John Mullett, deputy United States surveyor, in December, 1825, and the sectional lines by Sylvester Sibley, in March, 1831. The original forests were deciduous in their nature, beech, maple, oak, whitewood, sycamore, lynn, and ash predominating, and the growth most dense on the bottom lands skirting the streams. Although pine was found in many places, it never flourished extensively on any par ticular section. \" Gun Plains\" was a burr-oak opening of the finest quality and prairie-like in its appearance. Fre quently but two or three trees were found standing upon an acre. The soil of the plains, rich and friable in its nature, yielded readily to cultivation when once broken. The soil of the township generally is excellent, being a sand and clay loam with alluvial deposits intermixed, and is distinguished by no traits rendering it different from that of the greater part of the Peninsular State. The first purchase of lands in this township and in the county was made by Sylvester Sibley, of Wayne Co. Mich., June 15. 1831. His purchase embraced the northeast fractional quarter of section 30, and was chosen, doubtless, while he was engaged running the subdivision lines. _Samuel C. Wells, of Jefferson Co., Ohio, concluded the next pur chase, June 22, 1831, his choice resting upon a portion of section 18, and on the 9th of December, 1831, Hull Sher wood, of Otsego, Mich, bought lands situated upon section 15. These three entries included all made during the year 1831 in Allegan County. The principal water-courses are the Kalamazoo and Gun Rivers, and Silver Creek. The former enters the township on the south line of section 33, and thence, in its rapid flow towards the great lake, pursues a northwest course, and, intersecting sections 33, 32, 29,' 30, and 19, leaves the township by crossing the west line of the latter section. By the construction of dams and an artificial channel at the village of Plainwell, excellent water-power is obtained and utilized by various mills, village water-works, etc. Other early entries for parts of sections are mentioned by years as follows: 1832.

Gun River takes its rise in a lake of the same name in Barry County, and, as a tributary to the Kalamazoo, flows in a southwesterly direction across the northern part of this township, and finally effects a junction with the latter stream in the eastern part of Otsego. Its current is sluggish, and extensive swamps and marshes abound along its course. These marshes were of great benefit to the early settlers, for here they were enabled to obtain pasturage and hay for their stock at a time when the present well-cultivated fields were covered with forests. By dredging and the cutting away of drift-wood, thousands of acres now valueless can aud will yet be reclaimed. 1834. Lucius Lindsley, Chenango Co., N. Y., section 30, June.

Pine Creek, and removed his family to that location, bavins; purchased for their occupancy a small board shanty erected by an earlier pioneer. In company with Charles Miles, he managed this mill until July, 1S32, when it was burned. He then tore down his shanty, and, moving the material to his land in the present township of Gun Plain, erected with it the first habitation in range 11 of Allegan County. This house stood on the north side of the road, opposite the eastern part of the cemetery, and was first occupied early in the fall of 1832. It was a story and one-half in height, and was constructed by fastening the boards \u2014 which ran up and down, barn fashion \u2014 to the frame with wooden pins. A floor of loose boards and a door finished its ap pointments. The cooking was done outside. Mrs. Thomp son relates that while occupying this shanty she was greatly annoyed by the dogs owned by her Indian neighbors. They would dig holes under the sills of the house, and, by pushing aside the loose flooring, thereby gain an entrance and steal any and all eatables left in their reach, and it was difficult to imagine a place which those wolfish dogs could not reach. The Indians seemed to think more of them than of their wives, and as this was the time of tbe \" Black-Hawk war,\" when all Indians in Michigan were looked upon with fear and suspicion by the few white fam ilies then in the interior, Mrs. Thompson's position was not a pleasant one, as can well be imagined. 1836.

Upon the organization of the township of Allegan* in 1833, Mr. Thompson was elected township clerk. During the same year the Plainwell post-office was established, and he was appointed postmaster. In the fall of 1834, Dr. Thompson, with his family, returned to Ohio, where he remained a few years. He then resumed his residence in this town ship.

Dr. Cyrenius Thompson, whose parents emigrated from Connecticut to Hudson, in the present county of Summit, Ohio, about 1801, was born in the latter town during the month of January, 1802. Early in life he studied medi cine with the practitioners of his native village, and finally graduated from the medical college of Middlebury, Vt. In 1828 he married Miss Anna Pelton, of Euclid, Cuya hoga Co., Ohio, where he practiced his profession for a short period, as he also did in the town of Dover, in the same county. He likewise purchased a farm in Dover, but, the location not suiting him, he sold his possessions in Ohio, resolved to try his fortunes in the Territory of Michigan. His widow, Mrs. Anna P. Thompson, still resides upon the premises first occupied in 1832, and is remarkable for the pioneer vicissitudes through which she has passed, as well as for her lively recollections and youthful appear ance. Her daughter, Myra E., now the wife of Dr. Erastus N. Upjohn, of Nebraska, was born here in the fall of 1833, and her birth was one of the first, if not the first, to be chronicled in the township. The next family to settle here was that of Jonathan Russell. Mr. Russell emigrated from New London, Conn., to Gull Prairie, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., in the fall of 1830, where he joined his father-in-law, William Giddings. He purchased an 80-acre lot, situated upon Gull Prairie, and made some improvements upon it, but sold the same in 1832. He then bought the east one-half of the northeast quarter of section 19 in this township. In June, 1832, he hired at Gull Prairie a breaking-team of five yoke of oxen, aud, coming here, plowed five acres, situated on the He came to Gull Prairie in 1830 and pre-empted lands, which were finally entered for him in 1831 by Levi White. During the spring of the latter year Dr. Thompson settled upon the prairie. He practiced medicine but little, his attention being devoted more particularly to farming. He soon became dissatisfied with his prairie farm, however, from the difficulty found in obtaining a plentiful supply of water. Again selling out, he soon after purchased the east half of the northwest quarter of section 20, in township 1 north, of range 11 west. In March, 1S32, he leased Turner Aldrich's saw-mill on Allegan township included the whole of Allegan County."], [280, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 220 extreme northeast corner of his lot. This land was sowed to wheat in the fall, and was the first field plowed and cul tivated in the township. Mr. Russell's dwelling was also completed in the fall of 1832, and during the succeeding winter Mr. Thompson and himself were the sole house holders in the eastern tier of townships of Allegan County. During the Black-Hawk war Mr. Russell was called out, and with the Gull Prairie men proceeded as far as Niles, Mich. He was afterwards commissioned a lieutenant in the Michigan State forces. For his services he received $75 and warrants for 160 acres of land. His son, Ulysses D., was a gallant soldier, and color-sergeant of the Second Michigan Infantry. He died of wounds received at Knox ville, Tenn., in 1863. now owned by Jerome Wait. It required three months' time to accomplish the journey from Scotland. He was accompanied by his wife and two children, one member of his family \u2014 a daughter \u2014 having died at Detroit while on the way. James Flockhart, also from Peterhead, Scotland, pre ceded Mr. John Forbes by some three months, having arrived July 4, 1834. He purchased the east half of the northwest quarter of section 19, where he resided for a period of about forty-five years. Justus B. Sutherland, of the town of Lisle, Broome Co., N. Y., came to Michigan first in 1833, and bought the south half of the southwest quarter of section 35. In May, 1834, accompanied by his wife and six children, he began a journey, via the Erie Canal and the lake steamer \" Old Pioneer,\" for the purpose of settling upon his purchase. At Detroit he bought a yoke of oxen, and, attaching them to his wagon, which had been shipped as freight, he set out along the Territorial road to Battle Creek ; thence via Gull Prairie to Silas Dunham's resi dence, where his family remained for four weeks, while he was building a log house. Dan Arnold was his nearest neighbor on the road towards the Plains, while Dr. Demming's, in Cooper, was the nearest habitation in that direction. ., J.CUU., In the spring of 1833, Orlando Weed boarded with Mr. Russell while he (Weed) was building his barn, the first framed building erected in the township, and during the same year the population of the township was still further increased by the arrival and settlement of about ten persons with their families. Among them were Norman Davis, on section 19 ; War ren Caswell, who was the first settler in the northeast quarter of the township ; Isaac Aldrich, who, in 1835 or 1836, kept the first tavern on the Plains ; Friend Ives, from Medina, Ohio ; and William Forbes, from Scotland. In June, 1834, John Anderson, from Mayfield, Mont gomery Co., N. Y., became a resident. He was one of the first justices of the peace elected in Plainfield, and for many years was the postmaster of the Plainwell office. He was also an early supervisor and one of the associate judges of Allegan County. In the south part of the town, on the road leading to Gull Prairie, were Dan Arnold, from Chittenden Co., Vt. ; Silas Dunham and William Still, both from Rochester, Monroe Co., N. Y. Mr. Dunham also kept an open house for the accommodation of weary travelers and ''land-look ers.\" His daughter \u2014 since Mrs. D. A. McMartin \u2014 brought from Buffalo, N. Y., the pits from which were grown the first peach-trees to bear fruit in Allegan County. Other settlers of this year were Nathaniel Weed, who built the first saw-mill in the township, on Silver Creek, and Elisha Tracy, his son-in-law, from Wayne Co., Pa. William Forbes emigrated from Peterhead, Aberdeen shire, Scotland, to America in 1832. He remained for a few months in the city of New York, where he married a Mrs. McCausland. In the spring of 1833 he came to Gull Prairie. Learning that Lucius Lyon, the surveyor, was the owner of some desirable lauds situated on section 18 in this township, he purchased a tract from him, and in the fall of the same year, after having built a substantial dwelling, made it his home. Elisha B. Seeley and family came from Pittsford, Monroe Co., N. Y., and in the early part of the summer of 1835 settled upon a portion of section 33. George W. Kennicott, now a resident of Kalamazoo, Mich., came from Mayfield, Montgomery Co., N. Y., to this township in July, 1835. He purchased from the general government the north half of the southeast quarter of section 29, where he settled and remained until Novem ber, 1853, when he removed to Kalamazoo. In 1850, as an assistant United States marshal, he took the census of Allegan County, which then had a total of 5127 inhabits ants. His son, James C., a member of the Fifth Michigan Cavalry, was killed in the Shenandoah Valley, Aug. 19, 1864. Mr. Forbes was a surveyor, a gentleman of talent and education, aud was prominently identified with the early public interests of this township and county. For some six years immediately preceding his emigration to America he was engaged upon the survey and mapping of the county of Sutherland, Scotland, for the Duke of Sutherland. He was the first township clerk of Plainfield, one of the early county surveyors, and ran out many of the early highways in this and other townships of the county. In 1837 he platted the village of Plainfield, \u2014 a place described as \" sit uated near Gun River, one mile north of the Kalamazoo River, in township 1 north, of range 11 west, twenty-seven chains and eighty-five links from the southeast corner of section 18.\" John Murphy, the first supervisor of Plainfield and the first elected sheriff of Allegan County,* came from Roch ester, N. Y., and settled upon section 34 in August, 1835. His family, consisting of himself, wife, and three chil dren, made their home at Mr. Seeley's house while his own was in process of construction. He became the sheriff of Allegan County in 1836, and besides holding that office two terms he served one term in the State Legislature, and was also elected district attorney, \u2014 a position he did not fill, by reason of non-qualification legally. John Forbes, \u2014 a brother of William, \u2014 now a resident of the village of Plainwell, came direct from Peterhead, Scotland, to this township, arriving in October, 1834. He settled west of his brother, on the premises on section 18 * John S. Shearer had previously been sheriff by the appointment of the Territorial Governor."], [281, "Residence of R B.

During the years 1836 and '37 there were many acces sions to the settlement, and many of the new-comers fared hardly in consequence of fevers, lack of medicines, and necessary supplies of every kind. Those who had settled prior to 1835 were enabled to buy cheap live-stock and provisions, from the pioneers of Kalamazoo County. But when the flood-tide of emigration from the State of New York swept over Southern and Central Michigan, begin ning in the spring of 1836, it soon consumed the scant surplus of the earlier settlers, and the year which followed (1837) was in many localities one of utter destitution.

Many who started out from the Empire State with buoyant hopes, flushed with the anticipation of cheap homes and a future competency in the new State, became utterly discouraged by the privations they here endured, the women particularly ; so that after a few weeks' sojourn, with their purses depleted, their ranks thinned by death, the survivors carrying with them the unmistakable effects of a bilious climate, they hastened back to their old homes as rapidly as the means of locomotion then in vogue per mitted. This remark would apply with equal force to all parts of settled Michigan during the fourth and fifth de cades of the present century.

At the gubernatorial election of November 6th and 7th of the same year C. C. Trowbridge received 36 votes and Stevens V. Mason 30 votes. In 1840, 80 votes were polled for the two candidates for the office of supervisor, and there were tie votes for several of the candidates of the opposing Whig and Democratic parties, the contest being finally decided by lot. CIVIL HISTORY. ORGANIZATION. This township, originally forming part of Allegan* was erected as Plainfield in 1836. Section 38 of \" an act to organize certain townships, and for other purposes,\" ap proved March 23, 1836, reads as follows: \"All that portion of the County of Allegan designated by the United States Survey as townships number one, two, three, and four, north of range number eleven west, be, and the same is hereby set off and organized into a separate township by the name of Plainfield, and the first township-meeting therein shall be held at the dwelling house of Isaac Aldrich, in said township.\" DIVISION OF TOAVNSHIP. The township of Martin, including survey-townships Nos. 2, 3, and 4 north, of range No. 11 west, was set off as a separate organization by an act of the State Legislature approved March 22, 1839. Section 53 of the same act says : NAME CHANGED TO GUN PLAIN. By an act of the State Legislature, approved March 19, 1845, the name of the township of Plainfield was changed to Gun Plain, the latter being the name long borne by a beautiful and quite extensive tract of country lying between Gun River and the present village of Plainwell. \"If iu any of the townships organized at the present session of the Legislature there shall not be held a township-meeting on the first Monday of April next, then said township-meeting may be held on the third Monday in April next.\" Later, Section 53 was so amended as to make legal elec tions held on the first Monday in May, 1836.

According to the recollections of the earliest inhabitants, the first school-house erected in the township was built in the spring of 1834, upon lands then, or soon aster, owned by Charles Bush. Jonathan Russell was chosen school di rector, and the same season he hired Miss Hensdill, daugh ter of Judge Hensdill, of Gull Prairie, to teach the school. Receiving as compensation one dollar a week, she taught for a few days only, being compelled to relinquish her task by reason of sickness.

Orson D. Dunham was postmaster and proprietor of the Plainwell House, and in the old log house, previously mentioned, lived Harry Munn, an Eng lishman. The old school-house stood near Corporation Hall, and a man named Franklin lived in a small dwelling standing near the school-house. Abel Dunham's house was where Frederick Woodhams now resides, and a considera ble distance west, on Allegan Street, was Hiram W. Ander son's log dwelling. The Lovelock family also lived near the blacksmith-shop. Nathaniel Seeley was on the extreme west side, and in the vicinity of the village, on the north east side of the river, were John Anderson, William Still, and Calvin Dunham. Lasher's first dwelling, which stands on the north side of Allegan Street, west of the race, was built in the fall of 1855. At this time \u2014 in November, 1853 \u2014 came Orson D. Dun ham from Eaton Rapids. He purchased 40 acres of land situated on the east side of section 30, south of the river, a tract which nearly encircled Wellever's acre. By pur chase he soon after became the owner of Mr. Wellever's unfinished building and lot, and in July, 1854, the Plain well House was formally opened to the public as a place of entertainment for wearied, hungry men and beasts. Thus began the settlement and business at the Junction, and this was the origin of a name which the village continued to bear until after its incorporation. After the plank-road and the success attending Patter son, Glenn & Lyon's line of stage-coaches, the next impetus given the village was the organization of the Plainwell Water-Power Company. It was formed in the spring of 1856, the members being George C. Mills, Orson D. Dun ham, Mr. Fairchilds, Giles Sherwood, William H. Wood hams, and John K. Bingham. The race was excavated during the summer and fall, and a saw-mill completed in the winter following, the cost of first mill and race amount ing to $3000. The plank-road was completed in 1854, and immediately became a thronged thoroughfare for the hauling of freight, lumber, and farm produce ; besides, it was a favorite route for stage travel. Mr. Dunham relates that very frequently he had the passengers of seven four-horse stage-coaehes stopping at his house for dinner. He also became postmaster at about this time, succeeding Judge Anderson, who had been post master for many years. When Mr. Dunham first came here, William Woodhams was living in his residence, the ancient-looking structure still standing on Bridge Street, near the river, and an un occupied log house stood on the site of Waldo's store. These were the only dwellings on the site of the village proper, and the log house was used as the residence of the Dunham family until the completion of the hotel. In 1858, George C. Force and Orson D. Dunham built for a rake-factory the mill now occupied by Patterson, and during the fall of the same year Henry J. Cushman built the grist-mill now owned by Lantz. The planing-mill owned by Cressy was built by O. D. Dunham and Walter Pierson in 1860. The mills already mentioned and a thriving mercantile trade had gradually attracted popula tion to the Junction ; so much so that at the beginning of the war the inhabitants gathered here numbered about 200. After Wellever sold his hotel property he purchased the opposite corner, \u2014 now owned by George H. Anderson,\u2014 erected a small frame building, and within it exposed for sale a meagre stock of groceries. He soon after, however, sold to Alfred S. and Albert Pierson, who continued the business, while Mr. Wellever removed to the city of Flint, Mich. On the 8th day of April, 1863, William H. Woodhams, George H. Anderson, John C. Bannister, M. E. Cushman, Peter Hatfield, and M. E. Gifford, proprietors of lands situated on section 29, west side of the river, had the same surveyed by Ira Chichester and a map recorded as the first plat of the village of Plainwell. j- In the fall of 1855, Mr. Dunham sold his hotel property to Messrs. Mills & Merritt, and a man named Pratt then became proprietor of the same, changing the name to the \" Merritt House.\" Mr. Dunham then built a store, on the site of the Sherman store, bought Pierson's stock of groceries, removed the same to the new building, added dry-goods, no tions, etc., and thus kept the first store of general merchan dise at the Junction. Soon after, Messrs. Bannister & Whitney succeeded Mr. Dunham in the mercantile busi ness, and largely increased the stock. Among other early merchants were old Mr. Wooley, Cummings, and Peter Saxe, brother of John G., the poet. About the year 1864 a flouring-mill which stood between the present paper- and saw-mills was built by Orson D. Dunham, Sanford H. and K. B. Corbyn. After running two years, and while owned by Bartley & Co., it was burned. Messrs. Bartley & Co. then erected the extensive flouring-mills now owned by Merrill & McCourtie. INCORPORATION. Meanwhile, the Lake-Shore and Michigan Southern Rail road had been completed to this point. The inhabitants of John H. Lasher, the first shoemaker to settle here, came in July, 1855. His recollections of people and matters at that time are as follows : William H. Woodhams was re siding near the bridge. On the northeast corner of Bridge and Main Streets was Alfred S.

Leading citizens believed that their interests would be best promoted and protected by a village charter, and in consequence, during the winter of 1868-69, a petition, very generally signed, was sent in to the State Legislature then in session, praying that an act be passed for the incorporation of the village of Plainwell. Their petition received favorable consideration, and by an act approved March 26, 1869, the territory herein described was duly incorporated as the village of Plainwell. The act reads as follows : \" The People of the State of Michigan enact, That so much of the township of Gun Plain, in the county of Allegan, as is included in tho following territory, to wit : The southwest quarter of the north east quarter of section twenty-nine, the northwest quarter of section twenty-nine, the southwest quarter, excepting the sputhcast fractional quarter thereof, of section twenty-nine, the east half of the southeast quarter, the northwest quarter of the southeast quarter, the northeast quarter\" of the southwest quarter, the east half of the northwest quar ter and tho northeast quarter of section thirty, the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section nineteen, and the southwest quar ter of the southwest quarter of section twenty, in town one north, of range eleven west, be, and the same is hereby constituted a village corporate, by the name of the village of Plainwell.\" Section 2 of the same act authorized the inhabitants of the village having the qualifications of electors to meet at the Plainwell House the second Monday of March next, and on the first Monday of March annually thereafter at such places as shall be provided in the by-laws of said vil lage, for the election of village officers. FIRST CHARTER ELECTION. Pursuant to the provisions of their charter, the qualified electors of the village assembled at the Plainwell House, Monday, March 29, 1869, and from among their number Henry Keeler, Eli Hart, and Jacob V.

On the 3d day of February, 1870, the trustees of the village by resolution established a fire department and en acted by-laws to govern the same, the department to con sist of two hose companies and a hook-and-ladder com pany, controlled by a chief engineer and assistant engineer, who were to receive their appointment from the village council. Each hose company was to have at least 20 mem bers, and not more than 25, the hook-and-ladder company not to exceed 30 members. Since its incorporation and the completion of the two railroads, the village has gradually increased in population to its present numbers. Street grades have been established, miles of sidewalks have been laid, and the Holly system of water-works has been adopted. In 1873 the present Plainwell Water- Power Company was organized and incorporated, the village becoming part owner. The old company, for a comparatively minor con sideration, then deeded its right, title, and interest to the new one. During the same year the race was enlarged to its present proportions, \u2014 i.e., a fall of 10 feet at the bulk head, and a power of 8000 inches, \u2014 thus placing Plainwell in the front rank as a manufacturing centre. An extensive paper-mill was also established in 1872. Following along the course of time to the present day, we find that many other minor industries have since contributed their mite to the general prosperity, until the village of to-day, with its busy mills, its active merchants, its churches, and a noble school edifice, may justly be regarded as one of the most prosperous of the many villages which dot the surface of Southern Michigan. In March, 1870, a committee of trustees, consisting of Norton P. Kellogg, Dewitt C. Kenyon, and Jonas Rouse, was sent to Kalamazoo to inspect and report upon the Holly system of water-works there in use. It reported on the 26th of March, 1870, as follows : \" In the opinion of the com mittee, the Holly system, in connection with our water-power, would afford the best and most secure protection against fire for the least money.\" The following estimates were based upon information received from Horace Phelps, superintendent of the Kal amazoo water-works : Holly pump and wheel $1000 545 fe ot of 6-inch pipe 700 660 \" 4 \" \" 500 5 double hydrants 250 3 gates 100 Lead and oakum 125 VILLAGE OFFICERS SINCE 1S69. $2735 The following are the village officers elected annually for the years from 1870 to 1880 inclusive : At a session of the board of trustees held June 13, 1870, it was resolved to adopt the Holly system, and to expend on the work $3400, of which $2400 should be spread upon the tax-rolls of the year 1870, and a contract was made 1870. \u2014 Jonas Rouse, President; John H.

In December, 1870, William Cox and 0. M. Rradley were appointed the first fire-wardens. At the present time the fire companies, apparatus, etc., are in about the same condition as shown in the foregoing report. Dewitt C. Kenyon was appointed superintendent of water-works Jan. 20, 1871, and was ordered to take full control of keys, fire apparatus, etc., until a fire company should be organized and a chief engineer appointed. J. J. Monroe was appointed the first chief engineer, March 13, 1871. PLAINAVELL PAPER-MILLS. These mills were established by Messrs. Lyon and Page in 1872, and are now controlled by the firm of B. F. & F. M. Lyon, of Kalamazoo, Mich. Twenty-five people are steadily employed, and the daily products amount to two tons of news-printing paper. The water-works were completed in the spring of 1872, and on the 8th of April of the same year a contract was made with Messrs. 0. D. Dunham and R. P. Corbyn for 1000 square inches of water from their race, for which they were to receive $1150. Jonas Rouse was appointed to take charge of the works in August, 1872. PLAINAVELL EXCHANGE BANK. This institution was established in 1869 by Messrs. Winegar & Soule. Upon the death of Mr. Winegar, Mr. Joseph W. Hicks, the first president of the village, became a member of the firm. Mr. Hicks has served as county surveyor, and in many other responsible positions has proven himself a gentleman of ability and integrity. Halcyon Hose Company was formed in December, 1872. Early in the spring of 1873\" the present water-power com pany was formed, and for an unknown consideration the title was transferred from Messrs. Dunham and Corbyn to it. The village then became part of the new company, with the understanding that it was to have the first right to 1000 square inches of water, \" subject, however, to the rise and fall of the river.\" PLAINAVELL POST-OFFICE. As previously mentioned, the Plainwell post-office was first established in 1S33, Dr. Cyrenius Thompson, the first settler in tbe township, becoming the first postmaster. Mails were received weekly, via Gull Prairie, John H. Adams usually performing duty as mail-carrier. When Dr. Thompson returned to Ohio, in the fall of 1835, Or lando Weed became postmaster. A year or so later, when Weed removed from the Plains, Peter Dumont succeeded him. Mr. Dumont retained the office but a short period, however, for in 1837 he removed to the northern part of the county. John Anderson then became postmaster, and continued as such for nearly eighteeu years. During the summer of 1873 the race was enlarged to its present proportions. A hook-and-ladder truck, costing $975, was purchased in October, 1877, also Babcock fire extinguishers. Hook-and-Ladder Company No. 1 was also organized during the same month. To A. E. Smith and Fred. A. Williams was given the contract for erecting a building for the storage of fire apparatus. The building was completed in January, 1878, costing about $700. In the summer of 1854 the office was transferred to the Junction,* where it has since remained. Orson D. Dun ham, the first postmaster at the Junction, has been suc ceeded by John H. Lasher, George C. Mills, Milo E. Gifford, Eli Hart, Krouse, Fred. Hays, and John Crispe. In February, 1878, George H. Bean, chief engineer of the Plainwell Fire Department, in his annual report for the year ending March 1, 1878, said : \"At the time of my appointment last spring there was only one company, of about fifteen members; now, at this date, we have two full companies, a substantial building for all purposes of the fire department, and Plainwell is as fully provided with protection against fire as any place of its size in the United States. The present force of the department is a chief engineer, Halcyon Hose Company, No. ], with twenty members, and Plainwell Hook-and-Ladder Company, No. 1, with thirty members. PROFESSIONAL. Phi/sicians. \u2014 As already noticed, we find that Dr. Cyre nius Thompson was the first physician to settle in the township. He did not practice, however, the early resi dents relying mainly upon Dr. L. B. Coats, of Otsego. \" The apparatus consists of one good hose-cart, \u2014 two-wheeled, \u2014 equipped with one thousand feet of serviceable linen hose, one new hook-and-ladder truck, with all equipments, and eight Babcock ex tinguishers, the Holly pump, supplied with about three thousand feot of pipes, and five hydrants in good repair. About 1840, Dr. Erastus N. Upjohn, brother of Dr. Uriah Upjohn, of Gull Prairie, a native of England, and a graduate of a New York City medical college, became the first resident practicing physician in the township. He married Myra E., daughter of Dr. Thompson, in 1S50, and removed to the State of Nebraska in 1855. \" There has been one tire and two alarms of fire during the year. \" I would recommend to your consideration the advisability that the office of chief engineer be an honorary one, and that some com petent person, recommended by the chief engineer or hose company, to be confirmed by the board of trustees, be appointed to take charge of the wheel-house and pump, and to be held responsible for the good working order and care of the same. Dr. Charles W. Hawley was born in Canandaigua, On tario Co., N. Y., in 1S27. With his parents he removed from New York to Schoolcraft, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., in 1836. He studied medicine Avith Dr. James A. Allen, of Kalamazoo, and completed his course at Laporte, Ind. In 1S49, Dr. Hawley taught school in the Silver Creek neigh borhood, this township. The following year he located in Wilmingtou, Will Co., III., where he practiced three years. He then returned to this township, settling at Silver Creek. In the fall of 1875 he removed to his present place of resi dence, in the village of Plainwell. \"Also that some plan be provided that the business men may have the use of water during the summer season for sprinkling the streets, etc. For reasons : \" 1. It is not the duty of the fire department, or those in charge of tho pump, to let on water at the call of any and every one who sees fit to ask it, as was done last summer, and then be cursed when not doing it. 2. Tom, Dick, and Harry should not be allowed to run it, \u2014 perhaps go and let on the water, and then forget all about shutting it off or oiling tho machine bearings. 3. The present arrangements are very dissatisfactory to the citi zens, and a bill of expense to the village.*' * Village of Plainwell."], [298, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 230 SECRET BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATIONS. For several years subsequent to 1853 the doctor's prac tice extended throughout this toAvnship, also into the towns of Martin, Prairieville, and Cooper, \u2014 situated respect ively in the counties of Allegan, Barry, and Kalamazoo. Quite early in life Dr. Hawley married a daughter of John K. Bingham. Mr. Bingham was one of the earliest pioneers of the State. He came to Ann Arbor first in 1826, and, being a practical millwright, built the pioneer mills in many localities of Southern Michigan. He finally settled at Silver Creek, where he placed in good working order the old saw-mill first built by Nathaniel Weed, and in 1847, in the same locality, established the first grist-mill in Gun Plain. He was also one of the original members of the Plainwell Water-Power Company, and to his advice and energy was largely due the success which attended the enterprise. Plainwell Lodge, No. 35, F. and A. M., commenced work under a dispensation Sept. 9. 1867, and was chartered Jan. 9, 1868. The first officers installed were Jacob V. Rogers, W. M. ; James J. Hart, S.

Regular meetings are held Wednes day evenings, on or before the full moon of each month, and the lodge numbers 68 members at the present time. Dr. J. D. Peters is a native of Columbus, Ohio, and a graduate of the Cincinnati Eclectic Medical Institute. He first began practice in Alamo, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., where he remained eighteen months. He then removed to Otsego, Mich., remaining there one year. In the fall of 1861 he settled here, thus becoming the first physician to settle per manently in the village. Previous to his coming, a Dr. McNett had practiced here for a few months. Dr. Peters removed to the city of Grand Rapids in 1872, and remained there until January of the present year (1880), when he returned, and is again established in the village of Plain well. Succeeding Dr. Peters, and prior to 1869, Drs. O. E. Yates, Benjamin Thompson, E. C. Adams, E. M. Hume, L. A. Daniels, and Dr. Sherman had settled here. The first meetings were held in a hall over J. C. Ives' hardware -store, and were continued there until 1872, when the lodge was removed to its present quarters. For build ing, furnishing, etc., nearly $2000 have been expended. Gun Plain Lodge, No. 120, I. O. O. F, was instituted July 2, 1868, and the first officers installed were Milo E. Gifford, N. G. ; Henry Day, V. G. ; C. J. Poore, Sec.; William Starr, Treas. ; J. B.

These meetings were continued at irregular iuter vals, generally at the house of Mr. Dunham, until March 8, 1835, when Deacon Curtis Brigham commenced stated meetings in the log school-house on the Plains. and Levina Batchelor were the original members. Mr. Todd remained on the mission two years, and was then succeeded by Rev. F. Gage. In the summer of 1841 a camp-meeting was held near Gun Marsh, east of the Plains. Large numbers of the people attended, and many joined the church, which gave Methodism its first important start in the county. On the 13th of September, 1835, Rev. Jeremiah Hall, of Kalamazoo, was employed to preach once in four weeks. Deacon Brigham occupying the intervening Sabbaths. A meeting was held at the house of Silas Dunham, Dec. 26, 1835, to \" take into consideration the expediency of or ganizing a Baptist Church. After conferring on the sub ject, it was resolved to unite in church fellowship.\" The constituent members, eight in number, were Silas Dunham, Tirza Dunham, Elisha B. Seeley, Sarah Seeley, Curtis Brigham, Lydia Brigham, Alfred Dunham, and Edwin Dunham. Thus was organized the First Baptist Church of Plainfield, and the first church of any kind in the county of Allegan. After Mr. Gage came Revs. Daniel Bush, in 1842; Thomas Jakeways, 1S43 ; Jacob Parker, 1844; George King, 1845; M. B. Camburn, 1846; Curtis Moshier, 1847-48; Andrew J.

H. Day, 1864-65; L. H. Pierce, 1866-67; A. J. Van Wyck, 1868. Rev. Henry Munger became its pastor April 26, 1840, which position he continued to hold for a period of five years. Iu 1844 the organization changed both its name and location, and was known as the First Baptist Church of Otsego. Meetings were held alternately on the Plains and at the village of Otsego. Subsequently the place of meeting was changed from the Plains to the school-house at tbe Junction, an insignificant hamlet, from which has arisen the present flourishing village of Plainwell. At the session of the Michigan Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church held at Three Rivers, Sept. 3, 1868, a new circuit was organized, embracing Plainwell, Martin, and South Wayland, receiving the name of the Plainwell Circuit. Thomas Lyon became the pre siding elder, and Ira R. A. Wightman preacher in charge, the members constituting the official board of this circuit being L. S. Church, A. C. Beach, A. C. Wheeler, L. Spaulding, D. S. Owen, William Chappie, C. C. White, Jonathan Russell, 0. A. Conrad, R. G. Smith, A. W. Miller, Stephen S. Germond, David Gilger, Wm. H. South wick, and J. R. Richardson. It soon became evident that a village of some importance would be the result of the development of the Plainwell water-power and the construction of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, and on the 11th day of May, 1864, the Plainwell Baptist Church was organized, 22 persons having received letters of dismission from the Otsego Church for this purpose. Rev. 0. S. Wolfe was at this time pastor. In May, 1869, a church site was purchased in the village of Plainwell at a cost of $500, andvthe work of building a house of worship at once commenced. It was completed at an additional cost of $6000, and dedicated Feb. 3, 1870. It is of brick, and has sittings for 400 people. Iu the summer of 1878 a vestry, together with a kitchen, was built, costing $550. Rev. J. Fletcher, who had just previously served as chap lain of the Ninth Michigan Cavalry, became its pastor Oct. 1, 1865, and has remained continuously to the present time. In 1865-66 a house of worship was built. It was enlarged in 1870, and a spacious lecture-room added. A chapel, situated two and one-half miles east of the village, was built in 1871, for the accommodation of those mem bers residing in that locality. Rev. Ira R. A. Wightman remained two years. He was succeeded by B. S. Mills, who remained one year. J. W. Miller served three months, when, having been appointed presiding elder of the Grand Traverse district, Charles Hartley filled out the year. Others since have been J. T. Iddings, one year ; J. H. Potts, three years ; J. P. Force one year ; J. S. Valentine, two years ; and George L. Cole, who is the present pastor.\")\" Present membership of the church, 230 ; value of church property, both houses, $6000.* Methodist Episcopal Church of Plainwell. \u2014 In the spring of 1836 a class composed of Elisha Tracy and wife, Nathaniel Weed and wife, and Mrs. John Murphy was formed at the house of Elisha Tracy, in the Silver Creek settlement. Rev. Messrs. Davis and Franklin Gage were the first preachers. Their meetings were held at irregular intervals in the dwellings of the early members. Plainwell Presbyterian Cliurch. \u2014 This society was first organized, as the Presbyterian Church of Plainfield, at the house of George N. Smith on the 7th of January, 1837. The original members, sixteen in number, were Rev. Mr. Knapen, Rev. A. S. Ware and wife, Mr. Chamberlin, wife, and son, George N. Smith and wife, Cyrenius Thompson and wife, John Forbes and wife, Mrs. Foster, Mrs. Powers, Mrs. Adams, and Mr. Orr. Three years later Rev. William Todd came into the field to do missionary work in the territory comprising all of Allegan County, and Cooper and Alamo, in Kalamazoo County. A class of 7 members was then formed in the Gun Plain school-house, one mile north of the present village of Plainwell. Of this class Archibald Gates and wife, Abram J.

Mr. Bellingham is called by his fellow-townsmen one of Gun Plain's most successful farmers, and one who has made his wealth by hard work and good management, and whose honesty and integrity are above suspicion. He is a Demo crat in politics, but not a politician. On the 4th day of March, 1856, he was married to Miss Ann Stewart, daugh ter of John and Anna (Underwood) Stewart, who was born May 30, 1826. There has been born to them seven children, viz.: Eliza A., born May 8, 1858; Hattie, born April 27, 1860; Ella, born Feb. 11, 1863; Edgar, born July 3, 1865; Mary, born July 11, 1867; Charles E., born Feb. 2, 1869 ; and Sarah A., born July 15, 1872. situated one mile north of the present village of Plainwell, was built. 1872 a new house of worship was completed at the village, the one in present use. It has sittings for 400 people, and cost about $4000. A session-room was added in 1879, at a cost of $400. From 1842 to 1S50 the pastors were Rev. Messrs. McLaurens, M. Fuller, and E. F. Waldo. Since May 12, 1850, when Rev. R. McMath became pastor, his successors have settled as follows : Revs. S. Ste vens, May 23, 1852; F. Fuller, June 4, 1854; David S. Morse, May 1, 1858; S.

The present membership of the society numbers 58. Other Religious Organizations. \u2014 In 1S71 a Protestant Episcopal society was organized in Plainwell, and three years later a neat little church edifice was completed. Some twenty families are connected with this church, which stands, relatively, as a mission of the Allegan Episcopal Church. Rev. Walter Scott, rector, officiates here weekly. LEVI ARNOLD. Levi Arnold was born July 11, 1844, in the township of Gun Plain, Allegan Co., Mich., where his father, Dan Arnold, settled in 1833, buying the farm now owned by his heirs, and occupied by Levi, from the government. On this farm Levi has grown to manhood, seeing much of early life in a new country, and growing up with the county his family has done so much to clear up and improve. In 1862, Levi and his brother, George T., bought the home farm of the heirs, and for several years worked it in com mon. They then sold back to the heirs, and Levi has since then rented it and carried it on successfully. The Catholics of this and surrounding townships form a parish, of which their church edifice \u2014 formerly the old Presbyterian church building\u2014 is pleasantly situated on the north side of the river. They comprise some twenty or more families, aud are under the care of the Battle Creek Church. On the 11th day of December, 1872, Mr. Arnold was married to Miss Julia Starr, who was born Feb. 17, 1850. Their union has been blessed with one child, Harold L., born Feb. 14, 1878. On the breaking out of the Rebellion, Mr. Arnold enlisted in the First Michigan Infantry, but was thrown out on account of size and a broken foot. In 1869, with an idea of improving his own stock, he bought of E. B. Bissell the Poland China known as \" Old Darkey,\" which was the first full-blood Poland brought to the county. The following year Mr. Arnold bought of F. B. Pratt the Poland China known as \" Lady Pratt,\" and the same year of E. B. Bissell \" Long John,\" and soon after \" Richard Jones,\" of C. W. Jones, of Richland. The same year, wishing to better his herd, he went to Ohio, and of David Finch, one of the best stock-breeders in that State, bought \" Old Success,\" which was one of the best Polands ever brought into the State. These purchases were followed by others as good, making his herd one of the best in the State. He also bought in Ohio, of Joseph Morton, another famous breeder, the animals known as \" Black Bess\" and \" Maid of Oxford ;\" also of William W. Greer \" Billy Greer A,\" and second \" Queen of Butler.\" These pur chases represent the Harkrader, Pugh, and Perfection strain. Mr. Arnold keeps his herd well filled by pur chasing, from time to time, from other States, the best ani mals that can be bought, thus keeping up the reputation of his herd and increasing his popularity as a breeder of pure blooded swine. From the small beginning made in 1869 he has increased his business, until now his animals are sent to all parts of the United States, and his patrons are each year increasing. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. WILLIAM A. BELLINGHAM. William A. Bellingham was born in Rutherfield, Sussex Co., England, Nov. 19, 1824. When nine years old his father came to Washtenaw Co., Mich. A history of their voyage and of his ancestors will be found in the biography of his father, to which reference is here made. Growing up in a new country, as he did, his chances for an education were necessarily very limited, yet he made the most of his oppor tunities and acquired enough to fit him for the successful business life he has led. Arrived at his majority, he at once bought the eighty acres on which he now resides, and worked by the month in Allegan to pay for it, taking his pay in lumber, which was accepted as payment, as no money was to be had for work in those days. His land paid for, he at once commenced to improve it, and had made consider able advance in doing so when*, in 1852, he joined a party who were going to California and made the trip across the plains, enduring the hardships and privations then attend ing a three months' trip to the land of gold. He worked in the mines and at teaming, meeting with fair success. In the spring of 1855, Mr. Bellingham returned to the States, and soon after married and settled down on his farm, which he has improved, and on which he has built one of the finest houses in the township, which, with good out buildings, makes a fine home; a view of which appears on another page of this work.

Among the early settlers of Allegan County we find the name of Friend Ives, who may well be ranked as one of the self-made and prominent men of the early days of the county. His an cestors were New England people, he himself being a native of Plymouth, Conn., where he was born on the 22d day of De cember, A.D. 1790. His father was a farmer, and on his farm Friend grew to inanhood. His chances for an education were limited to the district schools of his day, yet he obtained enough to fit him for the active, successful business life he afterwards pursued. Arrived at his majority, he started out in life for himself. He traveled through the States of Maryland and Virginia selling Yankee clocks. This he followed several years, acquiring an insight into the ways of the world and its people which afterwards served him well. In after-years he used to relate, in his graphic way, incideuts of his wandering life that would have made an interesting volume. We next find him and his family living among the Shakers in New Leba non, Columbia Co., N. Y., where he stayed a few years pursuirg his old business. In 1818, becoming desirous of settling down with his family, he emigrated to Medina, Medina Co., Ohio, where his father-in-law had bought for each of his children one hundred acres of wild land. Medina County was then a new country, and Mr. Ives found only forests of heavy timber awaiting him. It was thirty miles to Cleveland, where they had to go to mill and for their supplies. He built a log house and at once commenced to improve his land. Before the never ceasing strokes of his strong arm the forest rapidly disappeared, and cleared fields and fine buildings soon took its place. In 1833, having sold his Ohio farm, he again turned his face west ward, and we find him in the fall of that year building a log house in the town of Allegan, Allegan Co., Mich., now the town ofjGun Plain. He had bought a section of land and reared his home on the beautiful burr-oak plains from which the town derives its name. There were but few in the tow at that time, and he had his choice of land, all of which h bought from the government. Again he cleared up a farm i a new country, set out orchards, and erected good building thus doubly earning the title of a pioneer. In the township c which he became one of its most prominent citizens, M Ives passed the remainder of his days, honored and respecte by all, passing away Feb. 22, 1874, in his eighty-fifth yea In politics he was always a Democrat, and by his party wi elected to fill many offices in the gift of his fellow-citizens. I 1835 he was elected assessor of the then town of Allegan, an was also one of the first assessors of the town of Plainfieli He was also elected one of the associate judges of the count; and subsequently represented his district in the lower houi of the State Legislature, all of which were filled with cred to himself and his constituents. Mr. Ives married Miss Ha riet Warner, who was born July 17, 1792, and died Marc 17, 1867. Of this union there were born to them eight chi dren, as follows: Jane, June 22, 1812; Charles W., 1814 Sabra D., Dec. 22, 1816; Betsey, 1818; Harriet, May II 1820; Elnathan, May 2, 1822; James, Sept. 17, 1824; ar Ann, June 17, 1827. Of the children only Harriet, Jame and Ann are now living. Harriet married Joshua Hill, No 25, 1S42 ; their children were Sarah, born Jan. 2, 1845, Jame who died in infancy, and James N., born April 9, 1849. Ann married, June 21, 1854, Ira Chichester, an old residei of the county. There were born to them four children, viz, Ernest M., April 9, 1858 ; Wilton, April 8, 1861 ; Leon, Jai 15, 1863; and Fred, Aug. 27, 1866. James was married, Dec. 31, 1851, to Octavia Chambers they had but one child, viz., George T., born Oct. 22, 185: Married, second, Miss Mary Jane Pierson, who was born No 13, 1834."], [302, ""], [303, "1 GUN PLAIN TOWNSHIP 233 WILLIAM R. DELANO. The Delano family are of English origin, and emigrated to America soon after the great fire in London in the fifteenth century, they having, it is said, lost their all by that disaster. Israel Delano was born in Pembroke, Mass., where his mother resided during her husband's absence at sea, he being captain of a whaling vessel and dying on board ship. Israel, when quite young, emigrated to On- tario Co., N. Y., which was then an almost unbroken wilder- ness, and was called Ontario township as well as county. He located in what afterwards was known as Palmyra township, subsequently divided, making his residence in Macedon township, Wayne Co. He thus lived in two different counties and three townships without ever changing his abiding-place. He bought three hundred and twenty acres of land, receiving an article which said he should have a deed when the purchase-price was paid. He was the possessor of only an axe and the indomitable will and the industry for which the pioneers of America have always been noted. He went into Ontario with the family of Judge Rogers, whose daughter, Martha, he afterwards married. The judge's mother was noted far and near for her great strength, there being but few men in the country around that she could not master in a trial of strength. Accounts of her prowess are still given by the descendants of the early settlers of that part of New York. On the land thus obtained Mr. Delano resided until his death, in August, 1857, at the advanced age of ninety-two years. He cleared up and improved the farm, which ultimately became one of the fine farms of Wayne County. There were born to them eleven children, \u2014 four sons and four daughters, growing to man's and woman's estate. William R. Delano, the ninth of the family, was born in Macedou, Wayne Co., N. Y., April 6, 1812. His chances for au education were very limited, as the children 30 of his father's family were put to work as soon as they were old enough to be of any assistance. Arrived at his majority, he commenced life on his own account. He cleared and cropped land on his father's farm a couple of years, then, in the fall of 1835, came to Michigan, and bought of the government one hundred and sixty acres of land in Gun Plain township, Allegan County, and then returned to Washtenaw County, where he worked at jobbing during the winter. The following spring he joined a sur veying-party sent out by the government, and spent the spring and summer of 1836 surveying in Wisconsin. The winter of 1S36-37 was passed in Washtenaw County, work ing at whatever he could get to do, and the following sea son in St. Joseph, Mich. The spring of 1838 found him on his land in Gun Plain, on which he built a log shanty just large enough to eat and sleep in and keep out the wolves. For several years he then worked on his farm when not working for other parties, to earn the money necessary to keep his modest establishment, over which he alone pre sided, in running OFder. In 1848 he returned to the old home in Wayne County, and worked his father's farm, which he continued to do until the death of his father, when he bought out some of the heirs and became part owner of the old homestead. In 1865 he returned to Michigan, having previously sold his interest in his Wayne County property and bought in Gun Plain township four hundred acres of land lying in sections 1, 10, and 15. The home-farm is nicely situated on a beautiful little creek which meanders through it. In this fine home Mr. Delano will probably pass the remainder of his days. He is a Re publican, but not a politician, and is not a member of any church. Of him his neighbors and fellow-townsmen say that he is a man whom to know is to respect and esteem, and one of whom naught but the highest praise is spoken."], [304, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 234 (Chart) Woodhams. She was born in Croyden, Surrey Co., England, May 1, 1833. In September, 1852, Mr. Anderson and his wife, in company with a party of friends, sailed in the clipper-ship \" Green Point\" for California, going around the Horn, and being five months on the way. They arrived in San Francisco March 11, 1853, and soon aster went into a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, near Redwood City. Remained on the ranch one year, engaged in stock raising. He then returned to San Francisco and bought a mill-ranch near the city, on which he. remained until the fall of 1859, and meeting with marked success. He then sold out and returned home, coming via Panama. Soon after his return he engaged in the mercantile busi ness in Plainwell, also carrying on his farm of two hun dred acres near the village. In 1869, Mr. Anderson sold out his mercantile business, since which he has managed his farm and attended to his property in the village, consisting of tenant-houses and other buildings. He is, and has always been, a Republican, but not a politician, never having sought or desired office. GEORGE H. ANDERSON. The Anderson family are of Scotch origin, Daniel An derson having been born in Scotland, from whence he emi grated soon after his marriage, and settled in the town of Mayfield, Fulton Co., N. Y., where he bought a tract of wild land, Mayfield being then a newly-settled country. His son, John Anderson, was born in Mayfield, Dec. 29, 1797, and grew to manhood on the home-farm. He was early taught that work was one of God's ordinances, and that boys, though small, were no exceptions to the rule. His education was obtained evenings by the light of the fire place, and by a close observance of men and the ways of the world. He was a natural mechanic, and could make anything that could be made with tools. Arrived at his majority, he built on his father's farm a saw-mill, which he ran until about the time of his marriage to Miss Laura Rice, which occurred Feb. 23, 1826. Miss Rice was born in Fulton Co., Feb. 19, 1799. Aster his marriage, Mr. Anderson worked at the carpenter trade, also as a mill wright, which he followed until the spring of 1834, when, with his wife and two children, he started for Michigan in quest of a home. He came to Grass Lake, in Jackson County, where he left his family and then set out on foot in search of government land. He came to Kalamazoo, but, finding the desirable land occupied, he pushed on farther north into Allegan County, which was then on the outskirts of civilization, and in what is now Gun Plain township he bought of the government four hundred acres of land. He then returned for his family, and at once came on to the new home in the wilderness. Until a log house could be built they lived in a deserted house, then moved into their own home, which was built on the northwest quarter of section 29, part of which is now the village of Plainwell. He at once commenced to improve his farm, and soon cleared fields made beautiful by waving grain took the place of the forest, while on every hand the homes of new settlers were spring ing up. Mr. Anderson cleared up one hundred acres of his farm and erected on it good buildings, and upon it he lived until his death, which occurred Jan. 17, 1877. In politics Mr. Anderson was in early life a Whig, and joined the Re publican party on its organization, and was always one of its strongest supporters. He was for many years postmas ter at Plainwell, was also justice of the peace, school inspec tor, supervisor, and associate judge. He is spoken of by his old friends and neighbors as one of nature's noblemen, a man whom to know Avas to love and esteem, and against whom no evil could be said. Mr. Anderson and his wife are consistent members of the Baptist Church. There have been born to them six children, as follows: George W., born March 29,1853; Edward J., born Sept. 9, 1854 ; Ella E., born Jan. 25, 1857 ; Ida M.,born Nov. 18, 1858, all born in California; Edith A., born Nov. 1, 1860 ; and Lewis C.,born Feb. 21, 1876, the two last in Plainwell, Mich. George W. is a conductor on the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, a po sition he has held six years. Edward J. enlisted in the regular army when fifteen years old, and served five years. After his return he entered the office of Silas Stafford, in Plainwell, as a law student, was admitted to the bar in 1876, since when he has followed his profession in Plainwell, where he has an office and a good practice. He is at present one of the Circuit Court commissioners for Allegan County. Mrs. Anderson's father, William H. Woodhams, was born in the county of Kent, England, Oct. 12, 1801. He is of Welsh descent, his ancestors living in Wales prior to their removal to England. His family were wealthy farmers, he himself having a lease of a farm which had been leased by his family for generations. In his boyhood days he was a miller's apprentice, but never followed the business. In 1827 he married Elizabeth Chart, which union was blessed with six sons and two daughters. In 1845, Mr. Woodhams bought ninety-five acres of land in Gun Plain, Allegan Co., Mich., and the following year sold his lease, and with his family emigrated to America ; he at once moved on to his farm, which he improved, and on part of which he laid out a portion of the village of Plainwell. The growth and pros perity of this flourishing village are due in a measure to Mr. Woodhams, who has done much for its advancement. He also bought other tracts of land, and lots in Kalamazoo village, a good deal of which is now owned by his sons. He has now in his old age retired from business with more than a competency. George H. Anderson was born in Mayfield, Fulton Co., N. Y., Oct. 22, 1827. In 1834 came to Michigan, as set forth in the biogntphy of his father, John Anderson. On the farm in Gun Plain Mr. Anderson grew to manhood, going to school with his sister to the log school-house in the woods, they being the only scholars from their part of the town. When eighteen years old he attended Dr. Stone's school one term, and four years after passed two terms in the college at Olivet. He then worked on his father's farm summers, and taught school winters until his marriage, which occurred June 25, 1852, his bride being Miss Eliza beth Woodhams, daughter of William H. aud Elizabeth Mrs. Woodhams, who was a lady of fine literary abili ties, and noted for her generous and noble qualities, died Dec. 15, 1873, in California, whither she had gone for her health, mourned by a large circle of friends and relatives."], [305, "GUN PLAIN TOWNSHIP. 235 JOHN MURPHY MRS. JOHN JIUKPIIY. JOHN MI RPHY Among the self-made men of Allegan there are none who better deserve the title than John Murphy, of whom this brief sketch is written. He was born in Dutchess Co., N. Y., Oct. 19, 1794. He was of Irish descent, his grand- parents having first seen the light of day on the Emerald Isle, from Avhence they emigrated to America when John's father was an infant. John grew to manhood in Pennfield, Genesee Co., N. Y., where his father owned a farm bought in its wild state. The country was new and schools were few and of the most primitive kind, hence Mr. Murphy obtained but a limited amount of the knowledge derived from books, but what he lacked in education he made up in energy and natural ability. Arrived at his majority, he bought a farm in Pennfield, which he carried on a number of years. During this time he served as constable for several years, thus becoming proficient in a line of work that afterwards made him useful to the new county of Al- legan. After selling his farm in Pennfield he went to Rochester and engaged in the grocery business, which he followed a few years, and then went to Ohio, where he took jobs in building the Ohio Canal. He also helped to build the Pennsylvania Canal, on which he lost a large sum through the dishonesty of a partner. Having married while in Ohio, and being somewhat disheartened by his losses in Pennsylvania, he concluded to settle down, and in a new country. He returned to Rochester and sold out his business there, and in the spring of 1835 came to Michigan in search of a home, leaving his wife and children in Ohio. He came to Detroit, and thence on foot through the country to Allegan, where he bought 80 acres of land on section 34, in Gun Plain township. Mr. Murphy stayed in Gun Plain during the summer, living with a Mr. Seeley, whose house he helped to build. In the fall he returned to Ohio for his family, with whom he at once returned to Mr. Seeley's, where they remained while he built a house. While living with Mr. Seeley 's people Mrs. Murphy, who was an old teacher, taught her own and Mr. Seeley's children, they occupying seats near the spinning-wheel, which she ran as she taught. This was the first school in their part of the town, and the lessons then learned were as valuable as those received in the costly schools of to-day. When settled in their new home they found themselves with a capital of twelve dollars and fifty cents, and with no team, stock, or tools, but with energy and perseverance they at once commenced to make for themselves a home. Fruit-trees were at once set out, clearings were made, and fences built. Roads and cleared fields soon took the place of the forests, while on every side the homes of the new-comers were springing up as if by magic, and Mrs. Murphy says they were very happy in those days, with none of the jealousies and heart-burnings of the present day. Mr. Murphy was a Democrat, and was often the standard-bearer of his party. He was the first supervisor of the toAvn, and held other township offices. When the county was organized he was elected its first sheriff, which office he held two terms, the first term doing the entire business on foot. His popularity and the efficiency shown in the offices he had held brought him prominently before the public, and in the fall of 1852 he was elected to represent his district in the State Legislature, which position he filled with credit to himself and his con- stituents. He was chairman of the committee on Indian affairs during the time of his service in the house. On his return from Lansing, Mr. Murphy retired from political life and gave his attention to his farm, until his son finally took entire charge of it. He died June 19, 1874, mourned and regretted by a large circle of friends and acquaintance Mr. Murphy was married Jan. 4, 1825, to Miss Mary Avers, daughter of Thomas and Mary (Hawkins) Ayers.

Its bridges were of the most primitive kind, many of the little lakes and streams being bridged only with floating logs, which often rolled under the oxen's feet, looking at times as though a duck ing, if nothing worse, awaited the whole family. JUSTUS B. SUTHERLAND. Reuben Sutherland was born at Horse Neck, on the sea coast, in the State of New York, where he grew to manhood. (His father was born in Scotland, and wore the bonnet and kilt.) Arrived at his majority, he went to Dutchess Co., N. Y., and bought a farm, and there he married. He was a strong Whig, and had uubounded faith in the Continental Congress and its financial policy. To prove his faith he took entire pay for his farm (which he sold about the be ginning of the Revolution) in Continental money, and which became worthless in his possession, thereby depriving The distance from Detroit to Gull Prairie, now made in fh'e hours, then took Mr. Sutherland, with his ox-team, as many days, and, although he traveled as cheaply as possible, it cost him sixty-four dollars. Arrived in the town, he stayed a few days with old Mr. Dunham while he built a log house on his farm. There were then but a few families in the town, Mr. Arnold's family being the nearest one west, while east of him there was no one living in the town ship. The house completed, he at once moved his family in, and life in the new home had begun. Around the house the deer and other game roamed by day, while the wolves made night hideous with their howling. So thick were the latter that Mr. Sutherland found it impossible to keep sheep or calves unless in a high pen. With the energy and perseverance for which the pioneers were noted, he at once commenced to clear and improve his farm. His land and traveling expenses had taken nearly all his means. Still, his family never went hungry or knew want. Clothing then was hard to get, and often buckskin took the place of cloth. On the farm he then bought Mr. Sutherland has lived nearly half a century, and he intends to pass the re mainder of his days where so many pleasant hours have been passed. The then wilderness has changed to beautiful homes, churches, and villages, all of which changes he has done his share to create. He is now in his eighty-second year, and a man respected and esteemed by all who know him. In politics Mr. Sutherland is a Democrat. When the town was first organized he was elected constable and collector, which offices he held at different times. He has also been treasurer and school inspector. For his first wife Mr. Sutherland married Elmira Bliss, daughter of Ebenezer Bliss. She was born Oct. 10, 1803. They had the fol lowing children: Bliss, born Jan. 1, 1824; Abraham K, born Dee. 12, 1825; Mercy, born March 1, 1827; Louisa, born April 30, 1829 ; Francis N., born March 12, 1831 ; Morris J., born Oct. 10, 1832 ; Lazetta, born Aug. 15, 1834; Pitt D., born Aug. 18, 1837, killed by a horse, Oct. 27, 1856; Emily M., born Dec. 18, 1839; Darwin D., born Dec. 28, 1841 ; Dewitt O, born Aug. 28, 1842; Mortimer W., born Oct. 21, 1845. Mrs. Sutherland died March 1, 1853. For his second wife, Mr. Sutherland mar ried his first wife's sister, Mrs. Esther Allen, who was born Oct. 11, 1796. JUSTUS B. SUTHERLAND. him of his all. He was not subject to the draft, but en listed in the patriot army and served as a private. Was present at the surrender of Burgoyne. After the war he moved to Broome Co., N. Y., where he bought one hun dred and ten acres of new land, which he partly improved, and where he died, Sept. 10, 1799. His son, Justus B. Sutherland, the subject of this sketch, was born in the town of Lisle, Broome Co., N. Y., March 15, 1799. Here he r,rew to man's estate, living with his mother until her death, which took place when he was twenty-two years old. After his mother's death he bought a small farm of fifty acres, which was all new. This farm he cleared, and upon it he lived until 1833, when he sold out and, leaving his family behind, came to Michigan in search of a home where land was cheap and plenty. Coming to what was then Allegan township, now Gun Plain, he bought the south ELIEZER C. KNAPP. Eliezer C. Knapp was born April 14, 1828, in the town of Pine Plains, Dutchess Co., N. Y.

Y., where he resided on the farm of his father until 1834, when he moved into Wayne County, same State, and bought a farm in the town of Arcadia, on which he resided until his death, in 1848. Eliezer grew to manhood on the home-farm, learning early that boys as well as men were destined to earn their living by the sweat of their brow. Arrived at his majority, he started out in life for himself, his capital consisting of health, strength, and determination to carve out for himself a suc cessful future. His first work was in a warehouse in the village of Newark, where he worked one year. Then for a couple of years he found employment in a machine-shop in Newark, and at the carpenter's trade in Clyde. In the spring of 1852, having been in poor health for several months, he started for California, his physician haviug recommended a change of climate. He went by the Nica ragua route, and arrived in San Francisco in July, 1852. Soon after his arrival he went up the north fork of the American River and engaged in mining. In the fall he went to Sacramento, and there worked at his trade for a short time, when he went to Marysville and took charge of a machine-shop, a position he held until the spring of 1854, when he returned to the States with but little more money than when he lest home. Soon after his return he came to Michigan, and in the town of Gun Plain bought the farm he now owns, running almost entirely in debt for it. There were no buildings and but twenty acres improved. By his management and labor the farm has become one of the fine farms of the township, with good buildings and nearly all improved, while to it he has added, until it now comprises one hundred and forty-six acres, the result of untiring energy and industry.

They landed in New York, from whence they went to Troy. Their money being exhausted, they stopped in Troy, where Mr. Bellingham worked in a market-garden, while his son, William A., then a lad of eight years, worked in the market mornings, receiv ing sixpence a morning for his services, which consisted in calling out in his English way, \" Here's where you get your nice inyans aud lettuce,\" which attracted much attention and a good deal of merriment. In August they came on to Detroit, where they again found themselves out of means, save a half-dollar. The family and goods were located in the street, where they were to stay until Mr. Bellingham and William A. could walk to the brother-in-law's (Mr. John Young), in Washtenaw County. As they were about to set out, a stranger came to them and asked what they were doing in the street. On being told that it was fur want of means to do any better, he at once invited them into his house, to stay until Mr. Bellingham returned. They then invested their half-dollar in crackers and cheese, and set out about four o'clock in the afternoon for Washtenaw. That night they slept in a straw-stack and the next day reached their destination. William A. and his cousin returned for the family, whom they found with the kind stranger, who refused to take any pay for his kindness. They found Mr. Young, like the most of the early settlers, the owner o a form and scarce anything else. They remained with him a In politics Mr. Knapp is a Democrat, although he now and for eight terms past has held the office of supervisor in a Republican township, filling the office to the entire satis faction of his constituents. On the 16th day of November, 1851, he was married to Miss Charlotte Harvey, daughter of Byron and Ruth (Waite) Harvey, who was born Oct. 15, 1830. To them was born Ida E., Feb. 9, 1855. She is the wife of Henry Crosbie, and resides in Ionia. Mrs. Knapp died Sept. 1, 1856. For his second wife Mr. Knapp married, June 28, 1858, Miss Frances Linderman, who was born Dec. 16, 1833, daughter of Jacob and Desire (Conrad) Linderman. Their union has been blessed with three chil dren, viz. : Will, born Jan. 23, 1860 ; Mabel, born Aug. 11, 1862 ; and Genevieve, born March 16, 1S65, died Oct. 20, 1865.

He finally got enough ahead so that he bought of the govern ment forty acres in the town of Lima. To this he added eighty acres, all of which he traded for the west half of the southeast quarter of section 15 in Gun Plain township, Allegan Co., and on which he located in 1844, and where he resided until his death, Nov. 2, 1878. His farm he cleared and improved and enlarged to three hundred and twenty acres. He Avas a Democrat, and held the offices of justice of the peace and township clerk. Was a member of the Baptist Church. He was highly esteemed by his neigh bors and fellow-townsmen, and is spoken of as one whom to know was to admire and respect. Mr. Bellingham was married Jan. 18, 1819, to Miss Phillis Powell, who was born March 28, 1800. There were born to them the following children : Catherine, born April 9, 1822 ; William A., born Nov. 19, 1824 ; Ellen, born April 20, 1827 ; Ruth, born July 19, 1829; Esther, born May 9, 1832; Ann, born Sept. 28, 1834; Sarah, born July 7, 1838; and Orpha, born Jan. 6, 1S43, \u2014 tbe two last born in America. Mrs. Bellingham died Jan. 2, 1844. Sarah, married July 4, 1853, Ralph Richmond, who was born in Twinsburg, Por tage Co., Ohio, Feb. 22, 1828. Their union has been blessed with two children, viz. : Lucy, bom Sept. 25, 1859, and Ernest, born Oct. 15, 1869. children, of whom Russel B. Fenner was the sixth. He was born in Pompey, Feb. 9, 1814, and grew to manhood on the farm of his father, for whom he worked until he arrived at his majority, when he started out on his own account. He worked one year for his father, then one season at the carpenter's trade, after which he worked his father's farm on shares four years. In 1841 Mr. Fenner bought fifty acres of land, which he built upon and im proved, and which he traded with his father for one hun dred and forty acres of wild land in the town of Martin, Allegan Co., Mich. In 1844 he came to Martin, and soon after, in company with his brother, built the first saw-mill in the town. It was called Fenner's mill, and was built in what was laid out to be the village of Smyrna. The brothers ran the mill about four years, when Russel sold his interest in it and then gave his attention to farming and the carpenter's trade. He improved about seventy acres of his farm, and built on it a large log house and a fine barn. In 1855 Mr. Fenner sold his Martin farm and bought in the town of Gun Plain the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section 5, and the southwest quarter of the southwest quarter of section 4, which was partly improved. On this place he has erected good build ings, planted orchards, and made himself and wife a beau tiful home, a sketch of which appears on another page of this work. Mr. Fenner is in every sense of the word a self-made man. He is one who believes that what one man can do another can, and he has never hesitated to attempt any work that place and circumstances has called upon him to perform. He has devoted much time to the study of medicine, and, though he has no diploma as a physician and does not hold himself out as one, still he has in his day performed many cures. He is and has always been a Democrat, and has been for three years road commissioner, and for eleven years a justice of the peace in a Republican township. On the 28th day of Septem ber, 1837, Mr. Fenner was joined in marriage to Miss Hannah V. Schenck, who was born in Lysander, Aug. 13, 1817. She is a daughter of Rules and Elsie (Baird) Schenck. There have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Fenner five children, viz. : Byron R., born March 4, 1839 ; Eliza E., April 1, 1842 ; William P., Dec. 22, 1844 ; all in Ly sander.

His ancestors originally settled on Long Island and were from England, but at what time is not known. After his marriage to Miss Betsey Perry, James emigrated to Onondaga Co., N. Y., and settled in the town of Man lius, where he worked at his trade, that of a millwright, helping to build many of the first mills of that then new country. In 1818, having sold his land in the town of Pompey (same county), where he had been living for some time, he moved with his family into the town of Lysander, Onondaga Co., where he bought a large tract of new land. This land he cleared and improved, setting out orchards aud erecting fine buildings, and making it in time one of the fine farms of his township, and on which he lived until his death, Jan. 16, 1851. There were born to them nine"], [309, ""], [310, "Residence & Fruit Farm of O.J LEMOIN, Heath, Michigan,"], [311, "HEATH The township of Heath has grown but slowly since its settlement, from the fact that its first residents were at tracted by the prolific growth of pine timber, and located there only for purposes of lumbering. Finding no strong inducements to remain aster the forests had been felled, they departed for other fields of labor. In point of conve nience Heath has an advantageous location, with the Grand Haven Railroad running transversely across it, and affording at the stations of Dunningville and Hamilton opportunities for the shipment of produce. It is designated on the United States survey as township 3 north, of range 14 west, having Overisel on the north, Pine Plains on the south, Monterey on the east, and Manlius on the west. The township has many beautiful and expansive views, and a considerable variety of surface. No striking elevations are to be seen, but many gentle slopes and numerous level plains diversify the scenery. A portion of the level land is swampy, though efforts are being made to drain these tracts. lage by crops of corn and wheat. Yet potatoes and garden vegetables find here a congenial soil and attain great size. Fruits are raised to a considerable extent, many fine orchards being found on the farms of the settlers. Peach crops are engaging the attention of farmers, both the soil and climate of Heath having been found well adapted to their growth. Many orchards have recently been started, and give promise of good revenues to their owners ; in fact, fruit-culture bids fair to be decidedly successful, and to redeem Heath from the somewhat dubious agricultural reputation which it has heretofore acquired. PURCHASERS OF LAND FROM GOVERNMENT. The following parties were the first purchasers of the land embraced in the present township of Heath : Section 1.\u2014 Bought from 1837 to 1834 by J. S.

Section 3. \u2014 Bought from 1833 to 1854 by Bronson and Swan, Daniels and Fetterman, Lucius Abbott, Benjamin Eager, Henry Abbott. Two rivers traverse the township, the Kalamazoo, which passes through the southwest corner, and Rabbit River, which affords a fine water-power in the northwest portion. Silver Creek, in the northeast quarter, flows in a northerly direction, and finds an outlet in the last-named river. The Kalamazoo River is fed by Deer and Bear Creeks, which floAV from the west and join it on section 32. Pine has been the principal timber of the township and its chief source of revenue. The largest and best trees have, how ever, been generally converted into lumber, leaving an infe rior quality still upon the ground, and eATen this is rapidly disappearing. In the northwest and southeast portions beech, oak, and maple flourish to a moderate extent, while the swampy land produces tamarack and other timber peculiar to such soil.

On the bottom-land along the rivers and creeks an alluvial soil is found, which equals in productiveness any in the county. Wheat and corn are the staple products of the township, a large portion of which is not yet sufficiently cleared to raise crops. Fine crops of corn have been raised on the clay land when deeply plowed, and on the river-bottoms an unusual yield is obtained. Section 13. \u2014 Bought in 1836 by Chandler Hollister, A. L. and A.

Abram Parkhurst, previously a resident of Branch County, moved to Heath in 1854, and purchased 40 acres on section 8. The work of farming was interspersed with the exciting life of a hunter and trapper, in which occu pations Mr. Parkhurst was remarkably skillful. Deer and other game were still plentiful, and his re\\Tenue was mate rially increased by the various furs and skins which he cap tured. The opportunities for such exploits are now so rare as to enable him to devote his attention exclusively to his farm, upon which he is still a resident.

Considerable of the land of Heath was purchased from the government as early as 1833, but the first settler did not appear until 1850, when Simon Howe obtained control under a contract of a portion of section 6, upon which he and Col. John Littlejohn erected a saw-mill on Rabbit River. This property was subsequently leased to other parties, and after a brief residence in the hamlet of Rabbit River, now Hamilton, Howe moved to Kalamazoo County, where he died. He passed through many vicissitudes during his business career at Rabbit River, and ultimately left the place with his exchequer greatly reduced as the result of his commercial schemes. Philander Smith settled in 1854 upon 40 acres in section 36, which he purchased of Daniel Rhodabaugh. He built a shingle-mill, which was run by horse-power, and for a while supplied many of the shingles which were used in that portion of the township. Daniel Rhodabaugh also owned a farm on the same sec tion, having obtained it on a land-Avarrant for services in the Mexican war. He entered the army at the beginning of the late war, and after his return moved to St. Louis, Mo., where he now resides. His farm is now occupied by Joseph Taylor. Peter Rhodabaugh came in 1854, and established a shingle-mill on section 12. The second settler was John Sadler, who left Rochester, N. Y., in 1841, and first located in Allegan township, where he remained ten years. Having, during this time, pur- chased 80 acres on section 36, in Heath, he removed thither in 1851. With him came his three sons, Jonathan, Richard A., and Andrew J. Sadler. They found Simon Howe already established on section 6 and preparing to build his saw-mill. Mr. Sadler aud his sons, having pre- viously lived within a short distance of their new purchase, had found it easy to make the necessary improvements on the land before becoming residents. They had already erected a log house and cleared a considerable tract. Indi- ans were still quite common in the spring and fall, usually chosing their spring residence in the vicinity of maple- groves, where they made considerable quantities of sugar for use or exchange. Mr. Sadler died in 1863 on the homestead which is now occupied by his son, Andrew. Jonathan Sadler resides on the east half of section 36. Daniel H. Dowd, who now resides in Allegan, lest the city of Chicago for the pine-forests of Heath in 1856. He chose section 2 as a location, where he purchased 320 acres of land. The largest log house in the county (which is still occupied), together with a substantial barn, was built by him soon after his arrival. Samuel S. Graham had previously erected a log shanty just east of Mr. Dowd's place, which he had been in the habit for se\\*eral years of occupying in the summer, removing in the winter to his more comfortable residence in Branch County. Into this cabin Mr. Dowd and his family removed until his own resi dence was completed. Mr. Dowd cleared a considerable portion of his land, much of it having been covered with pine of a superior quality. A part of it, by hard labor, he made quite productive. On Silver Creek, which runs through the farm, his son, Charles S. Dowd, owns and manages a large saw-mill, which is one of the most flourish ing of the business enterprises of the township. Porter Shields arrived in the township in 1852, and lo cated upon section 35. He was afterwards employed in the saw-mill built by Ambrose Beldeu iu 1856, aud while"], [313, "HEATH TOWNSHIP. 241 William Lowrie purchased 400 acres on sections 8 and 9 in 1855, upon which he built a house and improved 40 acres. He subsequently sold it, however, and removed to Monterey. was employed as foreman in the saw-mill, and at nearly the same time Aaron Willards became interested in it, and was among the transient residents of the place. W. II. Mohn arrived later, from Wayne Co , Ohio, and settled in Hamilton. He removed with his family to a framed house that had been erected and vacated, and engaged in work at the mill. He afterwards followed his trade as a carpenter. Simeon Howe found for a short time a home in the family of Mr. Mohn. The population was at this time, and has been since, transient in character, very few of those em ployed in milling or lumbering having become permanent residents. The present supervisor, C. R. Brownell, is a resident of the place, where he is engaged in milling and other occupations. He removed from Allegan in 1866, where his father now resides. Mr. Brownell placed the writer under many obligations for aid in his researches after facts. Fitch Swan purchased, in 1855, the north half of the northwest quarter of section 1, and the north half of the northeast quarter of section 2. He improved this land and remained upon it several years, after which he ex changed it for land in Branch County, owned by James Roblyer, who became a resident of Heath in 1866, and now occupies the land he obtained from Mr. Swan. George H. Phelps, in connection with his son, C. D. Phelps, erected a saw-mill on section 28 in 1855, which was for many years in operation, but is now in ruins. Mr. Phelps resided in Heath until his death, in 1872. Charles Davis came to the township in 1862, and pur chased land at Hamilton. Mrs. Davis was a daughter of James M. Heath, from whom the township was named. The family still reside near the hamlet just named. THE GRIST-MILL. In 1861, George P. Heath built a grist-mill on Rab bit River, occupying the site of the present mill, and con ducted it until 1867, when Frank Schorno purchased the property. While under the management of Lewis Schorno the mill was burned, and the site remained unoccupied until 1879, when Messrs. Kullen, Kepple & Co. purchased the site and erected one of the most complete grist-mills in the county. The interest of the first partner was soon after transferred to John Schipper, and the mill was in active operation during the same year. Its power is supplied by Avater from the river, and with four run of stone its utmost capacity is 100 barrels per day, though not often pressed to this limit. It has also a feed-stone, which is constantly in use. The latest improvements in making flour by the most recent process are adopted, and a ready market is found in Milwaukee, Boston, and portions of Illinois. The home market also makes large demands on this mill, 100 bar rels per week being disposed of at Muskegou and Grand Haven. The earliest death recalled was that of Jesse Clements, who fell a victim to the brutality of his son. The culprit was sentenced to the State prison, where, after repeated ex hibitions of his murderous instinct, his existence finally ended. HAMILTON. The little village of Hamilton (formerly known as Rabbit River), dates its first recorded event in 1835, when Charles Butler entered the whole section upon which it is located. It subsequently came into the possession of Anton Schorno, Chauncey W. Calkins, and Elnathan Judson. Simon Howe became the controller, under a contract, of a certain portion of the land, and, in connection with Col. John Littlejohn, built the saw-mill known throughout the county as the Rabbit River Mill, which contained both a circular and an upright saw. This mill was built in 1852, but the same year the dam gave out. It was in 1855 re built by Col. Littlejohn, and subsequently purchased and controlled by Howe, by whom it was leased to Messrs. Allen & Jewett. In 1857, James B. Streeter managed it, and at the expiration of his period of ownership, embracing eighteen months, it became the property of H. M. Peck, who sold it to Robert M. Moore, by whom Henry Porter was employed to superintend the enterprise. In 1873 Charles R. Brownell, who had previously rented the property, pur chased it, and is now the proprietor. The capacity of the mill is 12,000 feet per day. OTHER BUSINESS. There are at Hamilton, in addition to the mill, two stores, containing a general stock of goods, kept by H. J. Fisher, who is also postmaster, and by Messrs. Kolvoort & Baker ; one hardware-store, owned by Benjamin Bosman ; a black smith-shop, kept by Hiram Lee ; a shoe-shop, by Eugene Lesperence ; and a cooper-shop, by Southwin. The school of the district is taught by Harry Sears. A bending works doing an active business is owned by W. B. Lin coln, and a hotel built in 1872 is kept by C. M. Wood ruff. The physician of the place is Dr. Charles H. Kimber, who is also the proprietor of a public hall which does credit to the enterprise of Hamilton. The earliest settler was a man who was engaged to board the hands employed by the first owners of the mill. His name is not recalled. A shanty was erected for his conve nience on the north side of the river, which for a brief time afforded shelter to all who came to the little hamlet. SCHOOLS. G. B. Sheffield came from Ontario Co., N. Y., in 1852, and aster a brief residence in Holland removed to Hamil ton. He built a framed house, aud was for a while em ployed in the mill. In 1858 he purchased a farm in the township of Fillmore, where he at present resides, though still transacting much business at the place of his early resideuce. The first school was opened in district No. 1, now em braced in that portion of the township known as Pine Plains. The second district embraced what was known as the Sadler neighborhood, a log school-house having been early built in this locality. None of the early teachers are remembered. Miss Mercy Bigsby was the first to instruct the little ones in district No. 1 , though this territory would now be properly regarded as a portion of Pine Plains, and In 1855 a man named Lockrey came to the place and engaged in lumberiug.

The district school is presided over by Nelson Young, whose skill as teacher has warranted his employment for a succes sion of years. Heath is divided into one fractional and four whole dis tricts, the board of directors being B. B. Martin, Jonathan Sadler, C. S. Dowd, D. P. Veach, and C. M. Woodruff. There are four frame school buildings in the towuship, valued at $1430. The number of children who are in structed is 170, three male and six female teachers being employed in the various districts. They receive in salaries annually the sum of $776. The total resources of the township for school purposes are $1329.02, of which $107.44 is derived from the primary school fund. REFORMED (DUTCH) CHURCH. The Society of the Reformed (Dutch) Church at Over isel, having observed at this locality the want of conveni ences for worship, determined upon the erection of a church edifice. Aided by subscriptions from the residents of the township, they erected the present building, and also a con venient parsonage, at a total cost of $3000. The work was done under the supervision of Rev. Gerret Dangre mond, who after the dedication of the edifice was installed as its first pastor. He remained until 1871, when the pulpit was supplied by the Methodist Conference. Rev. N. D. Marsh was the pastor from 1874 to 1876, when he was succeeded by Rev. H. D. Lawrence, who remained until 1878. EARLY ROADS. Soon after the Holland colony arrived in Michigan an effort was made to divert their trade to Allegan, and thereby secure a portion of the gold with which many of them were bountifully supplied. With that view, two highways were surveyed from Allegan, having Holland as their ob jective point, both of which traversed the soil of Heath. The first was known as the Dumont road, and was sur- veyed by John B. Dumont in 1847. It began at Peter Dumont's land, on section 6, in Allegan, to which point a road had been already surveyed from Allegan village, bore to the northwest through Pine Plains, and entered this town- ship on section 36. It ran directly north, crossed the Rabbit River, and passed out of the township on the section-line between sections 1 and 2, on its way to Holland. At present there is no regular organization, though ser vices are held each alternate Sabbath by clergymen whose residences are adjacent to the place. A flourishing Sab bath-school, embracing 50 members and a corps of devoted teachers, is maintained, and much interest is manifested in the work. The superintendent is B. W. Lincoln, and the secretary C. R. Brownell. LODGE OF I. O. O. F., No. 315. The charter of this lodge bears date Oct. 19, 1878, the following gentlemen having held office when it was insti tuted : G. B. Sheffield, N. G. ; C. E. Siple, V. G. ; C. W. Stone, Sec. ; J. Bowman, Treas. It has 27 members, and holds its convocations in a hall fitted for the purpose and rented for five years from G. B. Sheffield. The present officers are C. R. Brownell, N. G. ; Albert Helmer, V. G. ; John Boyd, Sec. ; J. Bowman, Treas. A railroad, known as the Bee-Line road, was projected by James M. Heath, which also had Holland as its terminus. It began near the residence of Maj. Heath, on section 12, in Pine Plains (then Heath), and, passing northwest into Heath, which it entered on section 35, ran diagonally through the township in a northwesterly direction, passing out near the northwest corner, on section 6. This highway was surveyed a few months later than the Dumont road, and had an equal share of the public travel. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. The survey of the township of Heath was made by Cal vin Britain, and completed on the 7th of March, 1831. It was formerly included in the township of Allegan, having been made an independent township by an act of the State Legislature approved March 18, 1851, which reads as fol lows : \" That all that portion of territory lying east and north of the Kalamazoo River, in township 2 north, of range 14 west, together with the whole of township 3 north, of range 14 west, be and the same is hereby set off from the township of Allegan and organized into a separate township by the name of Heath, and that the first town ship-meeting therein shall be held at the house of James M. Heath, in said township.\" In 1871 its area was diminished by as much territory as is now embraced in Pine Plains, lying north of the Kalamazoo River, leaving it with a boundary six miles square. It was named in compliment to one of its early settlers, Maj. James M. Heath. DUNNINGVILLE. This hamlet was first settled by Andrew Whistler, who arrived early (the date is not -remembered) and purchased the half of section 28, upon which he located a saw-mill, Bear Creek affording the water-power. He was accom- panied by his nephew, John Whistler. After the mill had been established and conducted a brief time by Andrew Whistler, it was sold to Martin Miller and John Whistler. Their term of ownership was also brief, when it passed into the possession of Riley Granger, who in turn disposed of the property to Messrs. Dunning and Hopkins, of Sau- gatuck. Their successor was a party named Brewer, durino* whose ownership it was burned. The present owner, Wil- liam Scott, then purchased the property, and erected on the debris of the old mill a new and more complete structure, which is now in successful operation. William A. Earl erected the first and only store in the place, which has since been closed. A hotel affords hospitality to the trav- eler, the landlord being William Scott, who is also post master. A religious society of Wesleyan Methodists exists in the place, who worship in the school-house on each The earliest township-meeting of the township of Heath was held on the first Monday in April, 1851.

J., not yet of age, purchased one hundred and twenty acres on section 24, making a small payment, and until 1859 devoted his time, winters, lumbering, sum mers returning to Illinois to work at his trade (masonry). December 9th of that year he married Harriet A., daughter of H. G. and Amanda M. Howlett, residents of Lee Co., 111., and returned to his wilderness home in Michigan. In 1867 he purchased eighty acres on section 26, where he removed June 1, 1868. This, with an additional purchase of two hundred and eighty acres, constitutes his farm. Mr. Lemoin was influenced to his purchase, believing that the location and soil were adapted to fruit-culture, which has proved cor rect. He first began by planting three acres of peaches, pears, and grapes, increasing the acreage, until to-day he has over seventy acres planted. He may proudly call the reader's attention to his view as illustrative of the above. We append as the result of the union of these goodly people their family record : Frank F., born May 6, 1861 ; James E., born Nov. 4, 1864, died Nov. 1, 1865; Mary A., born Jan. 5, 1866, died in infancy; Rosilia A., born May 22, 1867 ; Cornelia C, born Dee. 20, 1869 ; Jenette M., born Aug. 29, 1874; Cora A., born Dec. 11, 1877; Fred H., born Oct. 23, 1879.

Jan. 1, 1874, Mr. Brownell married Fidelia M. Spencer, daughter of Simeon and Mehitable (Baker) Spen cer, known as one of the pioneers of Clinton Co., Mich. In 1873 Mr. Brownell purchased the Rabbit River Mills; previous to and since that date he has made several pur chases of pine-lands, and has been quite extensively en gaged in lumbering. At the present time he is preparing to engage largely in peach-culture. Aside from his business interests, Mr. Brownell has served his townsmen as super visor and clerk since 1869 ; although not a politician, favors the Democratic party. Is known and recognized among a large circle of acquaintances and friends as a thorough and conscientious business man. 0. J. LEMOIN. The parents of L.

In the year 1853 the family re moved to De Kalb Co., 111., where they remained till the fall HOPKINS. NATUKAL FEATURES. afford ample water-power for milling or other purposes. There are two or three lakes of great magnitude on sections 18 and 32, and numerous springs. The pre\\*ailing timber is beech, oak, basswood, elm, with a small quantity of pine in the northwestern portion. Survey-township No. 3, range 12, constitutes the civil township of Hopkins. It is bounded on the west by Mon terey, on the east by Wayland, on the north by Dorr, and on the south by Watson. It ranks among the foremost townships of the county in the quality of the land and in the amount of its crops, while its reputation as a sugar-pro ducing district has extended beyond the limits of Allegan County. The soil of Hopkins varies in different localities, but is well adapted to the growth of all grains, as well as most vegetables and fruits. A species of vegetable mould abounds in the swamps ; a strong clay subsoil is found on the level plains ; and sand and gravel, interspersed with clay, yield abundant crops on the elevated ground. The yield of wheat is quite equal to the average throughout the county, while oats are exceptional in their prolific growth. Much fine grazing-land is also found in this town ship, and the hay crop is generally extremely good. In the summer of 1873, 771 acres of wheat were harvested, which produced 9523 bushels of that grain, while 777 acres of corn yielded 18,770 bushels. Of other grains 14,404 bushels were produced. Since that time a large area of land has been rendered available, and the crop of all grains is proportionally increased. Portions of the surface of Hopkins are level, though tho larger part is undulating. Along the southern boundary and in the northwestern portion many hills and valleys are to be seen, which abound in picturesque aud beautiful views. The level lands were earliest cleared, and are now covered by fine orchards and fertile fields of waving \"rain. On the west side of the township there is some swampy land, which, however, easily yields to the excellent system of drainage in use, and is rapidly being converted into pro ductive acres. A branch of Rabbit River enters the township at the northeast and another at the southeast corner. They unite on section 20, whence the combined stream passes out of the township near the northwest corner. These streams Hopkins' especial boast, however, is its yield of maple sugar, not being approached in the production of this de licious article by any of its neighbors.

Section 6. \u2014 Bought in 1835 by Talcott Howard, A. L. Cotton, Samuel Hubbard. As late as the fore-part of the year 1838 the area now embraced in the township of Hopkins was an unbroken wilderness, and the only inhabitants were the deer, the wolf, and other wild animals, and their formidable foe the red man.

During the year above mentioned, Jonathan Olin Round, a native of Vermont, and latterly a resident of Kalamazoo County, made his advent as the first settler of Hopkins. Mr. Round had come the previous year and located the southwest quarter of section 26, where he had erected a loo- cabin and made a small clearing, so that a rude home was ready for his family when they arrived in 1838. The life of the Round family was, until the arrival of the next settlers, an extremely isolated one, it being no less than five miles to the nearest neighbor. Mr. Round's first clear ino- was necessarily very roughly done, and his first crops grew up scattered here and there among not only stumps, but lo\u00b0*s. His corn was husked in the fields, beside a blazing fire of logs. He dryly remarks that he gave no invitation to huskiog-bees, as there were no neighbors to respond.

In the family of Mr. Round occurred the first birth in the township, that of his daughter, Sarah A. Round, now Mrs. William S. Kenfleld, who was born in 1838. In June, 1839, Mr. and Mrs. Round were afflicted by the death of their son, Oziel Hopkins Round, aged two and a half years, his being the first death in the township.

Joel Button, a former resident of Cuyahoga Co., Ohio, located in 1853 upon 80 acres on section 15, to which he afterwards added 80 more. It was partially cleared, and a log house had been erected upon it by Luther Martin, who, after a brief residence, had removed to Indiana. J. P. Lindsley arrived with his neighbor, Mr. Button, in 1853, and found a homo on 30 acres of section 33. He was one of the Ohio colony, and purchased of Zenas Pratt, who moved to another part of the township. James E. Parma lee, formerly of Summit Co., Ohio, located in 1854 upon 80 acres on section 22. He was a carpenter by trade, and found many demands made upon his time and skill. Mr. Parmalee erected a substantial frame house upon his farm, and also speedily demonstrated that the labors of the hus bandman were no less congenial to him than those of the carpenter. II is nearest neighbors were Edward Barbarow, who purchased 50 acres on section 23 (where he died in 1859), and J. P. Lindsley, already mentioned. In the fall of 1838 came Erastus Congdon, who built a cabin on section 26, the northwest quarter of which he purchased, and on which, a year later, he became a perma nent resident. He was also a Vermonter, and had been a temporary resident in Kalamazoo County, where he arrived in company with Mr. Round. Mr. Congdon was after wards the first postmaster in the township. His death occurred at Hopkins in 1871, where his two sons, Albert P. and Erastus B. Congdon, now reside. Among the earliest pioneers of Hopkins were Esek Baker and two sons, Harvey N. and Jason Baker, the first of whom entered 100 acres of land on section 28 in 1837, to which he subsequently added 40 acres. Har vey N. Baker had been a resident of Canada previously to 1836, when he came to Michigan. After a short stay in Martin he removed to Hopkins in 1838, having also lo cated on section 28. While residing in Martin he had built a log house and made some advances towards clearing his land. Jason Baker is the only survivor of the family, and still occupies the old homestead, which he has made one of the most productive farms in the township. Jackson Baker, a son of Harvey N. Baker, resides in Hopkins, on section 3, where he has 100 acres, which he purchased in 1854. At nearly the same time came William H. Parmalee, who located 120 acres upon sections 9 and 10, which he cleared and improved. He participated actively in public affairs, and held many offices of trust in the township. Among the leading citizens of German descent in the township are the family of Hoffmasters, who removed from Mahoning Co., Ohio, in 1854. John Hoffmaster pur chased 80 acres on section 19, and placed his family under the care of a brother in Monterey while he erected a com fortable habitation for their occupancy. He at once began the labor of improving his land, doing all this labor with his own hands, as he had neither oxen nor horses to assist in the operation. His nearest neighbor was Konrad Krug, who preceded him from Ohio in 1853, and had settled upon 120 acres on section 19, where he still resides. Mr. Hoffmaster still lives in Hopkins, but has recently moved to the southeast portion of the township. The first wedding in the township occurred at the house of Mr. Esek Baker, the parties being his daughter, Miss Huldah Baker, and Mr. John Lardner. T. J. Crampton settled in Hopkins in 1839, having pur chased 40 acres on section 16. John J. Lardner arrived in 1841, and purchased 120 acres on section 35, and an additional 40 in the adjoining township of Watson. He found the same obstacles await ing him that had been encountered by his predecessors, but devoted much energy to the work of improving his land. Subsequently he purchased a farm in Kalamazoo County, and made it his residence. Gotlieb Hoffmastgr, a native of Wittenberg, Germany, emigrated to America with his father in 1817, and arrived in Hopkins in 1854. He purchased 80 acres on section 20, and the log house of his brother John gave him tem porary shelter until he could build one of his own. He, too, is still a resident of the township. William Tyler followed soon after, and found a home upon 80 acres on section 29. John Hicks was also a pioneer of about the same period, but does not appear to have become a land-owner on his arrival. Nelson Corbitt and his family made their weary and tedious way to Hop kins with an ox-team in the fall of 1846. On section 35 he purchased 120 acres, and the family obtained shelter at the log house of Jonathan O. Round until quarters could be erected on their own land. Mr. Corbitt went to work resolutely to clear his place, but did not long survive his advent. His death occurred in the fall of 1850, and his estate, with his heritage of hard labor, passed to his son. The latter died in 1878, and left the farm in possession of his widow, who now resides upon it. Joseph Hoffmaster arrived in 1855, and at once secured 320 acres on section 18. He was the eldest of the brothers, and had accumulated property in Ohio, which of course greatly aided him in his Michigan experience. He lived upon the farm until his death, in 1873, having previously divided his property among his children. Albert Lane, another Ohio pioneer, came from Summit County, in that State, in 1854, purchased 80 acres on sec tion 22, 120 acres on section 27, and 80 acres on section 29. On section 27 a log house had already been built and 10 acres chopped. This dispensed with much of the pre liminary labor of the settler, and enabled Mr. Lane to make rapid progress. Forty acres of cleared land was the result of his first year of toil. His nearest neighbors were Jason Baker and Seralpha C. Buck, the latter of whom had pre ceded him and located upon 115 acres on section 27. Mr. John Parsons became a resident upon 1 60 acres on sec tion 1 in 1843, and William H. Warner purchased and oc cupied 40 acres upon section 15 the year following, which they both improved. For many years there was little emigration to Hopkins, although the neighboring townships were being rapidly populated.

William Parmelee's hospitality was gladly accepted while Mr. Eg gleston was engaged in erecting a habitation of his own. There were no near neighbors, with the exception of Wil liam Frue on the same section, whose death occurred in 1860. Mr. Eggleston is still a resident of the township. H. F. White, another member of the Ohio colony, arrived in 1854, and chose a residence upon section 22, where he purchased 80 acres of unimproved land. As Mr. White had no team, he could improve his land but slowly, his first planting being done without any plowing whatever. Luther Martin early located on section 15, where he owned 50 acres, which he cleared up. He then repaired to section 23, and finally removed to Indiana, where he died. Among other settlers who arrived as early as 1853, or earlier, were Jonathan Brewer, who located 80 acres on section 28 ; John Breslin, who resided on section 32; R. B. Congdon, who purchased 80 acres on section 28 ; D. C. Ingerson ; I. Joy, who settled upon 160 acres on section 24; Hiram Loomis, who located on section 14 ; John Par sons, whose farm embraced 160 acres on section 1 ; John Truax, who owned 80 acres on section 3 ; Matthew Van Dusen, who made his home on section 1 ; Thomas Wilson, Benjamin Truax, Chester B. Storrs, and Edward Daily, Jr. Many of these gentlemen were active in promoting the in terests of the township, but it is impracticable to go into further details. Alonzo Button arrived from Cuyahoga Co., Ohio, in 1855, and purchased 240 acres on section 14, a small portion of which had been cleared. He still lives on the place he originally selected. Among the enterprising pioneers of 1854 were Abram, Peter, and Eliphalet Buskirk, who like so many others had been residents of Ohio. Abram and Peter purchased land on section 23, the former owning 40 and the latter 60 acres. Eliphalet, however, made his home upon 80 acres on sec tion 13. They devoted themselves to improving their farms, and all still occupy their original locations, upon which inviting frame houses have since been built. Wil liam Buskirk came one year later, and purchased 160 acres on section 24, where he now resides. Hopkins, like other Michigan townships, could not dis play much wealth in its early days, and, perhaps on account of its slow settlement, had a longer struggle with poverty than some townships whose prosperity is not now equal to its own. Johnny-cake was the staple article of diet, and a tattered garment did not prove an obstacle to admission to the best society of Hopkins. Many barefooted worshipers were seen at the religious services on Sabbath, and William Wheeler, who conducted the exercises in the log school house in district No. 2, frequently officiated without coat or shoes. Poverty in the primitive days of the township history was accomoaniea with nc disgrace. Dr. James M. Baldwin became a resident of the town ship in 1853, and immediately began the practice of his profession. Previous to this date the health of the towns people was cared for by Drs. Briggs and Bradley, of Way land. S. W. Mankin, a native of Columbiana Co., Ohio, with his wife and three children, emigrated to Hopkins in the fall of 1853, and purchased of Jonathan Brewer 80 acres on section 28. After converting the uncultivated land of 1853 into a fine farm, Mr. Mankin moved to Hopkins' Station in 1877, leaving his place in charge of his son. At the station he engaged in carrying on the business of black smithing and repairing wagons. EARLY ROADS. The earliest recorded highways were surveyed in 1840, the line of the first road being laid out by S. Barber, in April of that year. It pursued the following course : William R. Ingerson, a native of Vermont, emigrated to Michigan in 1850, and purchased land near Jonathan O. Round, where he still resides. His brother, D. C. Inger son, came in 1854, and located 160 acres on section 24, where he now lives. They have met with the success that always follows persistent and well-directed efforts. L. A. Atwater became a resident of Hopkins in 1856. He worked several years in R. A. Baird's saw-mill. He pur chased 50 acres of land on section 14 from Alonzo Button, subsequently added 40 more, and finally moved on to his place in 1863. \" Commencing at the northeast corner of section two, in township four north, of range twelve west, in Allegan County and State of Michigan ; from thence south five miles to the northeast corner of section thirty five; from thence south forty-five degrees west to the southwest corner of tbe above-named section, all in the above-named township ; thence south between sections two and three in township three north, of range twelve west, one mile to the northeast corner of section ten ; thence south forty-five degrees west one hundred and thirteen chains, to the northeast corner of section sixteen ; thence south sixty-three chains to an iron-wood post, distant from a white-oak tree twenty-four inches in diameter ninety-seven links, course from post to tree being north forty-four degrees west; thence south seventy-eight degrees east four chains one hundred and twenty-five links, to a beech-tree three inches in diameter, distant from an elm-tree twelve inches in diameter fifty-six links north forty-eight degrees east; thence south thirty-one degrees five minutes east three chains and forty-six links, to a thorn-apple post three inches in diameter, standing on the north bank of Rabbit River, distant eighty-five links.\" Robert Ashley Baird arrived from Ohio in 1856, and in connection with Dr. E. H. Wait erected a steam saw-mill, the first in the township, on section 26, of which he soon became the sole manager. Afterwards he purchased a farm upon the adjoining section, on which he resided until his death, in 1872. His widow still occupies the place. His brother, J. A. Baird, also arrived in 1850, and two years later secured 80 acres on section 15. The nearest neighbor at this time Avas J. H. Avery, who was then located upon section 15, but has since removed to Monterey. Mr. Baird's highly-cultivated form and attractive appurtenances are evidence of his success in agricultural pursuits. The next road began at the northwest corner of section 28, in township 3, range 12, running thence east on the section-line one mile, to the northeast corner of the same section. This road was surveyed by R. T. M. Wells. The record of its adoption is dated April 16, 1840, and is signed by William S. Miner and Clark Corey, as highway com missioners."], [326, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 248 Pratt ; the two millinery-stores of Mrs. L. E. Reed and Mrs. J. H. Luddington ; and a market, kept by Walter Kibby. The public school of the district, kept by Miss Russell, is also located here. SCHOOLS. The first account of any action taken by the people of Hopkins in reference to schools is in the township records, from which the following items are gleaned : A post-office was early established at Hopkins Station, Henry Guyott having been the first postmaster. Royal L. Taylor now holds the appointment. The physicians of the place are Drs. Luddington and Leighton. A meeting was held at the house of Erastus Congdon on Tuesday, the 1st day of October, 1844, and a contract for the construction of the first school building in Hopkins was awarded to Jason Baker, for which he received the sum of $26.50. The earliest school was opened on the 16th day of December, 1844, Miss Josephine Wait being the teacher. This building was erected in district No. 1, and was known as the \" Round School-house,\" from the fact of its having been adjacent to the residence of J. 0. Round, the earliest settler in Hopkins. It was many years before a second school building was erected. The township is now divided into ten whole school districts and one frac tional one, with the following board of directors: Frederick Hodge, Charles W. Button, N. W. Smith, Aaron Kroug, Edward Scofield, H. Avery, W. H. Parmelee, Henry Bus kirk, L. C. Chadwick, \"R. L. Taylor, and James Huttlcston. There are nine framed school-houses and one of logs, where 443 scholars receive instruction. The salaries of the teach ers amount to \u00a91796.50 annually. HOPKINS. The original owners of the land embraced in the present village of Hopkins were Erastus Congdon and Elder Buck. In 1856, Dr. E. H. Wait purchased a tract of Mr. Congdon, and in connection with Robert A. Baird erected a steam saw-mill, which was soon aster entirely controlled by the latter gentleman. Dr. Wait meanwhile erected a store, and placed in it a stock of goods. This business he conducted for several years, and then sold to William Richmond, who in 1861 built a flouring-mill and began to operate it. Mr. Richmond disposed of his interest in the store to a Mr. Salisbury, who, however, sold it to its former owner. It finally became the property of parties residing at Kalama zoo. The building was then rented, and was ultimately purchased by Messrs. Aldrich & Baker. On the retirement of Mr. Baker, the firm became Aldrich & Owen. HOPKINS STATION. The hamlet known as Hopkins Station is built on section 19, and principally known as a station of the Kalamazoo division of the Lake-Shore and Michigan Southern Rail road. The site Avas originally owned by John Hoffmaster, who purchased the land in 1854, and afterwards sold it to his nephews, John and Philip Hoffmaster. The railroad company established a station there in 1871, and appointed Royal L. Taylor its agent, who found a temporary habita tion in the log house originally erected by John Hoffmaster. In 1872 the first framed house was erected by Henry Guyott. Two years later Mr. Taylor built a house and store, the latter of which was filled with goods before it was supplied with doors and windows. Messrs. Burnip & Iliff had previously built a cabin, which was temporarily used for the sale of a small stock of groceries. Mr. S. A. Buck, whose advent occurred in 1873, had previously been a resident of Kent County. He purchased 10 acres of the Hoffmasters, a plat of which was recorded on the 17th of October, 1874. John Hoffmaster recorded an addition on the 10th of March, 1876, and another was made by George Wise on the 12th of May, 1877. In the fall of 1873, Mr. Buck built a wagon- and blacksmith-shop aud engaged actively in business, meanwhile erecting buildings and gen erally advancing the interests of the place. The second store in the hamlet was built by Messrs. Hopper & Smith, who engaged for a while in business, and had a liberal trade, but at length disposed of the property and departed for Nebraska. Dr. William K. Darling arrived in 1872, having previ ously enjoyed an extensive practice in Otsego. For five years after his arrival in Hopkins he followed his profession, when ill health compelled him to relinquish its arduous du ties. He then engaged in mercantile pursuits, building the store he now occupies, and placed in it an extensive stock of drugs and groceries. This business he still carries on. Charles S. Chadwick purchased, in 1878, the building erected by Dr. E. H. Wait, and is now extensively engaged in trade. He is also the postmaster of the village. Ira Hill conducts a hardware business, and Thomas Hicks has a blacksmith-shop. He was one of tho pioneers of 1857, having arrived in the county as early as 1839. Dr. U. R. Fox and Dr. Lafayette Stuck are the practicing physicians of this locality. The public school is taught by Martin Baldwin. CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. The earliest religious meetings preparatory to the organ ization of a society were conducted in the various school houses of the township, clergymen of the Methodist Church and the Church of the Disciples having officiated. A society under the auspices of the Congregational Church was formed Aug. 4, 1857, embracing 13 members, the first meeting having been held at the Red school-house in school district No. 1 . On this occasion the Rev. Edward Taylor, of Kal amazoo, delivered the formal sermon, while Rev. Thomas Jones and Rev. E. Andrew assisted in the exercises. John Parsons and William H. Parmalee were at this time chosen as the first deacons. The little band continued to worship in the Red school-house, varying the routine by occasional The hamlet has since become of considerable impor tance. Its leading places of business are a hotel, formerly kept by Abram Hoffmaster, and now managed by Wendle Ederly ; a saw-mill, owned by Cooper & Konkle; a broom handle factory ; three general stores, owned respectively by John Bragenten, J. H. Luddington, and Messrs. Furber & Kidder ; a harness-shop, the proprietor of which is S. V. Bourne ; a tin-shop, kept by Andrew Bee, who enjoys con siderable fame as one of the heroes of the Jefferson Davis capture; two blacksmith-shops, carried on by S. W.

This undertaking was successfully accomplished, and $700 cheer fully subscribed to defray the expense of building. The structure was enlarged to meet the growing wants of the people in 1871, and the amount necessary very readily ob tained. The pastors in succession since the organization of the church have been Revs. James A. McKay, D. W. Comstock, Lewis E. Sikes, S. W. Noyes, Thomas Nield, and J. S. Kidder. acres on section 5, which was then covered with a heavy growth of timber, very little of it having yet been cut. A saw-mill had already been erected on the Rabbit River by a man named Potter. Capt. Billiard, finding this a favorable locality in which to carry on lumbering interests, increased his purchases of land until he owned nearly 2000 acres. He erected a frame residence, and then devoted himself with his accustomed energy to business pursuits until his death, which occurred in 1871. Mrs. Hilliard still resides upon the homestead. Capt. Hilliard had in early life attained a high reputa tion as a skillful navigator upon the St. Lawrence River. A successful voyage in 1840 won for him the admiration of the men of his craft and a handsome testimonial bearing the following inscription : WESLEYAN METHODIST CHURCH. A class under the auspices of this denomination was organized in 1873 by C. G. Fero, services having been held in the school-house on section 32. These services were continued under the successive ministrations of Elders Harvey Johnson and J. Burke, who is the present pastor. \" Presented to Capt. L. Hilliard by John Hamilton, to commemo rate the safe arrival of the steamboat 'Ontario' at Montreal from Prescott, Upper Canada, being tbe first descent over the rapids of the St. Lawrence by steam. The school building, which had for a season been the place of meeting of this small body of worshipers, was finally purchased by them, remodeled, and converted into a neat and attractive church edifice, in which services are now held semi-monthly. A flourishing Sabbath-school is also con nected with the society. \"Aitg. 19, 1840.\" The station of Hilliard's, on the Kalamazoo division of the Lake-Shore and Michigau Southern Railroad, now bears the name of this enterprising pioneer. Three sons are still residents of the township. William H. is the proprietor of the mill which is converted into a handle-factory, Eugene is engaged in mercantile pursuits, and David L. cultivates the farm. A fourth son, Charles H., is a resident of Ot tawa County. At the station are two stores, owned respec tively by Woodhams & Hilliard and Foot & Mudget ; a blacksmith-shop, owned by George Lewis ; a saw-mill, owned by Willard Sadler ; a stave-factory, the proprietor of which is D. W. Lankton ; and a shoe-shop, kept by Charles Armstrong. Occasional religious services are held in other portions of the township, the various school-houses affording convenient places of meeting. HOPKINS LODGE, No. 270, I. O. O. F. This lodge was organized Feb. 19, 1876, with the fol lowing charter members : James Armstrong, A. P. Varney, C. B. Eldred, E. B. Congdon, Richard Redhead, U. R.

ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. The subdivision lines of the survey of survey-township No. 3 north, of range 12 west, were run by Lucius Lyon, being finished on the 14th of September, 1831. Town ship 3 was at first a part of the township of Allegan, and then Otsego, which included the four townships in range 12. After two divisions of that territory, \u2014 the first sepa rating the three northern townships from Otsego and organ izing them as Watson, and the second severing the two northern from Watson under the name of Dorr, \u2014 No. 3 was set off from Dorr and separately organized by the following ordinance : HOPKINS GRANGE, No. 390, PATRONS OP HUS- BANDRY. Hopkins Grange was organized as early as 1874, with the following officers: Silas W. Mankin, Master; J. M. Baldwin, Overseer ; Samuel Baldwin, Steward ; Jonathan Brewer, Lecturer ; William Edgell, Chaplain ; Horatio Hodge, Treas. ; Erastus Congdon, Sec. The present officers are Erastus Congdon, Master; Martin Smith, Overseer; William Edgell, Steward ; G. M. Baldwin, Lecturer ; Al bert Congdon, Treas. ; Mary Edgell, Sec. The meetings of the Hopkins Grange are held weekly in the school build ing of district No. 9, 60 members being enrolled on its books. \"At a meeting of the board of supervisors, held Dec. 29, 1852, it is ordered by the board of supervisors of the county of Allegan, two thirds of all the members voting therefor, that township No. 3 north, of range 12 west, in the said county, be, and the same is, hereby set off from the township of Dorr, and organized into a separate town ship by the name of ' Hopkins,' and that the first township-meeting for the election of township officers shall be held at the school-house known as the ' Round School-house,' in said township, on the first Monday in April next, and Luther Martin, Jason Baker, and Erastus Congdon are hereby appointed to act as inspectors of election at said township-meeting. It is further ordered that the next township meeting, in and for the township of Dorr, shall be held at the dwelling house now occupied by Orrin Goodspeed, in said township.\" HILLIARD'S. Capt.

The name of Round is associated with the earliest efforts of the patriots of 1776 to establish freedom in the colonies. The grandparents of Mr. Jonathan O. Round were George and Martha Hopkins Round. The first participated in the war of the Revolution, and the second was a sister of Ste phen Hopkins, one of the signers of the Declaration of In dependence. The father was Oziel Hopkins Round, and the mother Anna Olin, a descendant of Chief Justice The ophilus Harrington, of Vermont, who replied when requested to return a fugitive slave he harbored, \" If you have a bill of sale from God Almighty, you can take this negro; other wise, not.\" The foregoing names very aptly illustrate the character of the stock from which Mr. Round is descended. He was the first son in a family of fourteen children, and was born in Clarendon, Rutland Co., Vt., Oct. 10, 1809. At the age of twenty-one years he married Miss Sallie Congdon, who was born July 10, 1810, and was also a resi dent of Clarendon, Vt.

He graduated from the Cleveland Medical College, and began practice in Solon, Cuyahoga Co., in 1851. Two years later he re moved with his family to the township of Hopkins, where he had previously located two hundred and eighty acres of land. In January, 1833, Dr. Baldwin was married to Miss Jane Bissell, of Portage Co., Ohio. Two sons were born, \u2014 James H., whose birth occurred July 13, 1835, and G. M., born Dec. 15, 1836. An adopted daughter, Miss Ellen D. Patterson, was also a member of the family circle. On his arrival in Michigan the doctor at once began the arduous duties of his profession, which were supplemented by his farming interests, in which he was greatly aided by the younger son. The country was then in an almost prim itive condition, which rendered the practice of medicine one of much hardship. In 1865 he relinquished these active duties as a result of failing health, and his death occurred some years later, superinduced, no doubt, by exces sive toil. His son, G. M., succeeded to the possession of the homestead. He was married Nov. 7, 1858, to Miss Mary E. Ingerson, and has a family of three children, \u2014 Martha J., born Sept. 20, 1859, now Mrs. Buck, of Alle gan ; Lotta A., whose birth occurred June 1, 1808; and Blanch A., born Aug. 31, 1875. James H. Baldwin is a prominent citizen of Indianapolis, Ind. The venerable mother still resides upon the homestead. A log cabin was erected during the fall of the same^year, in which the family were comfortably housed the suc ceeding spring. Mr. Round continued his agricultural em ployments until the year 1877, when he retired from active labor and removed to his present home in the hamlet of Hopkins. Mr. and Mrs. Round have been blessed with an old-fashioned number in their family, having nine children, who were born in the following order : Rollin C., born July 13, 1831 ; Avis Ann, born Nov. 1, 1832 (now Mrs. W. B. Andrews) ; Henry O, born July 27, 1834 ; Oziel H., born Nov. 25, 1836, died in his second year; Sarah Ann, born Nov. 5, 1838 (now Mrs. Wm. Kenfleld) ; Joseph R., born Oct. 8, 1840, died while serving in the late war ; Amelia S., born Dec. 26, 1842, died in her nineteenth year; Delia E., born July 1, 1844 (now Mrs. J. A. Lawrence) ; Olive M., born May 1, 1846 (wife of Lyman A. Atwater). Mr. Round has been for successive terms elected super visor, and while acting as assessor severely injured his sight by devotion to his arduous duties. Mr. and Mrs. Round are now enjoying the autumn of their lives among their children and friends that surround them, age having no perceptible effect upon their cheerful and elastic spirits. R. C. ROUND The above-named gentleman is the son of Jonathan Olin Round, the earliest pioneer in Hopkins, and was born July 13, 1831, being a lad of six years on the arrival of the family in the wilderness then embraced in the township. At the age of twenty he became ambitious for a more ex tended and independent sphere of usefulness than his home afforded, and purchased forty acres on section 36. A year later he added an additional forty acres, erected a log house, and planted his first crop. L. A ATWATER. During the year 1836, Jared and Sarah Alderman At water, who were natives of the State of Connecticut, re moved to Summit Co., Ohio, where their son, L. A. Atwater, was born, Dec. 25, 1836. In the year 1856 the family removed to Kalamazoo Co., Mich., and after a residence of nine years at the county-seat repaired to Hopkins, Allegan Co. The father of Mr. L. A. Atwater died in March, 1873, and his wife survived him but three years, her death having occurred in 1876. On his arrival the son sought employment with Robert A. Baird, of Hopkins, and in 1856 he purchased fifty acres of land of Alonzo Button, on section 14, on which he afterwards erected his buildings, making occasional payments as the opportunity offered from his annual earnings. He was married, Jan. 11, 1863, to Miss Olive, daughter of Jona than Olin Round, and, having added forty acres in same section, bought of R. A. Baird in 1860, to the original purchase, the young pioneers began with a will the arduous labor of improving their land and making for themselves an inviting home. Mr. Atwater has erected a convenient and tasteful residence on the land, a view of which accom panies this brief sketch. In May, 1854, Mr. Round was united in marriage to Miss Zarada Andrews, whose parents, Norton and Caroline (Root) Andrews, were residents of Hopkins. In the midst of prosperity and happiness death entered the family circle, and on Dec. 13, 1877, Mrs. Round was \"summoned to that bourne from whence no traveler returns.\" Their sur viving daughter, Clara A., since the death of her mother, has assumed the entire responsibility of the household economy. Mr. Round has been persevering and energetic, and now enjoys a highly-cultivated estate and an attractive home as the result of his laudable efforts. This is the more gratifying since many obstacles were met during his career, all of which his buoyant nature and unfailing resources euabled him to overcome. Mr. and Mrs. Atwater have three children, the eldest, Olin J., having been born April 10, 1866. Ida D., the only daughter, was born Sept. 9, 1867, and the birth of the younger, Fred R., occurred Oct. 10, 1870. Mr. Atwater comes of distinguished lineage, a genealogy of the family having been published some years since. The limit- of this sketch will not admit of more than an allusion to this interesting compilation. JAMES M. BALDWIN, M.D. Dr. Baldwin was a native of Portage Co., Ohio, where he was born Dec. 4, 1810.

Mr. Kenfield may with pardonable pride refer to the ca reer of his grandfather, Erastus Kenfield, who was one of the stalwart soldiers of the Revolution, and at the close of the conflict retired to Hampshire Co., Mass., where he sur vived until his eighty-third year. The father of William S., who bore his parent's name, Erastus, was born Feb. 19, 1801, at Belcher, Hampshire Co., Mass., and spent his early days in agricultural pursuits. He was wedded to Miss Clarissa Piper in November, 1828, a native of Glas tenbury, Conn., whose father, Samuel Piper, was a man of fervid patriotism and suffered severely from a wound re ceived during his service in the war of 1770. Erastus, Jr., and his wife resided in Hampshire County until 1834, when they became pioneers to Ohio, having purchased un improved land in Medina County in that State. He still resides upon this farm at the age of seventy-nine years, while his companion has reached her seventy-fourth year. William S., the second son, was born in Belcher, Berk shire Co., Mass., March 28, 1831. After a varied career of industry in the Buckeye State and in the county of his birth in Massachusetts, he followed the tide of emigration to the West in 1854. During a temporary residence in Wayland, Mich., he married Miss Sarah A. Round, who was the first white child born in the township of Hopkins, their marriage having occurred July 3, 1858. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Kenfleld located in Hopkins, upon a form of eighty acres, on section 12. It was at this early date little else than a wilderness, but industry and a spirit of progress, which has been evinced to a remarkable degree, have changed it to a productive and inviting home. One child graces their cheerful fireside, \u2014 Carrie A., born Dec. 26, 1859. barked for Michigan, and chose a home in Hopkins in the spring of 1854. The eighty unimproved acres which he purchased, evinced in its rapidly improved condition his energy. He in 1858 erected a comfortable residence (a view of which will be found on another page), and speedily returned to Ohio to bring to it a Avife. Mrs. Par melce was formerly Miss Catharine White, daughter of Hanford White, Esq., who was born in Middlesex Co., Conn., in 1797, and married in April, 1822, Miss Hcpza bah Pratt. Of a family of seven children, Mrs. Parmelee is the fifth. Mr. Parmelee has added to the dimensions of the farm since the first purchase, which now embraces a sugar-grove of nine hundred trees that has been for years remarkably productive. The buildings upon this fine estate were erected by him personally.

Alfred and Sylvia (Rutley) Parmelce were each born in Middlesex Co., Conn., in 1798 and 1799, respectively, where they were united in marriage in 1823. Their son, James E., whose life forms the subject of this brief bio graphical sketch, was the third of seven children, having been born in the year 1828. During his third year he became, with his parents, a resident of Summit Co., Ohio, and later of Clay Co., Ind. After a brief residence in the latter State he was left fatherless, and the mother, not having formed attachments in her new home, determined to return to her friends in Ohio. James remained with the family until twenty one, when he became ambitious for a more independent life. He attained proficiency in the occupation of a car penter and joiner, and for five years labored assiduously at his trade.

In January, 1842, he was married to Miss Margaret Zapp, a lady also of German extraction. In 1844 he removed to Calhoun Co., Mich., and later to Kalamazoo County, where he engaged with D. S. Walbridge in a flouring-mill. This employment was followed until 1857, when he removed to Hopkins upon three hundred and twenty acres of laud previously purchased. In this wilderness he erected a log cabin and began the work of clearing. ERASTl'S CU.NUDoN. In the spring of 1839 they disposed of this property, and followed their relative, Mr. J. 0. Round, to Hopkins, where Mr. Congdon secured from government one hundred and sixty acres on section 26. To the business of farming he then devoted his attention, with occasional speculations in land. Mrs. Congdon died in July, 1863, and her husband survived until May 3, 1871, when his death occurred. Aster this event the homestead was purchased by their son Albert, who was the fourth in a family of ten children. Mr. Congdon was the earliest postmaster in \"Hopkins, and held many positions of responsibility in the township. His son Albert married, in 1861, Miss Mary A.

He was buried with Masonic honors by the Bradley Lodge, of which he was a member, and to-day a fine monument marks his resting-place, erected by his devoted wife and companion, who now continues alone in the path of life, endeavoring to instruct those left in her charge to fulfill their duty to God and mankind.

Seeking a home in the West, they removed to Cleveland, Ohio, where they resided for a short time. Determining to locate in Michigan, they purchased an ox-team and journeyed to Hopkins township, Allegan Co., Mich., where they arrived in the fall of 1846. They purchased forty acres of land on section 35, and proceeded to erect a log cabin, meantime making their home with Mr. J. 0. Round. Once installed in their new home, everything seemed to prosper until Mr. Nelson Corbett sickened and died, Sept. 23, 1850. The management of affairs then devolved upon George W., then nineteen years of age. He continued the improvement of the form, purchased additional acres, erected commodious farm buildings, and, Oct. 25, 1859, married Martha A.

It lies upon Lake Michigan, and has upon the north the Ottawa county-line, on the south Saugatuck township, on the east Fillmore, and on the west Lake Michigan. Although settlements were made in the northeast by the Dutch as early as 1847, there were few, if any, attempts at settlement in other portions of the township until 1859, and even after that period they progressed slowly. There was considerable swamp-land in the township at an early day, but the march of civilization SETTLED BY THE DUTCH. In June, 1847, several members of the Dutch colony then gathering at the village of Holland were desirous of seeking locations elsewhere, but near at hand, and were ad vised by Dominie Van Raalte to settle in township 4, range 16, then a part of Newark, and now called Laketown, that township being then unoccupied by white settlers. The people thus advised to make their first permanent homes in the New World had come in company across the ocean from Holland to America, and naturally desired to continue their fraternity as settlers. They were Aaron J. Neerken (a bachelor), Jans Rutgers and family, Lukas Tinholt (a bachelor), Lampert Tinholt and family, Henry Brinkman and family, Geert Henevelt (a bachelor), Stephen Lucas and family, Henry Kleeman and family. As before observed, all came West together and made Holland village their destination, where they found temporary accommoda tions in the log cabins of those already located there. In accordance with Dominie Van Raalte's suggestion, they agreed to settle in the township now called Laketown, and so he entered lands for them according to their means and his judgment. has brought this land to the uses of agriculture. Laketown is just beginning to assume a place as a fruit- growing town, and in the matter of peach-growing has set forward with a fair promise of acquiring valuable impor tance.

When the members of the colony had completed their land-purchases and were ready to begin the work of settle ment, one John Robbus, a Hollander, who professed to know all about that region of country, volunteered to pilot the pilgrims to their new possessions, but by some mis chance he located some of them upon the Fillmore side of the town-line, the- lands they had bought lying close to the line in Laketown.

The mistake in location was not discovered until Tinholt, Lucas, and Neerken had built their cabins on the Fillmore side, and then, to avoid the annoyance of moving, they made fresh purchases of the land they occupied in Fillmore. In the erection of cabins each assisted the other, and so in a brief time they were all comfortably domiciled and ready for the business of wrestling with the forest for the possession of fruitful forms and the privileges of civilization. Fillmore. In 1859 district No. 1, in Laketown, was or ganized, and from the first annual report it is learned that out of an enrollment of 67 school children in the district but 36 attended the school. From the school records it is further learned that the first school-teacher employed was Harriet H. Hudson, and the second Ann E. Leonard. District No. 2 was organized November, 1860, district No. 3 in 1870, and district No. 4 in 1873. From the annual school report for 1879 have been obtained the subjoined statistics : In the midst of a densely-timbered country this little band of hardy pioneers were shut in by themselves and a dreary stretch of wilderness, but they were, after all, within easy reach of neighboring settlements. There were people east of them, in Fillmore, north, in Holland, and south at Saugatuck, where the advanced stage of the settlements gave many advantages to those of the surrounding country. Number of districts 4 Enrollment 322 Average attendance 255 Value of property $1900 Teachers' wages $913 The school directors for 1879 were Gerrit Rutgers, Wm. Corvor, Wm. Van Hoes, and J. C. Hoek. As to churches, Laketown is singularly destitute. There is at present no church edifice in the town, and but one church organization. That is a Wesleyan Methodist Church Society, worshiping in a school-house on section 27. They erected near there, in 1873, a church frame, but before it could be inclosed a wind-storm leveled it to the ground, and no attempt at its restoration was made. Two churches in Graafschap, on the Fillmore side, provide ample conveniences in the way of religious worship to the Hollanders of that neighborhood, in both Fillmore and The pioneers named in the foregoing as members of the Dutch colony were, therefore, the advance-guard of Lake town's settlers. Of their number those living in February, 1880, were A. J. Neerken, Lukas Tinholt, Henry Kleeman, and Geert Henevelt, all of whom reside in Laketown, near Graafschap. Soon there came to that locality other Hollanders, who effected locations near the eastern town-line southward. Among the earliest were Berend J. Brinkman, J. H. Hatger, G. B. Speet, B. H. Scholte, H. J. Brinkman, J. H. Sleuk, and J. H. Lemmen. Among those who settled early near the north town-line were the brothers Hopkins, \u2014 Henry, Elizur, William L., and James, \u2014 who located on section 2, where James and William L. are now living. The latter was among the early government contractors in the building of the piers at Holland, and has for years been interested in the improvements made at that point. Laketown. When the first settlements were made, there were no roads save such as each incoming settler made in reaching the place of his location. Presently, however, there was a road between Holland and Graafschap, for between those points there was considerable communication. There was a much-used Indian trail between Hollaud and Saugatuck, and upon that trail was shortly laid what was from the first known as the Colony road, and which is now a much-used THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE TOWN. thoroughfare. This did not begin to receive settlers until 1859, and the same statement may also be made as to the lake-shore region. In the year named Nathan Kendall, Eli Knowlton, and John Hogeboom made settlements upon section 22, and to the close of that year were the only residents in the south western portion of Laketown, although east of them, on the town-line, there were a few Hollanders. In 1859, Lake town contained 69 resident tax-payers, and had an assessed valuation of $31,123. In 1879 the assessed valuation was $114,780. In 1861 the tax-payers in the south included also W. H. Rose, James Delvin, and George Amesbury, and, in 1862, J. H. Tidd and Nathaniel Stratton. The first saw-mill Laketown boasted was built on section 35 by John and Nicholas Sutton. The town has never had a grist-mill, and has now no mills of any kind. The first death in the Dutch settlement was that of Garrit Salmink, in 1847, and the first birth that of a daughter of H. Sehroetenboer, now the wife of Henry Lubbers, of Fill more. The first couple married were Geert Henevelt and Gracia Kropscott, who were united in 1847 by Elder DunneAviud. Early interments were made near the Dutch Reformed church, but in 1861 Laketown and Fillmore purchased and laid out in common a cemetery just north of the line be tween the two towns, and since then it has been used by both towns. GRAAFSCHAP VILLAGE. Graafschap lies upon both sides of the line between Fillmore and Laketown, and belongs equally to both, but, in view of its having been founded by the early settlers of Laketown, that township has a special claim on it. These early settlers came from the region lying between the kingdoms of Hanover and the Netherlands, and in recollection of the system prevalent in that country of giving small principalities to the rulership of graafs (or counts), whose districts were known as graafschaps, they gave that familiar appellation to their new home in the Western world. Geert Henevelt owned 81 acres just over the line in Fillmore, and in 1848 he sold the property to the Dutch Reformed Church Society. The latter erected a log church upon the tract, which was laid out as Graafschap village. Trade was inaugurated in 1849 by Mathias Naaye, who opened a store, which was, however, a trivial affair, and endured but a year or so. After that there was no pro- SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, Etc.

In 1860, A. H. Brink took hold, and made it a success ; continuing it for some years, much to his own profit and the convenience of the village. A post-office was established at Graafschap in 1867, when A. H. Brink was appointed postmaster. Brink disposed of his store to G. W. Mokma in 1874, when the latter received also the appointment as postmaster, and still retains the office. Berend Lugers, Hendrik Bakker, Geert Heerspink, Derk Ten Cate, A. J.

In 1867 the Laketown portion of Graafschap was laid out upon land belonging to A. J. Neerken. The first physician to locate in the village was Dr. Wil liam Reus, who came in 1869 and remained until 1872. The present village doctor is Dr. Mantingh. Graafschaap is now a small but active village, containing three general stores, a furniture- and hardware-store, and two churches, and gives promise of steady growth, now that the neigh boring country is developing its resources as a \" fruit-belt.\" THE FOREST FIRES OF 1871. Herewith is presented a list of the persons chosen an nually from 1860 to 1880 to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace : The wide-spread forest fires which raged through West ern Allegan in the autumn of 1871 were especially disas trous in Laketown, and consumed vast quantities of stand ing timber. Remembrancers of that fiery epoch are still to be seen upon every hand in charred trees and blackened stumps, which blur the face of nature and inflict upon the prospect a dreary and desolate presence.

It is interesting to observe that since its organization in 1859 the township has had but four different supervisors (A. J. Neerken serving in that office thirteen consecutive years) ; but one clerk (Gerrit Rutgers) ; and but three dif ferent treasurers, \u2014 John Rutgers filling the place 18 years in succession and being yet in the office (February, 1880)."], [341, "L E e; Lee, one of the newest townships in Allegan in respect to settlement, lies upon the southern border of the county. having Clyde upon the north, the Van Buren county line upon the south, Cheshire on the east, and Casco on the west. It was surveyed as township 1 north, range 15 west, but by reason of its lack of desirable forming-land was far behind its sister-townships in point of settlement, being indeed unpeopled until invaded by lumbermen, which was not until 1858. Measures have recently been set on foot looking to the eventual reclamation of great tracts of swamp land now covering a large portion of the town's area, and towards this much-desired consummation the eye of ex pectation gladly turns, since the valuable farming region will by such means be materially enlarged, and the best interests of Lee will accordingly be more conspicuously advanced than by any method now within contemplation. these did not penetrate the swampy recesses of the town ship until about 1858, and up to that time the six miles square of solitude remained unbroken, save by the appear ance of a single settler, Thomas Scott by name. Scott lo cated a tract of land between the two lakes, now bearing his name, and, although aiming to do something in the way of farming, devoted his energies chiefly to hunting, in which business he was an expert, and, as there was ample material upon which to exercise his skill, he made this sport quite profitable. Scott was known as \" the man with the wolf-skin cap,\" and was famous for his success in the capture of wolves, upon whose scalps the county offered a handsome premium. He settled in Lee about 1844, and between farming and'wolf catching passed his time until 1849, when he determined to move in the gold-seeking throng to California, his wife returning East to her friends. Scott was reported to have made a fortune on the Pacific Slope, where in the course of time he died. In the southeast and northwest, however, may now be found tracts of excellent farming country, and, while the west promises to develop into an important fruit-producing region, the east is already rich in the production of wheat. Saw-mills are now quite active, for there is yet considerable valuable timber uncut ; but this branch of industry must be abandoned in a brief space, and leave the town's pros perity to rest upon its agricultural resources alone. As before remarked, from the time of Scott's advent in 1844 until 1858 nothing was done towards populating Lee. In the year last named, however, the South Haven Lumber Company, having become possessed of considerable quanti ties of land in the township, sent out a company of lumber men in charge of J. H. Thistle, and then came too Thomas Raplee, Harmon B. Rice, Michael Hoy, David W. Mat thews, Henry Davidson, Winchester Jenkins, and others, who in 1859 organized the township. Lee has no church within its limits, but is provided with five schools, \u2014 one of them created only in January, 1880. The other four have an average attendance of 110 out of an enrollment of 144 school children in the four districts. Thomas Raplee occupied the old Scott place for a while, removed afterwards to Ganges, and, returning subsequently to Lee, lives now upon the place of his earliest settlement. Mr. Raplee was prominently identified with township affairs from the outset, and during his residence in Lee was, to the close of 1876, a town official, his last services being given as supervisor from 1872 to 1876, inclusive. The Chicago and West Michigan Railroad passes from north to south on an air-line, while numerous water-courses, furnishing in some instances good mill-power, divide the face of the country in the south. The sorest fires which raged through Western Allegan in the autumn of 1871 played sad havoc with the timber lands of Lee, and laid waste many homes. The track of the flames seemed most sharply defined along the route of the railway, where for miles one may now observe acres of evidence showing the resistless march of the fire-king and his victory over the monarchs of the forest, whose stately forms are now replaced by charred and blackened trunks. Reuben Johnson, of Indiana, moved to South Haven in 1866, and, there making an engagement to work in Lee for Dickinson, Rogers & Co., moved to that township in 1867, and made his home in a lumberman's cabin on sec tion 22. At that time the firm named was largely engaged in lumbering in Lee, and moved great quantities of logs down the Black River to South Haven. After working for Dickinson, Rogers & Co. about four years, Johnson con cluded to become a tiller of the soil, and bought a form on section 22. where he has lived ever since. William Rhodes, who came with Johnson, worked with him for a time as lumberman, but, tiring of the business, returned to South Haven, where he died. LEE'S EARLY SETTLERS. The nature of the country in the township of Lee was not such as to attract settlers at a very early day. There were great tracts of pine-lands and swampy regions whose only virtue was the stock of timber they contained, so that, while the tillers of the soil sought more favorable localities, Lee was left to court the attention of lumbermen. Even When Mr. Johnson came to Lee, in 1S67, there were not above a dozen settlers in the township. Among them were Michael Hoy, Robert Hilton, Robert Crawford, John \u00ae By David Schwartz. 257"], [342, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 258 Heath ; Treasurer, H. B.

Rice; District No. 2, Winchester Jenkins ; District No. 4, Michael Hoy. Orr, John H. Thistle, Charles Griffing, and 0. Hodgman. Town-meetings were frequently held at Mr. Johnson's house, and on such occasions the participants were furnished with a dinner at the town's expense. Mrs. Johnson has pre pared many such dinners on election days, but the custom was abandoned after the number of voters reached beyond the number of a baker's dozen, although periodically revived thereafter. Until lately there was but little done in the way of form ing. True, there was some agricultural activity in the east and southwest, where there were a few sections of excellent tillable land, but lumbering was the main industry, highways were chiefly lumber-roads, and the population was naturally of a constantly changing character, for the inmates of the lumbering camps, without any fixed location or permanent interests, moved in and out as the notion possessed them. In 1864 the inhabitants north of the river were few and far between, and one might have then journeyed a long way without encountering a settler. South of the river there were a few settlers and a considerable community of bark peelers. At that meeting $250 were raised for township purposes, and a similar amount for highways and bridges. The second annual election was held on section 22, \" in Dikeman, Hale & Co.'s block-house,\" in which place also many subsequent elections were held. Although the votes cast in 1859 were but 8, there were only 5 in 1860, and 13 in 1861. From that there was no material change until 1869, when there was a sudden increase to 27. A list of the names of the persons who have been annu ally elected, from 1859 to 1880, to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace, follows here: SUPERVISORS. G. F.

The township records were at first very badly kept, and it is extremely difficult to obtain information from them. The best information obtainable, however, from the records, has been gathered touching township proceedings since 1859, and is now presented. JUSTICES OF THE PEACE. 1859, H. B.

The first entry in the records reads as follows : \" That the Township Board of Lee and Pine Plains met at the house of Michael Hoy, in Lee, August 11, 1859, for the purpose of settling all claims between tbe above named townships. Harmon B. Rice was called to the chair, and John P. Parish appointed Secretary. It was agreed that the said township of Pine Plains should pay $155.84 school and other funds, due school district No. 2, of what was Pine Plains. It was further agreed that Pine Plains should have the benefit of any money due from Allegan County at the time of the division, and to pay the indebledness of said township at the time of division. Further, the town of Pine Plains should let the town of Lee have one-third of the library books of said town. HOPPERTOWN. Hoppertown, so called, a signal-station on the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad, occupies a quarter of section 9, land owned by Hopper & Bennett, of Michigan City, upon which two brothers named Clement put up a saw-mill in 1870. They sold the mill to Holden & Loney, who took the job of clearing Hopper & Co.'s land. In 1871, Bon foey & Hurlbut erected a shingle-mill, and Sweet & Fer guson a saw-mill. In 1872, Hyatt & Anderson helped matters along with a 30 horse-power saw-mill, and iu that year Hoppertown rose to the dignity of a hamlet, boasting a population of 23 families or about 215 people all told, who were supported by the industry of four saw mills, \u2014 a prosperous era indeed in Hoppertown's history. Affairs flourished, however, in this fashion only about four years.

BLACK RIVER STATION. George Kraal established a saw-mill at this place in 1871, and presently sold it to William Ferguson, who discontinued it about 1874. Nothing more was done at the place until 1875, when D. J. Dorkey set a saw-mill in operation there, and has carried it on ever since. He employs at times as many as 20 men, and ships considerable lumber. A post office was established here in 1877, and called Lee. Mr. Dorkey, who was appointed postmaster, is yet the incumbent. About a mile south of Black River Station, Adam White, of Geneva, carries on the business of charcoal-burning. He has three large kilns, owns several hundred acres of land in the vicinity, and employs an aggregate of 75 men in clearing land and burning coal. In the winter of the same year there was a business re vival. Snell & Cobb purchased the old Bonfoey & Hurlbut shingle-mill, and, setting it once more in motion, restored Hoppertown to activity. Now the place boasts two saw mills, which have produced for shipment since 1877 from 18 to 20 car-loads of lumber each week. A post-office was established at Hoppertown in 1876, when Ransom Snell was appointed postmaster, and as such he still continues. This station, besides forwarding considerable lumber, shipped during 1879 about 6000 baskets of peaches, and with im proved depot conveniences will forward thrice that number the coming season. leighton; Leighton is prominent as the northeastern township of Allegan County, and in the field-notes of the original survey was designated as township No. 4 north, of range No. 11 west. It has Kent County on the north, Barry County on the east, and the townships of Wayland and Dorr, in this county, for its eastern and southern boundaries. cius Lyon in the year 1826, but the field-work was not completed until the spring of 1831, when Sylvester Sibley, also a deputy United States surveyor, ran out the southern boundary-line and subdivided the territory described into sections. FIRST AND OTHER EARLY LAND-ENTRIES. The surface is rolling, rendering drainage both easy and practicable. Originally, it was heavily timbered with the deciduous trees common to this region, and many acres of the primeval forests still remain. The first entry of public lands in township 4 north, of range 11 west, was made on the 11th day of July, 1835, by the well-known Indian trader, Louis Campau. His tract embraced the east half of the southwest quarter of section 10, and lay immediately south of Green Lake. From the fact that he had squatted there some two years previously, and erected a large and substantial framed building, it is very probable that the lands in this township were not placed upon the market until about the time of Campau's purchase. The soil is most excellent, and well adapted to all the pursuits of agriculture. This is shown by the fact that, although it was one of the most recently settled and organ ized townships, it is now one of the largest wheat-producing and fruit-growing districts in the county. Green Lake, a beautiful sheet of water, embraces portions of sections 2, 3, 10, and 11, some 320 acres in all. It is of great depth, and an excellent fishing-place. Several other small lakes are found in the northeast part of the township. Green Lake Creek, the principal stream of Leighton, takes its rise from Green Lake, and, flowing to the southwest, through the rforth and west parts of the town ship, finally becomes tributary to the Rabbit River. It affords good water-power privileges on section 8, where are situated Brown's saw-mills. A few other lots were purchased during the same year (1835), but it was not until the year 1836 that anything like a general raid of \" land-lookers\" and speculators was made upon this portion of the public domain, and, strangely enough, some entire sections remained vested in the general government until quite a recent period. To illustrate still further, we append the following list of first and other early entries made upon each section : The road-bed of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad intersects sections 18, 19, 30, and 31, but no depots are located in this township, the people being afforded railway facilities at the stations of Wayland and Moline.

Bostwick for lands lying within the limits of the present city of Grand Rapids. Bostwick erected a barn, also a small building which he occupied as a store, and in 1837 Lucius A. Barnes found him installed here as tavern keeper and merchant. His hotel patrons were those un happy creatures, the \" land-lookers,\" and through travelers from Bronson* to \" the Rapids,\" while his store customers were Indians. Mr. Bostwick remained at the lake two or three years. He cleared about 20 acres, one half of which was brought under cultivation.

Louis Campau, the Indian trader whose name is prom inent in the history of Kent County and other sections of Western Michigan, made the first improvement in this township. As early as 1833 or '34 he came in from Grand Rapids and built a large framed building on the north part of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 10. then assessed as resident land. The brothers Samuel B. and William S. Hooker were natives of the State of Vermont, and came to Michigan in 1838 or '39, stopping a short time at Gull Prairie, where their brother Darwin had preceded them by some four or five years. On the 29th of January, 1840, they purchased the north east quarter of section 34 in this township, and began an improvement upon their land during the same spring, which resulted in the establishment of the first permanent home stead in Leighton. The Hookers were prominent and re spected citizens. Both held offices in Wayland, and were This house stood on the east side of the present high way, between the outlet and the lake, and about forty rods from the latter. The timbers and other material of which it was constructed were sawed out by means of the old fashioned saw-pit and whip-saw. Those who were familiar with the appearance of this old structure describe it as having been very substantially built. It was a long, low conspicuous in the organization of their own township. * Kalamazoo."], [347, "LEIGHTON TOWNSHIP. 261 1850.

An approximate estimate of the present number of inhabitants places them at about 1700. Formerly the people had a post-office in their midst, but the township of to-day boasts neither a post-office, railway station, village, store, rum-shop, nor tavern. One small church edifice \u2014 German Evangelical \u2014 is situated on the northwest corner of section 12, in which vicinity quite a number of families of that nationality and faith have settled. CIVIL HISTORY. ORGANIZATION. Forming successively part of Allegan, Plainfield, Martin, and Wayland townships, Leighton was finally set off as an independent organization by an act of the State Legis lature which was approved March 9, 184S. The following is that portion of the act applying to this township : Boughton Wilson seems to have been the next settler, and came in soon after the Hookers. His location was the northwest quarter of section 24. He was a plain, unas suming citizen, not given to office-holding, and died years ago, while still a young man. His widow still owns a large portion of the original homestead. When Wayland was organized, in 1844, the Hooker brothers and Boughton Wilson were the only resident tax payers in township 4 north, of range 11 west. The per sonal estate of the former was valued at $174 ; of the latter, at $120. In 1845 the population was further increased by the settlement of George W. Lewis on section 34, Alfred Mann on section 22, and John Woodward on 34. Lucius A. Barnes and H. Gardner were also here at that time. Prior to the first township-meeting, in 1848, Levi S. Bagnell and Seth A. Lucas were both settled on section 6. Others who were here, but were not real-estate owners, were John Goodspeed, Homer Hulett, Samuel E. Lincoln, Jehu Wilson, Warren Spencer, and Stephen Hartwell. Darwin W. Hooker, a brother of Samuel and William, came from Essex Co., N. Y., to Gull Prairie, Mich., in 1834, and was a prominent citizen of that locality until 1849, when he removed to his present place of residence in this township. He was born in Rutland Co., Vt., and early in life became a tailor. Afterwards, at Castleton, Vt., and Keeseville, N. Y., he carried on an extensive merchants tailoring establishment. Since his settlement in Michigan, however, he has devoted all his energies to farming. Here, as well as in Kalamazoo County, he has served many terms as justice of the peace, and with great gratification asserts that none of his decisions have been reversed by a higher court. Especially was he triumphant in the \" Leighton road war.\" Among other well-known citizens of Leighton who came in during the sixth decade, and in years which are believed to be correctly given below, were the following : 1849-50.\u2014 Charles Furber, Loren M.

The growth of population and the development of the fine farming-lands of this township have not been marked by any period of activity which deserves especial mention. Gradually but surely, however, the people have advanced in population and prosperity, until to-day they point with just pride to theirs as being one of the best agricultural districts in the county of Allegan. Various statistics, therefore, gathered from the United States Census Reports, will, in this connection, prove of interest :"], [348, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 262 S.

In May, 1844, school district No. 1,* of Wayland, was organized, and included sections 34, 35, and 36 in town ship 4 north, of range 11 west. The school-house, which was built soon aster, was a small plank building, and stood in the vicinity of Barnes' saw-mill.

Since the first organization of the township it has been supplied with a public school library, to which yearly addi tions have been made. Prior to the organization of Leighton, in 1848, a school house known as the Green Lake school-house had been erected. But it seems that no schools Avere taught in it prior to \u2014 or for a year or more succeeding \u2014 the date men tioned. Seth A. Lucas and Alfred Mann, the school in spectors elected in 1848, made no record of their official acts, and it is very probable they performed none. On the 19th of March, 1849, Darwin W. and Samuel B. Hooker, school inspectors, met at the township clerk's office \" for the purpose of forming a school district in said township,\" and ordered As showing the present condition of school interests in Leighton, the following statistics, taken from the school inspectors' annual report for the year ending Sept. 1, 1879, are appended : Number of districts (whole, 9; fractional, 2) 11 \" children of school age residing in the township.. 484 \" \" attending school during the year 365 11 school-houses (brick, 1 ; frame, 8) 9 \" teachers employed (male, 5 ; female 10) 15 Paid male teachers $69... 25 \" female \" $747.00 Resources, from moneys on hand Sept. 2, 1S78, two-mill tax, primary school fund, tuition of non-resident scholars, district taxes, and from all other sources $34-16.90 \"That the southeast quarter of section 21, the whole of section 22 and 23, the west half of 24 and 25, the whole of sections 26, 27, 28, and the east half of section 29, shall constitute and form a school dis trict, to be known as school district No. 1.\" This was the first school district organized within the township. It was enlarged March 23, 1850, by annexing the north half of sections 34 and 35, territory which had previously belonged to the Wayland and Leighton frac tional districts. On the 26th of June, 1850, the first teacher was licensed by the Leighton authorities, but unfortunately her name was not placed on record. The next teacher in district No. 1 was Miss F. M. Jones, who received a certifi cate April 28, 1851. District No. 2 was formed Nov. 1, 1851, and district No. 3, Dec. 20, 1851. On the latter date Miss Frances M. Ralph and Mr. M. H. Lester re ceived teachers' certificates. Other early teachers were licensed as follows : Sarah Jane Freeman, May 4, 1852 ; Susan A.

WILLIAM B. HOOKER. William S. Hooker, the father of the immediate subject of this brief sketch, was born in the State of Vermont, Aug. 17, 1818. After residing for some years in Essex Co., N.Y., he removed to Gull Prairie, Mich., about 1838 39. In 1840, together with his brother Samuel B., he pur chased of the general goA'ernment lands situated upon sec tion 34 in the present township of Leighton, and during the same year, accompanied by his father (Josiah) and mother, began the first improvement in the southern half of the township. He was an active, energetic citizen, was prominent as a township official, and also served as sheriff of Allegan County. On the 17th of January, 1844, he married Miss Mary Betterly, of Battle Creek, Mich. Of this union six chil dren were born, as follows: Dorinda, Aug. 18, 1847, died, April 14, 1850; Marcia O, Aug. 14, 1849; Dorinda A., April 27, 1851 ; Lucy F., Jan. 14, 1853 ; William B. and Mary B., Feb. 10, 1856. Mary, the wife and mother, died Feb. 22, 1856. District No. 4 was formed March 10, 1853 ; district No. 5, December, 1855 ; No. 6, October, 1856.

It contains considerable wild land and some swampy tracts, but, judging from the past, it appears very probable that much of the unimproved land will, within the next ten years, be brought under cultiva tion and devoted to the fruit business, which, although of comparatively late de\\*elopment in this township, is rapidly expanding. The traffic in lumber has heretofore been im portant, but is now declining, and is being succeeded by the more important industry of fruit-culture, especially the cul ture of the peach, from which very profitable results are, with reason, anticipated. which he called Richmond, after the place of that name in Virginia, whence he had come to Michigan. He returned to Ann Arbor, where he caused handsome maps of his in tended city to be made and circulated wherever he thought that men might be induced to migrate thither. At Ann Arbor he encountered Ralph R. Mann, who had just come out from Connecticut with his family in search of a Western location, and bargained with him to go to Richmond and superintend the improvements to be made there, and also to open a store and boarding-house for the benefit of the laborers to be sent thither. Preparations were speedily made, and in October, 1836, Mann embarked at Marshall upon a scow, with a dozen laborers and a full cargo of supplies, and set out by way of the Kalamazoo River for Richmond. Allen, with Mann's wife and sister in-law, proceeded overland to Otsego^ where they expected to meet the scow. From Marshall to Kalamazoo the river trip was a tedious one, and, what with snags and low water to obstruct their progress, Mann and his men were ten days in reaching the latter point. Twice during the trip from Kalamazoo to Richmond the craft ran upon rocks and came very near sinking, but the desperate exertions of the ama teur mariners prevented this misfortune, and after a three weeks' journey the party landed safe and sound at Rich mond. The Chicago and West Michigan Railroad, which runs across the township almost due north and south, has a station in Manlius, called Richmond, from which there is easy communication, both by stage and by river, with the villages of Saugatuck and Douglas. The Kalamazoo River, which passes through Manlius from east to west, is naviga ble for steamboats from the mouth to Richmond. Manlius first attracted attention because of its importance as a lumbering region, and its timber-lands were early pur chased in large tracts by Eastern capitalists, who for years carried on extensive operations in the country bordering the Kalamazoo River, which afforded an excellent highway upon which to transport both logs and lumber to the lake. The valuable timber has well-nigh disappeared, yet the mill business still retains a place among the industries of the township, although farming and fruit-raising are fast superseding. There had been an Indian trading-post kept at that point some time before,\"}\" and of the abandoned cabin previously occupied as a trading-house Mann, Allen, and the rest took immediate possession. It served them for shelter until something better could be provided, which was speedily done. Not much could be done that fall and winter, but the next spring the work of city-building was begun with great vigor. Allen's laborers cleared some land, Mann carried on a boarding-house and store, a few houses were put up, timbers were got out for what was to be a monster saw mill, work was begun upon a mill-race, and for a time everything went on swimmingly. In 1838, however, just before the improvements in Richmond reached their full development, Allen failed, his brilliant enterprise came to a sudden halt, and the magnificent prospects of the city of Richmond faded into nothingness. Allen remained a year after that, and then betook himself to other scenes. Mann lived upon the site of the ruined city until 1844, when he moved to a place a mile and a half south, afterwards kuown as Manlius, where he still resides. The largest fruit-grower in the township is James Mc- Cormick, on section 31, who, in the spring of 1880, had 40 acres set out to peaches and 11 to apples. Charles Hanson, E. J. Stow, Allen Owen, G. Veeder, and P. C. Whitbeck, although smaller producers, have, in all, several thousands of peach-trees. JOHN ALLEN'S CITY OF KICHMOND. The first movement looking towards the permanent settlement of Manlius was made by John Allen, of Ann Arbor, in connection with three Eastern capitalists and land-owners, \u2014 Lucius Boltwood, Luke Sweetzer, and a Mr. Morgan. These gentlemen owned large tracts of land in the western part of Allegan County, and John Allen made arrangements with them by which he took on himself the charge of starting a city on sections 7 and 8, in township 3. Early in 1836 he visited the locality, and upon the whole of section 8 and the eastern half of section 7 laid out a town, JAMES McCORMICK.

He made his way with his family overland from Allegan to section 31, where he had bought 160 acres, and, although he was com pelled to cut out the road a portion of the journey, the generally open character of the woodland made traveling tolerably convenient. When Mr. McCormick made his settlement, Jacob Bailey was operating a saw-mill on sec tion 10, in Clyde, for a New York company, but there was not at that time, to Bailey's knowledge, even one settler between him and South Haven. Shortly after McCormick's location, however, he had near neighbors in Ganges, where Harrison Hutchins and four or five other pioneers led the march of civilization. children now in the town are Isaac, Lyman M., and George, and Mrs. B. Coif; Daniel's children are, Ebenezer, Mrs. James Smead, and Mrs. E. J. Stow. George Veedor also came from the State of New York in 1845, in company with Charles T. Billings, and after stopping a while in the shanty of John H. Billings, on section 31, bought of the latter a tract of 30 acres on the same section, where he still lives. Amoiis* the settlers who came into Manlius at a later date may be men tioned E. J. Stow (a resident since 1847), Allen Owen (since 1858), and the Whitbecks. Down to the year 1861 there were but few settlers in the northern portion of the township. At that time there were in that locality John and Frederick Gretzinger, Charles Eisner, Amos Brooks, Thomas Lamoreux, and Eldredge Stanton. In the east were the Woodcocks, the Shermans, and the Hammonds. John II. Billings, just mentioned, settled in Ganges in 1838, but in 1841 removed to Manlius, where he lived on section 31, becoming ultimately a resident of Saugatuck village, where he died in 1874. EICHMOND VILLAGE. The little village known as Bichmond, at which is located the post-office of New Richmond, was created by the com pletion of the Chicago and Western Michigan road, being chosen as a station because of its easy access by river from Saugatuck. H. F. Marsh, who owned land in the neighbor hood, laid out the village, called it Richmond, built a saw mill, and soon afterwards a few people came in and put up residences. Mr. Marsh then opened a store, and in a short time Gilbert Lamoreux stocked a second store and erected *he commodious tavern now known as the \" Western Hotel.\" B. F. Wheelock also opened a hotel, called the \" Richmond House.\" MANLIUS VILLAGE. When Ralph R. Mann moved to a location south of the site of Richmond City, he erected a water saw-mill \u2014 the first in the township \u2014 there, and there soon after came to the same locality a number of settlers, of whom Jonathan Wade located in 1844 and Asa Bowker in 1845, the latter having come to the township in 1841. Mr. Bowker was afterwards drowned, in the lake, off the mouth of the river, by the capsizing of a vessel in which he had taken passage for Chicago. James Harris opened a blacksmith shop on section 21, and W. C. Meeker, a hand in the mill, became a settler on section 16, where he died in 1870. Johnson Parsons built the first store opened in Manlius vil lage, and John Roe the first tavern, which T. S. Coates afterwards bought and enlarged. Richmond was quite a brisk place at one time, obtaining its support from the lumbering and farming business around. At least four extensive firms were then engaged in lumbering in the vicinity, employing a small army of men. Although the business of the village is not now as large as it has been, it is steadily improving by reason of the increase of fruit-shipments there. During the season of 1879 upwards of 11,000 baskets of peaches were shipped at the station, while there were also forwarded considerable amounts of other products. When the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad was completed to that point, Manlius was made a station, but the mill being abandoned in 1874, by reason of the destruc tion of the dam, and the tavern being burned the same year, Manlius village became gradually of less and less im portance, and in 1879 the railway company discontinued the station at that point. It now bears a deserted appear ance, but the very excellent water power has more than once caused an effort to be made for the erection of a grist-mill there. The property, however, is owned by New England people, who do not appear anxious to sell, and so the water-power is suffered to remain idle. The township has never had a grist-mill, and the people are still obliged to go to Saugatuck to have their grain ground. EARLY MAILS. The first post-office within the present township of Man lius was established in 1837 at Richmond, \u2014 i.e., the old village of that name. Jonathan Stratton, a surveyor in the employ of Allen & Co., was the first postmaster, and a Mr. Fairchild was the mail-carrier. The latter was popu larly supposed to carry a mail from Allegan down the river on a raft to Saugatuck once every week, stopping en route at Richmond, but, as a matter of fact, he carried the mail as convenience suited, and frequently neglected the busi ness for a month at a time. John T. Gidley, who came to Michigan in 1836, became a settler in Manlius during the \" hard winter\" of 1842-43 upon an 80-acre lot on section 28. He died in 1862, leaving a widow, who still resides in Manlius with her son, A. P. Gidley. Ralph R. Mann became postmaster at Richmond in 1838 and remained so until 1843, when, being convinced that a post-office was useless at a point where little, if any, mail was directed, he refused to serve any longer, and the office was wisely abolished. Once during his term he was ad vised from Washington that he bad failed to make his \" returns.\" Mann replied that he hadn't made any returns for the reason that he had not seen the mail-carrier for a Daniel Lamoreux, a New Yorker, came to Michigan in 1844, aud located in what is now Fillmore township. Iu 1845 he moved to section 8, in Manlius, aud there, during tho same year, was joined by his brother Thomas, who built on section 8 the framed house now occupied by Charles Hanson.

Thomas Collins has preached every Sunday since 1877. lage, Randall Curtis, who had put up a tannery there in 1846, being appointed postmaster. On his removal the position was given to William C. Meeker. Ralph R. Mann succeeded Mr. Meeker, and was in turn followed by T. S. Coates, David Signor, Norman Bowker, and James W. Sackett. In 1872 the office at Manlius was discontinued, and one was established at Richmond, the name of New Richmond being given to it, as there was already a Rich mond post-office in this State. Gilbert Lamoreux was ap pointed postmaster and served until 1878, when William Delvin, the present incumbent, succeeded him. EARLY ROADS. The first public highway in the town was cut out in 1838 by Ralph R. Mann and two laborers. It extended from the then village of Richmond towards Allegan for a distance of eight miles. According to the records, the roads first regularly estab lished were the Allegan road, the McCormick's road from section 17 to section 31, the Rabbit River road, the Singa pore road, and the Black River road. These all were estab lished May 23, 1839, by John Allen, Samuel Town, and Truman D. Austin, road commissioners. EAST SAUGATUCK. East Saugatuck, a village peopled almost exclusively by Hollanders, and a station on the Chicago and West Mich igan Railroad, lies upon both sides of the line between Fill more and Manlius, but chiefly in the latter township. In 1859 the town-line road, although chopped out at an earlier day, was a mere cattle-path. The settlements made upon it about that time were by G. F. and John A. Gretzinger and Charles Eisner, in Manlius, and Christian Arzt, Fred erick Kern, and Jacob Illg, in Fillmore. The Gretzingers moved into an abandoned log shanty upon a clearing made some time before by William P. Sherman, the only clearing upon the road in 1859. In 1840 the township was divided into two road districts. In 1845 there were four road districts, in which the high way overseers returned an aggregate of $313.08 as non resident highway taxes. MINOR ITEMS. Mention has been made in Chapters VII. and X. of the general history of the habits of the Indians and of the principal Indian traders of the early days. Among the subordinate traders were George Campau, a relation of Joseph Campau, and John Godfrey, who used to cir culate among the Indian camps, usually traveling afoot with their packs on their backs. Campau had a longing for the soothing fire-water, and had a fashion of pleading for \" something that would not freeze a man's heart.\" In the northern part of Manlius, as indeed in nearly every other portion, the land had been taken up at an early* day by speculators, and had afterwards fallen into the hands of lumbermen. In 1859 the business of lumbering was briskly carried on in the northern part of the town by Stockbridge & Johnson, who employed a large number of men. At that time the settlers north of the Kalamazoo River in Manlius, besides those already enumerated, were Theophilus Harrington, Thomas Lamoreux, William Wood cock, John Hammond, and John Boyles. Traveling in that region was an extremely difficult matter, and neighbors living within three miles of each other rarely met except at log-raisings. The settlers named as being on the town line in 1859 remained about the only ones until 1867, when the Hollanders began to gather in the vicinity and locate in considerable numbers upon both sides of the line. Thomas Lamoreux was the popular coffin-maker for the Indians, and charged ten shillings a coffin, big and little. The Indians had a fancy for elaborate coffin-decorations, and often had those which, though cheap, were quite gorgeous. For a long time Ralph R. Mann owned the only horse in his neighborhood, and whenever a doctor was wanted Mann's horse was invariably borrowed to hunt up the man of medicine. Dr. Goodrich, of Ganges, was the main de pendence in time of sickness, and when he was persuaded to locate at Manlius village it was upon the pledge of the inhabitants of the surrounding country that he should receive a yearly compensation to a certain amount. When the railway was completed and East Saugatuck station established, Schelter Bergsma built a store at that place, and in 1873 a post-office was established there, W. C. Sempel, who had opened the second store in the village, being appointed postmaster. In 1874 he was succeeded by Jacob Heeringa, the present incumbent. The railway-sta- tion, post-office, and one store are on the Manlius side of the line, another store being located on the Fillmore side. Near the village, in Manlius, the Bangor Furnace Company have eight large coal-kilns, which have been making char coal since 1874, and which have, moreover, rendered ex cellent service in causing the clearing up of the country round about. At the general election in 1840 only eight votes were cast, and they were equally divided between the Whigs and Democrats. The question of conveying the returns to Al legan coming up for consideration, it transpired that no one desired to undertake the tedious task. Thereupon some body suggesting that, as the votes were evenly divided, their return would have no effect upon the result, it was ac cordingly resolved not to send any returns, and that was the end of the matter. The first white child born in the township was a daugh ter of Jonathan Stratton, the surveyor, in 1838. Two weeks later David R., a son of Ralph R. Maun, was born, the first white male child born in range 15. He now lives in Plainwell. Susan L., daughter of Ralph R. Mann, was the first person who died in the township, the date of her death being Jan. 1, 1837. She was buried in the woods on the hill back of the then village of Richmond, but was subse- Until 1867 there were no roads in the vicinity worth mentioning, and in 1871 the country was still so wild that the railway-station was built in the woods.

The township of Manlius, previously a part of Newark, was organized by an act of the Legislature approved March 6, 1838. It received its name from John R. Kellogg, a member of the Legislature, who presented the petition for organization, and who, having been born in Manlius, N. Y., desired to honor his native place. John Allen wanted the town named Richmond, but, as there was already a Rich mond in Michigan, his desire was not gratified. Manlius was originally of the same size as now, embracing only sur vey-township No. 3, in range 15. Township No. 4 was subsequently added, but was at a stiil later date given a separate organization as Fillmore.* The total number of votes cast in 1840 was 10 ; there were 23 in 1847 ; in 1848, 10 ; in 1849, 21 ; in 1851, 10 ; in 1852 the number rose to 14; in 1854, to 31 ; in 1855, to 50 ; in 1856, to 64 ; in 1859, to 87 ; in 1866 there was a decline to 75 ; in 1868, an advance to 119 ; and in 1872, to 150. The voters at the election in 1843 were R. R. Mann, James McCormick, Josiah Martin, Ira Ogle, Asa Bowker, John S. Gidley, Robert G. Winn, and John H. Billings. Those who A'oted at the election in 1846 were Asa Bowker, A. V. Benhatn, It. R. Mann, Daniel Lamo reux, Thomas Lamoreux, Randall Curtis, George N. Smith, Josiah Martin, James McCormick, E. W. Gillman, J. H. Billings, Isaac Fairbanks, Jonathan Wade, W. C. Meeker, Ahaz Williams, and Luther Holman. The first town-meeting was held at the house of R. R. Mann, April 1, 1839, when John Allen and Samuel Town were chosen moderators or inspectors of election, and Ralph R. Mann clerk. The officers chosen were John Allen, Su pervisor; James A. Poage, Clerk; Samuel Town, Orren Ball, and John Allen, Assessors ; R. R. Mann, John Allen, and Truman D. Austin, Commissioners of Highways ; Orren Ball, Constable and Collector; Samuel Town, Paul Shepard, and Isaac Vredenberg, School Inspectors ; Paul Shepard, Treasurer; R. R. Mann, Samuel Town, James A. Poage, and J. W. Palmer, Justices of the Peace; R. R. Mann and Isaac Vredenberg, Directors of the Poor ; John Allen, Overseer of Highways for District No. 1 ; James McCormick, for District No. 2 ; Truman D. Austin, Pound- Master. Although there appear to have been 10 voters in the township at this time, less than that number of votes were cast, since the successful candidates received but four votes each. At the same meeting the sum of $50 was raised for the support of the poor and other expenses. Following is a list of those elected annually from 1840 to 1880 to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace : CHURCHES. There was a Methodist Episcopal class at Manlius village in 1846, of which Randall Curtis and Daniel Lamoreux were the leaders, but it exists no more. A Wesleyan Methodist society has been organized at Richmond, and, although now worshiping in a school-house, will presently build a church edifice. A Methodist class was organized about 1850, by Rev. Mr. Mosher, of Allegan, in a school house in Manlius, upon the Clyde line. The class had 7 members, of whom 5 were C. T. Billings and wife, John Billings and wife, and Harrison Hutchins. Worship was held in the school-house until 1870, when Walters Hall, near Fennville, was occupied, and in 1871 the society built the church now standing in Fennville on the Manlius side. The membership is now very small. Preaching is supplied once a fortnight by Rev. N. B. Steele. The church trus tees are James Withrow, Edward Cotton, C. T. Billings, Stephen Atwater, and Loomis Benson. The Sabbath-school, in charge of Edward Cotton, has regular weekly sessions, and enjoys a flourishing prosperity. SUPERVISORS. 1S40-41, R. R.

He has held several minor township offices, but is not ambitious for political preferment. Mr. and Mrs. McCormick have been cheered by the pres ence of thirteen children, eight of whom are now living; these are married and settled near the paternal home, with the exception of the youngest son, who resides upon the old homestead. Though not a man of strong religious fervor, Mr. McCormick is inclined to the belief of the Spiritualists. The school directors for 1879 were G. Coif, N. Arnold, C. D. Reynolds, P. C. Whitbeck, C. Hanson, and F. Brink. FENNVILLE GRANGE, No. 461, was organized in June, 1874, with 30 members. W. H. McCormick was chosen Master, and George W. Whitbeck Secretary. Meetings, which were first held in Walters' Hall, at Fennville, are now held in a public hall on the Manlius side of the village. J. N. McCormick was Master of the grange from 1874 until the election in 1879. The mem bership is now about 60, and the officers are as follows : J. R. Goodrich, M. ; S. W. Bryan, 0. ; N. D.

His death was the first one in the grange membership. H. F. MARSH. Mr. Marsh was a former resident of the State of Con necticut, and became a Michigan pioneer in 1853. He was identified soon after his arrival with the interests of the village of Allegan, having purchased the hotel known as the \" Exchange,\" which was for a period of nine years under his management. In 1862 he relinquished the duties of host for the congenial pursuits of a farmer. The land in the township to which he removed was wholly unim proved on his advent, but very speedily yielded to the axe and the plow. Mr. Marsh has continued its cultivation since that time, and is fast developing one of the most attractive estates in Manlius. His industry and energy are being well rewarded. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. JAMES McCORMICK. Mr. McCormick, the subject of this sketch, was the eldest in a family of eleven children. A Canadian by birth, he was born Feb. 7, 1806. His father, Nathaniel McCormick, a native of Belfast, Ireland, emigrated to the hospitable shores of America at an early day, and settled in the State of Pennsylvania. He subsequently removed to Canada, where he married Miss Elinor Campbell, a lady of Scottish descent, as the name implies. When James was a small boy his parents removed to the town of Porter, Niagara Co., in the State of New York, where he spent his early life under the shadow of the paternal roof. After he came to manhood's estate he divided his time for two years be tween Ulster and Dutchess Counties, after which he went to Canada and was employed at carpenters' work, building locks on the Welland Canal. Returning to the scenes of his former home, he purchased a farm, and at the age of twenty-six years chose for a wife Miss Maria Billings. She was born March 25, 1816, near Albany, N. Y., as were also her parents. They subsequently removed to Monroe County, where is located the family burial-place. In 1833 Mr. McCormick disposed of his Eastern home, and, with his family, emigrated to the then far West, locating in Michigan, where, after several changes of location, he set tled upon the splendid farm he now occupies. It was then a dense forest, unbroken by the woodman's axe, and the tall hemlocks marked the spot where now stands his beautiful residence. Mr. McCormick possessed, how ever, the requisite energy to carve a home out of the wilderness ; this, combined with his indomitable will, has worked the transformation. EDWARD J. STOW. The paternal grandfather of Mr. Stow, who was Capt. William Stow, formerly of Connecticut, removed to Stow, Summit Co., Ohio, at an early day, where the subject of this biography was born, March 18, 1823, being the eldest child and only son. The father of Edward having died when the lad was in his fifth year, he a few years later removed to the home of a Mr. Eldred, and remained for four years under his protection. He afterwards returned to the family of his stepfather, and ultimately learned the trade of a carriage-trimmer. His removal to Michigan oc curred at a later period, where, having chosen Allegan County as a place of residence, he engaged in lumbering and rafting upon the Kalamazoo River. This occupation, having proved a congenial one, was pursued for seven con secutive years, after which he was married to Miss Sarah M. Lamoreux, a native of Yates Co., N. Y., from whence her parents came to Michigan in 1844. Mr. and Mrs. Stow's household has been brightened by the presence of three children,\u2014 Allen C, born April 17, 1859; William H., whose birth occurred Oct, 4, 1874; and Mary A., born June 28, 1878. Two years after his marriage Mr. Stow located upon his present farm, in Man lius, which then embraced eighty acres, and has since been increased to two hundred. He has given much attention to the raising of fine fruits, especially peaches, having, during the past year, shipped (to Chicago) fourteen thousand baskets, produced from his own orchards, of this delicious fruit. This land is also well adapted to the raising of the A*arious grains, of which very bountiful harvests are reaped. He was a soldier in the late war, and much of the time detailed for special service. During this period Mrs. Stow manifested much ability in her administration of the farm ing interests. Mr. Stow's industry and acknowledged in tegrity of character have won for him an enviable place among the citizens of the township of Manlius."], [361, "Residence of E.J. STOW.

To observers the improvement of these lands seemed an easy matter, and Mr. Eldred's real estate was then con sidered the most desirable one in the township. But with the completion of his cabin \u2014 which stood upon or near the site of William Nesbit's present residence \u2014 and the re moA'al of his family to it, his difficulties had but just com menced. A small band of Indians, remnants of the once powerful Ottawa and Potlaioatlamie tribes, occupied the opening and claimed it as their own. Here, on the northern border, was their little village of bark wigwams, and farther out their scattered patches of broken soil, where the women had cultivated for many years corn, pumpkins, potatoes, etc. Here had been celebrated victories gained over their enemies, and the surrounding forests had doubtless re echoed many times with lamentations when defeat had attended their warlike expeditions. Their children had been born here, and here their dead had been prepared for the happy hunting-ground. The little prairie was their home ; they were loth to depart from it. Who can blame them ?

FIRST AND OTHER EARLY SETTLEMENTS. Mumford Eldred, the first settler within the limits of this township, was a native of Pownal, Bennington Co., Vt., and passed his boyhood days in sight of the Green Mountains. After arriving at manhood's estate, he engaged for some time in buying and selling live-stock. Subsequently, the brothers Caleb (afterwards the well known Judge Caleb Yet had Mumford Eldred been less austere and more gracious in his bearing towards them, this would not have been one of the exceptional cases in the history of the set tlement of Southern Michigan in which the white settler and his Indian neighbors were at enmity. But Mr. Eldred chose a different course ; he considered the land his own, * The Drst purchase, being the northwest quarter of the northwest quarter."], [365, "Residence of Wm.F. HARDEN, Martin Tp., A llegan Co., M i ch:"], [366, ""], [367, "MARTIN TOWNSHIP. 271 the Indians as interlopers, and ordered them away. They demurred, and moved not. He plowed their little patches of loose soil and planted his crops. Upon their appearance above the surface the corn and potatoes were pulled up and the stalks scattered. His hogs, and- for a truth \"-old Black Hawk,\" at last disappeared. After vain searches they were given up as gone forever, and he declared the Indians had stolen them. Eldred, the first child of Mumford by his second marriage, is now a distinguished divine of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Dr. Calvin White, from Canada, was the next to settle. He purchased 100 acres, situated on sections 28 and 33, May 16, 1836, and became a resident during the fall of the same year. Although a graduate of a medical college, he practiced but little here, devoting his time and energies chiefly to the clearing and improvement of his land. He was a man of many eccentricities, antagonistic in principles to a large majority of those who were his friends and neigh bors, and seeking every opportunity to express his opinions concerning politics and religion. Consequently, although ambitious to wear official honors, he found great difficulty in obtaining votes when he most needed them. It is be lieved, however, that he was the first postmaster of the \" Martin\" office, which was established some time during the administration of Martin Van Buren. Walter Mon teith was also an early postmaster. Terribly enraged, he again ordered his dusky neighbors from his vicinity, threatening that unless they did so within a time specified, he would fell an immense tree upon their wigwams, or such of them as its trunk and branches would reach. At the expiration of the time allowed them the Indians were still there, stoical and unconcerned in danger as only Indians can be. Eldred seized his axe, and with lusty blows began the fulfillment of his threat. They watched him intently for a few moments. The chips flew rapidly from the incisions made with his keen axe, and at last they seemed to understand that he was in earnest, that it was only a question of moments when the tree would come crashing upon them, demolishing in its fall wigwams and household idols. They called to him to desist, prom ising that if permitted to remain until their chief, who was sick, was able to be removed, they would depart in peace. With this understanding they remained a few days longer, and then removed to the present township of Wayland. Cotton M. Kimball was born in Marlborough, Windham Co., Vt. About 1805, with his parents, he removed to Rutland, Jefferson Co., N. Y. His father, Ruel Kimball, was a teacher, and afterwards became a minister of the gospel in Lewis Co., N. Y., where he preached for thirty years. Having resided in Lewis and Jefferson Counties, N. Y., until the spring of 1836, Cotton M. Kimball then journeyed to Michigan. He arrived in the present town ship of Martin in May, 1836, and made choice of lands situated on sections 15 and 17. As soon as vacated, their wigwams were burned by Eldred, and thus did he with his family become the sole occupant of the \" opening.\" He was not fairly rid of the Indians, however, for they made frequent visits to the local ity, and his crops and stock were always in danger. He had aroused a life-long enmity, and had not the Michigan Indians been so completely coAved, abject, and in fear of the white man's power, dating from the time of Tecumseh's defeat, Mr. Eldred's career would have terminated ere he had a neighbor in sight of his opening. The land on section 15 was bought in partnership with one Sidney Stafford, and included a mill-site. During the summer of 1836, assisted by Stafford and residents of Plainfield, Mr. Kimball erected a log house on the latter section, 18 by 24 feet in size. This house was built of whitewood logs, and was the second dwelling erected in the township, although not the second one occupied. Upon the death of the sick Indian before mentioned, his body was brought to the near vicinity of Mr. Eldred's house. A square pen of logs was constructed, roofed with bark, and inside the inclosure, in a sitting posture, was placed the remains of the dead chief, covered with his blanket. Mrs. Eldred, who is still living in the township, wherein at that time she was the only white woman, relates that the sight of this dead warrior keeping his lonely vigil was a most distressing one to her. She could not step out side her house without looking in that direction. About one year aster the death of the chief, Mr. Eldred had helping him one or two young men from Gull Prairie. Arising early one morning, they filled the pen with dry wood and brush, and then, setting the whole on fire, finally succeeded in cremating the remains. Mr. Kimball remained in the State until January, 1837, in order to obtain a hearing at the land-office and get a title to his land. He then returned to the State of New York on foot. In April, 1837, accompanied by his wife and three children, Huldah C., Edward R., and Henry, he began a second journey to Michigan, via the Erie Canal and Lake Erie to Detroit. The family, while en route, suffered much inconvenience and considerable sickness. At Detroit he hired a man named Stonehouse to take himself and family to that portion of Plainfield now known as Martin, for which he paid him $45. The wagon-journey from Detroit required nine days to accomplish, and from Mumford Eldred's to the log cabin awaiting them they had to cut their own road. During the interval from the build ing of his house until its occupation, Dr. Calvin White, William and Walter Monteith had settled in the township. Mathew Shelman and family settled the same year (1837). In 1837, Mr. Eldred was elected a justice of the peace of Plainfield, and while Martin formed part of the old town ship he held other responsible positions. As justice of the peace of the latter township he presided at the first election in Martin, in 1839, and was also elected assessor. He died Jan. 24, 1870, aged eighty-four years. Mrs. Eldred still survives, at the age of seventy-six years. A son, Samuel, who was born Dec. 10, 1836, bears the distinction of having been the first white child born in Martin. Rev. Andrew Upon the organization of Martin, in 1839, Mr. Kimball was elected the first supervisor, and during a long residence there was prominent in many other positions of trust and honor. In 1843 he removed from his first location to the premises on section 17 now occupied by his son, Edward R. Kimball.

John Monteith, section 32 160 R. B. Wiggins Personal Monteith is a name which has ever been conspicuous in the annals of this township since its first settlement. The progenitors of the numerous descendants living here came from Scotland prior to the Revolutionary struggle, and set tled in Montgomery Co., N. Y. They very naturally es poused the cause of the colonies. The brothers, Thomas and William Monteith, the fathers and eldest members of the Monteith family who settled in Allegan County, both participated in the war of 1812. During the early settle ment of Livingston Co., N. Y., members of this family, to gether with many other people of Scotch descent, emigrated to it from Montgomery, and impressed their nationality upon a portion of old Livingston's surface, by naming their place of settlement Caledonia. Here we find them in the year 1835. An exodus from the northwestern counties of New York to the \" far West\" was then in full progress, and the Monteiths of Livingston, too, soon joined the multi tude of emigrants bearing down upon Michigan Territory.

Y., to Moscow, Hillsdale Co., Mich., where they remained during the following winter. Meantime, their father, Thomas Monteith, Sr., had proceeded to the State of Illinois to view land in that region. The season was unpropitious, mud and water predominated everywhere, and, utterly disgusted with Illinois, he returned eastward as far as Kalamazoo. He visited the Gun Plain settlement, and prospected for desirable lands in this township. As a result, his sons at Moscow were invited to meet him at Kalamazoo, and on the 13th day of May, 1836, Thomas Monteith, Sr., purchased the whole of section 32, while William T. entered 280 acres situated upon section 29, being all that then remaiued of the latter section. Early in the spring of 1837, the brothers, William T., Walter, and Thomas, Jr., began their first improvements here. Their father did not become a resident of Martin until several years later.

The total expenses incurred by the township during the year ending April 1, 1840, were $139.65, as follows: Although more than 2000 acres of swamp-lands lie within its borders, the central and western parts of Martin are conceded to be among the fairest and most productive found in Allegan County.

By an act of the State Legislature approved March 22, 1839, the township of Martin was formed from Plainfield. Section 1, of an act to organize certain townships, reads as follows : FIRST HIGHWAYS, ROAD DISTRICTS, Ere. In 1837, Road District No. 6, of the township of Plain field, embraced within its boundaries the present towns of Martin, Wayland, and Leighton ; Mumford Eldred, overseer. No highways recognized by authority existed ; only the by-paths of early settlers and the trails of the aborigines traversed the region mentioned. Consequently Mr. Eldred's duties as overseer could not have been onerous. \"That all that part of the county of Allegan designated by the United States survey as townships number two, three, and four north, of range number eleven west, be, and the same is hereby set off and organized into a separate township by the name of Martin, and the first township-meeting therein shall be held at the house of John H. Adams.\" To Mrs. Mumford Eldred, the first white woman to reside here, was accorded the honor of naming the new township. She suggested several names, but when the Hon. George W. Barnes \u2014 the member of the State Legislature from this district \u2014 arrived in Detroit, he found that those chosen by Mrs. Eldred had already been adopted by other localities. He therefore sent in the name of Martin, as a compliment to the then President of the United States, Martin Van Buren, \u2014 a name which was universally approved by the pioneers then within its borders, and which the township bears to-day. \" Road No. 12,\" of the town of Plainfield, seems to have been the first regularly laid highway to penetrate town ship 2 north, of range 11 west. It was surveyed by Wil liam Forbes in January, 1838, by order of Mumford El dred and George F. Nichols, highway commissioners of Plainfield. This road commenced 84 rods north of the southwest corner of section 8, in the present township of Gun Plain, and ran in a geneial northerly direction through the Monteith Settlement and Martin Corners, to the north line of Martin township, a distance of seven and three fourth miles. FIRST TOAVNSHIP-MEETING, Etc. Roads numbered in the Plainfield records as 13, 14, 15 16, 17, and several others, were also laid out during the year 1838. In accordance with the act before quoted, 17 legal voters, residents of the territory described, assembled at the house of John H. Adams, on the 13th day of April, 1839, and organized by choosing Timothy Gregg, George W. Barnes, and John H. Adams inspectors of election. Mumford Eldred, Esq., and Calvin White, Esq., took seats as mem bers of the board of canvassers by virtue of their offices as justices of the peace, they having been elected to that position in the township of Plainfield in 1837. This first meeting resulted in the election of the following officers : Cotton M. Kimball, Supervisor ; Timothy Gregg, Township Clerk ; John H. Adams, Treasurer ; George W. Barnes, John H. Adams, Mumford Eldred, Assessors ; Nicholas Shellman, Collector; George W. Barnes, John C. White, Cotton M. Kimball, School Inspectors; Abraham Shellman, Adam W. Miller, Walter Monteith, Highway Commission ers; Timothy Gregg, Abraham Shellman, Directors of the The first road laid by the authorities of Martin began 22 rods north of the quarter post between sections 15 and 16, in township No. 2 north, of range 11 west; running thence, as described by field-notes, to a post near Col. Barnes' saw-mill, on the southwest quarter of section 2, in the same township. Another road began on the county-line between Allegan and Barry Counties, at the corner of sections 25 and 36 in township 3 north, range 11 west; thence to quarter post of section 33, on the south line of said township. These roads were surveyed by E. Robinson, surveyor, on the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th days of May, 1839. The first road districts in Martin were established by Commissioners Abraham Shellman and Adam W. Miller, March 20, 1840, and were described as follows : \"District No. 1. To consist of sections 6, 7, IS, 19, 30, 31, and the * Darius P.

The first action taken by township authorities regarding schools and school districts in township No. 2 north, of range 11 west, was in the year 1837. On the 19th day of September, William Forbes, John Nichols, and George W. Kennicott, school inspectors of Plainfield, met and determined the boundaries of nine school districts. Dis tricts numbered from 1 to 7, inclusive, were all located in the present township of Gun Plain, while district No. 8 embraced the south half of township 2 north, range 11 west, and district No. 9 included the remainder or northern half of the latter township. During the past thirty years, the schools of Martin have advanced in common with those of other sections. Their present condition is shown by statistics gathered from the school inspectors' report for the year ending Sept. 1, 1879: Number of whole districts 5 \" fractional districts 3 \" children of school age residing in the township 374 children attending school during the year 329 frame school-houses 8 \" male teachers employed 8 \" female \" \" 10 Paid male teachers. $898.25 v female \" $326.50 Total resources for the year ending Sept.], 1879, including money on hand Sept. 2, 1878, two- mill tax, primary school fund, district taxes, and from allother sources $1919.91 It is possible that schools were taught in one or both districts last mentioned prior to the organization ; but, if they were, we have not been able to learn the names of teachers or any statistics regarding them. It is quite certain, however, that no school moneys were apportioned to any districts in this township while it formed part of Plainfield* MEDICAL. Upon the organization of Martin, in 1839, George W. Barnes, John C. White, and Cotton M. Kimball were elected school inspectors. In August of the same year this board of education, represented by Messrs. Kimball and White, met and organized two school districts, de scribed as follows : Dr. Calvin White, one of the first settlers, was the first physician to reside in the township of Martin. He came from Canada in 1836, and continued a resident until his death. He never practiced here to any extent, however, as the early residents were attended by Dr. L. B. Coats, of Otsego, and Dr. Erastus N. Upjohn, of Gun Plain. ''District No. 1 will embrace sections 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and the south half of sections 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30, in township number two north, of range number eleven west, and the first meeting in said district shall be held at the house of William T. Monteith on the 14th day of September, 1839. Dr. Alexander Gillis, a native of Scotland, and a grad uate of Edinburgh Medical College, practiced here at an early period. He finally removed to Hickory Corners, Barry Co., Mich., where he died. \" District No. 2 will embrace sections 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, and 19, and the north half of sections 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30, in township num ber two north, of range number eleven west, and the first meeting in said district shall be held at the house of Mumford Eldred, Sept. 14, 1839.\" Dr. David Bradley removed here in 1854, from Way land township, where he had been conspicuous as the first resident physician, an early postmaster, merchant, and tav ern-keeper. He was not a medical graduate, yet was quite successful in tho treatment of ordinary ailments. Since 1840 changes have been made almost yearly of districts and their boundaries. The records preserved relating to school matters are meagre and incomplete, and to the chronicler afford but little satisfaction. It is credibly stated that John McVeanf taught the first school at Mar tin Corners, or old district No. 2, about 1842-43, and the first school in district No. 1, or the Monteith neighborhood, was opened at about the same time. Dr. George B. Nichols graduated at the Castleton (Ver mont) Medical College, in 1852, and thereafter until the spring of 1858, practiced his profession in Ontario Co., N. Y. He then settled at his present place of residence, \u2014 i.e., Martin Corners, \u2014 where he has long been known as the principal physician of the township. His field is an ex tensive one, and one in which he has been uniformly suc cessful. At the close of the township election held in April, 1847, it was voted that the next annual meeting \" be held in the new school-house near Lafayette Shellman's.\" In Among other disciples of the healing art who, since Dr. Nichols' settlement, have practiced at various periods, there have been Drs. S. W. Thompson, George W. Houghton, and F. E. Rosenkrans. The first now resides in the village of Otsego, the latter in Plainwell. * See history of Gun Plain. f It is also claimed that Miss Chichester taught the first school in this district."], [376, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 276 VILLAGES AND EAILROAD-STATIONS. in 1733, under the leadership of the Erskines, Fisher, and others; and in 1743 another branch broke off, called the Reformed Presbyterian Church, but more commonly known as Cameronians or Covenanters; Renwick, Cameron, and others being the leaders. In the course of time members of these two churches found their way to the United States, and at their request ministers were sent to preach to them. Thus these two bodies were transplanted into this country, \u2014 the Associate Presbyterian in 1753, and the Reformed Presbyterian in 1774. They differed mainly on the subject of civil government. But during the Revo lutionary war they both united in the support of one gov ernment, and thus the way was prepared for an organic union, which took place in 1782, the united body taking the names of the two churches, \u2014 Associate Reformed Pres byterian. Some of the Associate Presbyterians, not enter ing into this union, continued the existence of their church, so that the two churches \u2014 the Associate Presbyterian and the Associate Reformed Presbyterian \u2014 existed side by side, holding substantially the same doctrines and using the same forms of worship. Descending from the same source, it was but natural that these two streams should eventually flow together, which they did in a formal union in 1858, the resultant body taking the name which it bears to day, \" The United Presbyterian Church.\" The church of Mar tin having had an existence prior to 1858, and under both of the previously existing bodies, it will be necessary to notice \u2014 1. The Associate Reformed Presbyterian; 2. The Associate Presbyterian ; and 3. The United Presbyterian Church. The villages and railroad-stations of Martin are known as Martin Corners, Monteith, and Shelbyville. The former is the most important, and includes within its limits a por tion of the lot first settled upon by Mumford Eldred, in 1836. A few years later, a school-house, situated one-half mile south of the Corners, was built, and, as a crossing of country roads occurred here, the locality was convenient for holding caucuses and township-meetings, and conse quently became an early resort of the townspeople for vari- ous purposes. But it was not until the building of the Kalamazoo and Grand Kapids plank-road, in 1853 and '54, that the \" Cor ners\" took on the appearance of even a hamlet. In the year last named, John Gray began the construc tion of a hotel. When it was only partially built, A. Haggart bought the property and finished the building. He then rented it to Messrs. Bradley & Pratt. In 1856 David Bradley became proprietor of the house, and a few months later it was burned with all its contents. The present hotel was rebuilt by Bradley soon after. A man named Phittleplace sold the first goods in 1854. Tuthill McClelland and William Mathews were also early mer chants here. The Martin post-office was removed to this point upon the completion of the plank-road. In 1858 the business men at the Corners were Fred erick Faling, hotel-keeper ; Hugh Finley, merchant, in the building now occupied by Wylie & Shepherd ; Wil liam Mathews, merchant and postmaster; Drs. David Brad ley and George B. Nichols, physicians ; and Peter and Stephen Hatfield, blacksmiths. 1. The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. \u2014 As early as 1838 we read of Rev. T. C. McCaughan preaching in this vicinity. But what may be regarded as the origin of this church was the removal, in 1841, of Thomas Monteith, Sr., to this place from Caledonia, Liv ingston Co., N. Y. A ruling elder in the church and devoted to the cause of Christ, to him, and to his wife and family, the church of Martin is very largely indebted for its existence and prosperity. The first meetings were held in his house and barn. Among the first ministers we find the names of Revs. Wilson Blain, T. F. Kerr, J. Barnett, W. Lind, Jeremiah Dick, John N. Dick, D. B. Jones, J. A. Campbell, and J. A. Frazier. The first members came mainly from Caledonia, N. Y., and Peterhead, Scotland. Since the completion of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, in 1870, the population has gradually increased. The village of to-day contains two church edifices, \u2014 Meth odist Episcopal and United Presbyterian, \u2014 two stores of general merchandise, one hotel, one drug-store, several small mechanical shops, one grist-mill, one saw-mill, grain elevators, and a population of about 200 inhabitants. MONTEITH STATION is situated near the southwest corner of the township, and is prominent only as being the point of crossing of the Grand Rapids and Indiana and the Allegan and Southeastern Railroads. SHELBYVILLE, In the year 1842, in answer to a petition for the organ ization of a church, the Rev. Wilson Blain was appointed by the Presbytery of Michigan to perform the duty of organization, which he did on the 5th of February, in the house of Thomas Monteith. The original members were as follows: Thomas Monteith, Jane A. Monteith, Isaac Maston, Jane Maston, William Walker, Elizabeth Walker, William Russell, Margery Monteith, Lovinus Monteith, Jennett Monteith, William Hay, and Mary Hay by certifi cate, and William T. Monteith, Walter Monteith, Elisabeth Monteith, and Daniel D. McMartin by profession. Thomas Monteith seems to have been the only elder elected at the organization. Of the 16 original members, but 7 remain. also a station on the line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, is situated near the northwest corner of Martin township. It contains an extensive saw-mill, a store of general merchandise, several small mechanical shops, a post office, and some half-dozen dwelling-houses. RELIGIOUS. UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF MARTIN* The original elements of the United Presbyterian Church in North America run back through different organizations to the best days of the Reformed Church of Scotland. Owing to corruptions in the Established Church of that country, the Associate Presbyterian Church was organized The additions to the Session were as follows: 1843, William T. Monteith and William Russell were elected, their ordination taking place June 10, 1843. In 1847, * Contributed by Rev. Wm. M. Ritchie."], [377, "Residence of D. C M ..

In 1849, Jason Gillespie, an elder from Graham's Church, Orange Co., N. Y., was received, elected, and installed. May 8, 1854, John Wylie, an elder from Ontario, Ind., was received, elected, and installed. 3. The United Presbyterian Church. \u2014 The Presbyteries of the two churches having agreed on a basis of union, the highest courts of these bodies completed the consolidation in Pittsburgh, Pa., May 26, 1858. Where both these churches had existed in the same place, an adjustment in regard to church property, officers, etc., was necessary. To effect this in Martin, Rev. Thomas Calahan was commis sioned by the United Presbyterian Presbytery of Michigan. The first pastor was James A. Frazier, a licentiate of the First Presbytery of Ohio. He was ordained in 1848. His pastorate was of short duration, but successful in building up the church. Having had his attention directed to the work of foreign missions, when the church resolved, in 1850, to establish a mission in Palestine, he offered him self, and was elected. He went out in 1851. In 1860, owing to the disturbances in that country, he returned to America, but in a few months resumed his work. He died at his post Aug. 30, 1863. On the 25th of November, 1858, the churches agreed on a union, the Session consisting of the elders of both of them, as follows : William T. Monteith, William Russell, David Wylie, John Wylie, James Redpath, and John Blair. The members of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church numbered 45 ; of the Associate Presbyterian, 34 ; total, 79. The first pastor of the United Church was Rev. T. J. Wilson, a licentiate of the Presbytery of Chartiers, who was ordained and installed May 5, 1864. On account of feeble health he was obliged to resign. He removed to Oregon in 1868, where he has been engaged most of the time in preaching; first at Salem, at present at Halsey, in that State. Mr. Wilson's work was very successful, and he is affectionately remembered. The next pastor was Rev. William T. Canning, who came from the Presbyterian Church of Nova Scotia, and was installed in 1853. He labored in this place about three years. In 1856 he resigned his charge, when he removed to Canada and connected himself with the Canada Presbyterian Church, where he is still laboring. The first church building in Martin was erected by this society in 1846, mainly by the labors and generosity of Thomas Monteith, Sr. It is a comfortable framed building, erected at a cost of about $800, with a seating capacity of about 200. It is located one mile south of Martin's Cor ners, and is now used as a common school-house. The second pastor was Rev. John Anderson. Mr. An derson was ordained by the Associate Reformed Presbytery of Michigan. June 20, 1857, and labored in Northern In diana until after Mr. Wilson's resignation, when he accepted a call from Martin. He was installed in 1869. He labored with great acceptance until troubles arose, when he was obliged to resign. He was released April 10, 1877. Since then he has been connected with the reunited Presbyterian Church, and is laboring at Kalamazoo. Since Mr. Ander son's resignation the pulpit has been supplied by the Pres bytery, the present incumbent, Rev. William M. Richie, being appointed for a year, commencing Nov. 20, 1879. 2. The Associate Presbyterian Church. \u2014 In the year 1851 a number of persons petitioned the Home Mission Board of the Associate Presbyterian Church for the preach ing of the gospel. Their petition was granted, and Rev. D. S. McHenry was sent to supply them for six months. The first services were held in the house of Robert Pat terson, Sr. Some time in the fall of that year a petition was sent to the nearest Presbytery \u2014 that of Richland, Ohio \u2014 for the organization of a congregation. The petition was granted, and Rev. Samuel Anderson appointed to or ganize. The organization was effected on the 8th of March, 1852, at which time 12 members were received, 8 by certificate and 4 by profession. The following are the names : Robert Patterson, Jennett Patterson, Orin A. Porter, Jennet Porter, John Redpath, James Redpath, N. Davidson Redpath, Maria Redpath, Lovinus Monteith, Jennet Monteith, Charles Davidson, and Robert Davidson, \u25a0 \u2014 the last four by profession. The present church building was erected and dedicated in 1871, at a cost of about $6000. It is a large, well proportioned edifice, with a seating capacity of 500 or 600, finely frescoed, the iuside work being of ash and walnut. It is surmounted by a cupola with a good bell, and is heated by furnaces in the basement. Around the church are about 40 sheds, in good order, for the comfort of teams. Mr. Thomas Shepherd was elected and ordained to the Session in 1875. He, with the surviving members of the former one, make the Session as follows : William T. Mon tieth, David Wylie, Thomas Shepherd. The present su perintendent of Sabbath-schools is John S. Monteith. Num ber of officers and teachers, 12 ; number of scholars, 60 ; contributions for the year, $34. At the organization Orin A. Porter and N. D. Redpath were chosen ruling elders. These two elders having been removed by death, James Redpath and John Blair were ordained to that office Feb. 5, 1855. A house of worship was erected in 1855, at a cost of about $1000, capable of seating about 250 persons. It is now used as a carriage manufactory. Whilst many have been received into the communion of the church, many have died and others have moved away. The number of church members reported for April 1, 1880, was 124. From published records, this society has, in the last twenty years, contributed to pastors' salaries over $13,000, and for the spread of the gospel in other parts of our own land and in foreign countries, over $5000. The church is at present in a prosperous condition. This church never had a settled pastor, but was furnished with preaching in accordance with the home mission reg ulations of the church. Among the names of the supplies are some of the first men in the denomination, such as Revs. D. S. McHenry, James M. Smeallie, Samuel Ander son, J. B. Clark, J. H. Andrew, Samuel Patten, J. A. Shankland, Gilbert Small, and others. Four young men, members of this church, have given themselves to the work of the ministry, and have met with much acceptance by the church : Revs. Thomas Wylie, Hebron, N. Y., died April 3, 1877 ; Thomas W. Monteith,"], [380, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 278 lage of Martin Corners, and contains about 225 sittings.

THE MARTIN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH* This body was organized in 1840 by Rev. William Todd, the preacher in charge of the Allegan Circuit. The first members of the Martin class, who were Ashbel Gates (leader), Ph\u0153be Gates, Abram Shellman, Mary A. Shellman, and a Mrs. Hanmer, held their first meeting in a small log house, situated one mile and a quarter southeast of Martin Cor ners. Until a school-house was built in the vicinity, other early meetings were held in the dwelling-houses of the pio neers. In time the school-house afforded them a conve nient place for worship, and there their usual services were held until the building of a church edifice, in 1868. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. HON. WILLIAM F. HARDEN. Hiram Harden was born in the township of Hartford, Washington Co., N. Y., where his ancestors had lived many years. About the year 1820 he emigrated to the town of Williamson, Wayne Co., N. Y., where his son, William F., was born July 19, 1830. At that early day (1820) Wayne County was a new country, and Mr. Harden bought a farm in the midst of an almost unbroken wilder ness. This farm he cleared up and improved, living on it half a century, leaving it to go into the village of William son a few years previous to his death. Wm. F. grew to manhood on his father's farm, receiving a good common school education. Arrived at his majority, he worked for seven years his father's farm on shares, teaching school winters. In this way he got his first start in life. In 1858, Mr. Harden and his wife came to Martin township, Allegan Co., Mich., on a visit, and while here bought of his brother-in-law one hundred acres of the farm on which he now resides. It was partly improved, and embraced a small barn and a log house. To the farm then bought Mr. Harden has since added, until he now owns three hundred and ten acres, of which two hundred and fifty-five acres are under a splendid state of cultivation, with a large house and many and fine out-buildings, while he stands high as one of Martin's most successful farmers and business In September, 1811, Rev. F. Gage became the preacher in charge. He remained one year, and was succeeded by Rev. Daniel Bush, in September, 1842. Other pastors were Thomas Jakeways, who came in September, 1843 ; Jacob Parker, September, 1844 ; George King, September, 1845 ; M. B. Camburn, September, 1846 ; Curtis Mosher, September, 1847 ; A. J. Eldred, September, 1849 ; and Godell, in September, 1850. At the close of the year 1850 the charge was divided, and Otsego became the head of this circuit, the pastors of the Otsego Circuit being T. H. Bignell, who came in September, 1851 ; A. Wakefield, September, 1852 ; W. F. Jenkins, September, 1853, who remained two years. In September, 1855, the charge was again divided, Otsego being set off and Martin attached to Wayland, the circuit assuming the name of the Wayland Circuit, with Porter Williams preacher in charge. He was succeeded by A. C. Beach in September, 1856; L. M. Bennett, September, 1858; Cleveland, September, 1860; J. Billings, September, 1861; Blowers, September, 1862 ; C. H. Fisher, September, 1864 ; D. R. Latham, September, 1866 ; and J. R. A. Wightman, in September, 1867. men. In politics Mr. Harden was in early life a Whig, as were his ancestors before him. On the organization of the Re publican party he became one of its most ardent supporters, and still believes it to be the party of progress and civil liberty. He has been many times its standard-bearer, hav ing been in his township school inspector, highway com missioner, and for twelve years supervisor, \u2014 eight years successively. In 1876 he represented his county on the State board of equalization, and in 1875 was elected to represent bis district in the lower house at the special ses sion of the State Legislature, to which he was again elected for the full term of 1875-76. He served as chairman on the committee on federal relations, and as a member of the committee on local taxation. All of which positions Mr. Harden has filled with credit and to the entire satisfaction of his fellow-citizens. The Martin class was attached to Plainwell charge in September, 1868, and the last-named pastor appointed to Plainwell, thus retaining the pastorate over the Martin class for the term of three years. In September, 1870, B. S. Mills was appointed, and he was succeeded in Sep tember. 1871, by J. W. Miller, who, after a few months, was called to Grand Traverse district. J. C. Hartley was appointed to fill out the year, and was succeeded by J. T. Iddings in September, 1872. This, with other appointments, became Martin charge in September, 1873, with Abraham J. Van Wyck pastor. He served for a short period, when, having located, D. M. Ward was appointed in his stead, who served until May 5, 1874. An exchange was then made, and N. Saunders filled out the year. The subsequent pastors have been G. W. Hoag, appointed in September, 1874 ; T. Clark, appointed in September, 1876 ; and O. E. Wightman, the present in cumbent, who* was appointed in September, 1877. On the 29th day of September, 1852, he was married to Miss Mary J. Wilcox, who was born in Wayne County, where her parents were among the earliest settlers. She was a daughter of Earl and Jane (Stewart) Wilcox, and was born Aug. 21, 1830. Their union has been blessed with five children, as follows : Josephine J., born March 31, 1853; Malon D., Nov. 6, 1855 ; Jennie E., Sept. 19, 1860; Hattie M., May 7, 1866; and Cora B., May 11, 1872. Under the pastorate of J. R. A. Wightman, in January, 1868, a house of worship was completed and dedicated. It is a neat wooden structure, pleasantly situated in the vil- * From data famished by Rev.

His father, Alfred Nichols, was born in Suffield, Hart ford Co., Conn., July 27, 1802, and is still living. In the year 1825 he emigrated to Naples, Ontario Co., N. Y., and March 8, 1826, was married to Miss Angeline Lyon, who was born in Naples, Ontario Co., N. Y., Sept. 7, 1808, and died Oct. 21, 1873. In the spring of 1858, Dr. Nichols thought it best to seek a new field of labor, and started for the West, driving his horse and sulky, and arrived at Martin, Allegan Co., Mich., in due time. He was in a strange land, poor in purse, but rich in energy, willing to work, and strong in confidence of success. Strangers extended the friendly hand, gave the cheery, heartfelt welcome, while the latchstring hung out from every door of all the nationalities that constituted the then sparse popula tion of the town of Martin. Soon friendships and asso ciations were formed, which grew warmer, stronger, and more dear and mature as succeeding years passed, the recollections of which are freighted with pleasure and gratitude that his lot was cast among such. G. B. Nichols, who was the oldest of their family, during his boyhood attended the best schools his town and vicinity afforded, and while in his teens commenced teaching school winters and working by the month, farm ing, summers. In the spring of 1848 he entered the office of his uncle, Dr. Lester Sprague, an old and suc cessful practitioner in Naples, and commenced reading medicine, continuing to teach winters to furnish the \"sinews\" to pursue his studies and enter college. He attended the session of 1850-51 at Geneva Medical College, New York, and graduated at Castleton Medical College, Vermont, in November 1852, and from that time has practiced his profession. Dr. Nichols has for over twenty-two years practiced medicine in Martin and its surrounding towns, and by his energy and untiring perseverance met with marked success, and now has an extensive and lucrative practice. Dr. Nichols is and has been throughout his life a hard student, thus keeping up with the times and making himself proficient in the profession he loves. After his graduation he returned and practiced with Dr. Sprague until 1858. On Dec. 21, 1853, he was married to Miss Eunice M. Watkins, daughter of Bing ham and Mary Watkins. She was born in Naples, Ontario Co., N. Y., Nov. 1, 1832. She has ever since been the willing helper, noble woman, and faithful wife, He has always been an active Republican, preferring rather to work in the \" ranks\" than to hold a \" com mission.\" Gave his first vote, in 1848, for \"Free-Soil,\" Van Buren, and Adams."], [382, ""], [383, "279 MARTIN TOWNSHIP WALTER MONTEITH Among the early settlers of Allegan County there are few, if any, who have done more to advance the best in- terests of the county, its growth and prosperity, than Walter Monteith. Of Scotch descent and born in the town of Caledonia, Livingston Co., N. Y., he grew to manhood among the sturdy Scotsmen by whom that town was set- tled, and from them learned lessons of industry and sterling honesty which have followed him through life, making him one of that class from which the ranks of American pioneers have been recruited. His educational advantages were limited to the common schools of his day, while his knowl- edge of the world and its people have never been limited, but have expanded year by year. In the fall of 1835, Mr. Monteith, in company with his brother William, came to Michigan, stopping first in Hillsdale County, where they remained until the following July, working at whatever they could find to do. They then returned to New York. While in Hillsdale, Mr. Monteith east his first vote, it being for town offices and he voting the Whig ticket. In the spring of 1837 the brothers again came West, driving through with a team. From Detroit they came to Kala- mazoo, and from there to Plainwell. In the town of Martin their father had bought of the government section 32 ; to this land they followed an Indian trail from Gun Plain, no road having been cut through at that time. There were then but two families in the township, those of Mr. Eldred and Mr. White. On the farm now owned by Walter the brothers built a log house, and at once commenced to im prove and clear their laud. They broke up and the same season sowed ten acres to wheat, which was their start in life. Their father afterwards gave each of his boys a quarter section, which was their only help. The first four years Mr. Monteith boarded himself part of the time, being im pelled thereto by the low state of his finances. At that time the people of Martin went to Plainwell to vote, and to Kalamazoo and Plainwell for their supplies, while their nearest mill was at Pine Creek. The new farm Mr. Monteith then moved on to, has now become one of the fine farms of Martin, and is the work and management of he who cut upon it the first tree, and who now in the evening of life sees around him cleared fields, fences, and buildings, and who has gained more than a competency, \u2014 the result, not of speculation, but of honest toil, good management, and adherence to the calling which he so well understands. His farm now consists of three hundred and thirty acres of land in Martin and a large tract in Nebraska. In politics Mr. Monteith is a Republican ; he was the first assessor in the town, and one of the first road commis sioners. He has been for thirty-five years a member of the United Presbyterian Church, of which he was many years a trustee. He has always taken a deep interest in church matters, and has done his share towards building three churches. On the 14th day of March, 1840, Mr. Monteith was married to Miss Elizabeth McMartin, daughter of Duncan and Margaret (McArthur) McMartin. Their ancestors were born in Scotland, from whence they emigrated to Johnstown, N. Y., where Elizabeth was born, April 14, 1814. Their union has been blessed with five children, as follows: Margaret E, horn May 15, 1844'; Arthur, June 2, 1848; Mary.

Among the old and prominent families of Allegan County are the Monteiths, who settled in the town of Mar tin when there were but two families in the township. They are of Scotch origin. William, the grandfather of the present William T., was born in Stirling, in the lowlands of Scotland, June 4, 1743, and was one of a long line of Monteiths who trace their lineage back to the early days of Scotch history. He emigrated to America and settled in Broadalbin, Montgomery Co., N. Y., prior to the Revolu tion, in which war he took an active part. He took up and improved a farm in Broadalbin, where he was among the first settlers, and where he lived until his death, at the ripe old age of seventy-seven years. His family consisted of five sons and two daughters, Thomas, the father of Wil liam T., being the youngest, and born March 10, 1792, on the old homestead iu Montgomery County, where he grew to manhood. In 1812 he married Miss Jane Allen, and a couple of years later moved into Caledonia, Livingston Co., N. Y., then an almost unbroken wilderness, where he bought from the government a tract of wild land, which he cleared and improved, and on which he resided until about 1840, when be sold out and moved into Martin township, where he had previously bought from the government and divided among his sons the entire section 32. He bought more land, which he cleared up and on which he lived until his death, which occurred Feb. 13, 1858. Mr. Monteith was a Scotch Presbyterian of the old school, and did much to advance the cause of religion in his vicinity. His wife still resides on section 32, at the advanced age of eighty-nine years. There were born to them five sons and three daughters, of whom William T. was the oldest child. ARTHUR ANDERSON. Among the enterprising farmers of Martin township, there are none who have done more to show that success de pends upon energy, industry, and enterprise than Arthur Anderson, who was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Nov. 22, 1838. In 1852 his father, William Anderson, left his home in the lowlands of Scotland, where many generations of Andersons had lived and died, and in a sail ing vessel embarked for the New World beyond the sea. They landed in Quebec, Canada, on the 24th day of May, 1852, and soon after came to Gun Plain township, in Alle gan County, where the elder Mr. Anderson bought a farm, and on which Arthur grew to manhood, receiving a com mon-school education. He remained with his father until his marriage, March 28,1865, to Miss Ann Robertson, daugh ter of John and Jannette (M'Donald) Robertson, who was born in Scotland (from whence her family emigrated in 1856), Dec. 30, 1846. He was born Aug. 7, 1813, in Broadalbin, but grew up on the farm in Caledonia. His education was such as could be obtained at the winter schools of his district. In the fall of 1835 he came to Michigan in company with his brother Walter, stopping during the winter in Hillsdale County, working at anything they could get to do. The following summer they returned to New York, where they remained until the next spring, when, as set forth in Wal ter's biography, they returned to Michigan, and settled on the land previously entered in Martin by their father. Wil liam helped his brother get started on his land, and then returned again to New York, where, on the 16th day of May, 1839, he was married to Miss Margery Sinclair, who was born in Caledonia, June 9, 1813. Her parents emi grated from Scotland. Soon after his marriage Mr. Mon teith returned to Martin, and settled on the quarter-section where he still resides, and on which he intends to pass the remainder of his days. To the farm he has added until he now owns one of the fine large farms for which Martin is noted, the work of his own hands and management. In 1865, Arthur bought of Mr. Patterson two hundred acres of land in Martin township, running in debt for the most of it. To this he has since added eighty acres, making a large farm, and one well adapted to stock-raising, which Mr. Anderson is now making a specialty. In 1873, wishing to improve his stock, he bought of the State Ag ricultural College a fine short-horned Durham, called Capt. Absolute, and numbered 13,599. The following year he purchased the Crown Prince, numbered 13,738. Previous to this he had purchased of E. L. Smith, of Kalamazoo, the Roan Beauty and Minnie Harris. In 1877 Mr. Anderson, wishing to still improve his herd of short-horns, bought of Isaac Runyan two very fine animals, known as May Flower and Sturgis Maid. Two years later, becoming more inter ested in the handling of blooded cattle, and believing that money expended in improving his herd was means well spent, he purchased Clement, numbered 11,519, of Richard Daugherty This animal was one of the finest ever brought into the State, he having taken the first premium at the Northern Ohio Fair when two years old, and after wards sold for one thousand dollars. The same year he bought the Hampton Lad, numbered 23,388, sired by the second Duke of Oneida, who sold for twelve thousand dol lars at the New York Mills' sale. Other fine animals have He is, and for forty years has been, a member and elder of the United Presbyterian Church, to the advancement of which he has ever done his share. He has also been prominent in Sabbath-schools, of which he has been super intendent for twenty-five years. In politics Mr. Monteith is a stalwart Republican, in early life a Whig. He was among the first supervisors of"], [385, "MARTIN TOWNSHIP. 281 at different times been added to the herd, thereby keeping up the reputation of his stock, which has given Mr. Ander son many customers and ranks him among the successful breeders of fine stock. In politics Mr. Anderson is a Re publican, and has filled the offices of drain commissioner and town treasurer, and is now president of the Martin Protection Society. He is, and has been since he was twenty years old, a member of the LTnited Presbyteriau Church. There have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Anderson six chil dren, viz.: William H., Dec. 15, 1865, died Dec. 27, 1870 ; John C, Dec. 16, 1868 ; Jessie J., Juiy 29, 1870 ; Jennie M., April 24, 1873; Ann E., May 11, 1876; and Arthur, March 31, 1880. ANDREW TEMPLETON. farms in Martin, with a beautiful house and grounds and fine out-buildings. He was brought up in the United Pres byterian faith, with which church he united at an early age, and of which he remained an esteemed and consistent member until his death. In politics Mr. Templeton was a Republican, and was by that party elected to different offices, which he filled with credit and ability. He was a man of sterling worth, of fine business qualities, and one esteemed by all who knew him. He died March 25, 1873, mourned and regretted by many friends and acquaintances. On the 23d day of May, 1855, Mr. Templeton was joined in marriage to Miss Susan G. McFarlan, daughter of Alexander D. and Elizabeth (Allen) McFarlan. She was born in Broadalbin, Fulton Co., N. Y., July 3, 1829. Her parents were of Scotch descent, her father having been born in Scotland, from whence his parents emigrated when he was an infant. They settled in Broad albin when that country was new, and where Mr. McFar lan lived and died. On the Cauldhame farm, in Ayrshire, Scotland, there has resided for generations the Templetons, one of the old and honored families of that historic land. On this farm generation after generation of the family have been born, have lived, and died. From time to time different members of the family on reaching manhood have left the old farm and emigrated to the New World beyond the sea, where they have become useful and influential members of society. Such an one was Andrew Templeton, of whom this brief sketch is written. He was born on the old farm Jan. 29, 1825, and remained there until he arrived at his majority, receiving a fair education. In 1852 he emigrated to America. Upon landing in New York City, Mr. Tem pleton went to Martin township, in Allegan County, where he had cousins living. In July, 1854, he bought of a Mr. Wolcott one hundred and sixty acres of land on section 19. It was all new, and Mr. Templeton at once commenced to improve his farm and erect buildings. That his efforts were crowned with success is shown by one of the finest 36"], [386, "281 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. with his lather uutil he was twenty years old, receiving a com- mon-school education, with one year at the Genesee Acad- emy. In 1846, Mr. McVean came to Michigan, coming to Buffalo with a team and wagon. At Buffalo he, with his team, took passage on a steamer for Detroit; then, follow- ing the old Territorial road, he came to Allegan County, arriving in Martin in September, where he bought of the government the southwest quarter of section 30, in partner- ship with his brothers John and Daniel C, whose interest he afterwards purchased. To this farm he has added, until he now owns three hundred and twenty acres of well- improved land, one hundred acres of which he has chopped and cleared himself, and on which he has built a fine house and out-buildings, a view of which appears on another page of this work. In politics Mr. McVean is an ardent Repub- lican, but not a politician ; in religion a Presbyterian, of which church he has been a member twenty-five years. In 1852, Mr. McVean was married to Mary Johnson, who died March 24, 1853. On the 29th day of November, 1855, he was again married, his choice being Miss Mary Davidson, who was born in Pavilion, Genesee Co., N. Y., Oct. 16, 1836, daughter of Robert and Mary (Simpson) Davidson, who emigrated from Scotland. There have been born to Mr. and Mrs. McVean nine children, viz. : Frank lin D., Daniel J., Mary A., Flora A., Elizabeth, Hugh D., Jennette F., Millard C. aud Marion S., twins. DUNCAN C. McVEAN. Among the pioneers of America who left the old country to make for themselves and their posterity homes in a coun try where land was plenty and cheap, there came from the highlands of Scotland representatives of the McVean and Creighton families. Daniel McVean came with the British army during the Revolutionary war, he having enlisted on condition that at the close of the war he could return or remain, as he saw fit. He- was a sergeant, but remained with the army only until he could honorably leave it. After the war he emigrated to Montgomery Co., N. Y., which was then new, and where he was among the first settlers. He bought three hundred acres of land, which he cleared and im proved, and on which he died. His son Duncan was born on the old homestead, in Johnstown, where he remained until after his marriage to Miss Jennette Creighton, when he moved into Livingston Co., N. Y., where he was a pioneer. His wise's father, Daniel Creighton, came from Scotland soon after Daniel McVean, Sr., and also settled in Montgomery County. Duncan McVean bought one hundred and fifty acres of land in Livingston County, which he made into one of the fine farms of that county, and where he passed the remainder of his days. There were born to them seven chil dren, of whom Duncan C. was the sixth. He was born in Caledonia, Livingston Co., N. Y., Noa'. 29, 1826 ; remained MONTEREY/ NATURAL FEATURES. The soil of Monterey is varied, the level land being com posed of clay, sand, and gravel, with a large proportion of gravel also in the hills. There is occasionally a bit of swampy land, but much of this has since been made arable. This soil is especially adapted to the growth of grain, of which it produces large crops. Wheat is the staple pro duct of the township, some of the residents claiming pre cedence for Monterey, in this regard, over all the rest of the county. The enormous amount of 51 \u00a3 bushels of wheat to the acre was produced on a small tract of land by one of its farmers, though this is of course very exceptional. Monterey was formerly especially well supplied with tim ber, but the larger portion of this has been cut for market. It was composed of beech, oak, elm, basswood, pine, black walnut, and white and black ash, and there are considerable quantities of these kinds of timber still standing. A strip of pine-land is found on the western boundary of the town ship, and the northeast corner also has a limited amount. Monterey, which is designated on the United States survey as township No. 3 north, in range 13 west, is one of the most important townships of Allegan County, not only from the excellence of its land, but from the wealth and intelligence of its citizens. It is bounded on the north by Salem, on the east by Hopkins, on the south by Allegan, and on the west by Heath. Its surface is remarkable for its varied aspect, the township containing numerous hills of moderate elevation and valleys of rich and luxuriant ver- dure. Some of these hills are sufficiently high to afford an extended view of the surrounding landscape ; but it is only at a few points that the land is so rugged as to offer any obsta- cles to cultivation. There are some small bodies of water to be found in Monterey, but no large ones. The most impor- tant is Dumont Lake, a portion of which lies on sections 32 and 33, the remainder being in the township of Allegan. There are one or two smaller sheets, but they can hardly be dignified by the name of lakes. A creek of some importance flows from the northwest corner of the township, which has a fall rapid enough so that it might be utilized for mills or manufactories. The township is also well watered by numerous smaller streams. The soil and climate of Monterey are well adapted to the culture of fruit, and fine orchards adorn nearly all the farms of the township. Apples are a staple crop, and peaches are grown with so much success as to warrant many farmers in devoting much time and labor to their growth.

The year 1836 witnessed the first settlement of Monte rey, the earliest pioneer to make a permanent location being Gil Bias Wilcox. He had removed from Rochester, N. Y., the same year, and after remaining a few days in Allegan repaired to the southwest quarter of section 22, in township 3 (now Monterey), which had been previously entered for him by John Swezy. Several choppers had been employed by Alexander L. Ely to clear a tract of land in the town ship, owned by him, who remained only during their term of labor, and did not become permanent settlers.

Mr. Wilcox had provided himself with a cloth tent, under which he obtained temporary shelter, devoting himself at once to the work of clearing some garden-ground and build ing a house, and repairing once a week to Allegan for pro visions. At the expiration of a month he had completed a very comfortable log structure, to which his family, which had meanwhile remained in Allegan, was removed. A sufficient tract had also been cleared to provide them with garden products. Section 9. \u2014 Bought in 1836 by C. C. Trobridge, Frederick Booher, R. D. Hill, Nelson Aldrich, Horace M. Burch.

There was not a road in the township, one which had been surveyed in 1832 not having been opened. Messrs. Wilcox and Swezy obtained a contract to open this road for a distance of six miles. The following summer Mr. Wilcox built a barn, the cost of which was liquidated by the sale of corn and potatoes he had raised. He was for a while diverted from his farming by the excitements of a boatman's life on the Kalamazoo River, but returned ere long and worked steadily to improve his land. He re mained in Monterey until his removal to Trowbridge, where* he now resides. The first birth in the township was that of a son of Mr. Wilcox (whom he named Elijah), an event which occurred on the 1st day of October, 1837. Another early birth occurred in the family of John Swezy. The first death in the township was that of one of the choppers employed by Alexander L. Ely, on section 34, the name of the individual having been Tanney or Penney, as nearly as can be recollected. His disease was similar to that known to modern science as diphtheria, though unfamiliar to the practitioners of that day. This was unquestionably the first death in the township.

Sylsbre Rumery pur chased land on section 34 in 1839, and still resides upon it. which the village of Allegan is located, moved to the farm which Henry had vacated, and remained there a few years. He subsequently located upon section 26, but ultimately moved back to Allegan, where he died. From Chenango Co., N. Y., Hiram Sabin came to Alle gan village in 1835, and the year following entered 80 acres on section 22, but did not then take up his residence upon it. He devoted his time principally to lumbering, but occasionally did some work on his place, until in 1843 he had a comfortable house and 12 acres under cultiva tion. In that year he married, and the very next day he repaired with his young wife to his farm and began life amid the forests of Monterey. His nearest neighbor was Harvey Kenyon, who had 53 acres upon section 15. Mr. Sabin had raised a bountiful crop of grain and vegetables the year before their advent, and the young couple was, therefore, better supplied than the average of new beginners iu the wilderness. John Swezey was the third settler in Monterey. He en tered 160 acres of land on section 22 (which he reached by following the Indian trail from Allegan) in 1836, but did not make a permanent location upon it until 1837, having, on his arrival in 1835 from Rochester, N. Y., his former home, taken up his residence in Allegan. After working for two years for Mr. Ely he built a house on his land and removed thither with his family. The earliest preaching in the township occurred at his home in 1837, Rev. Bradley Granger having officiated on that occasion. Elders Tyler and Gage also preached occa sionally in Monterey in the pioneer days. The foregoing facts are obtained from Messrs. Swezy and Wilcox. Mr. John Swezy and Mr. Sabin are the only ones among the surviving pioneers of Monterey now residing upon their original farms. From Akron, Ohio, came Leonard Ross in 1837, who located upon 80 acres on section 27, which he found entirely uncleared. Like others, while building his cabin and making his first clearing he had to depend on Allegan for supplies, which were so extravagant in price as to render it almost impossible to obtain more than the bare necessaries of life. Pork, the staple article of diet for the laboring man, was $18 per hundred, salt cost the same sum per barrel, and other articles were proportionately high. Another representative of Ohio is the venerable William Briggs, a brother of Noah Briggs, who located upon section 21 in 1845, where he had previously secured 80 acres. His brother's house afforded him a shelter until he could build a residence on his own land, the lumber for which came from Peter Dumont, in Allegan. Afterwards he moved to sec tion 21, near the centre of the township, where he now re sides. One of the earliest settlers was Noah Briggs, whose ad vent in Allegan occurred in 1836, he having been a former resident of Oswego, N. Y. Two years later he located upon 80 acres on section 15. His household goods had been shipped from his New York home by lake, and had been lost during a storm, so that when tbe family moved to Monterey they were almost destitute of the articles neces sary for keeping house. Mr. Briggs and his family, how ever, struggled bravely with adverse circumstances, and soon made themselves a comfortable home. He increased his original 80 acres to 240, but ultimately removed to Kalamazoo County, where he died in 1875. Joseph Tanner, another pioneer of 1845, located west of the centre, upon section 21. The following season he pur chased the farm which had formerly belonged to Gil Bias Wileox, on section 28, where he remained until his death, in 1872. James McAlpine came from Wayne Co., N. Y., in 1845, and settled upon 80 acres on section 28, remaining with the family of Fluskey Atwell until he made his own land hab itable. He chopped 20 acres the first year, which he speedily made productive. With Mr. McAlpine came his brother Willis, who assisted him in the improvement of his land and afterwards returned to his old home in New York. Nicholas Brown came from Wayne Co., N. Y., in 1838, 'and settled on 125 acres of uncleared land on section 12. Lemuel Wilcox, the father of Gil Bias Wilcox, came from Rochester, N. Y., in 1836, and made his temporary resi dence in Allegan. In 1837 he moved to Monterey with his family, where he had purchased 80 acres on section 21. His son, Samuel Wilcox, then a lad, was with him. In 1849 the latter bought 50 acres on section 36, but soon exchanged it for a tract on section 28, where he cleared up a farm. He afterwards removed to Monterey Centre, where he now resides. Ira Miller came with two sons to the township in 1847, having been a former resident of Ohio. On section 14 he purchased 160 acres of wild land. On section 15 lived Lewis Huttleston, his nearest neighbor, who afterwards re moved to Kalamazoo County. Mr. Miller died at the resi dence of his son, Chandler F. Miller, on section 23. An other son, Madison Miller, resides upon section 15. Among the most successful of the pioneers of Monterey is John M. Granger. He removed from Wayne Co., N. Y., in 1849, and, in connection with his brother, purchased 400 acres of Charles Howard, of Detroit, on sections 21, 22, and 28. Of this land Mr. Granger retained 120 acres, on which he now resides. The township at this time was being rapidly settled, and the work of the laborer was ap parent in the fields of lofty corn and waving grain that had superseded the ancient monarchs of the forest. Frederick S. Day, another Rochester pioneer, removed from that city in 1838 to Watson, Allegan Co., where he remained three years, after which he purchased 120 acres in Monterey, on section 21. On this land a small piece iiad been chopped, but the larger portion was still uncleared. No road had yet been opened, and the Indian trail, along which the whites had cut away the underbrush, was the main highway to Allegan. John M. Granger's brother, Eli D. Granger, came soon afterwards, and located upon a portion of the original 400 acres. Mr. Granger was a graduate of the New York State Normal School, and a gentleman of scholarly attainments. He, however, adapted himself to the rugged life of a pioneer, Small bands of Indians frequently stopped at Mr. Day's residence on their way to Grand Rapids, where government money and supplies were apportioned to them, but they"], [391, ""], [392, "Residence of JOSEPH"], [393, "i \"fOf-N, Monterey, Mich."], [394, ""], [395, "MONTEREY TOWNSHIP. 285 built him a house, and at once began the labor of clearing his land. His death occurred in Kalamazoo County in 1866. 1872. Mr. Mentz, who still resides in the township, has during the larger portion of his life been a minister of the gospel, and officiated as pastor of the German Methodist Church in the township. B. F. Granger, another brother, located, in 1852, upon section 26, where he owned 80 acres, which were purchased of William Knapp, of Allegan. Hiram Bailey came in 1855 and located upon section 20, where he owns 80 acres, besides land on the adjoining section. He had previously been a resident of Rochester, N. Y., and had followed the occupation of a boatman. Christian Renzehousen emigrated from Ohio in 1852, and settled upon section 25, where he became the possessor of 70 acres of land. His original purchase was 160, which he divided with his brother, who has 90 acres. The latter, August Renzehousen, came two years later. Among other prominent settlers in the township during the years attached to their respective names may be men tioned the following : L. Huttleston in 1841 ; S. Squires and S. J. Reed in 1842; S. B. Guyot in 1849; J. Thome, C. Gibson, and J. H. White in 1851 ; M. Reed, J. G. Merrifield, Adam Knoblock, and G. Shank in 1853; C. Atwell and S. J. Stranahan in 1854 ; G. Huskinson, P. Fel tenbarger, J. Pierce, A. Symonds, F. Webber, and II. Mer rifield in 1856. John Goodell, on his arrival from Cleveland, first settled in Trowbridge, but, in 1849, came to Monterey, where he secured 40 acres on section 10. To this he has added at various times, until he now has 220 acres in the immediate neighborhood. Mr. Goodell had no neighbor for a distance of sixteen miles north and for twenty miles west. Noah Briggs was near him on the south, and Thomas and Nicholas Brown had located on the east, two and a half miles away. Mr. Goodell removed to his present farm in 1858. EARLY ROADS. The earliest highway in the township was the one from Allegan to Grand Rapids, which passed through Monterey from north to south, angling slightly near the township-line of Allegan. It was originally surveyed by Pierce Barber, in 1832, and marked by blazed trees, but, not being cleared, the lines became so obliterated as to make a re-survey necessary. This was made by F. J. Littlejohn in 1841. The weather at the time this was done happened to be ex tremely cold ; the members of the surveying party suffered severely, and on reaching a place of shelter at night one of them fell senseless upon the floor, while the remainder were rendered almost speechless by the cold. The same year a contract was awarded John H. Swezy for opening that por tion of the road which passed through Monterey. The second road, which was surveyed soon after (probably by Mr. Littlejohn), began on the southeast corner of section 24, and ran west on section-lines through the township. John Chase, a native of the State of New York, became a resident of Monterey in 1851, having purchased 80 acres on section 36. After making many improvements upon it he finally removed to Kansas. Mr. Chase was a public spirited citizen, and very active in promoting the interests of the township. \u2666 Joseph Thorn, formerly of Ohio, purchased of Robert Weeks 160 acres on section 25. He was, for some time after his advent, a member of Horace Wilson's family, but finally removed to his own land, where he at present resides. OF. Kenyon, another native of the Buckeye State, pur chased a farm of William Hoyer, which had previously been entered by Osman Smith on section 16, but boasted no other improvement than a log house. William Hoyer resided south of him, on section 21, and was his nearest neighbor. Mr. Kenyon still resides upon his original pur chase. BURIAL PLACES. In 1842 the meagre population of the township deter mined to set apart a tract of ground for burial-purposes. A spot was accordingly selected on section 28, which was neatly fenced and improved so as be suitable for the purpose to which it was devoted. The largest landed proprietor in Monterey is George T. Lay, who includes in his possessions 960 acres of land, his residence being located on section 25. Mr. Lay came from Pennsylvania in 1844, but remained for ten years in the village of Allegan, following the occupation of a boatman on the river. In 1851 he purchased 160 acres of land in Monterey, and employed a man to chop 100 acres, building a log house for his use. To this house Mr. Lay moved his family in 1854. Sylsbre Rumery and Horace Wilson were their nearest neighbors. At this time two-thirds of Monterey was still uncultivated. Mr. Lay is one of the few who mention any special bad behavior of the Indians beyond getting drunk. He says that when he was working on the river they would frequently board his raft and purloin whatever eatables or drinkables could be found. He passed through a varied experience with them, and was sometimes exposed to much danger from their violent tempers. Especially was this the case when they resolved to resent any fancied injury. The first interment occurred soon after, Lemuel Wilcox, one of the township's oldest residents, being the first to find a resting-place in the new cemetery. It has since been maintained as a burial-ground, and is adorned with many beautiful tablets and memorial stones. A cemetery located in Hopkins is also used by the residents of the eastern por tion of the township. EARLY SCHOOLS. The first school in Monterey, if the meagre information relating to the subject be correct, was established upon sec tion 22, on land belonging to John Swezy. A log structure was erected, and school established in it, which was patron ized by the few residents of the district, including the families of Messrs. Ross, Wilson, and Huttleston. Mr. Horace Wilson cut a road from his place to the school house to enable his children to reach it with ease. The Christian Sebright and Henry Mentz were among the pioneers of 1854, each of whom purchased 80 acres of land, which they at once improved.

Jahraus, all four being during their pastorates resi dents of Allegan. Next came Rev. Laas, with whom was associated Rev. Henry Mentz, who is still a resident of Monterey. The township is now divided into eight whole districts and one fractional one, of which the directors are Joseph Chamberlain, Fred. Miller, C. F. Miller, Frank Lay, Zopher Cornell, Josiah Feltenbarger, John W. Avery, F. P. Heath, and A. 0. Reed. There are 9 school buildings in the town ship and 359 scholars receiving instruction, 23 of whom are non-residents. The teachers arc paid an aggregate annual salary of $1430.20. Rev. William Burns then became pastor, after which Rev. Henry Krill was recalled. In 1868 the charge was under the pastoral care of Rev. Conrad Wauas, who, during the second year of his pastorate, made strenuous efforts which resulted in the erection of a church edifice, the building committee, who labored assiduously in the enter prise, having been Christian Renzehousen, Peter Deudel, and August Renzehousen. The cost of the edifice was $1400, exclusive of much labor volunteered by members of the congregation. MONTEREY CENTRE. The hamlet of Monterey Centre is located on the four corners of sections 15, 16, 21, and 22, its geographical position being tbe exact centre of the township. It was first settled by Horace Wilson, who purchased in 1835 the southwest quarter of section 15. He made some improve ment on the land and then disposed of it for a location on sections 26 and 27. He was followed by Justus W. Bond, who entered the northeast corner of section 21. He em ployed Eli Griffith to do the first chopping, to whom he gave 40 acres of uncleared land as compensation for his services. Mr. Bond afterwards removed to California. Rev. Henry Mentz became the pastor after the completion of the church, and remained in charge three years, when he was succeeded by Rev. G. C. Herzer, now the presiding elder of the district. Rev. Andrew Myer was then in stalled, and at the expiration of his term of service Rev. C. A. Militzer, of Allegan, the present pastor, began his labors. The church has upon its roll the names of 40 members. A flourishing Sabbath-school is connected with it. The present board of trustees is composed of Christian Renzehousen, Peter Deudel, Claus Buck, Henry Mentz, August Renzehousen. George W. Kibby became, in 1847, the owner of 80 acres, embracing the northwest corner of section 22, which he improved and on which he built a house. In 1860 he erected a hotel, the upper portion of which is now used as a public hall. Andrew Briggs located 40 acres on the southeast corner of section 16 in 1848, upon which he built an ashery. He subsequently removed to Allegan, where his death occurred in 1877. SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH. The first meetings held with a view to introducing the faith of the Seventh-Day Adventists occurred in the winter of 1855, under the auspices of Elder M. E. Cornell. As a result of his labors a church was organized the following year with 35 members, Charles Jones and John Russ being installed as local elders. The earliest store was opened by Andrew Briggs, on the corner of section 21. After conducting it for a brief time he was succeeded by Dr. See. It subsequently passed under the control of Messrs. Ferguson and Moore, who were fol lowed by Messrs. Hoffmaster and Miller. After a few years one of the proprietors died, when the business was closed up. A store was next erected by Abram Berry, which he afterwards disposed of to Henry Guyot. Tbe local lodge of Odd-Fellows purchased the building and converted it into a hall for the use of that organization. In the summer of 1858 a small church edifice was erected, and in 1860, Elder Joseph Bates, who was one of the earliest to embrace the faith, located at Monterey as pastor of the little flock. He remained until his death, which occurred in 1872, John Russ, one of the local elders, having died the same year. The dimensions of the house of worship proving inadequate to the wants of the congre gation, which had considerably increased in numbers, a new edifice was erected in 1862, in which they at present wor ship. The membership numbers 71, Elder H. M. Kenyon being the pastor. In 1869 a store was built by Messrs. O. R. Johnson & Co., which is at present occupied by F. B. Watkins, his stock embracing all goods suited to a country trade. A store of a similar character is kept by Frank Hewitt, in which the post-office is located, Samuel A. Hewitt being postmaster. There is also a district school, presided over by W. F. Benson ; one blacksmith-shop, kept by Squire Bishop ; a wagon-shop, owned by John Frey ; and a boot and-shoe shop. METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. The Methodist Episcopal society in Monterey, which was formerly a part of Allegan charge, was made a separate one by the action of the Michigan Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held at Lansing in the fall of 1867. Rev. Joseph Wood was the first preacher in charge. During the year a house and lot at Monterey Centre were purchased for a parsonage at a cost of $600. It has since been improved, and its value increased. CHURCHES GERMAN METHODIST CHURCH. The earliest missionary of the German Methodist Church who labored in Monterey was Rev. G. Berthrams, whose advent occurred in 1856. His successor, Rev. Jacob Kre bill, was instrumental in the organization of the first class in the township, his assistant at the time being Rev. H. Krill. These clergymen who had already inaugurated the good work were succeeded by Rev. Nathaniel Myer, and later by The present church edifice on section 26 was erected during the pastorate of Rev. E. Hayes. It was completed in September, 1862, at a cost of $2700, being dedicated by Rev. E. B. Jocelyn, D.D., president of Albion College. The church has a present membership of 75, and is in a flourishing condition, the residents of Monterey being"], [397, "Residence of CALEB F. KENYON.

Since its separation from the Allegan charge the church has been served by the following pastors : Revs. Joseph Wood in 1867, H. Hurbert in 1868 and 1869, G. W. Cathorne in 1870, E. Hayes from 1871 to 1873, N. D. Marsh from 1874 to 1877, W. A. Bronson in 1877 and 1878, and E. A. Tauner (the present incumbent), installed in March, 1880. by W. E. Sawyer, which enjoys some patronage from the residents of the northwest corner of the township. A store containing a general stock was formerly kept by J. Clark, but this has since been discontinued. The school building of the district embracing this portion of the town ship is located here. The spot takes its name from a spring of clear, delicious water, which attracted the first settler to this locality. SECRET SOCIETIES. ORGANIZATION. LODGE No. 337, F. AND A. M. The act organizing the township of Monterey was ap proved March 16, 1847, and reads as follows: This lodge was organized under a dispensation in 1876, its first officers having been Ransom Harrington, W. M. ; Hiram Bailey, S. W. ; Samuel Goyt, J. W. Its present officers are Allen Mosher, W. M. ; Hiram Bailey, S. W. ; Aa/on Krug, J. W. ; C. C. Lindsley, Sec. ; Philip Felten barger, Treas. \" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Michigan, That townships number three and four north, of range thirteen west, and township four north, of range fourteen west, in the County of Allegan, be and the same are hereby set off from the township of Allegan, and organized into a separate township, by the name of Monterey, and the first township-meeting therein to bo held at the block meeting-house in said township.\" The meetings are held in a well-appoiuted hall, and the body is in a prosperous condition. This territory embraced Salem and Overisel, the former of which was organized as a separate township in 1855, and the latter attached to Fillmore, leaving the township of Monterey as it at present exists. On its organization sev eral names were proposed, among them Wilson, in honor of Horace Wilson, one of the earliest pioneers. This not proving acceptable to the committee who were appointed to christen the new township, \u2014 consisting of Horace Wil son, Hiram Sabin, Sylsbre Rumery, John Chase, and Isaac Dexter, \u2014 Hiram Sabin suggested the name of Lynn, which was accepted, and Messrs. John Chase and Sylsbre Rumery were appointed a committee to convey the intelligence to the county clerk, who was to forward the name to the Legislature. They were apprised of the existence of a township of Lynn in St. Clair, which precluded the use of that name. Burlington was then suggested, but proved amenable to the same objection. The clerk then informed the committee of the triumph of American arms in Mexico under Gens. Taylor and Worth, and the victory won on the field of Monterey. Mr. Rumery suggested that in honor of this event, the township be called Monterey, which met the approval of his colleague, and the name was adopted and confirmed by the Legislature.

Lay) was born Oct. 28, 1822, near Lockport, Niagara Co., N. Y. His father, Abner Lay, emigrated to that place from Vermont Avhen a young man, at which time that portion of the State was a dense wilderness. He afterwards took an active part in tho war of 1812, being engaged in a number of 1848, Henry Wilson ; 1849, John Chase; 1850, Noah Briggs; 1851, Eli D. Granger; 1852, Leland H. Shaw, Eli D.

The settlers of that portion of the State were inclined to look with great discredit upon the project of a canal from Al bany to Buffalo, and hooted at the idea of raising the boats by a system of locks as fanaticism of the wildest character, many of the settlers along the line of survey declaring that they asked no longer lease of life than to be spared to see the idea in successful operation. The mother of George T. Lay, whose maiden name was Mehitable Talbot, was a native of Massachusetts, and was a lineal descendant of one of three Talbot brothers who were among the very earliest settlers of Massachusetts. son, Mich, (at that time the terminus of the Michigan Central Railroad), and with satchel in hand traveled on foot through different towns and counties, landing finally at Allegan in May, 1844. The best outlet Kalamazoo then had for her flour was by shipping in keel-boats to Allegan, transferring from boats above the dam to boats below, and thence down the river to Lake Michigan. Our hero shipped on board the keel-boat '* Pioneer,\" and spent his first-sum mer in Michigan sailing up and down the Kalamazoo River before a stiff white-ash breeze, or, more properly, a stiff white-ash pole manipulated by his own hands. He then engaged in the lumber trade, and for the succeeding nine years worked in all its branches, from taking it from the stump in the forest of Allegan County to retailing the lum ber on the docks at the head of Lake Street. Chicago (now the site of large and valuable blocks of buildings), and found hard labor in all departments, except that of carry ing home the money received for the lumber. About this time the failure of the wildcat banks left Allegan without any currency that would pass for monev. In the fall of 1832, Abner Lay purchased a tract of wild land in Erie Co., Pa., and contracted with certain par ties to erect a cabin thereon, to be occupied by his family the following winter. A few weeks after his return to New York, he fitted out a train composed of two yoke of oxen and a long sled loaded with necessary household goods aud a limited supply of provision. There were to accompany this load six head of cattle, twenty sheep, a man to drive the oxen, and a boy fifteen years old to drive the cattle and sheep. That boy has since been a member of the Legislature of this State. George T. (then a lad of ten years) was di rected to accompany this train to assist in driving the live stock to Pennsylvania, a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, which journey be accomplished on foot in the dead of winter. The remainder of the family were to make the trip with a horse-team, and arrive in advance of the above-described train. However, on the day before that set for their departure, they met with an accident while re turning from a visit to a near relative. The sleigh-tongue slipped from the neck-yoke, capsizing the sleigh and its con tents, and seriously injuring tbe mother. The horses, being very spirited and badly frightened, immediately separated ; one of them, running some distance into the woods, was found the next day checked up, having tramped one acre of two-feet snow to a solid road-bed. The other ran a short distance and entered the hall of Muldo's hotel, where he was found apparently waiting for further orders. The above-named hotel enjoys the reputation of being the place where the abductors of William Morgan stopped to change horses at midnight, and it is said that Muldo's fancy team conveyed him from thence to the Niagara River. Numerous saw-mills were in operation, and lumber became tbe fiat money that kept Allegan alive through that financial crisis. During this time a certain head-sawyer found him self at the close of his week's labor with his pockets full of wildcat, yet without tbe means to buy even a pound of sugar, whereupon he loaded his broad shoulders with as much clear siding as be could carry, which he exchanged at the store for a supply of groceries, and for the balance due him received as change a 2 by 4 scantling. This sys tem of exchange kept Allegan from bankruptcy until the finances of tho county became settled. After residing in Allegan for a few years, and exercis ing great economy, Mr. Lay became able to purchase by contract one hundred and sixty acres of land in the town ship of Monterey, on section 25. Instead of paying for his land immediately, he used what means he had in hiring men to chop, and adding to this his own labor he suc ceeded in clearing up one hundred acres at once. The first and second crops from this paid for the land and cleared him from debt. He was married in Allegan, Oct. 5, 1851, to Mary E., daughter of Chester and Nancy Barber. She was born in Old Canaan, Conn., July 14, 1825, and at the age of nine, with her father's family, emigrated to Free dom, Portage Co., Ohio, afterwards to Allegan in 1844, and after their marriage remained there until the birth of their first child, which occurred May 27, 1853. At the time of its birth the father was at work on his present home in Monterey, preparing a place to move his family. On his return home, Saturday night, he found a little blue eyed daughter two days old waiting to welcome him. At the age of twenty this child was married to E. Brackett, and two years later a daughter was born to her in the same house and room where she was born. Mr. and Mrs. Brackett are now residents of Van Buren Co., Mich. His other three children are now residents of Monterey, and married as follows : Alta R. to J. C. Clemens, formerly of Iowa ; Frank B. to Belle M. Barclay, of Allegan ; and Ida E. to M. H. Lane, of New York. Mary E., the wife of George T. Lay, died Nov. 27, 1S62. On the 5th of April, 1864, he was married to his present wife, who was the On the arrival of the ox-train at the new home, they found only the log body of the cabin, without a roof, and two feet of snow inside. The snow was shoveled out, a single board roof put on, a fire built in one end, and the first meal eaten in the bouse was composed of flour mixed with water, placed upon a board and turned up to the fire to bake. Notwithstanding its primitive character, this meal was eaten with very evident relish. The next step was to cut a large hemlock-tree so as to lodge it in a similar one, which device formed a shelter for the stock until spring. After a week of suspeuse the horse-team appeared with the rest of the family to share their pioneer life, to the great delight of young George, who had begun to feel the pangs of home sickness. Eleven years later, at the age of twenty-one, he left the cleared and well-improved farm in Pennsylvania to seek his own fortune farther west. He landed first at Jack- 37"], [404, "290 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 16, 1858, and her marriage to Clifton Chamberlain, Dec. 22, 1874 ; Franklin J., born in 1860, who died in 1863 ; and Jesse A., born in 1862, and whose death, the result of diphtheria, also occurred in 1863. Mr. Ross was for merly a Democrat, but espoused the principles of the Re publican party in 1860. daughter of Daniel and Hannah Finch Stone, and was born Feb. 11, 1833, in Oswego Co., N. Y., and in 1834 re moved with the family, by way of Erie Canal and Lake Erie, to Portage Co., Ohio, and in 1843, with her parents, brother James S. Stone, now a resident of Kewanee, 111., and sister Harriet, now Mrs. Stephen Gardner, and resi dent of this town, emigrated to Shiawassee Co., Mich., performing the journey in a covered wagon, and passing through what was then known as Maumee Swamp. She afterwards resided for some years in Erie Co , Pa., and re moved from there to Allegan Co., Mich., in 1856. Both himself and wife were originally Baptists in faith, but have more recently connected themselves with the Seventh-Day Adventists, who have a flourishing society in Monterey. JAMES McALPINE. Mr. Lay's fine orchards and large productive fields have amassed to him wealth ; while his extensive dealing in agricultural implements has made him very generally known throughout the county and adjoining towns. The Empire State seems to have been the home not only but the permanent abiding-place of the McAlpiue family previous to the arrival of the subject of the present biog raphy in Michigan. His father, William McAlpine, was born in 1792, and died in 1867. His mother, Lydia, whose birth occurred about 1790, died iu 1869, both having re mained in their native State of New York all their lives. LEONARD ROSS. Among the pioneers of Monterey meriting conspicuous mention is Leonard Ross, a native of the State of New York. He was the eldest in a family of six children of Huram and Nancy Bidwell Ross, the former of whom was born July 3, 1796, in Vermont, and died Aug. 8, 1866, in Monterey ; the fitter's birth occurred April 3, 1798, and her decease took place in January, 1858. The birth of their son Leonard occurred during their residence in Ban gor, Franklin Co., N. Y., April 25, 1821. He remained at home during tbe early years of his life, and aided his father in the improvement of his land. In 1837 the latter gentleman determined to cast his fortunes with the Mich igan pioneers, and purchased the south half of the south east quarter of section 28, in Monterey, upon which his son, the subject of this biography, still resides. Of their five children, James was born in Windham, Greene Co., N. Y., Sept. 6, 1820, and at the age of eleven years departed from the paternal roof and sought employ ment abroad, his father receiving the proceeds of his labor. At the age of twenty he married Lucinda M. Granger, who was born Oct. 17, 1819, in Sodus, Wayne Co., N. Y., and was the sixth of a family of ten children. Her father, Noble Granger, was a native of the Bay State, as was also her mother, both bearing the family name of Granger, though not related. James McAlpine after his marriage spent some time in agricultural pursuits in his native State, first in Ontario County, and later in Monroe County, where he cultivated farms on shares. In 1845 he came to Michigan on a pros pecting-tour. Having been favorably impressed with the soil of Monterey, he purchased land in that township, and later returned for his wife and child. On their arrival in Michigan they found a hospitable welcome at the house or Flasky Atwell, a near neighbor, until a substantial frame house could be erected by Mr. McAlpine on his recent purchase, to which they removed Nov. 25, 1845. The details of the journey from their Eastern home, the adventures they encountered, and the discouragements they met are too voluminous to come within the province of a brief sketch of this character. They were subjected, how ever, to all the privations common to pioneer life which are recounted in the pages of this volume, braved all dangers, were indifferent to obstacles, and ultimately arrived at their destination, where they were comfortably settled in a house erected by Mr. Ross and his son. On the 10th of August, 1848, Leonard Ross was married to Miss Laura Ann Tan ner, daughter of Joseph and Lydia Kenyon Tanner, their daughter having been born in Granville, Washington Co., N. Y., Aug. 27, 1820, and was the oldest in a family of nine children. The father of Mrs. Ross claimed the same village as a birthplace in the year 1799, and died in Monterey at the age of seventy-three years. The mother, also a native of the Empire State, died Oct. 17, 1856, in her fifty-sixth year. The home of Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Ross has been cheered by the presence of seven children. Myron A. Ross was born June 23, 1849, and married April 20, 1873, to Miss Mida Jane Brewer ; Mary M. was born July 26, 1851, and married in Decem ber of 1874 Nelson M. Bartlett ; Harris Earl, whose birth occurred Oct. 23, 1853, and his marriage to Miss Orsa Goblie, Oct. 22, 1875 ; Seth Adelbert, who was born March 31, 1856, and married to Miss E. Barber, April 14, 1877 ; Emma Jane Ross, whose birth occurred May After his arrival, thirty dollars was the cash balance re maining with which to engage in the work of improvement. However, Mr. McAlpine was equal to the emergency. Em ployment was found in the immediate vicinity, which en abled him to provide for the wants of the household, while the intervals were devoted to cultivating the land and se curing crops which should afford them a subsistence. By industry and excellent judgment this land was soon con verted into the productive farm upon which he now resides. Mr. McAlpine's political convictions have caused him to affiliate with the Democratic party. He has devoted much time to the interests of the township, and held many im portant public trusts. Mr. and Mrs. McAlpine have had three children, the first of whom, Martin V. B., was born June 23, 1843; William Noble's birth occurred Nov. 23, 1849, and his death in October, 1853 ; Henry C. was born Feb. 24, 1856 ; he is still residing with his parents, while the elder son is married and located near them. These children have each been educated in the faith of their parents, \u2014 that of the Methodist denomination."], [405, "Residence of J A M ES M.

He has occupied in succession the various offices of road commissioner, township treasurer, and justice of the peace in Monterey, each of which posi tions he has filled with ability and credit. The progenitor of the Sabin family in Monterey was Ziba Sabin, who was born in the State of Massachusetts in 1784, and in July, 1809, married Miss Hannah Phillips, who was a native of the State of New York, where she was born in 1788. Mr. Sabin's death occurred in 1847, while his wife survived until 1868, and died in Monterey. A family of four children graced their home, \u2014 Hiram, whose brief biography is here traced ; Oliver, who is a resident of New York State ; and two daughters, Eunice and Clarissa, both residents of Allegan County. Hiram Sabin was born in Plymouth, Chenango Co., N. Y., Feb. 21, 1815, and during his early life assisted his father upon the farm. At the age of twenty he became ambitious for a wider, and at the same time more independent, field of usefulness, and departed for Michigan, reaching Allegan in November, 1835. Here he found a village projected, and aided in the first clearing of the ground upon which it was subsequently built. In March, 1836, be entered the land embraced in his present farm, described as the east half of northwest quarter of section 22. He began in 1839 the clearing of this tract, and in the winter of 1842-43 erected a house, to which, in February, 1843, he brought his wife, who was formerly Miss Deidamia, daughter of Josiah and Sarah Potter, natives of New Hampshire. Mrs. Sabin came to Michigan in 1837, having been at- tracted thither by the presence of her sister, Mrs. William Allen, who was a resident of Allegan. Mr. and Mrs. Sabin have four children : Sarah H. was born July 20, 1844, and is married to Noah Briggs, of Monterey; Martha D., whose birth occurred May 16, 1847, and is the wife of Morris Price, of Isabella Co., Mich. ; Harlan I., born Oct. 15, 1851 ; and Hattie A. Sabin, born Aug. 27, 1859. The two latter remain at home with their parents. Mr. Sabin is an earnest Democrat in his political convictions, and has been all his life active in the public Since their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Sabin have been de voted members of the Presbyterian Church, and have ex emplified in their lives the teachings of the faith they espoused. He has always been a strong advocate of tem perance and its principles. This rare unity and consistency of character have gained for them the affection and respect of all who know them. CALEB F. KENYON. The father of tbe gentleman who is the subject of this biography was Elijah Kenyon, who was born in Rhode Island in 1793, and died in 1875, reaching the good old age of eighty-two years. He married first Miss Hannah Calkins, of Vermont, who died, as nearly as can be de termined, in 1824, and later Miss Mary Briggs. From the first marriage there were three children, one of whom was Caleb F. Kenyon, who was born in Vermont, Feb. 8, 1822. Six children blessed the latter union, and Mrs. Kenyon still survives and resides in Monterey. Caleb F., early having a desire to fulfill the duties of a faithful son, remained with his father until twenty-one years of age, having accompa nied him to Ohio in 1832. The two following years after having attained his majority he devoted to chopping and clearing land. He was married May 22, 1845, to Miss Jane Eggleston, daughter of Newell and Mary Eggleston, who was born July 12, 1828, in Ohio, and was the first in a family of seven children, \u2014 two boys and five girls. Caleb and Jane were married in the village of Medina, Ohio. Her father died iu 1S71 ; the mother is still living, and resides at Battle Creek, Michigan. After his marriage Mr. Kenyon purchased cattle, and"], [408, "292 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. conducted the business of a butcher for three years in the county of Cuyahoga, Ohio; and in the year 1850 he came with his family to Michigan, and purchased eighty acres of land on section 20, and later exchanged it for their attrac tive home. Coming into the country at an early day, they endured the many privations and hardships of a pioneer life, the entire township being nearly a wilderness. They have had seven children ; four of them died in infancy, and the survivors are Hiram, born April 27, 1846, and was married to Katie Johnson, of Allegan, Oct. 6, 1874, the latter of whom died Oct. 17, 1878 ; and Freeman, born April 6, 1850, and was married to Inez Pierce, the only child of Horace and Harriet Pierce, March 30, 1876, and is now living opposite the homestead ; and Almedu, who was born April 29, 1857, and is now married to E. F. Ferris, and liviug at Grand Traverse. In politics Mr. Kenyon is a Re publican. They are respected citizens, and by economy and patient industry have acquired a sufficient competency for their declining years. subsequently attended the Kinsman Academy, in Trumbull Co., Ohio, for one term. The two years following he was employed by the month on a dairy-farm. He inherited from his father a tract of land of about fifty acres, located in Ohio ; this he traded July 4, 1851, for one hundred and sixty acres, the northeast quarter of section 25, in Mon terey township, Allegan Co., Mich. In the month of Oc tober following he visited Michigan, looked at his new possessions, and returned to Ohio, being but nine days absent from home. In November, 1852, he came to Monterey, Mich., and, boarding with Horace Wilson, commenced chopping on his own place. He did not commence the clearing until 1854, which year he planted two acres of corn and twenty-four of wheat. In 1855 he harvested six hundred and ten bushels, as the yield of twenty-four acres, the seed being dragged in without plowing. He married, Dec. 20, 1855, Mary Louisa Wilson, daughter of Horace Wilson, an early settler (who cleared the village plat in Allegan in 1836). Mr. Thorn had raised a log house the November previous, and soon after his marriage moved into it ; this remained his humble home until De cember, 1869, when he moved into his present residence. Mr. and Mrs. Thorn have had but one child, which is de ceased. Mr. Thorn is a Republican in politics, \"first, last, aud always.\" Both himself and his wife are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He is now, as he has always been, active iu all the material interests of the town in which he lives. JOSEPH THORN. Joseph Thorn was born in Liberty, Trumbull Co., Ohio, May 16, 1830. His father died when he was but two months old. Joseph remained with his mother, on the farm, until he was twenty-one years of age, attending the district school winters. When he had attained his nine teenth year his time was given him by his stepfather. He OTSEGO.* This township, prominent as the seat of the first im portant settlement in the county of Allegan, derives its name from Otsego Co., N. Y., and embraces territory designated in the original survey as township No. 1 north, of range No. 12 west. township. It has been, and ever will be, the most import ant natural feature of Otsego. Its descent and flow are rapid. High banks on either side keep it within its channel at the highest stage, and by means of dams and artificial chan nels at the village of Otsego excellent water-power privileges are secured, which are among the best in the State of Mich igan. Gun River enters the township by crossing the east line of section 13, and after flowing one mile to the south west empties into the Kalamazoo. It is situated on the southern border of the county, east of the centre, is bounded on the south by Kalamazoo County, and for about a mile in the southwest corner by Van Buren County ; on the north, east, and west it is bounded by the townships of Watson, Gun Plain, and Trowbridge, respect ively, in Allegan County. Schnable Brook comes in from Watson township, and, flowing to the southwest for a distance of some two miles, pours its waters into the Kalamazoo, near the centre of section 7. Pine Creek enters the township near the south west corner, and, taking a northeasterly direction, empties into the Kalamazoo River on section 21. Its surface is generally rolling, and originally that part north of the Kalamazoo River was covered with dense forests of beech, maple, oak, ash, whitewood, lynn, black walnut, and many other deciduous varieties. Along Pine Creek were many acres of handsome pines, while to the eastward of the same, and south of the Kalamazoo, was an extensive tract of oak-openings. The soil of Otsego is excellent. It is well adapted to grazing, and in the cultivation of fruit, corn, and cereals the inhabitants are very successful. The Kalamazoo and Gun Rivers, Schnable Brook, and Pine Creek are its principal water-courses. The former river, in its course towards Lake Michigan, passes from east to west, bearing a little north, through the central part of the EARLY HISTORY. ORIGINAL SURA'EYS, The first survey-party to visit this region was led by John Mullett, of Detroit, who, as deputy United States sur veyor, ran out the east boundary-line of this township, as * By J.

Among those men who traversed and looked over a large portion of this county prior to the first settlement were Giles Scott and the Sherwoods, of Rochester, N.

They were here during the winter of 1829 and 1830, and explored the Kalamazoo River and its tributaries, look ing for mill-sites, and for pine tracts in their immediate vicinity ; likewise for good farming-lands. Of all the region examined, this locality suited them best. They returned to their homes early in the spring of 1830, and we may believe that during the intervening months all due preparations were made for the removal of themselves and families, and their permanent settlement in the then wild Territory of Michigan.

Giles Scott,* the son-in-law of Hull Sherwood, Sr., seems to have eclipsed all others in his preparations, for we find that, accompanied by his wife and one or two small children, he arrived at the mouth of Pine Creek early in the fall of 1830, and constructed a small log house, described by Lucius Lyon in January, 1831, as situated \"on the bottom-lands, about ten chains back from the river.\" Edmund Sherwood, son of Hull, Sr., then a boy of fourteen years, came with Mr. Scott, and probably some other members of the Sherwood family. Their place of settlement was on the north part of tbe southwest quarter of section 21, and was held by right of pre-emption until the lands of this town ship came into the market, in September, 1832. Mr. Scott was a genial spirit among the early pioneers, an excellent fiddler, and many \" hoe-downs\" were tripped o'er his punch eon floor by the lads and lasses of early times. He built a tavern at Pine Creek in 1836, over which he presided until his death. Section 26. \u2014 Horace H. Comstock, Michigan, July, 1824; Orsamus Eaton, Monroe Co., N.

(See history of Gun Plain.) It was immediately rebuilt by Mr. Aldrich, and was then operated by Orlando AA^eed prior to his removal to the Gun Plain settlement."], [411, "OTSEGO TOWNSHIP, 295 on Pine Creek, one mile from its mouth. It was completed in the spring of 1831, and probably cut the first lumber in all Western Michigan. Uri Baker, now a resident of Mar tin township, came in with Mr. Aldrich ; also Sloan Eaton, a Mr. Hill, and John B. Yeomans. the journey was continued, via Gull Prairie, to the forest home on the banks of the Kalamazoo, where all arrived safely in the fall of 1831. \u00a7 Dr. Foster pre-empted a large portion of section 23, and built his first house on the south bank of the river, in rear of the Lutkins House. During the fall of 1831, Hull Sherwood moved in with the remainder of his numerous family. He came from Rochester, Monroe Co., N. Y., and was accompanied by his married sons Eber Sherwood, Hull Sherwood, Jr., and Royal Sherwood, with their families, Lebbeus Sherwood, an unmarried son, and a young man named J. McCormick, now a resident of Gun Plain township. The Sherwoods also settled near the mouth of Pine Creek, and, assisted by Mr. Scott, commenced building a dam and saw-mill at the mouth of that creek. Their saw-mill was completed in the winter of 1831-32, and was followed in 1834 by a grist mill,* of which J. Volentine was the master-mechanic. After his settlement here he gave up the practice of medicine, devoting bis time and energies principally to farming. In 1832 he was appointed the first justice of the peace and the first postmaster in the territory now com prising the county of Allegan. His house was the rally ing-point for all important meetings of the early pioneers, and he was one of Otsego's most prominent citizens. During the year 1832 the settlement thus commenced was still further increased by the arrival of Charles Miles, the first supervisor elected in the county, and a most prom inent man at an early day in many other respects ; Martin W. Rowe, an early merchant, and the first constable and collector in the county ; Abijah Chichester, one of the first township officials ; A. L. Cotton, who came here first as one of Lyon's surveying-party, and afterwards married one of Hull Sherwood's daughters ; John L. Shearer, who served as one of the first inspectors of election in 1833, and was afterwards prominent as an official in the township and county ; and Warren Caswell. For some two or three years the settlement at the mouth of Pine Creek was the most important one in the county, and a village known as New Rochester was platted by Hull Sherwood at a very early day. Here were established the first grist-mills, stores, shops, etc., and doubtless Mr. Sher wood secretly entertained the hope that some day the little hamlet might emulate, if it did not rival, its great name sake. This was the year of the celebrated Sauk or Black-Hawk war, and the few white families then settled at Pine Creek, at the rapids || of the Kalamazoo, aud in the Gun Plain neighborhood were kept in a fearful state of suspense and trepidation during the early summer, while awaiting the decision of the surrounding bands of Ottawa and Potta wattumie Indians whether they were for war as allies of Black Hawk, or for peace and the friends of the Michigan pioneers. At a council of several days' duration, held on Gun Plains, the Indians at last decided to remain quiet and peaceable, and thereafter no trouble was apprehended or experienced by the whites at their hands. Meantime, while the excitement was at its height, a worthless half breed named Pricket or Picket, then living near the mouth of Gun River, assured his white neighbors again and again that the Indians meant mischief, that they were bent on war, and advised the settlers to fly with their families from the country and avoid massacre. As it proved, he belied the dusky race with whom he was connected. His purpose was supposed to be to inaugurate a precipitate flight of the whites, and afterwards appropriate to himself such articles as they might leave behind. The next family to settle in the township, and the first on the site of the present village of Otsego, was that of Dr. Samuel Foster. Dr. Foster was a native of the State of Maine. Early in life he removed to Vermont, and there married Miss Pamelia Camp, of Barre. He was a regu larly educated physician, and practiced his profession in Montgomery, Franklin Co., Vt., until his removal to the State of Michigan. He was accompanied here by his wife and the following-named children,']' Samuel D., Gould O, Pamelia, Betsey, Benjamin W., George H., and Everissa, and by Norman Davis, a young unmarried man. Dr. Fos ter's youngest child, Albert R., the first child born in the village of Otsego, was ushered into this troublesome world during the year 1834. The trials and vexations ex perienced by Dr. Foster and his family in their removal to and settlement in Otsego were about the same as attended all Michigan pioneers of that date. They and their house hold goods, farming implements, etc., were conveyed on boats, via the Erie Canal and Lake Erie, to Detroit. In the latter city the doctor bought a yoke of oxen, some In dian ponies, and a wagon, and after all his goods and the younger members of the family were snugly arranged therein he started westward along the Territorial road. But very few white families were seen after passing Ann Arbor. At Battle Creek a halt was made, while Mr. Fos ter and his party erected two log houses.^ From there *J There seems to be some discrepancy in the statement made by Mr. S. D. Foster concerning tbe date of his father's settlement here and the transcribed field-notes of Lucius Lyon's original survey and subdivision of the township. Under date of Jan. 27, 1831, Mr Lyon says: \"In section twenty-three, opposite Foster's house, is a spring, and the river here is very rapid.\" Therefore, of the three queries, \u2014 viz., whether Mr. Foster built his house during his first visit to Michi gan, whether he settled here in the fall of 1S30, instead of 1S31, or whether a mistake has been made in transcribing the original field notes of Mr. Lyon, and that tbe date should be Jan. 27, 1S32, instead of Jan. 27, 1831, \u2014 we cannot undertake to answer either. Mr. S. D. Foster avers that after their settlement Mr. Lyons and his surveying partv were here at work. This may be true, and yet Lyon may have been doiug unfinished work in adjoining townships while mak ing his headquarters here in the settlement. \u2022 Oka Town and three other men went with four ox-teams to De troit to procure the iron and machinery for this mill, the trip requir ing three weeks' time. This mill for several years supplied a wide oxtent of country. It was strongly built, and having since been repaired and enlarged, is still at work. t These children all grew to manhood and womanhood, married, and became heads of families, except Benjamin AV., who was drowned, at the age of thirteen years, in the Kalamazoo River. | These houses wero built for Messrs. Guernsey and Converse, and were the first buildings erected at Battle Creek. Now Otsego."], [412, "296 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. In September of the same year the lands of this town ship were placed upon the market. The choicest tracts soon found purchasers, and from that time the population and importance of these heretofore outlying settlements rapidly increased. By an understanding with Horace H. Comstock, formerly a resident of Otsego Co., N. Y., the lands pre-empted by Dr. Foster were entered in the name of the former. following table shows the names of all who were then assessed as resident tax-payers, also the number of acres owned and the value of real and personal estate possessed by each at that time. Albert Eldred, acres, 80; value of real estate, $320; value of personal estate, $80 ; total value of real and personal estate, $400. John AVeare, acres, 280 ; value of real estate, $1120 ; value of personal estate, $320; total value of real and personal estate, $1440. Oka Town, acres, 100; value of real estate, $400; value of personal estate, $77; total value of real and personal estate, $477. The event of 1833 was the organization of the township of Allegan and the election of township officers. The first meeting was held at the house of Samuel Foster, and, as the electors all resided in the present townships of Otsego and Gun Plain, tbe full proceedings of this and subsequent meetings held before the subdivision of Allegan into four townships will be found upon succeeding pages.

Samuel Foster, in the village; value of real estate, $1500; value of personal estate, $345 ; total value of real and personal estate, $1845. Among the settlers of 1834 was Oka Town, from Ver mont. He was elected an assessor in the spring of 1835, was appointed the first probate judge of Allegan County the same year, was chosen a justice of the peace in 1836, and a supervisor in 1837, and has since most worthily filled many other positions of trust and honor. And noAV, after forty-six years of continuous residence in the township, he still remains one of its most active and prominent citizens. Randall Crosby also settled here in 1 834. S. D.

Coats, the first practicing physician, and the first school-teacher to reside in the county, settled on the site of Otsego village in the fall of 1833, where he soon after erected the first framed house. He was thoroughly educated, was a successful physician, and most efficiently served both his township and county in many responsible civic positions. Eber Sherwood, acres, 359; value of real estate, $1486; value of personal estate, $230 ; total value of real and personal estate, $1716.

Albert Eldred, from Vermont, Jeremy Lindsley, from Monroe Co., N. Y., who still resides upon the land pur chased by him in October, 1834, and Orsamus Eaton, from the same place, also settled here in 1834. Mr. Eaton established the first store* at Pine Creek immediately after his settlement. Orsamus Eaton, acres, 80; value of real estate, $320; value of per- sonal estate, $15; total value of real and personal estate, $335.

Scott, son of Giles, who was born in the winter of 1830-31, and died three years later, was the first child born in the township. The first female child was Amanda, a daughter of Eber Sherwood, born in November, 1S32. The first marriage was that of John B. Yeomans to Miss Aldrich, a daughter of Turner Aldrich, in the spring of 1831. The first bridge across tbe Kalamazoo was built at Pine Creek in 1835; the first at Otsego in 1836. Oka Town assisted to build both, also the one at Plainwell, and all were constructed with money contributed by the people, no taxes being levied. Samuel Town built the first framed dwelliug at Pine Creek ; Dr. L. B. Coats the first at Otsego. Eber Sherwood sold the first goods in toAvn at Pine Creek in 1832. Royal Sherwood and John L. Shearer were also early merchants there. Elisha Belcher, who settled soon after 1840, was the first resident attorney in the township. Samuel D. Foster carried the first mail in 1832, which was received once a week from Kalamazoo. After the Allegan office was established he bought a team of horses and wagon, and made semi-weekly trips between Allegan and Kalamazoo, carrying the mails and passengers. \" Inspectors of Election.

The village of Otsego, an incorporated municipality of some 1200 inhabitants, is an important station on the line of the Kalamazoo division of the Lake-Shore and Michi gan Southern Railway, and is pleasantly located on the Kalamazoo River, which here flows rapidly to the west ward. ITS EARLY HISTORY. As already mentioned, Samuel Foster and his family were the first settlers upon the village site, locating here in the fall of 1831. About one year later, by an understanding with Samuel Foster, who pre-empted it, Horace H. Com stock purchased the land from the general government, and through his influence a post-office named Otsego was soon after established, Dr. Foster becoming the postmaster. Mr. Comstock was a native of Otsego Co., N. Y. He came to the Territory of Michigan in 1831 or 1832, and during the early days of both this and Kalamazoo County he was a most prominent actor, and operated largely in purchasing lands, platting villages, erecting mills, store-houses, dwell ings, etc. The surface on the south side rises some fifteen feet above the river, and, stretching back to the southward, presents a beautiful level plain, \u2014 lands denominated by the pioneers \" oak-openings.\" Here was established the original village plat. On the north side, after going back some forty rods from the stream, the land rises into a considerable hill ele vation, furnishing unsurpassed sites for private residences and abundant opportunities for lawn and landscape garden ing. This elevation, too, upon which is located the ceme tery,* one of the most beautiful places of interment in the county, gives a wide panoramic view of the village and of the surrounding country for miles in either direction. Min eral springs famous for their medicinal properties are also located on the north side of the river. It seems that he early contemplated using the magnifi cent water-power privileges here afforded by the Kalamazoo, and the establishment of a village upon its banks, and in furtherance of this plan obtained the enactment of the following law : The streets are broad and well shaded. Allegan Street is seven rods wide, another is six rods wide, while nearly \"Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislative Council of the Territory f H. Hall operates a flouring-mill two miles west of the village, and Messrs. Higgins & Scott another, four miles southwest of the same place. * A little burial-place on the banks of Pine Creek contains the remains of many of the early settlers."], [419, "OTSEGO TOWNSHIP. 303 of Michigan, That Horace H. Comstock and his heirs and assigns be and they are hereby authorized to build a dam across the Kalamazoo River at Otsego, in the county of Allegan. cess of Mr. Comstock's enterprise. But the crowning event of the year was the survey and plattin^ of the vil lage of Otsego.f This was completed on the 22d day of December, 1836, by 0. J. Wilder, surveyor. The map of this plat shows the bridge, dam, and mill-race, and a \" bed of first-rate iron ore\" on the north bank of the river, some forty rods above the bridge. Also roads leading to Portsmouth, Kalamazoo, Paw Paw, to the mouth of the Kalamazoo, and to the rapids of Grand River. \"Section 2. The said dam shall not exceed five feet in height above common low water, and shall contain a convenient lock for the pass age of boats, barges, canoes, rafts, or other water craft, not less than seventy-five feet in length and fourteen feet in width, and shall be so constructed as to receive boats in slack water of sufficient depth below the ripple, and pass them to slack water above the ripple, for all the purposes of navigation on said river. \"Section 3. It shall be the duty of the owners of said dam, at all times, after the building of the same shall have been so far prosecuted as to obstruct tbe navigation of said river, to keep said lock in repair, and to pass any water craft or raft which can be admitted therein through the same without any unnecessary delay, free of all toll; and the said owners of ssiid dam bhall be liable to the owner or master of any water craft or raft, in double the amount of such damages such owner or master may sustain from any unnecessary detention of said water craft or raft at said lock, to be recovered, with cost of suit, be fore any court having competent jurisdiction. The surveyor says, \u2014 \"This town is laid on the south side of the river, on section 23, in township No. 1 north, of range No. 12 west. Allegan Street is seven rods wide, Wilmot is six rods wide, and all the others are five.\" Other streets were named Court, Orleans, Franklin, Morell, Hammond, Kalamazoo, Farmer, Fair, and Platt. In another \" note\" we learn that \u2014 \"Section 4. Any person who shall destroy or in any wise injure said lock or dam shall be deemed to have committed a trespass upon the owners thereof, and liable accordingly ; and any person who shall willfully and maliciously destroy or injure the said lock or dam shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction be punishable \"This town is situated on the rapids of the Kalamazoo River, im mediately below its junction with Gun River, and at the head of steamboat navigation.

Nothing herein contained shall authorize the individual named in the first setion of this act, or his heirs and assigns, to enter upon or flow the lands of any person without the consent of such per son ; and the Legislature may at any time so alter or amend this act as to provide for the further improvement of the navigation of the said Kalamazoo River. Samuel D.Foster began selling goods in the latter part of 1836. Roswell Crane took charge of the saw-mill in 1837, and built the Exchange Hotel for Mr. Comstock the same year. The hotel was then managed by Mr. Comstock for a few months, after which Mr. Crane assumed control of it. The first flouring-mill was built by Mr. Comstock in 1839. The resident tax-payers of 1840 have been mentioned in preceding pages, also a large majority of all other early settlers who settled subsequently; to them the reader is referred. \"Approved March 28, 1835.\" During the next year (1836) a dam, mill-race, and saw mil! were constructed. A bridge was built across the river at this point. The Buckleys were selling goods.

THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH IN OTSEGO .f This body dates its history from the formation of the First Baptist Church in Plainfield, which was organized at the house of Silas Dunham in Plainfield^ (now Gun Plain) Dec . 26, 1 835. The names of the constituent members were Silas Dunham, Curtis Brigham, S. Calkins, Elisha B. Seely, James Calkins, Alfred S. Dunham, Edwin S. Dunham, Tirza Dunham, Lydia Brigham, Joanna Calkins, Sarah Seely, and Matilda Calkins. Their meetings during the first few years were held at different points over the wide field which this church then covered, \u2014 sometimes in the Gun Plain school-house, sometimes at the dwellings and school-houses in Cooper, in Otsego, and in Allegan, \u2014 Otsego being made the central point and permanent location in 1842. The first newspaper established in the county, the Alle gan County Democrat, was published at Otsego, by Moses Hawks, April 12, 1842. It was removed to Allegan soon aster. Several other newspaper enterprises have originated here, which are mentioned in Chapter XX. of the general history. Dr. Foster continued as postmaster until about 1840. Dr. Coats succeeded him, aud he in turn was succeeded by Willard G. Eaton* Although the village suffered severely by fire in June, 1863, also in 1875, and again in December, 1877, it pos sesses no fire department or water supply that is at all effi cient or worthy of notice. The first pastor was Elder Jeremiah Hall, who was the moderator of the council held Feb. 4, 1836, for the recognition of the church. After Elder Hall, Elder Harvey Munger was pastor for several years, preaching only a portion of the time. Deacon Curtis Brigham, though not an ordained minister, preached acceptably during the early years of the society's history. Elder William A. Bronson was called to the pastorate June 24, 1844, and served about one year. Elder Harvey Munger followed him. In 1851, Rev. A. M. Buck became the pastor, and resigned in 1857. Rev. H. Stanwood was called in 1858, and served one year. Rev. A. M. Buck was recalled in April, 1859, and resigned in December, 1863. Rev. 0. S. Wolfe was called in 1864, served until August, 1864, and was succeeded by Rev. H. B. Tast in November of the same year, who remained one year. Rev. A. M. Buck was again called in November, 1872, and is the present incumbent. INCORPORATION. By an act of the State Legislature approved March 15, 1865, the territory described in the act was incorporated as the village of Otsego. The first charter election was held in the boot-and-shoe store of A. W. Blackmond, on the 15th of April, 1865, and the president, trustees, and marshal then elected were as follows : Willard Higgins, President ; William H. Ingram, Franklin Chadsey, Ethan Allen, Lenora Foster, Henry C. Houghton, Wilson C. Edsell, Trustees ; Byron Ballou, Marshal. The following officers have been subsequently elected : 1866. \u2014 William H. Ingram, President; Myron McCorn, Joseph H. Chapman, Edwin M.

Botsford, Marshal. 1868. \u2014 Willard Higgins, President; Norman L. Travis, James Clark, John M. Cloud, Trustees ; M. G. Higgins, Marshal. This was the mother-church in Allegan County, and was probably the first church of any denomination formed within its limits. In December, 1840, a branch was set off to form a church in Cooper. In January, 1841, a branch was set off to form the Baptist Church in Allegan. In April, 1864, a branch was set off to form a church in Trowbridge, and in May of the same year another branch was set off to organize the present Baptist Church in Plain well. 1869. \u2014 Willard Higgins, President; Chester M.

This gentleman, whose name is so prominently associated with the history of Otsego and Allegan Counties, was born in Bradford Co., Pa., July 8, 1814. The family are of German-American origin. His parents were natives of New York and Connecticut, and reared a family of nine children. The elder Edsell was a farmer, and his family were brought up to habits of industry and thrift. Our subject's advantages for education were confined to the common schools of that day, but his though (fulness and close observation made amends for other deficiencies. At the a<re of eighteen he was apprenticed to the vocation of a carpenter and joiner, and upon attaining his majority he Their first meetings were held at the house of George Leighton. In June, 1863, Elder M. E. Cornell held a successful series of tent-meetings at a point not far away from their present house of worship. Their church edifice is of brick, and situated on Farmer Street, in the village of Otsego. It was erected in 1867. The members of this organization number 74 at the present time. -*- From data furnished by Dr. S. W. Thompson. j Name changed to Ots.go Lodge in 1S73. j} From data furnished by Silas Philley.

In 1835 he started West, stopping at Cleveland to recruit his finances ; leaving Cleveland, he went to Sandusky, and entered the employ of George Lawton, a successful mill-builder, with whom he remained four years. He gained the reputation of a faith ful, competent workman, and spent his leisure time in study ing Nicholson's \" Operative Mechanics,\" chemistry, natural philosophy, drawing, and history. In 1839 he built a large flouring-mill at Monroeville, Ohio. Here also he met his destiny in Miss Julia A., daughter of David Cleck, Esq., whom he married the following year. Soon after their mar riage they entered Oberliu College, and began a four years' course. In 1844 they joined a colony of thirty persons, who emigrated from Oberlin to Olivet, Mich., for the pur pose of establishing a similar college at that place, where Mr. Edsell, in company with Rev. John J. Shipard, founder of Oberlin College, Carlos Reed, and William Hesford, pur chased about twelve hundred acres of land for college, mill, and kindred purposes. Mr. Edsell was made treasurer, sec retary, and trustee, and pushed forward the work amid many discouragements until it had gained a firm hold upon the confidence of the people. Its admirable discipline and su perior educational advantages now render it a power for good, and much of its after-success is attributable to the self-sacrifice and untiring energy of its first secretary. In 1849, Mr. Edsell removed to Otsego, where his energy and ability were soon recognized. He was admitted to practice in all the State courts, was justice of the peace sixteen years, trustee of the State Asylum for the Insane, and twice elected member of the State Senate. As a jurist he mani fested clearness of perception, sound common sense, and in defatigable perseverance. In 1870 he was admitted to practice in the United States courts, thus proving that though advanced in years he is both aggressive and progres sive. He has not confined his efforts solely to the practice of his profession, but has been one of the largest real-es tate owners in the county, and in 1869 he, in company with H. N. Peck, established the first banking-house in Otsego. In 1866, Mrs. Edsell died. She was a lady of refinement and education, and esteemed highly. She was the mother of four children, two of whom are still living, \u2014 Chas. W., of the firm of W. C. Edsell & Son, and Sarah, wife of H. N. Peck. In 1867 he was again mar ried, to Mrs. Clara Hughes, of Kalamazoo. By the last union one daughter, Esther, was born. The salient points in the character of Mr. Edsell are industry and economy, to which he attributes his success. Starting in at twenty one with only his natural resources and five dollars, he has attained success in all departments of life. He is one of whom the Latin phrase \"Faber su\u00e6 fortunse\" is eminently true. In his political and religious convictions he is a Re publican and a Congregationalist. Socially, he is genial and courteous, and his hospitality and good nature are pro verbial. He possesses that quality of bearing and manner, united with a fine presence, which not only favorably im presses the stranger, but endears him to those who enjoy his society. Public spirited in the fullest sense of the word, he is one of those whose identification with any community is always productive of good. Among the most prominent things of his life-work, as well as being the most satisfactory to himself, are, he says, the following : The pleasure and satisfaction of assisting and taking care of his aged mother, who lived to be ninety four years old ; the part he took in the sounding and es tablishing of the Olivet College ; and his untiring efforts in the anti-slavery cause, and the organization and perpetuity of the Republican party. OVERISEL; This is one of the three townships of Allegan County populated chiefly by Hollanders, and may, perhaps, be re garded as the stronghold of the people of that nationality in the county. It is described iu the United States survey as township 4 north, of range 14 west, being bounded on the north by Ottawa County, south by Heath, east by Salem, and west by Fillmore. that regard, different from most of the townships of Allegan County. Rabbit River, which makes its way, with many windings, through the southeastern portion, enters the township from Salem on section 25, flows southwestward, and passes out into Heath on the southern line of section 34. This stream is fed by several small creeks, which rise in the northern portion of the township, while the tributaries of the Black River water the northwestern corner of the township. The surface of Overisel is quite varied, the elevations in the southeastern portion often reaching the dignity of hills, while in the centre the slopes are more gentle. There are a few swamps, so small, however, as not materially to lessen the value of that district. The northern and southwestern portions are level and productive, and afford many advan tages to the agriculturist. A considerable portion of the soil of Overisel is a sandy loam, while in many localities a strong clay loam abounds and in others the clay is mixed with gravel, a composition which produces as good crops as are to be found anywhere in Allegan County. No lakes diversify the surface of Overisel, which is, in Wheat finds a congenial soil in Overisel, the average crop being quite equal to that of neighboring townships.

Seven hundred and forty-six acres of corn had produced 26,059 bushels of that cereal, while of other grains 19,224 bushels had been raised.

Bolks, embarked from Holland for the hospitable shores of America. They remained a year in the State of New York, and during this interval Rev. Mr. Bolks came to Western Michigan, a larger colony of his countrymen having located in the southern part of Ottawa County a short time before* He first determined upon Fillmore as a location for his colony, but finally de cided on Overisel. His followers met a cordial welcome from the colony of Hollanders who had already established themselves in Hol * See Chapter XII. of the general history. On nearly all the farms there are fine orchards, which generally produce very fine apples, that fruit being the one principally in favor among the Hollanders. There are very few peach-trees, hardly any one raising more peaches than are desired for home consumption. The timber of Overisel embraces most varieties found elsewhere in the county. Beech and maple are the staple woods, while ash, elm, hemlock, and pine also abound. The last-named timber is principally found along the bor ders of Rabbit River, though most of what formerly grew there has been used for building or exported. The population of Overisel is chiefly composed of Hol landers, who emigrated from their native land direct to Michigan, though a small band of settlers of American de scent are found in the southeastern portion. The industry, order, and neatness of this people are apparent even in a hasty survey of the township. The lands are mostly well improved and substantially fenced, while comfortable dwell ings of brick or wood, together with capacious barns and out-buildings, are seen on nearly every farm. The popula tion has increased materially since the census of 1874, and is now estimated to exceed 2000 persons. The hospitality and civility which are marked character istics of the Dutch race are fully maintained by the people of Overisel, as the writer can most willingly testify. There was only a single exception to the courtesy and friendliness with which he was received. There is among the Holland ers of this township but little rotation in office. Those who have filled positions of trust with ability and integrity are secure in their tenure of office, and are but slightly affected by political changes, as may be seen by a glance at the list of officers which closes the township history.

Here they remained until log houses could be constructed on the ground they had selected for each family, when they imme diately moved into them. The colonists brought with them Holland gold, with which they desired Dominie Bolks to enter 2000 acres of land at Ionia, Mich., where the land office for this district was then located. This land was then distributed by lot to the various heads of families, and all seem to have been entirely content with the tracts that this method of division assigned him. In this tract was em braced a farm of 63 acres, which was given to Dominie Bolks as a pledge of esteem by the colonists. two children, found a home upon section 9, where he owned 160 acres. His son now resides upon the same farm Henry Kroezre, with a wife and three children, owned the east half of the southeast quarter of section 8. He died very early, and the widow, with her son, has since cultivated the farm. Jan Schipper, accompanied by a wife and five children, settled on 40 acres on section 20. Hendricus Maatman, his wife and three children, located upon the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 17, and also purchased the northwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 20. His death occurred during an early period of the colony's history, and his son has since cultivated the land. L. Slatman, one of the early pioneers who left Holland in 1847, died in Syracuse, N. Y., soon after his arrival. His widow and five children re moved to Michigan with the colony, and settled upon the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section 19. William Oolbekkirck, who was unmarried on his arrival, located upon the northwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 19. The families who accompanied Rev. Mr. Bolks to Over isel and made the first settlement there in 1848 are here enumerated, with their location : Egbert Nykerk, with a wife and one child, who located upon the east half of the northwest fractional quarter of section 19. In his family also lived Aarand Teeslink, his wife's father, with a wife and four children. Gerret Veldhuis, with his wife and four children, located upon the southwest fractional quarter of section 19. Gerret H. Lankheit, with his wife and two little ones, became a resident of the south half of the southeast quarter of section 19. He lived upon this land until his death, in 1865. Mannes Kleinheksel resided upon section 20, where he had the northwest quarter of the southwest quarter. Gerret J. Haller, also an unmarried man, had the east half of the southwest quarter of section 17. Gerret Maatman and his wife established themselves upon section 8, where 40 acres was allotted to them. He lived upon his farm until his death, in 1876, when his son became owner of the property. John Schwuurusau did not locate land with the colony, but soon after entered a tract in the township which\" he improved and made his residence. Henry Beldman, accompanied by a wife and one child, settled upon the east half of the northwest quarter of sec tion 20. Berend Wieldrayer, with five children, found a home upon section 18, of which he had received half of the southeast quarter, embracing 80 acres. Mr. Wieldrayer died in 1879, having lived to the advanced age of eighty one years. Gerett J. Immink, accompanied by a wife and six children, settled upon the west half of the northwest quarter of section 20, and afterwards bought the east half of the northeast quarter of section 19. He is now de ceased, as is also his wife, who lived to the age of eighty four years. A son of the same name occupies the farm. In the fall of 1848 the following families, who had re mained in New York, joined the colony: Mannes Boers and two children settled upon the west fractional half of the southwest quarter of section 6, his wife having died in New York. Berend Timmerman, with his wife and four children, located upon the east half of the northwest fractional quarter of section 7. William Hulsman, with his wife, removed to the west half of the southeast quarter of section 17, embracing 80 acres. Hendrick Klumper, with his wise and three chil dren, located upon the east half of the southeast quarter of section 18, on which he lived until his death, in 1875. His son now occupies the homestead. Gerret J. Figuer vever, accompanied by his wife and child, found a home on section 8, of which he received the west half of the south west quarter. With him came his father and mother, who are since deceased. Gerret M. Brouwer, with his wife and two children, chose a farm on section 24, in the township of Fillmore. These last four settlers purchased their lands direct from the government, and not through the agency of Rev. S. Bolks. The same fall there arrived from Holland William Heck man, wife and four children, who settled upon the east half of the southwest quarter of section 6 ; Hendrick Eskes, his wise and three children, who chose a home in Fillmore; John Bolks, who was unmarried, and also located in Fill more, on section 24 ; Gerret Schoten, his wife and five children, who purchased 160 acres on section 17; Gerret Vreelink, with a wife and five children, who entered 80 acres on section 8. Evert J. Fokkert, wise, and child became residents of 40 acres on section 7. He died many years since, and left his son, Mannes Fokkert, in possession of the farm, upon which he now resides. John W. Agteres, with his wise and three children, removed to the west half of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 8. He died some years since, and left the farm to his widow, who now resides upon it. Henry Kleinheksel, accompanied by his wife and five children, settled upon the southwest quarter of the south east quarter of section 8. He enjoyed the distinction of having been the earliest pioneer in Overisel, and lived upon his land until 1875, when his death occurred. His son is now the owner of the farm. In 1849 came Hans Kok, his wife and six children, who located upon section 7 ; Mannes Slotman, with a wife and four children, who became settlers on section 20 ; and Rev. Gerret J. Nykerk, who is still living, and officiates as pastor of the Reformed Church of Overisel. Hendrick Brouwers, who came from Hanover in 1848, remained in Allegan until the fall of 1850, having mean while purchased land on section 17 in Overisel, where he then settled. Iu 1854 he bought 115 acres upon section Genet Peters, with a family consisting of a wife and"], [431, "OVERISEL TOWNSHIP. 309 9, on which he at present resides. Henry Michmer shuizen built a house upon his land, on section 18, as early as 1848, but did not remove to it until later, having re mained two years in Allegan. Cornelius J. Voorhorst left the province of Overisel, in Holland, in the spring of 1847, and came direct to Holland, Mich., where he remained until his settlement upon his farm, in 1848. opened a small store containing a supply of groceries and other articles adapted to a country trade. This business was conducted for a period of three years. In 1853 Mr. Voorhorst purchased 40 acres on section 18. His resi dence until his marriage was with Dominie Bolks. After that event he removed to a log house he had erected on the site of his present comfortable brick residence, on section 18. To this land he added until he was the owner of 124 acres, which is all in an improved condition. Fred Copeman came in 1851, and with his wise located upon 80 acres on section 7. Lucas Daugremond preceded him by a year, and with his family settled upon section 18, where he built a blacksmith-shop and conducted a thriving business. Mannes Kok settled upon the land formerly owned by Dominie Bolks. Doon Nicnwenhuis located with his family upon section 7. Z. Vujteveen and family settled upon section 20, and John W. Neveuzel upon sec tion 30. John Von Eerde and Gerret Kooiker were also among the later settlers. Other buildings sprang up in the little bamlet as the demand for them was apparent, a church was erected, a school opened, and the general business of the burg steadily increased. There arc now two stores keeping a general stock, \u2014 one owned by Henry Schotten, the other by P. M. & E. Van Zee ; one hardware store, owned by Daugremond & Nykerk ; two shoe-shops, kept by John Ensing and Peter Dyck, re spectively ; one blacksmith-shop, owned by H. Brinkman ; and a paint-shop belonging to Peter Ranken. R. Koning came from Zeeland, Mich., in 1866, and em barked in mercantile -pursuits. He soon after erected a substantial building, and conducted the business of a gen eral store, adapted to the country trade, for a period of eight years. Later he purchased a large tract of land, and is now extensively engaged in real-estate operations. OTHER ITEMS. On section 11 in the township is also a general store kept by John Dozeman. The first physician who practiced here and in the township was Dr. Boerth, who resided in Zeel and, Ottawa Co., and made occasional pilgrimages to Over isel as his services were in demand. Dr. R. B. Best be came a resident practitioner in 1874, and aster a brief absence has returned again to his former field of labor. The earliest marriage was that of John Schipper to Miss Jennie Nykerk. The exact date, however, is not recollected. Jan Van Dau settled upon section 3, and resided upon his farm during his lifetime. Jan and Geraud Van Rhu also located on the same section. Roeluf A. Weurding, with his family, found a home on section 2, where he pur chased the south half of the southeast quarter, and Albert Vredevelt secured the east half of the southwest quarter on the same section. OVERISEL. REFORMED (DUTCH) CHURCH. The organization of this church dates back to the advent of the first emigrants from the province of Overisel, in the Netherlands, to Allegan County, in 1847. Rev. S. Bolks, the pastor of the church in the Fatherland, with a large part of his congregation and three members of his Consis tory, had left their place of birth for the purpose of im proving their secular and religious condition, and as has been previously stated selected the township of Overisel as their home. The hamlet of Overisel is located upon section 18. It was first begun in 1848, when a temporary structure was erected by the men of the colony, who located in the town ship, and desired a place of shelter while employed in erect ing log houses for the reception erf their families. This house was a structure of the rudest description. In lieu of beds the pioneers were content to repose upon hemlock boughs, while, their food was of such a character as could be easily transported from Holland, Ottawa Co., at which place they rejoined their families at the expiration of each week's toil. As soon as the structure was rendered habit able, Henry Kleinheksel came with his wife and established themselves in the house, or \" tavern,\" as it was called, and remained until their own log structure, on section 18, was completed, to which they then removed. They may therefore be regarded as having been the first permanent settlers in the township. Soon aster occurred the birth of Mr. Kleinheksel's son William, who was the first child born in the township. In the sal] of 1S48 a house of worship of logs was begun, but was not completed before the snows of winter had appeared, services being meanwhile held at the houses of the settlers. In 1849 the edifice was rendered habitable, and from that time used as a place of worship, some im provements being made in the course of time. Rev. Mr. Bolks was the pastor, and also directed the educational in terests of the township. In 1851 the congregation united with the denomination known as the Reformed Dutch Church. In the same year, Rev. Mr. Bolks having re moved from the township, one of the elders of the church, Mr. G. J. Nykerk, was chosen as pastor, and to enable him the better to fulfill the duties of this sacred calling was sent by the colony to the then Holland Academy, now Hope College, to perfect himself in theology and the languages. The elders of the church, during the interval, officiated and suarded the religious interests of the colony. There was at this time no saw-mill in Overisel, and the lumber used in constructing the earliest buildings was drawn from Dumont's mill, in Allegan, by ox-teams, there being then no fodder for horses. But two horse-teams were owned in the township during the first year of its set tlement. In the fall of 1848 Cornelius J. Voorhorst re moved to the hamlet. He had previously been a resident of Holland, Ottawa Co., and had been importuned by Dominie Bulks to embark with him iu a mercantile enterprise. They The Rev. Mr. Nykerk was ordained to the ministry and iustallcd as pastor of the church at Overisel, iu 1858, by"], [432, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 310 the Classis of Holland. He is still filling that sacred office in Overisel, being assisted in his clerical labors by Rev. P. Lepeltak, who was educated by the congregation to the work of the ministry, and was called to the church at Over isel in 1877. Other young men who have been educated by this church have entered the ministry, or are engaged in teaching at Hope College, Holland. Gerret Maatman. Harm Walters. Albert Woerding.

Wolterink, Barteld Vredeveld, Justices of the Peace ; Eg bert Nykerk, Harm Schepers, Directors of the Poor ; Mannes Hulsman, Albert Woerding, Constables. The remaining township officers to the present time are as fol lows : The membership of the church has steadily increased until its roll now embraces 489 names. A successful Sab bath-school is also maintained, with 375 scholars. Since 1859 the congregation has contributed to the support of its own church and parish, and to various benevolent enter prises, a sum exceeding $50,000. It has a spacious and well-appointed church edifice and a very desirable parson age, which is about to be rebuilt.

Holland, for America, Feb. 27, 1847, and landed in Baltimore after a tedious voyage of thirty-six days. The oldest of their family was Remmett, whose birth occurred in the province of Trent, Netherlands, July 24, 1826. On their arrival they began the westward journey, Michigan having been their objective point. The father's health for a year previous had been poor, and seven days later he died on a canal-boat at Millington, Pa., where he was buried, leaving the little band under the protecting care of the oldest son. They continued their journey, aud ultimately arrived at Kalamazoo with but ten guilders, or four dollars, of their small capital left. They removed to a small house and Remmett found employment in a brick-yard, where he earned twelve dollars a mouth, that having been the maximum sum paid at that time for labor. The following fall he removed to Saugatuck and was employed by John Roberts upon a scow running from Allegan around tho lake to Holland, Mich. Having a desire to become the owner of laud, he borrowed of a friend, Mr. Harm Smith, sufficient money with which to enter and pay for the southwest quarter of section 18, in Zeeland. This he intrusted to the care of a would-be friend, who appropriated it to his own use and left him minus the land. However, with the assistance of his brother Jacob, a fractional eighty was preempted, aud finally paid for after much anxiety and effort on the part of the young emigrants. Previous to this time Mr. Koning had assumed the burden of the family support, depending entirely upon his good health and his strong arms for aid. A change, however, occurred in the family relations by the marriage of his mother to John Van Vleet iu 1851. Mr. Koning's talent for speculation was first developed in the purchase of twenty-six fat hogs, which he sold soon after at a fine profit and enabled him to purchase thirty-seven more. He then repaired to Kalamazoo County and sought em ployment, chopping in a single winter three hundred and sixty-five cords of wood, and also engaging soon after at labor in a furnace. On the 23d of July, 1854, he was married to Miss Janette Immink, the third in a family of six children who came from the Netherlands to America in 1S47 and settled in Overisel in 1848, where her brother still resides. Mr. and Mrs. Koning have had six children, two of whom are living. Gerrit was born July 9, 1855, and died the following month ; a little one, whose advent and departure from the world both occurred in September, 1856 ; Gerrit, born Sept. 8, 1857, whose death occurred in November of the same year; Gerrit J., whose birth occurred Aug. 29, 1858; Diana J., born Feb. 4, 1861 ; and William, whose birthday was Sept. 9, 1864, and whose death took place in January of the following K. Daugremond. SCHOOLS. The earliest school was taught very soon after the estab lishment of the colony, in a log school-house, in district No. 1. It had as teacher Miss Bingham, now Mrs. George E. Jewett, of Allegan township. The building was located on section 17, on the section-line, and later gave place to a substantial frame structure, to which, in response to the de mand for more extended quarters, a wing has been added. Two teachers are employed in this district, and find here an ample field for their energies. The second school opened in Overisel was for the in struction of the children living within the boundaries of district No. 2. The building was constructed of logs, and located on section 2. Soon after, in response to the de mands of the residents of district No. 3, a school-house was built on section 9. The earliest teacher is not remem bered. The township is divided into six whole school dis tricts, which are under the supervision of a board of the following directors: H. G. Michmershuizen, H. Weurding, H. Brouwers, H. Beltman, W. C. Flanner, H. Rigterink. 406 children receive instruction, 11 of them being non residents, for which purpose 5 male and 4 female teachers are employed, who receive annually in salaries the amount of $2010.50. The value of school property is $3400, and the total resources of the township for school purposes $3037.74, of which $258.24 is derived from the primary school fund. BURIAL-PLACES. The earliest burial-place was begun in 1848, an exchange having been made with Cornelius J. Voorhorst, by which an acre of laud on his farm, and adjoining his residence, was devoted to purposes of burial. This was neatly fenced, has since been adorned with many neat tablets, and is still in use. The first interment was made in 1848, a little child of Gerret H. Veldhuis having there found a last resting-place. It was speedily followed by the father and two other children, who were the chosen victims to a pre vailing epidemic. A second burial-spot was set apart on section 11, a half acre having been purchased for the purpose on the quarter line. It was subsequently controlled by the township, and a half-acre added, the whole being neatly fenced and made attractive by the watchful care of the neighboring residents. year. Durinf the first ten years after Mr. Koning's marriage he lived upon his former home and engaged iu stock-buying and other speculations.

His son was drafted at eighteen and deserted, his desire to embark for America overcoming his patriotic instincts. The English language was to him an unknown tongue on his arrival, but by perseverance and application he has become proficient in its use. This was greatly aided by a substantial education in his early years. Mr. Koning's children have also received a liberal education, \u2014 Gerrit, at Hope College ; the latter has chosen farming as his vocation, and been presented with a four-hundred-acre farm. In politics Mr. Koning is an active Republican, and has been since the organization of the party. Both himself and wise are members of the Reformed (Dutch) Church in Overisel, and contribute liberally towards its support. bracing one hundred and twenty acres of land, and in 1864 secured an additional forty acres in Overisel, where his present residence is located. He then embarked both in farming and mercantile pursuits, having opened a small store with a general assortment of goods adapted to the country trade. The latter enterprise he conducted for a period of eight years, and then disposed of his interest to a partner. Mr. Koning had by industry and excellent judgment accumulated a competency, which was further increased by the sale of his land in Zeeland for the sum of six thousand dollars. Since that time he has added to his landed estates, until he is now the possessor of fourteen hundred and sixty-seven acres, a portion of which is highly cultivated. His tax-roll is among the largest paid in the county. In the Fatherland both Mr. Koning and his PINE PLAINS. Among the most heavily timbered townships of the county is that of Pine Plains, known on tbe U. S. survey as township 2 north, in range 14 west. It is bounded north by Heath, south by Cheshire, east by Allegan, and west by Clyde. It was surveyed in July, 1831, by Calvin Britain, and was organized as a separate civil township in 1850, then embracing tbe territory of Clyde and Lee, but not includ ing that part of its present territory northeast of Kalamazoo River. In 1859 the two townships just mentioned were separated from Pine Plains, which then embraced only that portion of township 2, range 14, lying southwest of the Kalamazoo River. In 1871 the portion lying north west of the river was taken from Heath by an act of the Legislature and annexed to Pine Plains, makiug its present area six miles square. ally overflowed and thus enriched, forming a soil the fer tility of which rivals that of any other land of the county. Wheat is grown with considerable success in various parts of the township, the average crop being quite equal to that obtained in neighboring territories. Corn, however, seems to be cultivated to even better advantage, and it is even said that in some favored localities 160 bushels of ears have been produced to the acre. In less fertile districts the corn crop is still abundant. The surface of Pine Plains is undulating, hills and val leys of varying height diversifying the scene. The eleva tions are frequently utilized for fruit-growing, and many fine peach-orchards, some of them of considerable extent, cover the sloping ground. The township was originally remarkable, as its name indicates, for its excellent pine-tim ber land. Oak, beech, maple, and basswood are also occa sionally found in the township. Much of the pine has been already cut, but enough still remains to attract lumbermen from other regions to this locality. Not only are the trees themselves utilized, but the stumps have in many districts been used for making fences, \u2014 fences which are supposed to be quite as durable as stone walls and less liable to fall down. In 1874 Pine Plains had nearly 2000 acres of improved land and 62 farms. These numbers are now considerably larger, and will be still further increased as the lands in the central and western portion are brought under cultivation. The township is well watered, the Kalamazoo River en tering it from the east, flowing through it to the northwest, and leaving it on the north line of section 5. Its course is tortuous, \u2014 perhaps even more so in this township than else where in the county, except in Allegan. The most impor tant of the smaller streams is Swan Creek, which enters the township on the south line, of section 32, follows a northerly course, and empties into the Kalamazoo. It affords good water-power, and saw-mills have at various times been erected upon its banks. Other smaller creeks are found in the northern portion of the township, and there is a small sheet of water on the western boundary which is known to the residents of that locality as Round Lake. EARLY SETTLEMENTS. The first settler, as nearly as can be determined, who un dertook to make a home in the territory of Pine Plains was Mr. A. Nobles, who located upon a tract of land on section 13, just north of the Kalamazoo River, about 1837. It is probable that his purchase was made from an early speculator, as he does not appear to have made a govern ment entry. Mr. Nobles built a log house on the bank of The quality of the soil in the timbered land is quite good, being a mixture of clay and sand, which by cultiva tion has been rendered very productive. Much of the land is a sandy loam, though at times there are found streaks of clay which are very productive. The river-lands are annu- By E. O.

The house was for a long time afterwards used as a temporary shelter by the river raftsmen and occasional itinerant fishermen. It was at length consumed by fire, through the carelessness of some of its temporary occupants. John Onderkirk was employed by Nobles to clear his land, and for several months made his headquarters at the house above mentioned. vigorous and active, survives him, and resides with her daughter, Mrs. George Peet. Maj. James M. Heath came West from Alleghany Co., N. Y., in 1845, and purchased 400 acres on section 12. Mr. West was at this time the only resident in the town ship, Mr. Bigsby having not yet returned from the East with his family. Mr. Heath occupied a log house on Mr. Dumont's farm until his own was completed, when he removed to it with his family. Even as late as 1845, within two or three miles of Allegan village, wild animals were not only abundant, but very obtrusive. Bears were especially destructive in the corn-fields, and would occa sionally visit the dwellings of the settlers. The house of Maj. Heath in his absence was visited by one of these marauders, which came close up to the door, coolly made a survey of the premises, badly frightened the inmates, and then walked off at his leisure. The next settlement was made by T. M. West, who pur chased a tract of land on section 14, north of the river, now occupied by W. N. Ingham. As near as can be ascer tained, Mr. West's advent occurred in 1838. He had pre viously resided in Allegan, to which place he returned aster a brief experience in Pine Plains. Daniel Amerman came from Wayne Co., Pa., in 1836, and located in Allegan on the line of Pine Plains. In 1845 he removed to the latter township and purchased 80 acres on section 13. Upon this he built a house and re mained two years, when he removed to Osceola County. His son then occupied the farm UDtil 1878, when he be came a resident of the village of Allegan. The first death in the township was that of Maj. Heath's son, Frank, who died near the close of the Mexican war from sickness contracted while serving as a soldier in that conflict. His remains were the first which were interred in the new cemetery. In 1844, Samuel Bigsby arrived from Allegany Co., N. Y., and located upon section 12, where he purchased of Oramel Griffin 160 acres. He found a temporary abode with Peter Dumont, in Allegan, while he cleared five acres of land, aster which he returned to the East, and the fol lowing year brought his family. They also enjoyed the hospitality of their Allegan neighbors until a comfortable residence could be built, into which they at once moved. For nearly a year they had no neighbors except a band of Indians who had pitched their camps on the river-bank, and were constantly roaming the forest in pursuit of game. With game and fish procured of the Indians, Mrs. Bigsby was able to set forth a repast which would have delighted the heart of a modern epicure. The first framed house and barn in the township were built by Mr. Bigsby, the erection of which was then considered as an achievement of which he might reasonably be proud. It was all the more com plimentary to his industry and energy that his ready cash after paying for his land was reduced to 25 cents in cur rency. During the time that Mr. Bigsby 's family was living in Mr. Dumont's house in Allegan, his daughter Amelia was married to George P. Heath. This could hardly be called the first marriage in Pine Plains, but it would have been if the bride's father had moved into his Peter Rhodabaugh arrived very soon aster, and settled on a farm adjoining Mr. Bigsby 's. In his family occurred the earliest birth in the township. A saw-mill was built as early as 1837 in Pine Plains by David B. Stout. It was located on Swan Creek, on the site of the property known as the Bush Mills, on sec tion 29 (now owned by Armitage & Co.), and was run for five years, during which time it supplied lumber for most of the settlers. A saw-mill was at a later date erected by H. Bower on section 17 upon the same creek, which was subsequently purchased by P. G. Paris & Co. John E. Babbitt removed from Mercer Co., Pa., to Pine Plains in 1849, and lived a while with Maj. Heath. In 1851 he entered 53 acres in the northeast corner of section 2, upon which he built a house and barn, and a considerable portion of which he cleared. Two years later his father became a resident of the township. Mr. Babbitt remained upon his farm until 1859, when he removed to Allegan and engaged in the practice of law. He served for a term in the Union army, and has ever since been an active member of the bar. Arad Hitchcock came from the State of New York and purchased from A. J. Kellogg 80 acres on section 13. He remained a few weeks, and during that time made a beginning in the work of clearing his land. This brief season of labor, however, proved fatal, as he contracted a malarial fever which ended his life one month later. Mrs. Hitchcock was not, however, dismayed. Under the care of her father she removed to her land in Pine Plains four years later, and has since resided upon it. new house a little quicker. There were as yet no religious services held in Pine Plains, but as settlers came in their ox-teams were fre quently seen conveying them to Allegan for worship. Later, Elder Bingham, of the latter place, held services in the school-house, which had been built in the mean time. An early death occurred in the household of Mr. Bigsby, which was probably the second in the township. A sick stranger from Hillsdale presented himself at Mr. Bigsby 's door and begged assistance. His suffering condition so moved the hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Bigsby that he was made welcome and tenderly nursed by them aud the neigh bors, who volunteered their services. Their ministrations, however, proved unavailing, as he survived but four weeks. Mr. Bigsby died during the year 1877. His wife, still The first settler who cleared a farm on the portion of Pine Plains south of the river was Giles H. Hills, who came from Oswego Co., N. Y., in 1853, and located 345 acres on section 24. He found no neighbors in that town ship, but in Allegan lived Loren Sage, who had located on section 30, very near Mr. Hill's own purchase. Mr. Hill be,ran life in Pine Plains, almost as a matter of course, in a log house. Four years later he built a hotel. The year 40"], [438, "314 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. following came George Muma and located on section 23, where he purchased 80 acres. He now resides with his son-in-law, G. H. Hill. This he afterwards disposed of, but has continued his resi dence at the place. H. C. Beverley, previously of Elmira, N. Y., located at Mill Grove in 1856, where he still resides. W. J. Shirley removed from Massachusetts in 1859, and purchased 100 acres on section 2, residing upon it until 1878, when he removed to Mill Grove. Mr. Muma was soon followed by John Frank, who located upon 130 acres on section 14, but subsequently removed from the township. J. W. Palmer purchased and improved 160 acres on section 6, but did not become a permanent resident. Jabez Pettit made an early location upon 140 acres on section 30. The township was slowly settled, and on' the occasion of the first election, held at the Pine Plains House, kept by T. S. Coates, but two offices were filled, from the fact that the population did not afford material for a full comple ment of officers. For some time after but eight electors presented themselves at the polls, and frequently a single individual would be burdened with official honors. George Peet was a former resident of Oneida Co., N. Y., which he left in 1844, and ten years later selected Pine Plains as a home, purchasing 120 acres on section 11, and finding a welcome at the house of George P. Heath while erecting a house for himself. His brother, William Peet, who came somewhat later, purchased an adjoining farm on the same section, which he improved, and upon which he still resides. SCHOOLS. Several years elapsed aster the first settlement of Pine Plains before the first school was opened. In 1853, a school district having been established on the fraction northeast of the Kalamazoo (then a part of Heath), Samuel Bigsby was awarded a contract for the construc tion of a school-house on section 12. On its completion a school was opened in it, with Miss Mercy Bigsby as the earliest teacher. Miss Bigsby, however, did not long oc cupy the position of a teacher. A severe illness proved fatal a few weeks aster she began teaching, and Miss Martha Platt became her successor, who soon established herself as a favorite with the little ones. It may be difficult to ascertain how much knowledge she imparted, but the devices she employed to amuse children, and the marvelous playhouses she erected, are still fresh in the recollection of her admirers. Burroughs Ingham, a native of Allegany Co., N. Y., moved to Allegan County in 1853, and purchased 80 acres on section 14, in Pine Plains, where he took up his resi dence. Across the river from Mr. Ingham's place, Rev. William Page had tried to build a saw-mill and factory as early as 1849. A race had been dug, but, the water-power proving insufficient, the enterprise was abandoned and the property disposed of. It is now owned by Ira Wilcox. The latter gentleman served four years in the army, and with the proceeds of this service liquidated the indebtedness on his purchase. Salmon Thayer had been a pioneer in Saugatuck in 1855. In 1857 he purchased of Myron Hinckley 80 acres on section 13, in Pine Plains, on which he established his family, though at first he continued to work most of the time at his mill in Saugatuck. Afterwards he permanently occupied his place, where he resided until 1875. Alfred Sirrine purchased a farm south of Mr. Thayer, and was one of his nearest neighbors. There are now three whole and two fractional districts in the township, the board of directors being William J. Shirley, A. P. Randall, E. B. Estabrook, A. Muma, and G. W. Place. One hundred and seventy scholars are in daily attendance at the various schools, who are instructed by 5 teachers receiving annually, in salaries, the sum of $608. The school property of the township is valued at $2790. Jabez Parish located 30 acres upon section 8, a por tion of which he improved, but finally sold to a band of Indians who lived on and cultivated the land. Many of them were industrious and enterprising, and raised good crops. At the expiration of a few years they removed from the township. BURIAL-PLACES. Asa Estabrook came from Allegany Co., N. Y., in 1856, and remained in Allegan until 1861. He then removed to Pine Plains and purchased of L. S. Weaver 66 acres on section 15, upon which he built a house. Soon afterwards he enlisted as a soldier in the war for the Union. Dur ing this time his parents removed from the East and made the farm their home, Mr. Estabrook, Sr., having assisted his son in the purchase of the land. Their son-in-law, Mr. Valentine Youngs, also came at the same time, and located upon an adjoining farm. His life was terminated by an accident while engaged at labor. Mr. Asa Estabrook, after his return from the war, purchased 80 acres on section 13, upon which he lives. Two cemeteries have been laid out in the township, one on the west line of section 12, and another near the western township-line of section 6. The former was purchased by the township of Maj. Heath in 1848, and was inclosed and improved by that gentleman. As it is the oldest of the two, many of the early settlers have found there a last resting place, and it is now well-nigh filled with graves. A neat fence incloses it, and many handsome memorial stones re mind the spectator of the pioneers of the township. The latter cemetery is comparatively new, and as yet but few interments have taken place within its borders. EARLY ROADS. Harvey Howe located on section 2 about the year 1852, and met a tragic death by the accidental falling of a tree upon him. C. C. Clark moved West from the State of New York in 1839, and settled at Mill Grove in 1855, when he purchased an interest in the saw-mill at that point. The early records give no survey of highways prior to 1850, though roads were undoubtedly laid out and used before that time. The first surveyed road was that from Allegan to Saugatuck, which entered the township on sec tion 28; ran thence northwestwardly, and left it at the"], [439, "PINE PLAINS TOWNSHIP. 315 northeast corner, on section 6. It was probably surveyed as early as 1834 or 1835. retail branch has been established at Three Rivers, where the principal market is found. MILL GROVE. 1IETHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. The hamlet of Mill Grove is located on the township line between Allegan and Pine Plains, the business of the place being done principally in the former township, while the scanty population resides principally in the latter. It has had a store owned by Alonzo Vosburgh, which is closed, at least for the present. It possesses a blacksmith-shop con nected with the mills, which occasionally does custom-work, a post-office (the present deputy being H. C. Beverly), a school building, and a few residences. The Grand Haven Railroad has a station at this point. This church had its beginning in 1872, and as the number of worshipers increased the little band was attached to the Monterey charge. Preaching was at first held in the school-house, but an effort was later made to erect an edifice, and with so much success that $700 was subscribed, while Mr. Alonzo Vosburgh donated the sawing of all the material. The funds subscribed not having proved available, Mr. Vosburgh himself bore the expense of completing the edi fice, and was given a mortgage of SHOO by the trustees to secure his investment. The class was then transferred to the Allegan charge, with which it is still connected. An effort was subsequently made to pay the mortgage, and, Mr. Vosburgh having consented to receive $800 in pay ment, the amount was raised. An accession of 60 members strengthened the church under the preaching of Rev. Mr. Edwards, who were received on probation. The present pastor is Rev. W. A. Hunsberger, of Allegan, and the trustees are Alonzo Vosburgh, B. Calkins, T. W. Sites. The present membership is 54. The founder of the hamlet and first settler was Levi M. Comstock. He made a contract with Chester Wetmore, the date of which is not obtainable, by which he became the possessor of the land whereon the saw-mill now stands, and soon after erected a small mill with an upright saw. It was not very successful, and did but little business. The property was abandoned by Mr. Comstock, and reverted to Mr. Wetmore. It was soon aster sold to Harris & Fuller, who erected a mill, placed in it a circular saw, and ran it for a year, depending upon the land adjacent to the mill for their timber. A party named Wheeler purchased the in terest of Mr. Fuller, and soon after that of Mr. Harris. His ownership ceased at the close of the second year, as the result of financial disaster. LAND PURCHASES. The lands of the township were early purchased by the following parties : John M. Heath, George P. Heath, and C. C. Clark next embarked in the enterprise, and added a shingle-mill, which proved a profitable investment. George P. Heath soon after retired, and the property finally came iuto the hands of Alonzo Vosburgh. Vosburgh, Harrington & Bo wen be came the owners in 1861, but soon afterwards Mr. Vos burgh purchased the entire property. John M. Heath went into partnership with Mr. Vosburgh in 1864, the firm becoming for one season Vosburgh & Heath, after which the property was transferred to Cole & Dean. It reverted to Vosburgh & Heath, the latter of whom disposed of his interest to Alby Rossman. Messrs. Vosburgh & Rossman leased the property for a brief time to Messrs. Davis & Hooker, but in 1865, Mr. Vosburgh became, and has con tinued, sole proprietor. He has since built two mills, the first of which was of very considerable dimensions, with a circular saw. Connected with it was a shingle-mill of large capacity, and also a lath-mill.

Another conflagration, in 1873, consumed a vast amount of material, including a stave-, heading-, and planing-mill, and involved a loss of $30,000. The des troyed works were again rebuilt. The property now em braces a saw-mill, a shingle-mill, a heading- and planing mill, and a stave-mill, which, with the exception of the last named, are run by water. When the supply of the latter is insufficient steam-power is applied. The average capacity of the mill is 20,000 feet per day. During the active season 40 men are employed in the various depart ments of labor. Connected with the business is a farm of 1500 acres, 400 of which is improved.

PLATT, born Jan. 7, 1862, returned to her parents, intending to remain until peace should restore them to each other again in their home. But fate decreed otherwise. Mr. Daniel G. Platt sickened and died at Newbern, N. C, May 10, 1865. To Mrs. Platt there seemed but one course to pursue, that of devoting her life to the rearing of her orphaned children. She returned to the home now so desolate, and began the struggle bravely, the results of which are before us, \u2014 a well improved farm conducted by her sons, now grown to man hood, for whom we bespeak honorable places among their townsmen, all due to the uutiring devotion of a mother. MR. AND MRS. DANIEL G. PLATT. In the quiet little town of Jackson, Susquehanna Co., Pa., devoting their time to instructing others in following the true path of life as laid down in the Good Book, lived the Rev. Daniel and his good wife Almira (Skinner) Platt, the parents of Daniel G. Platt, born March 11, 1827. In the early settlement of Michigan the Rev. D. Platt saw a wider field for labor in the good cause, and accordingly emigrated with his family to Allegan Co.. Mich. Later, he removed to the north part of Allegan township, where he lived the remainder of his life, devoted to the service of his Master. Daniel G., becoming of age, located eighty acres in Heath township, since included within the township of Pine Plains, on section No. 1. Nov. 9, 1858, he married Mary Sophronia Tanner, whose parents, Joseph and Lydia (Kenyon) Tanner, came from Washington Co., N. Y., in 1845, and settled in the town ship of Monterey, both having since passed away. Daniel G. and Mary S. Platt had unitedly put forth every effort to build up a home in the wilderness until March, 1865, when he was called to serve his country in the capacity of a sol dier. Renting their little home, Mary with her two chil dren, Warren Alson, born Dec. 8, 1859, and Elmor J., WILLIAM PEET The subject of this sketch was born April, 1827, and is a native of Oneida Co., N. Y. His parents, John and Mary (Davis) Peet. were of English and Welsh extraction. In 1838 the family removed from Oneida to Cattaraugus County, same State, where William engaged in lumbering upon the Alleghany River, but in 1849 he returned to farm ing, also doing carpenter and joiner work. Feb. 11, 1852, he married Fidelia L. Vahue, daughter of Philip and Arminta (Gillett) Vahue, residents of Cattaraugus Co.,"], [442, "318 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. N. Y. In October, 1854, he removed to Pine Plains township, and purchased a farm of eighty acres on section 11. This was then an unbroken wilderness, and after making a small payment on his purchase he erected a board shanty, 14 by 21, and entered upon the work of clearing and improving his farm. After remaining about one year, necessity compelled him to leave it and adopt some means which would enable him to make his payments. Accord ingly, he rented a small place and chopped cord-wood for that purpose, and at the end of a year's time had made enough to get a deed of his place, and returned to it and the work of improving and clearing this land. Year after year the work went on, seemingly slow, but eventually re- sulting in a home, \u2014 such an one as their fancy had pictured, \u2014 which at this time is one of the finest in this township. He has also added ninety-five acres to his first purchase. Mr. Peet has served as justice of the peace for twenty years, also in minor offices, and is to-day one of the most enter prising and trustworthy citizens of Pine Plains. Mr. and Mrs. Peet are the parents of six children, viz. : Judson A., born Nov. 22, 1852 ; Ammta M., March 19, 1855 ; Mary E., Jan. 21, 1859 ; Edward O, Sept. 20, 1861 ; Flora M., March 30, 1868 ; John P., June 20, 1876. Upon another page of this work we give a view of the residence of Mr. Peet and his family, also portraits of himself and estimable wife. SALEM.\" The timber of the township embraces many varieties. In the north are found beech, maple, black-walnut, butter nut, and basswood. Many of these trees grow to an un usual size, and are a source of large revenue to the owners. The section in which pine has flourished borders on the Rabbit River and its tributaries. But the woodman has been busy in this locality, and the larger proportion of these gigantic oaks and pines have yielded to his sturdy blows. GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY. Tins is one of the northern tier of townships of Allegan County, and is designated on the United States survey as township No. 4 north, in range 13 west. It is bounded on the east by Overisel, west by Dorr, north by Ottawa County, and south by Monterey. Salem presents a great variety of surface, some portions of it being level and easily tilled, while considerable undu lating ground is to be seen elsewhere, and in still other sec tions numerous lofty bluffs and deep ravines strike the eye of the spectator. PRESENT APPEARANCE, Etc. The township boasts some of the best and most produc tive farms in the county, many of which are adorned with tasteful, and even elegant, residences. Among the various industries the keeping of bees deserves prominent mention. Several of the residents have become extensively engaged in the business, and find that it well repays the time and labor expended upon it. It does not boast a single lake, but many streams, a few of considerable magnitude, fertilize its territory. Black Creek flows through the northwest portion of the township, and passes thence into Overisel. The two branches of Rabbit River, called respectively the Big and Little Rabbit Rivers, flow, the first from the southeast and the latter from the northeast, and unite on section 29, the combined stream leaving the township on the west line of section 30. Both of these streams afford much good water-power. The number of farms in the township in 1876 was 136, which has been largely increased during the succeeding four years. A large proportion of the population is com posed of Germans, whose productive and well-maintained estates extend over most of the northern portion of Salem. The soil of Salem is quite equal to the average land of the county, embracing sand loam and clay loam, with more or less of gravel. The districts formerly covered with a mixed growth of timber have a strong, rich soil, while a light sandy loam is the characteristic of those tracts where pine has principally flourished. The wheat-crop has gen erally been a satisfactory one, both as regards quantity and quality, and occasionally a small piece of land producing a yield which was almost phenomenal. Corn is also among the staples, and both oats and hay are profitably raised. The census of 1873 gives 1265 as the number of acres of wheat sown for that year, from which 18,353 bushels were harvested, while 801 acres of corn produced a yield of 29,977 bushels. Of other grains, 12,682 bushels were raised. LAND-ENTRIES The lands embraced in the present township of Salem were entered by the following parties : Seclion 1.\u2014 Bought from 1836 to 1855 by Z.

Mr. Straher built a log house and a shanty and began to clear off his land, but soon became weary of the life of monotony and hardship which opened before him. He accordingly sold his land to Henry Wilson, who after a brief ownership in turn disposed of it to its present occu pant, John Teed. Section 9.\u2014 Bought in 1836 by Francis Dwight, B. B.

Section 12.\u2014 Bought from 1853 to 1855 by Albert Krone, S. Herwick, Jeane Brimaker, James Laraway. Mr. Straher's advent was followed by that of William Goodman and Charles Strickfaden, who found him on his land when they were looking for a location in 1852, and again when they became permanent settlers in 1853. Charles Strickfaden, from Hancock Co., Ohio, located upon 80 acres on section 17, and occupied Michael Straher's shanty while erecting a log house of his own, to which his family removed on its completion. He still resides on the same farm. Two sons likewise have farms in the town ship. Section 13. \u2014 Bought in 1854 and 1855 by John Deardoff, Jacob Bre- dingam, Frank Goldbery, John Hendges and Jacob Bredigan, J. Shoemaker.

Goodman, Amos Showelter, Chris- topher Strickfaden, Frederick Miller. William Goodman, who left the cultivated fields of Ohio for a home in the forests of Michigan, chose 80 acres on section 17, and, like Mr. Strickfaden, accepted the hospi tality of Mr. Straher, who assisted him in the raising of his log dwelling. Many neighbors from the adjoining town ship of Monterey also volunteered their services on this occasion. Not a tree had, at this date, been cut, on the north of the Babbit River, and the obscure trail of the few remaining Indians who occasionally traversed their old hunt ing-ground was the only guide to the traveler. Deer were abundant, and afforded a constant supply of meat for the table. Wolves were regular nocturnal visitors, while oc casionally a bear was discovered invading the cornfield ; yet this, it will be remembered, was but little more than twenty five years ago. Seclion ]8.\u2014 Bought from 1836 to 1854 by Nelson Sage, Charles But- ler, Elisha Smith, William Goodman, Jacob Moyer, Adam Stickley.

Mr. Goodman has continued since his settlement a resi dent of the farm he first purchased. He is now in his eighty-fourth year, and has recently taken up his abode with his daughter, Mrs. Joseph Slagel. Two sons also reside in the township. Section 25.\u2014 Bought from 1835 to 1863 by C. E. Stewart, C. C. Trow- bridge, V. Bicker, M. Alston, J. J. and P. Alften, Peter Maas, James Kennedy. Section 26.\u2014 Bought in 1836 and 1856 by J. R. Kellogg, Samuel Petti- bone, C. C. Trowbridge, R. E. Ward. Albert Kraus, a former resident of Dorr, was at tracted to Salem in 1853 by the good prospects of that new district. He located in the fall of 1853 upon 240 acres on section 12, which was at that time wholly unimproved. He resided upon it until his death, in 1868.

Matthias Castor had also been a resident of Dorr before coming to Salem, where he chose a home in 1854. lie purchased 120 acres of unimproved land on sections 1 and 12, where he erected a temporary shelter of poles and similar material, his family remaining in Dorr until it was made ready for occupation. There was no window, and the door was com posed of two or three basswood slabs ; earth was the only floor of this primitive structure. Here Mr. Castor and his three sons led an isolated life. On section 11 there was a village of Chippewa Indians, who still found opportunity to indulge their love of hunting and fishing. But from this time the savages rapidly diminished, and in 1858 the Chippewas departed forever. Section 30.\u2014 Bought in 1S35 and 1S36 by Charles Butler.

Michael Straher, after pros pecting in various portions of the county, finally selected an eligible site on section 34, where he located upon 160 acres. He evidently bought of a previous purchaser, as his name does not appear among the official eutries of land. Mr. Castor and his son Jacob still occupy the old home stead. His son Peter has a farm of 160 acres on sections 12 and 14, while Theodore Castor, the present super visor, is actively engaged in business at Burnip's Corners. John Hendges and John Biermaker soon followed Mr. Cas tor, and located in the northeast portion of the township,"], [444, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 320 Among other settlers we would also mention Christian Sutter, Casper Raab, R. Pettingall, J. and W. Slagel, J. N. York, Isaiah Mannes, Nicholas Kreiser, Amos True, H. G. Bliss, and Wm. Linden. where they purchased farms. The former succeeded Theo dore Castor in his mercantile venture at New Salem. Jacob Hoffman and Fred Miller also arrived from Ohio, which furnished most of the pioneer stock in Salem, in the spring of 1854, the former purchasing land on section 8 and the latter on section 17. Mr. Hoffman did not long survive his advent, and left his farm to his widow, who now resides upon it. Mr. Miller is still actively engaged in agricultural pursuits. Henry Bear, another Ohio set tler, arrived in 1854, and found a home on section 16, where he had 40 acres. He built a log house, and had made some progress in the improvement of his land, when he entered the army, and died soon after his discharge from the service. Diligent inquiry has failed to discover the youth or dam sel ambitious of the honor of having been the first to see the light of day in Salem. Undoubtedly there was an in dividual thus favored, but he or she was apparently \" born to blush unseen.\" The earliest marriage festivities are en veloped in like obscurity. EARLY ROADS. The first road through the township of Salem was known as the State road, from Allegan to Grand Rapids, and was surveyed by F. J. Littlejohn in 1837. It entered the township at the middle of its southern boundary, and ran due north on the section-line to the middle of the west line of section 10. There it diverged to the west, and passed out of the township near the northeast corner of section 3. Jacob Raab came from Ohio to Salem in 1854, and pur chased 60 acres on section 8, which he at once began to clear, but made little progress the first year. He found a home, while building a log house, with his father-in-law, John Oesterley, Sr., who had preceded him by a few months, and who had purchased 60 acres on section 8. Mr. Oes terley's death occurred in 1864. Mr. Raab had but $17 when he arrived in Salem, and owed for nearly all his land. He recalls with satisfaction the obstacles he has overcome, but is not desirous to repeat his experience as a Michigan pioneer. It was not unusual for him to carry on his back for family use fifty pounds of corn-meal and a bag of potatoes a distance of nine miles. There were no cows, and butter was not easily procurable. Two pounds was all the family was able to obtain during a period of two years. The proceeds from the sale of half a pig enabled Mr. Raab to purchase seed wherewith to sow his first field of wheat. He now has 240 acres of excellent land and a substantial house, built in 1867. The earliest road recorded in the town book was laid out by the highway commissioners April 26, 1856, and is de scribed as a road running on the line between sections 11 and 12. A contract for cutting out this highway and piling the logs was made the same date, at the rate of $9.75 per acre. The next recorded road was surveyed, by direction of the highway commissioners, in September of the same year, and is described as \" commencing at the quarter-stake on the west side of section 16, and running east one mile through the section.\" In October, 1856, a road was surveyed by Dorr Skeels, which is thus described : \" Beginning at a stake where the Allegan road intersects the line between the counties of Allegan and Ottawa, and following an east erly course on the county-line to the corners of sections 2, 3, 34, and 35 ; thence running east again on the same line to the quarter-section corners between sections 2 and 35, and continuing on the same line to the corners of sections 1, 2, 35, and 36 ; thence on the same line to the corners of sections 1 and 36.\" The brother of Mrs. Raab, John Oesterley, Jr., died on his father's farm in 1856, and was buried at Burnip Centre. His death was the earliest in the township. Adam Raab, also an Ohioan, was a pioneer of 1855, and settled in the spring of that year upon 60 acres on section 8. He still occupies the same tract. Many private roads were cut for the convenience of in dividuals, running as convenience dictated ; but no offi cial survey of them was made, and as the farms were successively fenced up, these roads were necessarily aban doned. In 1855 came L. P. Brown, who located upon section 3. His neighbor, Mr. Castor, did not know of his arrival until the sound of his axe was heard in the forest. Mr. Brown was active in the cultivation of his land, but also partici pated largely in affairs connected with the welfare of the township. Highways, the larger number of which are in excellent condition, now traverse every portion of the township. Peter Rusch, who came in 1856, purchased 40 acres on section 23. He followed the vocation of a teacher, and ul timately removed from the township. John Fix located upon a farm on section 12, containing 80 acres. Aster making some improvements he sold it to John Weust, who occupies it and an adjacent piece, and now has 120 acres, together with 40 acres in Dorr. SCHOOLS. The earliest school building in the township was located on section 3, which is now embraced in district No. 4. The residents of the vicinity, feeling the necessity of obtaining educational advantages for their children, erected in 1857 a shanty building and employed a Miss Brown as teacher. The families of L. P. Brown, James Burnham, Jacob Schwander, Sr., and Robert Pettingall were represented at this school. A log school-house was afterwards substituted in this district, the location of which was on section 10. A substantial framed building has since taken its place. Among the early settlers on section 1 were J. Metzen and M. Ulman, both of whom owned fractional quarters on it. Mr. Ulman died some years ago ; his widow still occupies the farm. Quiren Weber came from Prussia in 1856, and purchased 40 acres on section 24, to which he removed two years later. After a residence of ten years upon it he removed to his present location, on section 13. Salem is now divided into six whole districts and one fractional one, with a board consisting of the following directors : William H. Goodman, Ira Stokes, Jacob Schwan-"], [445, "SALEM TOWNSHIP, 321 der, Aaron Hearley, Allen Twining, John Hendges, and Luewin Weber. The number of children receiving instruction is 303. The teachers receive in salaries an aggregate sum of $1161. A spacious town-hall is located iu the south part of the village. NEW SALEM. This hamlet owed its beginning to the enterprise of Theodore Castor in 1865. His brother, Peter Castor, owned 120 acres of land at this point, 5 of which was purchased by Theodore Castor, who erected a store upon it. In this a stock of goods was placed, for which a ready sale was found. Mr. Castor carried on the business five years, and then disposed of his property to John Hendges, who still remains the proprietor, and is also the postmaster. Frank Heibel came in 1867, and built a house, in which he soon after opened a shoe-shop. He also owns a farm in the township. John Schweigert also provided the towns people with a market in this locality. BTJRNIP'S CORNERS. This is the most important hamlet in Salem, being located on the line between sections 15 and 16, and extending south to the geographical centre of the township. The latter point was for a while known as Salem Centre, but has now no identity distinct from the Corners. The land on which the village was begun was first purchased by Timothy Bliss, who in 1858 entered the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter and southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of section 16. He sold it to F. P. Brown, who in turn dis posed of it to Philip Ferguson. The latter disposed of the property to R. E. Beard, and shortly afterwards 20 acres came into the possession of James Burnip. That gentle man in a short time sold a lot for building purposes to George Broughton. Adjacent lands, owned by Thomas Hinton and other parties, were then purchased, and a demand for property in this immediate locality created, which resulted in the growth of the hamlet. In 1870, William Hoffman established the first black smith-shop, which he is still carrying on. Adam Storm came in 1871, and went to work as the second shoemaker in the place. There are now two schools in the little village, one be longing to the district, the other a private enterprise where instruction in the German language is given. Adam En dries has also a store containing a general stock half a mile from New Salem. Dr. See had already built a store and transacted a lim ited business, which he subsequently abandoned. In 1856, James Burnip opened a store, furnished with a suitable stock of goods, which he managed for three years, and then sold to J. S. Warner. The latter conducted it until 1879, and then sold it to Messrs. Wells & Dibble. As the busi- RELIGIOUS. ST. MARY'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. This society had its beginning as early as the year 1856, under the fostering care of Father Marco, of Grand Rapids, who removed to the township to minister to the little flock. A log building for worship was erected during the first year of his presence, each contributing towards the expenses of building and adorning it. The trustees at this date were Anton Weber, A. Kraus, and M. Castor. Father Marco was succeeded by Father Allgyer, who was in turn followed by Father Beeshorst. Father Herwick next be came pastor, after whom Father Kluck ministered to the flock. Father Tohma succeeded, and after him came Father Sclosick, who was followed by Father Tillig, and he by Father Seybold. Next in succession came Father Rohr, and later Father Lietner. The present pastor is Father Buechman. The substantial framed church edifice on section 1 was erected in 1865, and improved and enlarged in 1S76. The church at present contains 110 members. ness of the Corners increased another store was opened by Messrs. Briggs & Martiny, of which firm James Briggs became the successor. In 1866 a saw-mill was built, which was carried on until 1875, when it was destroyed by fire. This was not the earliest, however, one having been built on section 34, by John Doge, in 1859. In 1867 another was erected by George and William Heck and Charles Fisher, and the next year a grist-mill was built on the Little Rabbit River. The place at the present time has one drug-store, kept by Dr. C. C. Lindsley ; three dry-goods and grocery-stores, kept respectively by Theodore Castor & Co., Messrs. Wells & Dibble, and Mr. James Briggs ; one blacksmith- and wagon-shop, of which J. F. Gardner is the proprietor; one harness-shop, owned by W. H. Lear ; a shoe-shop, belong ing to Joshua Myers ; a hardware-store, kept by W. H. Goodwin; the millinery establishment of Miss Van Zee; a cabinet-shop, in which Peter Martiny exercises his skill ; and a printing-office, owned by Frank Sturges. The Cor ners also boasts two hotels, over which O. J. Hardy and O. Titsworth preside as landlords. CHURCH OF THE UNITED BRETHREN. The Society of the United Brethren organized in Salem in 1856, and the earliest meetings were held in one of the school-houses built prior to that time. It was at first poorly sustained, but an increasing interest was manifested in the enterprise, and under the ministrations of Elder Stephen Ferguson a house of worship was erected in 1869, upon ground secured on section 9. The present pastor is Rev. S. B. Irving, who holds services each Sabbath. The society numbers 55 members and embraces a flourishing Sabbath school with 77 scholars upon its roll, of which Allen Twin ing is superintendent. The present trustees are Isaac Bear, William Fleetwood, and Allen Twining. A grist-mill, owned by William Heck, is located on the Little Rabbit River, and does an extensive custom business, to which it is exclusively devoted, and the saw-mill of George Heck has for many years been actively employed in the production of lumber. A steam saw- and grist-mill is about being erected by Ebmeyer & Castor, which will probably add largely to the business of the place. Two physicians also enjoy a lucrative practice in Salem, Dr. Palmer and Dr. Lindsley, the latter of whom belongs to the eclectic school. GERMAN LUTHERAN CHURCH. The Lutheran Church in Salem became an organization under the early ministratious of Rev. Mr. Eberhart at a 11"], [446, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 322 the erection of a hall, for which subscriptions to the amount of $1500 had been secured. On the occasion of its com pletion it was dedicated on the 24th of August, 1874, with imposing ceremonies, conducted by G. W. Griggs, Grand Master of the State. The prayer was by the Rev. C. C. Lindsley, and addresses were delivered by Hon. E. P. D. Holden and Rev. A. M. Buck. date which may be fixed at 1860, and possibly prior to that time. The society were content to find the hospitable doors of a school-house open to them until their numbers warranted the erection of a building on section 9 in 1872. Rev. John Bowman was at that time pastor. The present officiating clergyman is Rev. August Schernberg. A Sun day-school, which is well attended, holds its sessions in the summer. The trustees of the society are John Schmidt, William Brainard, and T. Slagel. The present officers are W. H. Goodman, N. G. ; George Ball, V. G. ; Elijah Gordon, Ree. Sec. ; George Heck, Perm. Sec. ; H. A. Ball, Treas. ; C. C. Lindsley, M.D., Chaplain. The lodge now numbers 26 members, and its convocations are held on Saturday evenings of each week. GERMAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. Early meetings held at the house of Casper Raab formed the nucleus for the later organization of the German Metho dist Episcopal Church in Salem. Afterwards the hospitable doors of Jacob and Adam Raab were opened to the small circle of worshipers. But four individuals comprised the early membership, those being embraced in the families of Jacob and Adam Raab. In 1808 a very attractive church edifice of brick was erected on section 8, in which services are regularly held. The earliest pastor was Rev. Mr. Kreibel, and the present officiating clergyman is Rev. C. A. Militzer, of Allegan. The trustees are Adam Raab, Fred'k Low, Jacob Milheim. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. A survey of the township was made in January, 1832, by Lucius Lyon, and the first lands were entered on sec tion 31 in 1834. Township No. 4, in range 13, was at first embraced in Allegan and afterwards in Monterey ; but by an act of the Legislature approved on the 10th day of October, 1855, it became a separate civil township by the name of Salem. The first township-meeting was held at the house of James Burnip on the 7th day of April, 1856. L. P. Brown was chosen moderator, Henry Wilson inspector of election, and Henry Bear clerk. The ballot resulted as follows: For Supervisor, L. P. Brown ; Clerk of the Township, Henry Bear ; Treasurer, James Burnip ; Justices of the Peace, Henry Wilson, John Schwagert; Highway Com missioners, A. A. Goodman, Robert Pettingall, Aaron Bas sett; School Inspectors, A. A. Goodman, Isaiah Mannes; Director of the Poor, Thomas Henton ; Constables, Florida Henton, A. A. Goodman, Abner Hunt, Jacob Brandegam. The remaining township officers until the present time are as follows : CHURCH OF GOD. This church was first organized by D. W. Lincoln and wife, with a membership of twelve persons, in 1868, the early meetings having been held in the school-house at Burnip's Corners. The first officers elected were Charles Fisher, Ruling Elder; William Heck and Wesley Moored, Deacons. The following preachers have since that time officiated as pastors: Elders J. H. Basore, R. H. Boston, B. D. Bright, Irons, S. D. C. Jackson, J. E. Moffit, William Reading, A. J. Hull (the present pastor), and C. C. Lindsley, asso ciate pastor. Elders J. Omens, II. Oliver, and J. M. B. Gillespie have also officiated in the same capacity. SUPERVISORS. 1857-58, L. P.

He also purchased an extensive tract of pine timber, located adjacent to the mills. Mr. Heck was married Sept. 20, 1869, to Miss Helen McDon ald, formerly of Sturges, Mich., and later of Allegan County. Three children brighten their hearth, Ernest J., Lulu J., and a babe. Mr. Heck has occasionally filled township offices, but prefers the quiet of his own home circle to the cares and excitements of public life. SCHOOL INSPECTORS. 1857, L. P.

The father of the enterprising citizen of Salem, Mr. William Heck, was a native of Cumberland Co., Pa., and removed to Hancock Co., Ohio, in 1844, where he con ducted an extensive farming and milling enterprise. He has since retired from active commercial life, and is enjoy ing a competency as the result of his industry, having chosen Findley, Ohio, as his residence. William, the fifth in order of the children, was born in Hancock Co., Ohio, Feb. 28, 1845. He became at the age of eighteen a part ner with his father in milling pursuits, and two years later purchased the entire interest, which he conducted for three years. A brother-in-law then became the owner, and Mr. Heck in 1S68, with his brother George, removed to Salem, Allegan Co., having the fall previously purchased the mill site of Edward Lutts where now stand the Little Rabbit Mills. They began at once the arduous labor of clearing, erecting a dam, and constructing a saw-mill which was in successful operation the year following. 1857, Wm. Goodman, Thomas Hinton; 1858, Amos Truce.

The succeeding year the flouring-mills were built, a delay having been inevitable as the result of serious injury to the dam which occurred a short time previously. In March, 1872, the copartnership between the brothers was dissolved and a harmonious division of the property took place, Wil liam having retained the flouring-mill. He has since that erected a comfortable and commodious dwelling, which is illustrated in this work. Mr. Heck has during his leisure hours developed con siderable power of invention, and succeeded in perfecting a self-feeding furnace which enables him to use corn-cobs as a substitute for other fuel. It. is the first successful BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. invention of this character, aud letters patent have been granted to the projector. GEORGE HECK. Mr. Heck Avas married Dec. 31, 1866, to Miss Elmira Twining, a former resident of Hancock Co., Ohio. Ida G., Hattie H., and Dellie D. are the only surviving children of their pleasant family circle, two daughters and an only son, Cartia, having died early. Mr. Heck is devoted to his business projects, and gives but little attention to public life. For enterprise and business capacity none of the residents of Salem take higher rank than do the brothers Heck, who were natives of Ohio, having both been born in Hancock County, in that State. The birth of George, the younger, occurred Feb. 22, 1850, the seventh in a family of ten"], [450, "saugatuck; ready to barter game, furs, and sugar for the white man's goods. Butler had brought but feAV goods with him, but had some whisky, which latter suited the red man better than anything else, and the demand for it was unfailing. This township, which was the earliest one settled in Alle gan County, was surveyed as township 3 north, range 16 west. It is bounded on the north by Laketown, south by Ganges, east by Manlius, and west by the waters of Lake Michigan. We may designate Mr. Butler as the first permanent resident of the county. There were already some French traders with the Indians within the county limits, but these did not locate with a view to permanent residence, and are therefore not counted as settlers. Mr. Butler, on the other hand, although for several years he did nothing but trade with the Indians, had purchased land with the intention of remaining after the Indians had gone \u2014 as he did. It was doubtless the presence of a natural harbor that led Mr. Butler to locate where he did, for it appears that he counted from the first upon founding a village there. It is also likely that the abundance of hemlock bark and ship timber near at hand strengthened his hopes touching the ultimate importance of the place. However that may have been, it is certain that the capitalists who came a few years later were attracted by the opportunities for lumber ing and tanning which existed in the vicinity, and which were promptly improved, those occupations having for nearly fifty years been important factors in promoting the prosperity of the Saugatuck country. It contains two incorporated villages, Saugatuck and Douglas, situated on either side of Kalamazoo Lake, three miles by the course of the stream from the mouth of the river of that name, but less than a mile from the lake-shore. These villages are important shipping-points for lumber and fruit, and, although without immediate railway facilities, have easy water communication with all important lake points by steamers and sailing-vessels throughout the sea son of navigation. A regular line of steamers, owned and managed by Captain R. C. Brittain, plies between the two villages mentioned and Chicago. The lumber business, which has been very important, is now declining, but the loss on that account has been made good by the rapid develop ment of fruit-culture. The peach-producing qualities of Western Allegan are remarkably conspicuous, even in so cele brated a fruit- bearing State as Michigan, and that section is likely to improve materially in value for an indefinite time to come. Although general farming is carried on to some extent, the cultivation of fruit \u2014 especially peaches \u2014 is the great feature in rural industry throughout the township of Saugatuck. Mr. Butler's business with the Indians frequently took him away from home, and sometimes he was obliged to be absent several days, his wife meanwhile remaining alone with her children in their log cabin, a voluntary exile from her race, her only neighbors Indians, and her only sur roundings the forest. For three years the Butlers lived by the side of the river, the only white inhabitants in the Avestern part of the county, and during that time Mrs. Butler saw no woman's face save the dusky countenances of Indian squaws, who visited her frequently, and with whom, as well as with the braves, she was on the most kindly terms of friendship. The Kalamazoo River is navigable for large craft to the two villages named, where it expands into a lake, and is also navigable to Richmond for light-draught steamers, al though latterly not much used for that purpose. The town ship sought, in 1869, by an offered donation of $40,000, to bring the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad within its borders, but other influences prevailed, and close railway communication is still a much-desired privilege. SAUGATUCK VILLAGE\u2014 ITS ORIGIN AND EARLY SETTLEMENT. Although Mr. Butler succeeded well enough in his trade with the Indians and experienced no extraordinary hard ships, he was always greatly troubled when brought face to face with the stern necessity of going to mill. During the first part of his sojourn at Saugatuck he was obliged to go to Elkhart, Ind., seventy-five miles distant, for that pur. pose, and the long, tedious, and difficult journey was always looked forward to with great dislike. William G. Butler, of Hartford, Conn., came to the site of Saugatuck village as the first white settler, in the spring of 1830.f Mr. Butler had pre-empted the tract now occu pied by the village, and brought his wife and two children with him by way of the lakes, a vessel landing him with his family and household effects at the mouth of the river. He speedily erected a log cabin a spot now in the mid dle of the street in front of the Saugatuck House, and began at once the business of trading with the Indians, who swarmed in great numbers in that region, and were always Until the year 1834 the Butler family continued to be the only white inhabitants of this section, but early in that year there came Edward Johonnett and R. R. Crosby, who built in company a tauuery on the river, near where Wil liams & Griffin's saw-mill now stands.

Mr. Plummer re mained in town until 1849, when he took the California fever and migrated to the far West. Mr. Johonnett lived in a framed house on the spot now occupied by the Odd- Fellows' building, and Crosby (who was a bachelor) lived with him. tanners, Daniel Plummer, and Palmer and Mayo, the latter being two fishermen and Indian-traders living at the river's mouth. Benjamin Plummer. like his brother Daniel, was a carpenter, and after working at his trade two years started a saw-mill northeast of the village, where he remained until 1846. He then abandoned the mill and removed to his present home. Mr. and Mrs. Plummer, who have shared the vicissitudes of pioneer life forty-six years, have been man and wise no less than fifty-three years. In July, 1834, Stephen D. Nichols, who had for a year been living in St. Joseph, Mich., came down the lake-shore with H. F. Comstock, landed at the mouth of the Kala mazoo, and made a prospecting tour up the river. They found on the site of Saugatuck Johonnett & Crosby's tan nery, and the houses of the Butlers, Plummers, and Jo honnetts. Nichols concluded to take up 160 acres on sec tion 17, and agreed with Comstock that the latter should put up a warehouse for the former at the mouth of the river ; this course being suggested by the fact that settlers bound for the up river country had begun to arrive, and there seemed a decided necessity for a warehouse and pier, since there were no conveniences for the landing of goods at the mouth of the river, and captains of vessels did not at that time like to venture into the stream. Having determined upon a plan of action, Nichols and Comstock engaged an Indian to take them up the lake in a canoe to St. Joseph, whence Nichols proceeded with all speed to the East. Nichols returned in September of the same year with his family, and located permanently at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River, on the north side. There he began straightway to erect a warehouse and dock. There was no saw-mill in the vicinity, and for Nichols' warehouse, as well as for the framed houses previously built by Plummer and Johonnett, the lumber was brought doAvn the river from Pine Creek, one mile below Otsego. In 1844, A. S. Wells and 0. R. Johnson built a tannery near Plummer's sawmill and carried it on until 1854, when it passed into the possession of C. C. Wallin & Sons, the present proprietors. THE TILLAGE LAID OUT. Previous to the coming of Nichols and the creation of the warehouse traffic, Butler had, in 1833, platted a village upon his pre-empted property, and called it Kalamazoo. Soon afterwards Henry Hoffman, of Niles, Jasper Mason, of St. Joseph, and John Griffith, of New York, purchased an interest in the village property, of which, however, But ler still retained a share.* A post-office was established at the village in 1835, upon application of R. R. Crosby, who was commissioned postmaster Aug. 4, 1835, the original commission being now in possession of S. A. Morrison, Esq. At his suggestion the office was called Saugatuck, an In dian word meaning \" mouth of river.\" The village re tained the name of Kalamazoo until the incorporation of the village now bearing that name. Being then deprived of it by the greater celebrity of the latter place, it was called Newark, after the township in which it was located. This appellation was retained until 1863, when the name of both township and village was changed to Saugatuck. William G. Butler, the founder of the town, continued to be one of its prominent citizens until his death, in 1857, when he was killed while engaged in log-rolling. The warehouse was at first used principally for the storing of the household effects of settlers moving by way of the lakes to the up-river country, but ere long there sprang up a driving business in connection with the re shipment of flour coming down the river to be forwarded around the lakes. William G. Butler sought to share the business controlled by Nichols, and early in 1835 built a Avarehouse on the river-bank, two miles from the mouth, but the location Avas a poor one, and the enterprise was sub stantially a failure. Meanwhile, Nichols opened a store near his warehouse, and affairs in that vicinity took on such a lively aspect that there Avas strong talk of starting a town there, but the project never resulted in anything more definite in shape than a plat on paper. In the month of May, 1837, Stephen A. Morrison came from Vermont to Saugatuck for the purpose of starting a tannery, having learned that the country thereabout was famous for hemlock-bark. Upon reaching that place he found Johonnett & Crosby already engaged in tanning, and so, instead of starting a fresh enterprise, he bought out that firm. He carried on the business on the old site about five years, when he removed the business to his present location, where he has ever since been employed in the same occupation. Saugatuck village improved slowly at first, and when Singapore reared its prosperous front the former place was completely overshadowed, and could scarcely be called more than a lumber-camp. In 1 837 about the only business it boasted Avas that of getting out ship-timber, and, although Stephen D. Nichols had a small store at the mouth of the river and sold a few goods from his house on Hoffman Street in the village, the inhabitants usually traded at Singapore, for at the latter place only was there a mer cantile establishment of even moderate pretensions. About 1842, Butler built a warehouse on the south side of the river, opposite that of Nichols, and until 1846 both concerns carried on a profitable business in shipping and receiving freight. In that year the completion of the Michigan Central Railroad to Kalamazoo greatly injured the river traffic, and iu 1848, when that road was finished to Niles, the forwarding business at the mouth of the river came to an end, unless indeed we include the fonvardiug of rafts. One of Saugatuck 's pioneers, Benjamin Plummer, now living in Ganges, relates how he came to the village with his wife in the fall of 1834, and found residing there and at the mouth of the river the families of William G. Butler, Stephen D. Nichols, Johonnett &, Crosby, the \u00bb The plat was recorded on the 17th of July, 1S34, in the register's office of Kalamazoo County, to which Allegan County was then at tached.

In 1836, Benjamin Plummer built a saw-mill on the site of Wallin's tannery, on section 3, and in 1837 he and Edward Johonnett operated it. During the next summer the business of rafting lumber and square timber down the river to the lake set in in earnest, and for some years con tinued to be an important industry. haps, Grand River. Kalamazoo Lake, three miles from the river's mouth, is half a mile wide by three-fourths of a mile long, being large enough to contain at one time all the vessels sailing on the lake, and having an ample depth of water to accommodate the largest of them. THE PIONEER VILLAGERS. SHIP-BUILDING. In 1837 Saugatuck contained, besides numerous Indians, the families of W. G. Butler, Daniel and Benjamin Plum mer, Johonnett & Crosby, Stephen A. Morrison, a Mrs. Jones, and Jas. McLaughlin (a ship-carpenter), besides a floating population of lumbermen and other laborers, with out families. Ship-timber being abundant near Saugatuck, ship-builders came hither early, led by James McLaughlin, who built at Saugatuck a lumber-vessel which he called the \" Crook.\" Carter & Co., the successors of the Wilders at Singapore, built at that point a lake-vessel for carrying lumber, and named it the \" Octavia.\" About that time other \\Tessels were built at Saugatuck and Singapore, and in 1842 Porter & Co. built at Singapore a flat-bottom steamboat, named the \" C. C. Trowbridge,\" and intended for the trade between Sau gatuck and Allegan. That attempt at steam navigation on the river was, however, a failure, and after a few trips de monstrated it to be so the \" Trowbridge\" was transferred to other scenes. In 1846 the village, showing but slight improvement, still boasted the presence of some Indian families, and of those of Morrison, M. B. Spencer, Butler, Nichols, Mc- Laughlin, and Saml. Underwood (a shoemaker). The place made exceedingly slow progress, and at one period not long aster 1837 was abandoned by almost all its inhab itants except Mr. Morrison's family. A second attempt in the same direction, made with the \" Adelaide,\" built at Allegan, met with better results, and from that time forward until 1869 steamboats plied with more or less regularity between Saugatuck and Allegan each season. First and last, a large number of sailing-ves sels and steamers have been built at Saugatuck. Generally the steamers have been tugs, although several lake-propel lers and lumber-barges have been constructed there, and several grain-carrying vessels of the larger class have figured in the list. The year 1879 was rn especially busy one in ship building at Saugatuck. A RIVER CALAMITY. On the 25th of July, 1841, John Billings, with his wife and six children, the wife of McLaughlin the ship-builder, with her child, R. A. McDonald, and an Irishman (name unknown) were passing up the river in a small boat, when the craft accidentally capsized, and five of the twelve persons on board were drowned, viz. : Mrs. Billings, three of her children, and Mrs. McLaughlin.

As already noted, the natural harbor at Saugatuck early invited attention. The general government was called upon to assist in the improvement of the harbor and river, and down to January, 1880, had expended over $100,000 for that purpose. The people of the locality have also expended upwards of $30,000 upon the river and harbor, but all the necessary works are not yet erected. Although vessels of moderate draft may now enter the harbor, there is need of an extension of the south pier at least four hun dred feet to admit craft of a larger class, and to this end Congress is now being appealed to for further help. The volume of water discharged by the Kalamazoo River is claimed to be greater than that of any other stream empty ing into Lake Michigan on the eastern coast, except, per- THE LIGHT-HOUSE. In 1838 the government erected at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River a stone light-house, the site of which is now covered by a portion of the south pier, the channel being now twenty rods north of where it was in 1838. Stephen D. Nichols was appointed the first keeper, aud re tained the place about six years. In 1859 the tower began to show signs of decay, and was replaced by a brick struc ture. The latter wore out in turn, and was succeeded in 1875 by the wooden tower now adorning the extremity of the south pier."], [455, "SAUGATUCK TOWNSHIP. 327 THE PROGRESS OF TRADE. of Ganges. The first adult person who died was the wise of William G. Butler. Until 1851, when S. D. Nichols built and opened a store in the village, Saugatuck boasted no such establishment of any pretensions whatever, and until that year the villagers generally did their trading at the mouth of the river or at Singapore. In 1854, Wells & Johnson, the mill-proprietors at Saugatuck, opened a general store at that place, much to the gratification of the townspeople. After that the vil lage began to grow and stores to multiply. The first marriage was that of John C. Wooster, a lum berman, and Ruth Johonnett, in June, 1837. The second was that of S. A. Morrison and Elizabeth Peckham. They were married in the public hall at Singapore, by Rev. Mr. West, of Otsego. Mr. West was a Universalist preacher, and used to come over from Otsego now and then to hold services in the hall at Singapore, which was also occasion ally occupied by the Methodists for the same purpose. When Wayne Coates came in 1849, and opened a drug store in a house built by Daniel Plummer, there was no store nearer than Nichols', at the mouth of the river, or Artemas Carter's, at Singapore. Tlje town was a forest, and included only the families of William G. Butler, S. A. Morrison, Samuel Underwood, Elias Jl. Dibble, 31. B. Spencer, and perhaps one or two others. In 1865 there were the stores of John Burns, S. A. Morrison, B. W. Phillips, R. F. Kleeman, and H. D. Moore; Dunning & Hopkins and H. D. Moore's saw-mills; Ebmeyer & Ruffin and Blanchard's shingle-mills ; a pail-stave manufactory ; and two hotels. Main Street from Nichols' to Morrison's had but two or three buildings, and beyond Dunning's saw mill the land was covered with growing timber. The village now contains a dozen mercantile establishments of all kinds, which carry on a business of no insignificant proportions. The school-house near Singapore was the first one built in the town. Previous to its erection Jane Powers taught the children of some of the settlers, as did Elizabeth Peck ham, who came from Allegan in response to a request from Benjamin Plummer, and taught in the house of the latter, near his saw-mill. A Methodist Episcopal society, now extinct, was organ ized in Saugatuck village about 1865, and endured until 1875. BeA's. Loomis, Benson, Hoyt, Cawthorne, Thurston, Cowen, and Pengally were among the earlier pastors. Rev. Mr. Cawthorne came hither, viii the lake, from Muskegon, with his family and household effects, on board a tug. While entering the river the tug capsized, and Mr. Caw thorne's two children Avere drowned. YILLAGE PHYSICIANS. Dr. Chauncey B. Goodrich, who came to Saugatuck in 1843 and entered upon the practice of medicine, was the first physician of the village. He soon removed to Ganges, but remained for many years the only physician in the western part of the county. He died in Ganges in 1879. His successor in village practice was Dr. Flowers, who made his appearance at Saugatuck in 1857, and practiced there until his death, in 1859. Dr. S L. Morris followed him, and remained until 1865. Dr. H. H. Stimson, who began to practice iu the county in 1853, went to Saugatuck from the eastern part of Allegan in 1860, and since that time has been steadily in practice there. GRIST-MILL. The only grist-mill built at Saugatuck village was erected iu 1866 by George P. Heath, and destroyed by fire in November, 1879. SAUGATUCK POST-OFFICE. A post-office was established at Saugatuck, as already mentioned, in August, 1835, and R. R. Crosby appointed postmaster. The mail-bag was in those days seldom very well filled, and, in fact, for a considerable period came down the river from Allegan upon rafts at such uncertain and irregular times as were most convenient. Dr. J. B. Cook, who is still a Saugatuck physician, entered upon his professional service in that village in 1862. After him came Dr. David McLean, who made but a brief stay, and then passed OA*er to Douglas, where he tarried until 1879. Dr. Alex. McRca,who came to Saugatuck in 1865, remained until 1871. Dr. R. Pengally, and his son-in-law, Dr. Charles Chamberlain, began practice in 1871, and moved away in 1873. Dr. Charles F. Stinson practiced from 1872 to 1879, when he died. Dr. E. B. Wright, who died in Saugatuck in 1S79, had practiced in the village eleven years. The village practice is at present confined chiefly to Drs. H. H. Stimson and J. B. Cook, the only resident In 1840, Samuel Morrison was appointed mail-carrier, and rode at regularly appointed dates on horseback between Saugatuck and Allegan. William G. Butler succeeded Crosby, and then followed S. A. Morrison, who gave place in 1860 to Ward. Samuel Johnson was the next occupant of the office, being followed successively by B. W. Phillips, S. A. Morrison (second term), Hiram Ellis, Samuel Johnson (second term), William V. Johnson, and George T. Arnold, the present incumbent. PORT OF ENTRY. In 1870, Saugatuck was made a port of entry, and in that year H. R. Ellis was appointed collector of customs. The present collector is George T. Arnold. physicians. YILLAGE LAWYERS. Saugatuck's first resident lawyer was a Mr. Pratt, who opened an office in 1868, went shortly afterwards -to Hol land village, and lives now in Grand Haven. His successor, J. S. Manry, came iu 1871, and remained two years. He now lives in Nebraska. The third lawyer was R. L. Newn ham, who came in 1876, and is yet in practice. The only other resident lawyer is D. A. Winslow, who removed to the village from St. Joseph, Mich., in February, 1880. FIRST BIRTH, MARRIAGE, Ere. The first white child born in the township was a daughter of William G. Butler. Her birth occurred in the fall of 1834, and her death early in 1835, she being also the first white person to die in the township. The second birth was that of Andrew, son of Benjamin Plummer, on the 1st day of Jauuary, 1835. He is now a resident of the township"], [456, "328 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

The church was organized Avithout delay, and included the following members : Rev. C. H. Eaton, F. B. Wallin, Moses Philbrook, Alanson Gardner, Mrs. M. F. Eaton, Mrs. Orcetia Wallin, Mrs. Mary Philbrook, Mrs. Marila Gardner, Mr. and Mrs. Elnathan Judson, John Harris, Mrs. Hannah Cook, Andrew Alexander, Miss Sarah Jane Cowles. In 1840, Moses Nichols kept a tavern at the mouth of the river, and in the same year S. A. Morrison's residence at Saugatuck was commonly regarded as a house of enter tainment where travelers could find lodging and refreshment, but no spirituous liquors. Mr. Morrison kept open house in that fashion until 1852, when by the donation of a vil lage lot he induced R. S. Smith, of Battle Creek, to come over and build the Saugatuck House. Mr. Smith was ac cidentally drowned in the Kalamazoo River. The first pastor was Rev. C. H. Eaton, and the first deacons Alanson Gardner and F. B. Wallin. Rev. J. C. Myers succeeded Mr. Eaton in May, 1862, and remained in charge until 1868. Rev. J. F. Taylor then entered upon the pastorate, and continued in it until 1878. Rev. W. C. Allen followed for a brief season, and then came Rev. W. B. Sutherland, the present pastor. VILLAGE ORGANIZATION. Saugatuck village was incorporated by the board of su pervisors of Allegan County in 1868, and on the first Tuesday in March of that year the first election was held. H. B. Moore was chosen President ; Hiram R. Ellis, Clerk ; Diodet Rogers, Treasurer; R. B. Newnham, Marshal; and George E. Dunn, James Hibbodine, Solomon Stanton, Warren Cook, S. A. Morrison, and Samuel Johnson, Trus tees. In 1869, H. B. Moore was President; Hiram R. Ellis, Clerk ; and J. M. Pond, Marshal. In the winter of 1869-70 the village was reincorporated by an act of the Legislature. The records having been destroyed by fire, a complete list of the village officials cannot be obtained. The following gentlemen have sen*ed as presidents, clerks, and treasurers during the years mentioned : During the summer after its organization the society built a church edifice, which was the first house of worship erected in the town. In it also was held Saugatuck's first \" war-meeting\" upon the outbreak of the Rebellion, in 1861. The deacons of the church are F. B. Wallin, H. L. House, and George E. Dunn. The trustees are George E. Dunn, F. B. Wallin, H. L. House, H. D. Moore, George H. Thomas, and M. B. Williams. The membership numbers about 80. THE FIRST DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH. PRESIDENTS.

THE FIRE RECORD. Saugatuck has been frequently visited with serious con flagrations, including (aside from those which have merely destroyed dwellings) the burning of H. D. Moore's store in 1866 ; that of O. R. Johnson & Co.'s large store and the Empire Billiard-Room, with a large public hall, in 1876; that of the Ebmeyer shingle-mill, Kleeman's store, and Miller's saloon in the same year; that of S. H. Mor rison's store in 1879 ; and that of Heath's grist-mill, also in 1879. ALL SAINTS* (EPISCOPAL) CHURCH. This organization was formed in September, 1868, by J. R. Taylor, who was chosen as the first rector, and who continued in charge until 1878, when he was succeeded by Rev. E. W. Flower, the present rector. The members of the church at the organization were O. R. Johnson and wife, F. B. Stockbridge and wife, R. B. Newnham and wife, H, H. Stimpson and wife, J. F. Geer, A. B. Taylor, William Dunning and wife, Mrs. Breuckman, Mrs. Merrill, Thomas Donald and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Moses Nash, Pierce Abbey, Mr. and Mrs. S. G. Moreland, David White and wife, Isaac Wilson and wife. The village school-house was used as a house of worship until January, 1873, when the edifice now in use was first occupied. Its cost was about $4000. The first wardens were Robert G. Annesley and Pierce Abbey. RELIGIOUS. FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. In accordance with previous notice, a meeting was held at the Saugatuck school-house on the 11th of January, 1860, to consider the propriety of organizing a Congrega tional Church. Rev.

'6 THE SAUGATUCK FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE SAUGATUCK RED RIBBON CLUB. In January, 1871, the village purchased a hook-and-lad der apparatus and placed it in charge of the marshal, the villagers at large being the working force whenever the machine was called into service. Shortly afterwards 200 pails were bought at public expense, and distributed in convenient places for use in case of fire. In 1873 a Bab cock extinguisher was purchased, and a fire department organized with 30 members, of which James M. Pond was chief engineer, and A. H. Gardner first assistant. The extinguisher, which cost $2000, proved a failure, and was replaced with a hand-engine and hose-cart, which now do efficient service. The engine company has 32 members, A. H. Gardner being the foreman. J. P. Hancock is the foreman of the hose company, which is also provided with a hook-and-ladder apparatus. It has 8 members. The chief engineer of the department is John Wilson. This organization was formed in April, 1879, by Dr. Reynolds, a noted temperance working advocate ; Morri son's Hall, the scene of the first meeting, being crowded with an enthusiastic assembly. About 80 persons enrolled themselves as members of the club, and chose Capt. Reu ben T. Rogers president and C. B. Scott secretary. The club has continued to flourish to the present time, and through the medium of weekly public assemblies, at which literary and musical entertainment is offered, promotes the cause of temperance in a very satisfactory manner. THE AVOMEN'S CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION. This association of the ladies of Saugatuck was organ ized March 19, 1879, and the hearty encouragement it has received is shown by the fact that it now contains 90 work ing members. Weekly business sessions are held, and every Sunday a gospel-meeting invites the attendance of the general public. The officers are Mrs. H. D. Moore, President; Mrs. George E. Dunn, Mrs. C. E.

As long ago as 1835, or perhaps before, William G. Butler stoutly maintained that the country in the neigh borhood of Saugatuck was well adapted to the growth of peaches, and he predicted, moreover, that the region round about would one day be famous and wealthy as a fruit producing district. That Mr. Butler was right in his conclusions time has abundantly proven. Peaches were cultivated to a moderate degree for home consumption in 1840, and were thus grown in a small way every year thereafter, but it was not until about 1869 that the culture of the peach was made an important commercial industry, and thus it has expanded annually to the present time into an enterprise which engages the attention of thousands of people, lays under tribute a vast area of country, and yields yearly the return of thousands of dollars. SAUGATUCK ENCAMPMENT, No. 60, I. O. O. F. Saugatuck Encampment was instituted Aug. 7, 1873, with William Corner, Samuel Clipson, Isaac Wilson, J. A. Houtcamp, John Wilson, H. Ebmeyer, John Priest, A. B. Titus, and Charles H. Chamberlain as the first members. The first officers were H. Ebmeyer, C. P. ; Isaac Wilson, H. P. ; John Wilson, S. W. ; John Priest, J. W. ; Samuel Clipson, Treas. The membership is now 24, and the offi cers as follows : Karl Ebmeyer, C. P. ; J. B. Cook, H. P. ; A. B. Titus, S. W. ; J. G. Williams, J. W. ; J. M. Pond, Scribe ; John Priest, Treas. The fruit-belt under consideration includes those por tions of Allegan and Van Buren Counties bordering Lake Michigan, and, according to reports gathered at the close of the season of 1879, included 600,000 peach-trees, yielding an estimated product of 3,000,000 baskets of fruit yearly. Reports made to the Saugatuck and Ganges Pomological Society, November, 1879, set forth that in Saugatuck 1200 acres were set to peach-trees, and that over 400 acres were in full bearing. Estimating 100 trees per acre, and SAUGATUCK LODGE, No. 328, F. AND A. M. This lodge was demitted from Dutcher Lodge, of Doug las, and instituted Jan. 26, 1876, with James G. Williams, W.

From similar reports it is learned that in Western Allegan during 1879 there were Saugatuck and Douglas. At the former place they have an extensiA'e tannery, which employs about 20 men, its business reaching as high as 30,000 hides yearly. At Douglas they employ 10 men in a tannery confined to the production of sole leather, which uses about 15,000 hides annually. Among other manufacturing interests in Sau gatuck, now extinct, two important ones were H. D. Moore's extensive saw-mill and the shingle-mill of Ebmeyer & Palzer, both early enterprises. shipments of peaches as follows : Baskets. Crates.

SINGAPORE\u2014 A DESERTED VILLAGE. On the map of Saugatuck township there appears in the northwestern corner the village of Singapore, once a thriv ing, bustling place, now abandoned by eA'erybody save a few fishermen, who abide there temporarily during the fishing seasons. In 1837, Oshea Wilder and sons, of New York, purchased of the Barnes family (the patentees) consider able tracts of land in Saugatuck township, and proceeded to lay out a village which they called Singapore. They arranged to build a large saw-mill at that point, succeeded in disposing of a good many village lots, and induced quite a number of settlers to locate there. The mill was built as promised, tenements were erected for the mill hands, a store was opened by the mill company, and Singapore started upon its career amid a great flourish of trumpets and a promise of much prosperity. The mill company, known as the New York and Michigan Lumber Company, flour ished so well that in 1839 they started the Singapore Bank, of which Daniel Wilder was chosen president, and Robert Hill cashier. A good deal of money was issued by the bank in the shape of handsome-looking notes, which were paid out for mill labor and taken in again at the company's store, but which belonged, nevertheless, to the kind of currency known as \" wildcat,\" although that particular species of wildcat is said to have been a trifle better than the average. Stephen D. Nichols, who invested in two 80 acre lots of wild land in support of the bank, says that the money was good enough at home, but \" bless you, you couldn't travel on it any farther than you could on a piece of sandstone.\" Among the prominent peach-growers of Saugatuck township may be mentioned Williams & Son, R. M. Moore, P. Purdy, Sophia Schultz, Thomas Gray, J. Crouse, Robert Reid and F. C. Kile, William Corner, William Cummings, Joshua Weed, Dressier & Patcher. Williams & Son and R. M. Moore, having respectively about 10,000 trees, are ranked the largest producers. LUMBERING. As has been seen, this was, during the pioneer period, the most important business, not only of Saugatuck, but of all Western Allegan, and it continued so for many years. Saugatuck was, until a few years ago, a place of many saw mills, but the gradual exhaustion of the timber caused the decline of the business, until now there are in Saugatuck and Douglas but three mills, and for two of these the sup ply is becoming very scanty. The first steam saw-mill built in Saugatuck village or vicinity was erected in 1846, by M. B. Spencer, upon the site now occupied by the mill of Williams, Griffin & Co. Mr. Spencer had also a lumber yard at the mouth of the river. He carried on the mill until 1850, when he sold it to Wells & Johnson. Williams, Griffin & Johnson carry on at Saugatuck the saw-mill put up in 1852 by Dunning & Hopkins. Here 40 men are employed in turning out lumber, shingles, lath, and siding. The capacity of the mill is about 52,000 feet of lumber daily. This firm is likely to continue in the business at Saugatuck for some years, as it has an assured and ample stock of logs. Of course the bank came to grief, as did Wilder & Co., together with all their enterprises, but James G. Carter & Co., who soon purchased the various interests, still kept Singapore alive. Its struggle for existence was, however, a hard one, and, although it was not utterly abandoned until 1875, it suffered a serious decline long before that period. The last mill-owners were Stockbridge & Johnson, who continued business at Singapore until the year last named. The stock of desirable timber being then pretty well ex hausted, they removed their mill machinery to Mackinaw, and with their departure Singapore breathed its last. Ebmeyer & Neis now control the Douglas mill-property, owned in 1879 by Gray & Crouse. From 30 to 40 men were employed during the busy periods of 1879, and about 50.000 feet of lumber were cut daily. In connection with the saw-mill, there are also large lath- and shingle-mills. H. B. Moore likewise has at Douglas a saw-mill and shingle mill, employing an average of 25 men. The basket-factory and planing-mill started at Douglas by Weed & King is now carried on by William Weed. He manufactured in 1879 about 30,000 fruit-baskets. OTHER MANUFACTURES. THE INDIANS. Hutchinson Bros. & Co. have at Douglas a fine grist mill containing five run of stone, and devoted to merchant as well as custom-work. The site was previously occupied by Crawford McDonald with a grist-mill, of which the present firm became the owners in 1877, and which they have materially enlarged. The vicinity of the mouth of Kalamazoo was, from a period long anterior to the first settlement of the whites down to 1840 or later, a great gathering-place for the Ot tawa and some Pottawattamie Indians, who came thither from Mackinaw every autumn, scattered through the coun try to the eastward to hunt during the winter, and returned to the mouth of the river in the spring. A full account of C. C. Wallin & Son are largely engaged in tanning at"], [459, "SAUGATUCK TOWNSHIP. 331 these migrations, of the habits of the Indians, and of the trading-posts which formerly existed along the Kalamazoo, will be found in Chapters VII. and IX. of the general history. As late as 1842 there existed near Saugatuck several Indian mounds, but the plowshares of the settlers soon obliterated these relics of primeval days. On the hills opposite Saugatuck there were visible until recently traces of Indian graves, and among them that of a chief called Wamnus, but there is now no sign to show where they were. rate the town of Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man. Thus it appears there were two villages, known as Douglas and Dudleyville, separated only by the width of a single street. By these names they were known until the incor poration of the entire tract as Douglas, in which were in cluded, besides the two village plats, Spencer's and other ad ditions. William Bush, who was interested with Dutcher in the saw-mill, opened a store near the mill, the first one in the village. Shortly aster 1861, Wade built the tavern called the Douglas House, the mill business began to expand, Daniel Gerber started the tannery now owned by Wallin & Sons, and the locality soon began to assume a village like appearance, although in 1861 the families wefe still but few in number. The building, by H. F. Marsh, of the saw-mill now owned by H. B. Moore, materially aided the advancement of the village, but it was not until the region round about began to develop as a rich fruit-country that Douglas attained decided prominence. Since that time the village has been an important shipping-point for fruit as well as lumber, and, although the latter interest is declin ing, the former is destined to remain permanently valuable. THE MANIA FOR VILLAGES. In illustration of the Western fever for paper villages from 1835 to 1838, it may be noted that in addition to Singapore (which did really become a village) there were the paper town of Kalamazoo Harbor, laid out at the mouth of the river, the town of Naples, on the river near Singa pore, laid out by parties now forgotten, and the city of Breese, also on the river, a mile or so above Saugatuck, the site being owned by a Mrs. Breese. These towns were handsomely depicted upon paper, and were represented to new-comers and people living at a distance as being very promising commercial localities, but, unfortunately for their projectors, they failed to delude anybody, and never rose above the condition of paper villages. The village now has two stores, kept respectively by Thomas Gray and D. C. Putnam. Mr. Putnam was ap pointed the postmaster at Douglas when a post-office was established there, in 1868, and has held the position from that time until this. The town contains a fine Masonic hall, a union school, two churches, two large saw-mills, a tannery, a basket-factory, a grist-mill, and the ordinary minor village industries. SETTLEMENTS IN THE SOUTH. Settlements in the southern portion of the township did not begin until some years after the pioneers began to gather at Saugatuck and Singapore. On the town-line road, and near there, H. S. Braman, James C. Hale, William Corner, Horace Fuller, William AVhite, Henry Oliver, and Josiah Martin (an early resident in Singapore) were among the first to locate themselves and become permanent residents. On the lake-shore the list of pioneers included Robert Reid, James McVey (now living in Ganges), John Strahan, J. W. Gill, the Kiles, and others. R. A. McDonald and Wm. Scovell have already been alluded to, while among other early comers may be mentioned John Renter, II. Weeks, the Kiles, Henry Smith, Philetas Purdy, R. M. Moore, William Plummer, William Cummings, J. S. Crouse, and F. Schultz. The oldest settlers now living in the village are M. B. Spencer and John Ryan, who became residents in 1861. LAAVYERS AND DOCTORS. David McLean, the first physician of Douglas, opened his office in 1864, and practiced until 1879, being the only doctor in the village. Upon Dr. McLean's retirement, Dr. A. H. Parks, the present resident physician, took posses sion of the field. W. A. Woodworth, the only lawyer who has ever resided in the village, located there in 1876, and is still in business there. DOUGLAS VILLAGE. The first settlers upon the site of Douglas village, and indeed the first settlers in Saugatuck township on that side the lake, were R. A. McDonald and William Scovill, who, in 1847, settled upon land in section 16, located for them the year before by M. B. Spencer. That was, however, long before the village of Douglas was even thought of. Mr. Scovill is dead, but Mr. McDonald still lives on section 22. The first effort towards creating a village at that point was made by Jonathan Wade, in 1851. He bought lot 3 on section 16, built a house thereon, interested Wells and Johnson in the project, and set about building a saw-mill on the site now occupied by Ebmeyer & Neis' mill. He then laid out a village on the south half of his lot, and called it Dudleyville, in honor of his brother, Dudley Wade, of Canada. Presently, William F. Dutcher bought the north half of Wade's lot, including the mill, and on that tract laid out a village, Avhich he named Douglas at the suggestion of F. H. May, who wished thus to commemo- VILLAGE INCORPORATION. During August and September, 1870, the citizens of Douglas met several times to consider the matter of in corporating the village, and appointed C. A. Ensign, D. W. Wiley, and David Porter, Sr., an executive committee on the subject. Upon the prayer of the citizens the village was incorporated by the supervisors, on the 14th of October, 1870, and C. A. Ensign, D. C. Putnam, and D. Gerber were appointed inspectors of election. At the first election, held Dec. 5, 1870, at D. Gerber's office, the total number of votes cast was 41. The names of those chosen annually to serve as president, trustees, clerk, and treasurer are as follows: 1870. \u2014 President, C. A. Ensign; Trustees, M. B. Spencer, Homer Manvil, D. AV.

Under an act of the Legislature in 1836, organizing townships, the township of Newark was created, and then included the territory now occupied by Laketown, Sauga tuck, Ganges, Casco, Fillmore, Manlius, Clyde, and Lee, or the whole of ranges 15 and 16 west, and the fractional range 17 west.* The first supervisor of Newark appears to have been Daniel A. Plummer. The township records antedating 1847 were destroyed by fire, and what has been gleaned from them refers of course to events subsequent to that year. In 1847 the votes cast aggregated but 29 ; in 1853 they rose to 38 ; in 1854 to 97 ; in 1856 to 157 ; and in 1858 to 186. In 1863 there was a still further increase to 201, but in 1864 the number declined to 98. In 1865 it leaped up to 213 ; in 1867 it reached 266 ; and in 1870, 313. CHURCHES. THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF DOUGLAS. This religious body had its origin in what was known as the Newark Class, formed in 1862, which had a member ship of ten persons, and was attached to the Newark Cir cuit. Among the first members were Mr. and Mrs. Wade, Mrs. Carmon, Mrs. Dutcher, Marshal Dye, Mrs. Deitrich, Nelson Wade and wife, and Geo. Dunn. Geo. Dunn was the first class-leader, and the Rev. Mr. Bliss the first pastor. The village school-house, which was at first used for services, was replaced, in 1870, by the present church edifice, \u2014 the only one in Douglas. Latterly membership of the church has become quite small, although the numerous revival meetings held during the past winter have reinvigorated it to a considerable decree. Divine services and sessions of the Sabbath school are held every Sunday. The present pastor is Rev. N. M. Steele, and the class-leader is Robert Elliott. We give below the names of those who have served as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace from 1847 to 1879. SUPERVISORS. 1847-52, S. A. Morrison; 1853-54, E. M.

At that time William Burnet was appointed leader, and has served in that capacity to the present time. Robert Reid, who was chosen the first deacon, still occupies that office. Public worship has been observed regularly every Saturday since the organization. Until 1879 various temporary places were occupied for this purpose, but during that year a build ing in the village was purchased and transformed into a convenient church edifice. The membership is now about 40. The Sabbath-school, in charge of Robert Reid, as superintendent, was organized in 1878, and has an average attendance of 25. 1873-79, Thomas Gray.

The membership has been as high as 80, but stands now at 64, Saugatuck Lodge having been demitted in 1876.

His duties became more ardu ous, and admitted of little leisure. Breakfast was eaten at half-past three o'clock, dinner at one, and supper at nine o'clock. Mr. Moore, with untiring perseverance and forti tude, endured this trying ordeal for four years, after which he removed to Monroe, N. H. In 1846 he managed a milling interest at Springfield, Mass., and in 1847, in con nection with Gen. Roswell M. Richardson, embarked in an extensive lumbering business, the firm having been Rich ardson & Moore. In closing this successful enterprise in 1854, their ledger revealed a profit to the partners of fifty thousand dollars, and six thousand four hundred acres of pine-land paid for. Mr. Moore then engaged in specu lations in produce, which were not successful. In 1855 he was an extensive purchaser of hemlock bark, which enabled him to restore the losses suffered from former transactions, and secure in addition a handsome profit. SCHOOLS. The first school of which there appears to be any present recollection was taught on section 4, upon the east bank of the river, and not far from Singapore ; but who was the teacher cannot now be learned. There was, after that, a private school in Saugatuck, taught by Miss Jane Powers, but touching that as well as other early schools in the town ship but little can be said, since the early school records were burned many years ago. At present the township is generally well supplied with excellent schools, Douglas and Saugatuck each having a fine graded school with a combined accommodation for about 500 pupils. The following statistics in regard to the public The year 1855 found him a traveler in the West, still actively engaged in business pursuits. The former lumber ing enterprise having proved successful, Mr. Moore was in 1856 induced to invest capital in Allegan County, and the following year began in Saugatuck an extensiA'e lumber and manufacturing interest. This he continued until the spring of 1875, having cut more than two hundred million feet of timber and employed many tugs and vessels as an accom paniment of the business. Upon abandoning the latter en terprise, Mr. Moore devoted his time to farming pursuits, having three improved farms to oversee, besides a large quantity of land in Wisconsin and Illinois, and property of various kinds elsewhere. schools are given in an official report for the year 1879 : Number of districts 5 Enrollment 618 Average attendance 536 Value of property $17,700 Teachers' wages $2,708 There are also four fractional school districts in the town- ship, with an aggregate of 40 school children. The school directors for 1879 were H. B. Moore, W. A. Woodworth, James Perry, William Cumming, and L. Har- rington. Mr. Moore is not less remarkable for his business capacity than for his integrity. He has never been known to fail in the payment of all his indebtedness, believing that honest debts should be liquidated upon the basis of one hundred cents to the dollar. Neither at any time has a note of his been known to go to protest. He is not an en thusiastic politician, though a strong Republican, as he has been since the organization of the party. He is a man of temperate habits, and advocates temperance in all things, being in no sense an extremist. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. HORACE D. MOORE. The life of Horace D. Moore is the record of a successful business man whose conquests were the result not so much of favorable circumstances as of sagacity combined with untiring energy. He is the grandson of Rev. Robert M. Moore, who was educated for the ministry in Edinburgh, Scotland, and whose diploma reveals the year 1610 as the date of his graduation. He came to the United States, and for many years filled the Presbyterian pulpit at Pembroke, N. H. Horace D. was born at Ryegate, Caledonia Co., Vt., June 14, 1821, his parents having been Nathaniel and Dorothy Moore, and his father's occupation that of a lum berman and farmer. His mother was descended from the family of Banfords, of English extraction, who were among the early settlers in Sanbornton, N. H., and closely identi fied with its primitive history and the Indian warfare of early days. The estate is still in the possession of the family. It is thus determined that the name of Moore is one which bears with it the record of a distinguished an cestry. Mr. Moore was married June 16, 1864, to Miss Tamer W. Phillips, of Clyde, Allegan Co., Mich., who is a native of Cass County. Her parents were former residents of New York State, and pioneers to Allegan wfien their daughter was but eleven years of age, having first located in Cass County. Mr. and Mrs. Moore have had four daughters, one of whom was a victim to scarlet fever at an early age. This concise sketch illustrates in a remarkable degree the success which is possible as the result of integrity coupled with energy. Having began his career with these as his only capital, Mr. Moore is now the most considerable tax payer in Allegan County. Horace D., whose life, though in a measure uneventful, was still one of conspicuous success, began his career as a tanner, but soon relinquished the pursuit as not congenial to his tastes. At the age of eighteen, with his worldly effects wrapped in a small bundle, he crossed one of the Green Mountain ridges and engaged at labor in a saw- and STEPHEN A. MORRISON. Among the venerable pioneers of Saugatuck the name of Morrison is conspicuous.

In 1853 a disastrous fire entailed a heavy loss, though the energy of Mr. Morrison very speedily enabled him to recuperate. mediately aster his advent closely identified with the inter ests of the township. He was the oldest son of Stephen Morrison, who still survives and is, in his ninety-third year, yet vigorous and active. Stephen A. was born in Danvers, Mass., May 18, 1815, and spent most of his early life in labor, though at disconnected intervals oppor tunities for study occurred. He was married in 1844 to Mary E., daughter of Samuel and Sophia Peckham, whose birthplace was Ver mont, and the date of her birth Aug. 31, 1816. Of their five children, but two daughters are living, \u2014 Mrs. Leland, who resides with her parents, and Mrs. Francis, who is a resident of the village. The original home has long since been replaced by a more spacious and convenient one, a view of whjph is seen upon an adjoining pago. Mr. Morrison has held successively the offices of county treasurer and supervisor, and has been for twenty years postmaster of his village. His constituents have also tendered him on more than one occasion the nomination for senator and representative in the State Legislature. At the age of eighteen he acquired the trade of a tanner, having served a weary apprenticeship of four years, after which his steps were turned towards Michigan. On his arrival in Saugatuck but four families inhabited the town ship, which was destitute alike of highways and other marks of civilization. The following year, in company with Samuel Morrison, his brother, a tannery was started, which was ultimately controlled by Stephen A., and has, to the present day, been profitably and successfully conducted AVILLIAM CORNER. MRS. WILLIAM CORNER, WILLIAM CORNER. Mr. Corner was the only child of Hugh and Sarah Cor ner, subjects of the British Crown, and was born in the county of Devon, England, Dec. 14, 1819. William, until he reached the age of manhood, remained at home, after which he married Miss Mary Ann Goodeve, the date of their union having been Feb. 10, 1841. Two children were theirs, \u2014 Eliza J., born in Genesee Co., N. Y., Feb. 14, 1842 ; and Rhoda R., whose birth occurred Feb. 26, 1845, and her death in September of the following year. Soon after their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Corner sailed for America, and on their arrival located at once in Genesee Co., N. Y., where he followed the trade of a cooper. Aster later changes in location he determined to become a pioneer, and chose Michigan as a residence, having removed to the State in 1852. He purchased one hundred acres in the township of Saugatuck, upon which he still resides. Hav ing in 1862 been afflicted by the death of his wife, after a lingering illness, Mr. Corner married, in 1864, Miss Lo rain Bathrick, who was born in Wyoming Co., N. Y., in 1834. He has devoted much labor to the cultivation of fruit, and made peaches a specialty. Six thousand bearing trees now adorn his farm, which is one of the most attrac tive in the township. Mr. Corner is not an active political partisan. He votes the Republican ticket, and has held minor offices, but is not ambitious for distinctions of an official character. He is a man of strong religious instincts, is active as a church member, superintendent of the Sabbath-school, and directs the church music, for which his musical abilities admirably fit him."], [469, "Residence of WILLIAM CORNER, Saugatuck, Allegan Co., Michigan."], [470, ""], [471, ""], [472, "JACOB GROVER was born in Tompkins Co., N. Y., Nov. 6, 1808. His early life was spent on the farm assisting his father. In 1834 he came to Comstock, Kalamazoo Co., Mich. In the early set tlement of the State much sickness prevailed. Mr. Grover did not escape this. After one year's stay here, finding his health in a precarious condition, he returned to his native State. In 1836 he had improved so much that he returned to Michigan, locating in Allegan, where he engaged in mill wrighting. After putting up some buildings at Plainwell, he, in company with others, went to Black Lake, put up huildings of various kinds, intending to lay out a village ; but before the end of the year the party found the project a failure, tore down the buildings, and shipped the lumber and machinery to Chicago. Mr. Grover then went to the mouth of the Kala mazoo Eiver, and assisted in erecting the first light-house ever built there. He has spent the greater part of his time in mechanical work, such as constructing houses, mills, and ships, and has worked at this employment in Michigan, Illi nois, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Minnesota. In Michigan he was engaged erecting saw-mills and farm huildings of various kinds, being employed by a New York and Michigan firm. In Mississippi he stopped at Grand Gulf, being first employed by Hugh M. Coffee ; from there he went to what was known as the Concord plantation, owned by Judge Perkins ; here he built negro cabins. His next work was on the planta tion of Stephen A. Douglas, building a large gin-house. Going thence to Illinois he was detained by a severe spell of typhoid fever, but was enabled to go to work again in the fall. Returning to Louisiana, he was employed on the plan tation of J. A. Douglas (brother of Stephen A.). In 1842 left the South, going through Illinois, where he remained two years, and landed in Michigan in 1844, engaging for the two coming years in business with Mr. Porter. At the end of that time he sold out to Porter, and bought forty acres of land on section 8, Trowbridge township. The following spring he purchased forty acres more on the same section, buying this land of a Boston Company at four dollars per acre. Not willing yet to give up his trade he worked in Allegan, Breeds ville, Plummerville, and in Kalamazoo County. In 1849 he purchased two hundred and eighty acres of land, improving it by clearing, and building a small house. In 1853 he sold this to John Clifford, and engaged again in mechanical pursuits during a part of the years of 1853 and 1854. He now de cided to revisit his native State. After a stay of a few weeks he returned West, traveling through Iowa and several other Western States, looking the country over before making an other purchase. He finally decided upon coming again to Michigan, where, in the latter part of 1854, he purchased three hundred and sixty-one acres in Trowbridge township. In 1855 he purchased one hundred and eighteen acres known as the Benn place, but sold this the same j*ear to Benjamin T. Benn. Mr. Grover has made Trowbridge his home since 1856. Mr. Grover considers a large mill in Minnesota, erected in 1856, the best piece of work ever put up by him. Since 1858 his entire time has been spent in the improvement of his farm. No man, perhaps, has done more towards the improvement of the county than Mr. Grover. In politics he has been a Republican since the organization of the party. He has been honored by the people with offices of trust and responsibility, and proved himself a competent officer. In an early day he was elected sheriff of his county. Mr. Jacob Grover's father and mother, Andrew and Mary Grover, never came West. They were both born in Sussex Co., N. J., and both died in New York. Their family con sisted of nine children, \u2014 six boys and three girls, \u2014 three brothers and one sister living in Michigan, the others in New York. Mr. Grover has never been married, and now at the age of seventy-one years he can quietly enjoy the fruits of his industrious, honest, faithful, and temperate life.

In 1S73 there were 1397 acres sown with wheat and 1200 acres planted with corn, which produced 16,555 bushels of the former grain, and 30,150 of the latter. Of other grains there were 13,439 bushels. In the following year the area soavo with wheat was increased to 1842 acres. PRODUCTIONS. Trowbridge is known on the United States survey as township No. 1 north, of range 13 west, and is bounded on the north by Allegan, south by Van Buren County, east by Otsego, and west by Cheshire. It contains many pic turesque lakes, and is well watered by numerous small streams, besides which the storied Kalamazoo makes its entrance on the east line of section 12 and flows westward, turns suddenly to the north, and then again to the west, finally leaving the township on the north line of section 5. The timber of Trowbridge includes all the varieties usu ally found in Michigan. Beech and maple prevail, while along the shores of the Kalamazoo and on the western border of the township are found considerable pine and a small quantity of hemlock, though in much less quantities than formerly. In the swamps flourish the tamarack and other similar species of trees. This attractive stream, the beauties of which have been so graphically described by the facile pen of Fenimore Cooper, loses none of its charms as it flows to the north ward. Its border-lands are fertile, and its banks attract the eye of the traveler by their weird and romantic beauty as they did in the days when the Indian plied his canoe, un conscious of the changes which civilization was to bring. The largest of the lakes of Trowbridge, which vary greatly in size and shape, is that lying farthest south, and known as Base Line Lake, a part of which is on sections 32 and 33 in this township, while the remainder is in Van Buren County. Northwest of it is Emerson Lake, a picturesque Bheet of water, lying principally on sections 29 and 30. Besides these, the principal bodies of water are Minckler Lake, on section 28; Lake No. 16, called after the section on which it lies, and remarkable for the luxuriance of the foliage along its shore; Osgood Lake, on section 16, with a small point invading the section south of it; and Hodge Lake, in the southeast corner of the township. Fish of various size abound in these lakes, and many pleasure-boats float upon their smooth and transparent waters. The citizens of the township have not engaged extensively in fruit-culture, though the soil, climate, and location would warrant a larger investment of capital in that direction. The residences of the farmers are comfortable and substan tial, without any attempt at display or luxury. Trowbridge has no village within its limits, but the close proximity of its citizens to Allegan and Otsego and to the railroads which pass through these villages affords them ample facilities for marketing their products and obtaining what they may need from the outer world. PURCHASES FROM GOVERNMENT. The following are the names of the individuals who early purchased land in the township : Section 1. \u2014 Bought in 1835 and 1836 by Samuel Brown, L. II. Sand- ford, Saul Hubbard, Bradley Granger, Benjamin Eager, John AV. Eager. Section 2. \u2014 Bought in 1834 and 1835 by Samuel Hubbard, Samuel Brown. Section 3.\u2014 Bought from 1S32 to 1851 by A. L. Cotton, Irad Harris, Samuel Hubbard, Charles C. Baker, Beers and Sherwood, A. A. AArilliams, J. D. Batchelor, Daniel Prindle, John R. Kellogg. The surface of Trowbridge is quite varied, many slopes and ridges being seen, although the inequalities are not generally so abrupt as to offer serious impediments to the labor of the husbandman. Some swampy land is found in its territory, though less than in many other parts of the county, while through the central, eastern, and west ern portions is a tract of level land, arable, highly culti vated, and extending nearly across the township. Seclion 4. \u2014 Bought in 1834 and 1835 by A. H. Edwards, Samuel Hub- bard, Cyrus Lowell, Alexander L. Ely, Daniel Bracelin, James Bracelin, L. H. Moore.

The soil is of almost every variety and quality, including clay-loam, sand, swamp-muck, and a mixture of clay and gravel. The average is quite equal to that of the best townships of the county, most of it rewarding with excel lent crops the labors of the husbandman. A large portion of the land is well adapted to the raising of wheat, and has produced crops of that grain, which, both as to quantity and quality, place Trowbridge in a high rank among wheat growing townships. Corn also attains a luxuriant growth, Section 7.\u2014 Bought from 1836 to 1S59 by Hill and Cobb, L. W. Wat- kins, J. G. Colburn, George Blanchard, Pliny Billings, George Stone, E. and G. Hurt, A.

In July of that year he was married, in Otsego, to Miss Harriet Cannon, and at the close of the ceremony he set out with his bride in a canoe for their new home on section 5 in the present township of Trowbridge. The marriage was performed by Oka Town, Esq., one of the earliest justices of the peace in Otsego, in which township he still resides. Mr. Smith devoted him self with vigor to the clearing of his land, but subsequently removed to section 9, where he resided until his death. One son still resides in the township.

Dr. Richard Wear, previously of Canada, made his way to Allegan Co., Mich., in 1834. For two years he devoted himself to prospecting for land, and found an active demand from speculators for his services. In 1835 he was the tax collector of Allegan township, which then embraced the whole county. The total amount of township, county, and State tax for that year, including the tax levied to prose cute the Toledo war, did not exceed $300. Dr. Wear was also the collector of Otsego in 1836, when it embraced the two eastern ranges of the county.* He was likewise a mem ber of the convention which transformed the Territory of Michigan into a State. Dr. Wear entered, in 1836, 80 acres on section 27, for which he paid $100, his nearest neighbor being several miles distant, in Van Buren County. He was the first pioneer who cleared the forests of the southern portion of the township. The doctor's first effort was to secure a shelter for temporary occupancy. From the material afforded by a white ash tree he built a wigwam, in which he led the life of a hermit, depending only on the labor of his own hands. He then chopped and burned a sufficient tract upon which to grow corn and potatoes for his own use. Later, he built a more comfortable log house, to which he brought his wife and family. He exchanged this farm for the one on which he now resides. The In dians, who were then numerous throughout the locality, Section 28.\u2014 Bought in 1837 by Alvin Niece, S. M.

The east and northwest portions of Trowbridge first afforded homes to the pioneers of the township. Sidney Smith entered 40 acres in January, 1835, and Leander S. Prouty 88 acres in April of the same year. Mr. Prouty, as has been stated in the history of the village of Allegan, came from the East in 1834, and was employed by Alexan der L. Ely at that place. The following year he removed with his family to Trowbridge, and made the first clearing on his land, upon which he has resided from that time until the present. He is still actively employed in agricul tural pursuits, and is the owner of portions of the finest land in the township. According to Mr. Prouty's recol lection, he is the first settler in the township, and this is doubtless correct. Sidney Smith, it is true, also made * AVe append the following receipt, given by the treasurer to Dr. Wear, as a reminiscence of the pioneer period: \"Recvd of Richard Wear six dollars and ninety-eight cents, to apply on the county tax for Otsego, for which he is collecter ; Also his Tax-Bill, as returned not collected, to the amount of one hundred fifty-three dollars and forty cents, For the year eighteen hundred and thirty-six. \"Allegan, Feb. 8, 1837. \"M.

ABIGAIL ROSE AND HARVEY ROSE At the top of this page can be seen the portraits of Mrs. Abigail Rose and her son, Harvey Rose. Mrs. Rose was born Feb. 29, 1804, in Dutchess Co., N. Y. She was the daughter of Asa and Sarah Luddington. AA'as married, Dec. 31, 1826, to David Rose, who was born in Dutchess Co., N. Y., April 23, 1799. This marriage took place in the winter, and the young couple commenced housekeeping the following spring, in Tompkins Co., N. Y. They began life with no capital save that of good health, energy, and perseverance; they well knew that the way to success was no royal road, but was open only to strong hands and willing hearts, and with a hearty good-will did they engage in this battle of life, looking forward to the time, later in life, when they could rest from their labors and enjoy the fruits thereof. But by the dispensation of an all-wise Providence they were not to enjoy each other's society long. May 28, 1831, Mr. Rose was called from his labors here to look into the mysteries of the great hereafter. Gloomy, indeed, must be the outlook of a widow deprived thus early in life of her companion and support, and hard, indeed, is it to say, \" Thy will be done.\" But is there any system, theory, or creed that promises aught of the great beyond compared to the Christian's sublime hope that the loved one is safely folded by the great shepherd Jesus ? Mrs. Rose had two children, viz., Sarah M. and Harvey. In 1862 she, in company with her son, moved to Michigan, making her home with him until six years ago, going at that time to her daughter, Mrs. Sarah M. Grover, where she has since made her home; and here we find her to-day, at the advanced age of seventy-six years, in good health, quietly and calmly passing down life's declivity, to blend \"by and by\" in tbe full glories of its latest autumnal sunset. charge, which he did not re6eive until June 28, 1865. Stopping in New York State to make a visit, he did not arrive at home until some time in August. He now receives twenty-four dollars pension per month. Can we pay too high a tribute to those faithful ones who went out in defense of our nation's honor? Many have laid their lives upon the altar of their country, and sleep peacefully and quietly beneath chap let and wreaths that are heaped upon their graves yearly by a grate ful people ; others have returned to us only wrecks of their former selves. But each and every one fought that freedom might survive, and that the rights of labor and the claims of honest industry might be acknowledged forever. \" Let us have but one sentiment for soldiers living or dead, \u2014 ' Cheers for the living, tears for the dead.' \" Mrs. Sarah M. Grover was born Jan. 7, 1828; was married, Feb. 15, 1858, to J. W. Grover, who was born Aug. 5, 1810, in Dryden, Tompkins Co., N. Y. Mr. Grover came to Michigan in 1836, bought eighty acres of land in Trowbridge township, and afterwards added to this purchase until he had two hundred and forty acres. He then bought another tract of forty-eight acres in the same township. Returning to New York, he remained until 1857, when he moved to Michigan with his wife. Here he made his home until his death, which occurred April 20, 1879, and here we to-day find his widow, who is nicely situ ated, having a pleasant home, all the result of their labor and economy in early life. When Mr. and Mrs. Grover came to Michigan the beautiful productive farm which we now see was an unbroken, uncleared wilderness. AVe well know that it requires a great amount of energy and nerve for persons to leave good comfortable homes and the society of dear friends to seek their fortunes in the wilds of a new country ; but the early settlers were men and women who, when they once de cided to take this step, were not to be numbered among those who are called failures. Industry and perseverance were qualities possessed by Mr. and Mrs. Grover, and by the practical application of these their success was secured. AVhen Mr. Grover first came to Michigan he worked for some time on the race then being built in Allegan. Some time before his death Mr. Grover sold his farm of two hundred and forty acres. One child only came to bless this union, viz., David A., born March 8, 1860 ; died May 23, 1869. Mr. Grover was engaged in agricultural pursuits during his life. Being an active member of the Republican party, he was chosen to fill township offices from time to time ; was elected supervisor about 1860, '62, and '64. Mr. Grover and wife were members of the Christian Church at Bloomingdale, but as the Methodist Episcopal church was much nearer their home they attended services there. The portraits of this worthy couple, also a view of their home, can be seen on another page of this work. Harvey Rose was born Nov. 18, 1829, married Oct. 15, 1873, and is now living on a farm of eighty acres, in Trowbridge township, near his mother and sister. Upon the breaking out of the Rebellion he promptly and patriotically stepped to the front, enlisting in the 13th Regiment Michigan Infantry, Sept. 2, 1864. This gallant regiment saw severe service, and Harvey was ever found sharing its fortunes, whether on long, tedious marches or in front of rebel bullets. But he was not to be in active service long, for on the 19th of March, 1865, at the battle of Bentonville, N. C, he was wounded just above the knee, and left in the hands of the rebels; the limb was amputated the following morning by a rebel surgeon. At the end of the third day he was recaptured by the Union boys and taken to Golds- borough, twenty-two miles from Benton ; from there to Newbern, N. C. After a stay of four weeks here, was again moved to Moore head City, put aboard a steamer bound for David's Island, New York harbor.

Always receiving a cordial welcome, they spread their blankets on the floor, and there slept soundly until the morning light warned them to depart. The floor was sometimes covered with these nomads of the wilder ness. Dr. Wear was one of the earliest justices of the peace of Trowbridge, and held the office for a period of twenty-four years. He performed many marriage services, a fugitive couple occasionally appearing at midnight to obtain his aid. His regular fee was $1.50, nor could he be induced to act for less. He performed the earliest mar riage service in the township, but is not able to recall the names of the contracting parties. To this abode he removed his family in March, 1837, per forming a weary pilgrimage through snow fifteen inches in depth. There were no windows or doors to this primitive mansion, and the family's scanty store did not even include a stove with which to temper the freezing atmosphere. But the indomitable spirit which was almost invariably displayed by the Michigan pioneers enabled them to look with indifference upon these deprivations. A fire was soon built against the end of the house with a foundation of green logs, and a hole in the roof served as a chimney. An acre of land was speedily cleared and planted with pota toes and corn, which supplied them with food during the following year, both directly and indirectly, being occa sionally exchanged with the Indians for game. Mr. Col burn is still a resident of the township, and one of its most useful citizens. One of the first births in the township occurred in the family of Dr. Wear, being that of his son William. Another early birth was that of a daughter of Sidney Smith, now Mrs. Albert Mosher. With Dr. Wear came his uncle, John Wear, who, after a residence of some years in Trowbridge, removed to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. From Brockport, N. Y., came John Billings, in 1836, and purchased 320 acres on section 4. This land had previously been owned by Alexander L. Ely, who had erected a log house for the accommodation of the men he had employed to chop the timber upon it. This house and the partial clearing made by the choppers gave Mr. Billings quite an advantage in the preliminary work of pioneering, an advantage which he improved by the most zealous industry. Hazadiah Ross entered land on sections 23 and 24 in 1836, and was one of the foremost pioneers, contributing much towards the growth of the township. He died many years since. William Porter, one of the venerable survivors of the early days of Trowbridge, had previously been a resident of Oswego, N. Y., whence he came West in the summer of 1836, and located 160 acres on sections 16 and 17, in Trowbridge, to which he soon added 80 more. In 1838 he cleared a space sufficiently large to erect a log house. Having secured a habitation he then married a wise, and the day of the marriage the happy pair were comfortably housed in their primitive abode. As near as can be determined, this was the first marriage in the township. The settlers living in the township on Mr. Porter's arrival were Leander S. Prouty, Dr. Richard Wear, Hazadiah Ross, Sidney Smith, John Wear, John Billings, and a man named Gough. For his land Mr. Porter paid $5 per acre to the \" Boston Company,\" with the stipulation that at least five acres should be cleared the first year. The first winter of Mr. Porter's settlement in Trowbridge his time was pro fitably occupied in making shingles, for which there was a considerable demand. His attention was next directed to the improvement of his land, and in 1840 to the erec tion of a saw-mill, the work on which was done by Jacob Grover. In 1844 another mill was built by him, on section 17. These mills were for twenty years kept in constant activity, supplying the demands made upon them by the early settlers for lumber. Mr. Porter now has near his residence a steam saw-mill with a capacity of 20,000 feet per day. Benjamin W. Colburn came with his brother, John G. Colburn, and like him located upon section 7, where he purchased 70 acres, which have since been increased to 200. He remained a short time in Allegan, and removed to the land where he has ever since resided. Martin Sheffer, more familiarly known as Capt. Sheffer, who commanded the first vessel that sailed out of Sauga tuck, \u2014 the \" Napoleon,\" \u2014 came first to Allegan in 1836, and at the expiration of a year removed to Trowbridge, where he purchased 160 acres upon section 18. He had already erected a house upon the land, and, being then single, secured a family to occupy it until his own marriage. He cleared up the farm, and on his death lest the property to Mrs. Sheffer, who has since managed it with much ability and success. Capt. Sheffer was quite as familiar with the Atlantic as with inland waters, having formerly been one of the officers of an English line-of-battle ship. The Granger brothers, William, Riley, and Bradley, were among the earliest settlers, and located in the extreme northeastern corner of the township, where they had 2 18 acres of land. Bradley Granger was one of the few pio neer preachers in the county. He and his brother Wil liam resided on the land they first purchased until their deaths. Riley subsequently removed to Plainwell, his present home. Oramel Fisk improved a farm on section 1 in 1838, and after a residence of several years in the town ship removed to Allegan, where he died. The earliest preaching occurred soon aster Mr. Porter's advent iu the Prouty school-house, Rev. T. Z. R. Jones officiating. Rev. W. C. H. Bliss frequently ministered to the wants of the townspeople on funeral occasions. John H. Blackman came from Ohio in May, 1841, and entered 160 acres on section 1, traveling with horses and wagon laden with his household goods. Adjoining his land was a somewhat dilapidated log house, which had been built by Dr. Bigelow. In this Mr. Blackman and his family domiciled themselves until a house could be built on their own land. Fourteen acres were planted with corn and sown with oats the second year, supplies having mean- Among the representatives of Monroe Co., N. Y., in Trowbridge is John G. Colburn, who, on his arrival in Allegan County, lingered but a few months in Allegan village, and then located himself upon 80 acres he had previously entered on section 7. ' During the interval he had cleared a small tract, on which he erected a log house. 43"], [482, "338 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. while been obtained from Gun Plain. With Mr. Black man came his sons, James and Henry E. Blackman, the latter of whom came to the State in 1839 and remained in Gun Plain until his father's advent. He now occupies the homestead. James resides upon section 12. bridge since the date mentioned, and is now, in addition to his farming business, actively engaged in the sale of agricultural implements. Daniel Foster, a former resident of Rochester, N. Y., re moved to Trowbridge in 1844, and purchased 320 acres on sections 21, 22, and 32, but chose section 16 as a place of residence. Mr. Foster at once planted some apple-seeds and peach-stones, the trees growing from which formed the nucleus of the extensiA'e Genesee nurseries, which he con ducted for twelve years, and which at one time contained no less than 65,000 thriving young apple-trees. He has been, since his residence in the township, an extensive land-owner and a successful farmer, but has more recently given the active management of his farm to his son. On 80 acres of the same section settled James Hender son in 1842. His three sons are still residents of the county, Alexander having remained on the farm, while Don C. is the senior editor and proprietor of the Allegan Journal. Henry M. Wilkinson became a settler on section 29 in 1842, his nearest neighbor being Dr. Wear. For a period of eighteen months after his arrival, Mrs. Wilkinson did not see the face of a white woman. Jacob Grover came from Tompkins Co., N. Y., to the State as early as 1834. He followed the trade of a millwright, and assisted in the erection of the earliest mills in Trowbridge. He bought lands iu that township in 1844, but did not locate upon them. In 1855 he became the owner of 361 acres on section 10, and erected on it the house in which he resides. From Seneca Co., Ohio, Mr. and Mrs. Roswell Rock well, in 1847, made their weary way in a lumber-wagon, surrounded by their six children and all their worldly effects, to the still wide township of Trowbridge. Mr. Rockwell, with his brother William, had come the previous year, made a clearing and. erected a log cabin on section 32, which the family occupied until a more comfortable structure could be built. Mr. Rockwell exchanged his horse-team for oxen with one of the Hollanders who had settled near the lake, obtaining the difference in gold, \u2014 a metal which was extremely rare, except among those thrifty emigrants. This was used to make a payment on his land. A little money was also received from the sale of coon and muskrat skins, which enabled the family to add somewhat to its scanty stores. Mr. Rockwell died many years since on the homestead he had improved, which is now occupied by his son Stephen. His brother George, who came in 1849, resides upon section 30. In 1858 his brothers, John W. and Andrew P. Grover, came from New York State and located upon section 1 1 , where the former was the owner of 366 acres. He died in the township in 1879. A. P. Grover purchased 80 acres, on which he still resides. George Y. Warner, previously a lawyer of Allegan, re moved in 1838 to section 5, where he had 203 acres of land. He remained many years, but finally sold to B. H. Taylor, and removed from the county. On Mr. Warner's arrival, William Porter entered into a contract to construct a log house for him at an expense of $50, Warner to cut the doors and windows. Henry Staring followed the footsteps of other emigrants to the county, and remained for a while in Allegan, but finally removed to Trowbridge, and in 1841 settled upon 203 acres belonging to George Y. Warner. On this farm there had been an Indian sugar-bush, which had caused the spot to become a rendezvous lor many of the wander ing bands of this region. Many implements in use among them were subsequently found while plowing the fields. Mr. Staring afterwards removed to Allegau, and died in Monterey in 1876. Loren Daggett was one of the pioneers of 1841, and established himself upon 80 acres on section 22. Morris Bullock located himself, in 1845, on 80 acres on section 25, now occupied by Gordon Hicks. In 1847 his mother, desiring to pay a visit to her neighbor, Mrs. Dag gett, set out through the woods for that lady's residence, having no other guide than an Indian trail to lead her to her destination. As she did not return at the appointed time, her friends became anxious, and began searching for her. They being unsuccessful, volunteers came from far and wide to aid their efforts. After twelve days of anxiety and exertion her body was discovered in the woods by Ira Chichester. The event caused great excitement and pro sound sadness throughout the township, and was long the theme of mournful reminiscences among the pioneers of Trowbridge. W. H. and Porter Rood were early pioneers from the State of New York to Allegan County, and in 1838 made Trowbridge their home, where they improved 80 acres of land on section 9, on which a beginning had already been made by a settler named Willard, which is still their home. Ira Davidson arrived at nearly the same time, and also located on section 9. His residence is now with the Messrs. Rood. Amos L. Rogers located in 1848 upon 80 acres on sec tion 12, and Martin Hicks settled upon 120 acres on sec tion 26 very soon afterwards. Both still reside on their original purchases. John B. Allen was a former resident of Niagara Co., N.Y., whence he came to Michigan in 1836, and to Al- legan in 1842, removing from the latter place to Trow- bridge in 1843. He was engaged in the pineries on the south side of the river for five years, during which time he purchased 61 acres on section 12, and in 1848 bought of D. Doane Davis 80 acres on section 1, to which he re- moved the following year. H. E. Blackman had already located half a mile west, and on the eastern side was Ben jamin Martin, of Otsego. Mr. Allen has resided in Trow- William Upson, another Ohio pioneer, settled upon 90 acres on sections 10 and 15 in 1852, which he purchased of Andrew Cone. The frame of a house had been erected, which was soon placed in a habitable condition. He is still a resident of the same farm. His nearest neighbor was John Clifford, from Ohio, who resided upon section 9, where he purchased a farm of Jacob Grover.

Alexander Dale entered 160 acres on section 9 in 1836, and subsequently added 40, upon which he resided until his death. Another road was surveyed by F. J. Littlejohn in 1838, and was known as the Prouty road, from the fact that it passed through that gentleman's land. Other roads were surveyed within the next few years by William Forbes, H. P. Barnum, and F. J. Littlejohn. The foregoing intelli gence was furnished the historian by William Porter, Esq. J. Killam removed from Monroe County to Allegan in 1844, and in 1849 became the owner of 80 acres on sec tion 9, on which he now lives. His nearest neighbor, at the time of his advent, was Porter Rood ; but the neigh borhood very soon became more thickly settled. BAPTIST CHURCH. Among others whose names are entitled to a place on the roll of more recent settlers are R. M. Bigelow, T. Babbitt, W. Lovett, J. and H. Ashley, G. Perkins, S. Stockwell, J. St. German, W. Dimond, L. Ingles, R. Simmons, H. M. Wilkinson, T. Wilson, H. Price, H. Goshorn, L. Nichols, J. G. Austen, R. Ames, and later B. W. Odell, Ichabod Stratton, H. Scott, A. B. Mallery, S. Webster, R.

The first meetings of this society were held in the Ross school-house, the Baptist Church of Otsego having estab lished a branch of their organization in Trowbridge, with service conducted each alternate Sabbath by Elder 0. S. Wolf, of Otsego. In 1868 a church was organized, in cluding a membership of forty six persons, with Elder Wolf still as their pastor. The school-house afforded a place of meeting until 1872, when it was determined to erect a church edifice. Ground was secured on section 24, and the building, having been completed, was dedicated May 21, 1873, the total cost of the church having been $3000. The clergymen in succession since that time have been ReA's. T. Z. B. Jones, B. P. Hewett, A. R. Leslie, A. M. Buck, B. C. Mosher, Smith, and J. Donalsou. The society is now without a pastor. The membership has not greatly increased since its organization. SCHOOLS. The earliest school was opened on land owned by Lean der S. Prouty, the residents of this portion of the town ship having erected a log school-house in 1841 and secured the services of a teacher. Some difi'erence of opinion ex ists as to who first filled that position, though it is probable that Miss Luvia Ann Bingham was the person in question. J. Glover Kellogg was also an early teacher iu the same school, and Bradley Granger was his successor. As the northwest portion of the township became settled, the little building was well filled with the growing youth of Trow bridge, and eventually the primitive log house gave place to a more substantial structure. TROWBRIDGE GRANGE, No. 290. This organization was established March 3, 1874, under a charter granted by the National Grange, with 47 charter members. Its first officers were E. G. Minckler, Master; Jacob F. Brest, Overseer ; Elisha Hammond, Lecturer ; Edward Buck, Steward; Thomas Hemitt, Assistant Stew ard ; Ichabod Stratton, Chaplain ; George W. Giigsby, Sec. ; J. W. Kussell, Treas. Its present officers are L. S. Lee, Master ; Martin Brest, Overseer ; J. S. Osgood, Lec turer ; E. T. Parker, Steward ; Charles Merriam, Assistant Steward ; E. Hammond, Chaplain ; Macy W. Brender, Sec. ; S. D. Rockwell, Treas. The present membership is 175. The organization is about erecting a hall for its semi-weakly meetings. The next school was opened in the Blackman neighbor hood, on section 1, in the log house of I. H. Blackman, in the year 1843, the first teacher having been his daughter, Miss Harriet A. Blackman. This district is now adorned with one of the most spacious and substantial school buildings in the township. Trowbridge is at this time divided into six whole and two fractional districts, which are controlled by the following directors : B. H. Taylor, P. C. Allen, Aaron C. Claire, S. C. Foster, Nelson Stratton, James S. Osgood, William Rupon, George W. Grigsby. The num ber of children receiving instruction is 390 ; the total amount of the salaries paid to the teachers is $1108. METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. The few settlers who populated Trowbridge in 1849 resolved that an opportunity should be afforded them of attending divine service in their own immediate neighbor hood, and after a few preliminary meetings a class was organized the same year, with Rev. Curtis Mosher as preacher. He Avas followed by Rev. Mr. Doughty, and services were held in the school-house until 1865, when the congregation had increased sufficiently to erect a house of worship on the northeast corner of section 26, which was dedicated in November of the same year, with Rev. L. H. Pierce as pastor. The trustees who superintended its construction and have officiated since that time are Thomas Stratton, Henry Pierce, John McKee, and William Sebring. The present pastor is Rev. F. L. McCoy. Those who have preceded him, so far as he is able to give their names, are Revs. A. J. Van Wyck, N. M. Steele, George L. Haight, William M. Paddock, J. Barrett, C. L. Van Antwerp, E. C. Chambers, and I. B. Tallman. The society is well sustained and prosperous. EARLY ROADS. The earliest surveyed road in Trowbridge was the State road, intended to run from Allegan southward into Kala mazoo County. It was only opened, however, as far as Emerson Lake, on the line betAveen sections 19 and 20. It was surveyed in 1S36, probably by William Forbes, and was for a short period the only surveyed road in the town ship that had been opened and improved. In 1837 a road Avas surveyed by F. J. Littlejohn, running from Allegan into Van Buren County, on the Hue between sections 4 aud 5 and 8 and 9, divergiug on its approach to section 16 to avoid a small lake Avhich obstructed its course. On section 20 the road bore off to the southwest, where it ran again directly south, aud passed out of the township on section 32."], [488, "340 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY\" COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

Trowbridge, together with many other townships of the county, was formerly a part of Allegan, and Avas organized as an independent township in 1842 in conjunction with Cheshire. It was surveyed by Lucius Lyon in April, 1841, and named in honor of C. C. Trowbridge, of Detroit, the popular treasurer of the Boston Company, aftenvards the first Whig candidate for Governor of tbe State. In 1851 Cheshire was accorded a separate existence, and Trowbridge was left with its present dimensions. It was early settled, and at the date of its organization was able to offer a poll-list the size of which considerably exceeded that of many other townships. TREASURERS. 1843, George Y.

BLACKMAN The greater number of men who had enough of the spirit of adventure to seek a home in a new country were men of iron nerve, of energy and per- severance, men who, Avhen they had once turned their faces thither, turned not back for trifles, but kept resolutely on until beautiful farms and homes show the work of their strong arms and willing hearts. Such a man is the Hon. H. E. Blackman, one among the first settlers in Michigan. He was born in Portage Co., Ohio, Jan. 6, 1820. In 1839, in com- pany with two other men, he started for Michigan. They decided to come through with a team. Load- ing their household furniture and provisions for their journey, they started for the, to them, unknoAvn country. Coming to the Maumee River, they found it frozen and Avere compelled to cross on the ice. During their passage across one wheel of the wagon breaking through the ice they were forced to unload their effects in order to pry out the Avagon. They were fourteen days making the trip. Upon reach- ing Michigan they stopped at Gun Plain, and Avent to work getting out timber and lumbering. As Michigan was so heavily timbered, lumbering was the first employment many of the pioneers engaged in. After working for a time Mr. Blackman re- turned to his father's, in Ohio, Avhere he remained two years. He then started again for Michigan, \u2014 alone and on foot. Passing through Medina, Ohio, he there met his brother-in-laAV, Jonathan Stevens, who accompanied him. Mr. Blackman had five dollars and his companion six shillings. They Avere on the way thirteen days. When they reached Gun Plain their capital consisted of thirty one cents. Mr. Blackrnan's father bought a farm in Michigan in January, 1841. He came to Michi- gan in June of the same year. This farm con sisted of two hundred acres, situated in TroAvbridge township. Here he remained until his death, Avhich occurred in 1854, he being in his seventy-first year. His wife died in 1879, in the eighty-eighth year of her age. Mr. H. E. Blackman managed his father's farm for two years, and in 1843 bought it. Oct. 26, 1853, H. E. Blackman and Lucy Sherwood were married. She Avas the daughter of Libbeus and Sophia Sherwood, and Avas born in Otsego, Aug. 8, 1835. Her parents came from Rochester, N. Y., to Michigan in 1833. Their family consisted of eight children. Eight children have been born in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Blackman, named below in the order of their births : Henry S. (deceased), James A., Hattie A. (deceased), John H., Mary A. (de ceased), Nellie A., Mary Bell, and Fred. L. Henry met with his death by shipAvreck, May 12, 1875, starting from Saugatuck to Chicago on board a vessel which was wrecked and all on board lost. The family recovered Henry's body only to find a severe Avound on the side of his head, caused, per haps, by the falling of some of the timber of the vessel.

Oct. 27, 1864, he married Miss Clara J., daughter of Nathaniel and Al mira Hart. Mrs. Martindale's grandfather served in the Revolutionary war. She was born in Michigan, June 25, 1844. Her parents and four brothers and one sister are living in Allegan County. One brother is practicing law in the town of Allegan. In 1865, one year after his mar riage, Mr. Martindale, hearing of the great opportunities afforded in Michigan, and thinking he could better secure a home for his family in this new country, started for Michi gan. Stopping in Otsego township, Allegan Co., he made a purchase of seventy acres of land ; after a stay of nine years, he sold his first purchase and removed to Trowbridge town ship, where he bought one hundred and forty-eight acres. Broad and fertile fields can now be seen where not many years ago the pioneer was obliged to \" blaze\" his way from cabin to cabin. Mr. Martindale has made for himself a comfortable home, a view of which can be seen on another page of this work ; also the portraits of himself and wife.

He has been long and actively engaged in the improvement of the country from the time it was almost an unbroken wilderness, inhabited almost exclusively by Indians and wild animals, with here and there, at long dis tances apart, a settlement of a feAV hardy pioneers. His parents were natives of New Hampshire, where he was born Oct. 5, 1813, in Hillsborough County. His boyhood was spent in assisting his father in the labors of farm life and in obtaining a limited common-school educa tion. He also learned the cooper's trade. In 1831 he moved to New York State to commence life for himself; his capital consisted of twenty-five cents in money and an abundance of energy and industry. Upon his arrival in New York he was unable to go to work for two months, on account of sickness; but, upon recovering, he worked at his trade three months; then hired to do farm-work with his uncle, where he stayed less than a year. Buying twelve acres in the woods, he cleared it, and built (in 1833) a small frame house upon it. Oct. 5, 1833, he married Almira, daughter of Ebenezer Sargent. Five children came to bless their union. One only is living, Sarah E., the wife of J. L. Austin, living near her father. jMrs. Colburn died Feb. 7, 1850. He married his second wife Oct. 15, 1850. This lady was Miss Elizabeth Wright, daughter of Jonathan S. Wright. They have had six children ; two only are living, who are at home with their parents. Mr. Colburn, hearing so much of the new and unsettled lands lying west of Lake Erie, began to look with longing eyes in that direction. Accordingly, in 1836, he left home for the purpose of securing a locatiou some- BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. W. S. MARTINDALE. Aaron Martindale, the grandfather of the gentleman I O o whose name appears at the head of this sketch, was born in England, in 1771. Emigrating to America, he was here during the war of the Revolution ; but, being a Tory, and having no sympathy whatever with the Americans, he re moved to Canada as soon as the war was over, never again leaving \" Her Majesty's Dominion.'' His family consisted of five children, \u2014 four sons and one daughter. Asa, the father of W. S., and the youngest of the family, was born in Canada, June 6, 1811. He has spent his entire life there, except occasional visits to the States ; is now with his son,"], [494, "342 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Y. ; from thence the family moved to the lumber-woods of McKean and Cameron Cos., in Pennsylvania, where the subject of this sketch, at an early age, graduated in the saw-mill, and became skilled in tho art of rafting lumber down the Alleghany and some of the head-waters of the Susquehanna. But so limited was his education that he was unable, at the age of twenty years, to read intelligibly in a common newspaper. Although backward, and at such an age, he determined to go to school, and accordingly, in the fall of 1856, with the money earned by his own hands, he attended the academy at Coudersport, Potter Co., Pa., until he attained a proficiency sufficient to teach school, which he followed, at intervals, with going to school, until 1863, when he married Miss Thankful 31. Freeman, daughter of Judge Freeman, of Emporium, Cameron Co., Pa. Miss Freeman was born in 1839, in Eulalia town ship, Potter Co., Pa. During the succeeding winter Mr. Grigsby and his wife taught the village school at Emporium, he teaching the higher department, and his wife the pri mary. In the spring of 1864 they emigrated to Michigan, and in the winter of the same year he felled the first tree towards clearing the land where is now located his home. Paid two hundred dollars down on the land (eighty acres) and gave a mortgage of six hundred dollars, but by industry, frugality, and living within their means were soon out of debt and prosperous. where in the Territory of Michigan. He stopped in Al legan, where he remained only ten months. In November, 1836, he entered eighty acres of land in Trowbridge, and built a house, removing with his family to this farm in 1837. This piece of land was heavily timbered, Mr. Colburn cutting the first stick. When he left his home in Allegan he had finished his house on the farm with the exception of a roof; this he took from the house in town, and placed on the one last built, thus sleeping under the same roof in his new home that he had slept under in the old. Mr. Colburn has made additions to his farm, until he now owns one hundred and eighty eight acres. Besides conducting and managing his own business, he has at various times served his town. He was the first constable in Trowbridge. His first duty, after being elected, was to serve a summons on a party living at some distance from him. Arriving at the house and not finding the party at home, he wished to leave a copy of the summons; now came the search for writing material ; nothing of the kind to be found, he substituted pokeberry juice and a goose quill : this enabled him to accomplish his purpose. Truly, \" necessity is the mother of invention.\" He relates that about 1838 provisions were very scarce; flour especially so, bringing sixteen dollars per barrel, him self paying as high as ten cents per pound for it in small quantities. Sometimes he has had nothing but bread and water to eat and drink, and has planted corn, shaking with the ague until he could not hold the handle of the hoe. He has lived three months at a time without a cent of money in his pocket, a letter from their friends costing twenty-five cents. Saleratus they made out of corn-cobs, burning them and saving the ashes, steeping them and using the liquor ; making starch out of potatoes by grating them and putting a little water to the mash, straining the liquid through a thin cloth ; then after evaporating it was ready for use. He has cleared two hundred acres of land ; built three houses and four barns; has his farm now under a fine state of cultivation; has assisted in building sour churches; led the singing in church for ten years; is tem perate in all his habits, eschewing both tobacco and spiritu ous beverages. No better representative of pioneer days can be found than the subject of this sketch, B. W. Colburn. They have four living children, viz. : Octavia, born July 12, 1865; Orrell, born Sept. 22, 1867 ; Arthur, born Oct. 5, 1869 ; and Huldah, bom Nov. 27, 1872. Mr. Grigsby has always voted with the Democratic party. Has taken an active part in the official business of the township, having been town clerk four terms, and sen*ed as supervisor, treasurer, and township superintendent of schools. We see by these offices of trust to which he has been elected by the people of his township that he has not only found time to make his own business affairs successful, but also to efficiently perform the duties of the public offices which he has held. EDGAR G. MINCKLER In giving a short biographical sketch of Edgar G. Minckler we write of a man who, though not one of the earliest settlers or pioneers of Michigan, yet has shown his ability and made his mark here. Francis E. Minck ler, father of Edgar, with his wife and only child, moved from Clinton Co., N. Y. (where Edgar was born June 11, 1821), in the spring of 1822, to Grand Isle Co., Vt. His occupation had always been that of farming. Ed gar's educational advantages were somewhat limited, he having only the winter months to devote to his education, besides one term at St. Alban's academy, while his summers were wholly taken up by farm-work ; but he succeeded in fitting himself for teaching. This he engaged in until 1848, when, on the 27th of March, of that year, he mar ried Mary T., daughter of Reuben and Rebecca Hyde. Their family are the following-named children : Helen J., married to G. 0. Merriam ; Charles E., married Abbie Pierce ; Sarah E., married to Alonzo Pierce ; Warren E., GEORGE W. GRIGSBY In looking about among the circle of our acquaintances, we are surprised to see how few have made life a success. Per haps in the start each had, to all appearances, the same oppor tunities, but at the close failures are thickly scattered, while here and there a successful one is found. We may call the attention of our readers to George W. Grigsby as one who has made life a success, and we find him now, although comparatively a young man, yet so situated in life that the remainder of it may be spent in enjoying the fruits of his earlier labors. He was born in the countv of Kent En\" land, in 1836. In 1840 he was taken by his father and mother, James and Martha Grigsby, with their five other children, to the United States, and settled in Wayne Co., N.

In those days a boy's life devoid of labor was a remarkable exception. William was not this exception, and, as his father was a farmer, his early days were passed in agricultural pursuits. At the age of twenty, the time when most young men think of beginning life for themselves, William left home and hired out by the month. Por six years he engaged at this during the summer season, and was employed in a tavern during the winter. At the age of twenty-six he came West. After making a short stop at Allegan, Mich., he went to Gun Plain, entering six hundred and forty acres of land in Martin township, this purchase costing him ten shillings per acre. At the end of four years he had sold this. In 1837 he bought three hundred and eighty acres in TroAv bridge toAvnship, and has since made additions until he is now the OAvner of eight hundred acres ; this land Avas heavily timbered, with no improvements. He first lived in a log hut; in a short time built a larger one; this Avas folloAved by the more commodious house which lie noAV occupies. In addition to his houses, he also built two saAv-mills \u2014 one in 1840 and the other in 1844. The first grindstone brought into the township Avas introduced by him. In connection with farming, Mr. Porter has been engaged in man ufacturing shingles, staves, and laths. The early settlers turned their hands to anything by which they could realize a few dollars. Hunting and trapping gave many of them amusement, and added to their small allowance of money. Mr. Porter caught thirty three coons during one Avinter, selling the skins for one dollar each. In 1839, wishing to plant an or chard, he was obliged to walk four miles and carry the trees on his back, carrying tAventy-five each trip, and making four trips. The result of this labor may be seen to-day in the fine-bearing orchard on his farm. Mr. Porter has been twice married. His first wife was Miss Huldah Billings. Five children were born of this union, viz. : Levi, born June 7, 1841; died in Andersonville prison Aug. 1, 1863. Frederic M., born Dec. 10, 1843; noAV living in Trowbridge toAvnship ; served in the war of the Re bellion almost three years. William, born March 4, 1847 ; died Aug. 12, 1857. Tavo died in infancy. Mrs. Porter died March 4, 1847. The second mar riage took place Nov. 14, 1857, when he married the widoAv of James B. Payne, and daughter of Royal and Ph\u0153be SouthAvorth. Five children have been born to them, viz. : Huldah G., Laura J., William D., Lumi E., and Addie AL, all of Avhom are living, Huldah being married. Mrs. Porter and one daughter are members of the Presbyterian Church. Mr. Porter is politically identified with the Repub lican party."], [498, ""], [499, "WATSON TOWNSHIP. 343 married Adella Armstrong ; Reuben H. and Solon T. are still at the old home. In 1850, Mr. Edgar Minckler bought a farm in Grand Isle Co., Vt., and remained there, engaged in farming, until 1861, when he decided to try his fortune in Michigan, the State then so much talked of. Arriving in Allegan County, he settled in Trowbridge township, on section 21, buying one hundred and twenty acres of land at twenty dollars per acre. Has not only engaged in farm ing, but speculated in wild lands ; also engaged in sheep raising. A part of the farm bought by Mr. Minckler was timbered; this he cleared. His first house was a small frame, but this has given place to a fine two-story house, a view of which can be seen on another page of this work. Mr. Minckler is a man of ability, and has been made good use of by his fellow-townsmen in Trowbridge, who have kept him in office most of the time. Has been elected su perintendent of schools, and served twelve years as supervisor. Mr. and Mrs. Minekler's parents were Americans. Neither of them ever came West, but lived and died in the State of Vermont. WATSON.* Survey-township No. 2 north, in range 12 west, other wise known as the civil township of Watson, is not only among the foremost portions of Allegan County in date of settlement, but also in the excellence of its lands and the advanced condition of its farming interests. Its location has some advantages on account of its accessibility to the county-seat, and also to the most important of the villages on the eastern side of the county. It lies south of Hop kins and north of Otsego, while Allegan bounds it on the west and Martin on the east. to be seen in other portions of the county existing here. Gravel and clay combined are found on the slopes, while on the leA'el lands clay-loam is liberally interspersed with sand. On the lowest flats a rich vegetable mould and clay subsoil are present, and in the swamps the usual quantity of muck is to be found. The soil is generally well adapted to the growth of wheat, there being very little territory in the township where that grain does not thrive. Much of the land is devoted to this crop. The last census \u2014 that of 1874 \u2014 gives the number of acres of wheat harvested the pre vious year as 1685, which produced 24,311 bushels, while 991 acres planted with corn yielded 31,854 bushels. Of other grains the annual product was 18,758 bushels, oats having been sown with great success. Much good grass is cut in the township, and hay of a superior quality is pro duced. The number of tons cut in 1873 was 2243. NATURAL FEATURES. The surface of Watson is greatly diversified. A consid erable portion of the south and southwest is level, and pos sesses an easily-cultiA'ated soil. Some swampy land is to be seen, but this is easily susceptible of drainage, and will probably ere long be converted into some of the most val uable land in the township. The northern portion of the township abounds in elevations and declivities, some of which are quite abrupt, and command from their summits extensive views of the surrounding region. On the eastern side, as well as in the centre, many inequalities are to be seen, but the changes of elevation are less abrupt and there are few impediments to the most thorough cultivation. The timber of Watson does not vary greatly in kind or quality from that usually found throughout the county. Beech, maple, whitewood, basswood, sycamore, and oak flourish, and a few oak-openings are still to be seen on the eastern side. Pine is not abundant, but tamarack attains a luxuriant growth on the marshy land. Elm and ash are also to be seen, and so is an occasional hemlock, though the latter does not find a congenial soil in this region. The soil is abundantly watered by springs and brooks, while numberless lakes, both small and large, are sprinkled over the surface. Chief among these are Schnable Lake, on sections 26 and 35 ; Big Lake, principally lying on sec tions 14 and 23 ; Schiller Lake, which lies on section 12 ; Hudson Lake, on section 14; School Section Lake, cover ing portions of sections 15 and 16 ; Pulsifer Lake, prin cipally on section 10 ; and others not of sufficient importance to mention. Many of these sheets of water offer strong attractions to the sportsman, as well as the admirer of pic turesque scenery. Numerous streams and brooks emanate from these lakes, and afford abundant irrigation to the land. Schnable Brook, in the south, affords quite a good water power. The climate and soil of Watson are both adapted to fruit culture, and no farm is found without its apple-orchard. Many of these produce grafted fruit of a superior quality, and the yield is generally very abundant. The number of apple-trees in the township is estimated at over 20,000, most of which are prolific bearers. The slopes and hills are ad mirably adapted to the culture of peaches, and more atten tion is being devoted to this fruit than heretofore. Those trees which are of sufficient age have yielded superior crops, while many orchards are but just started, and will require some time before becoming a source of profit. Two railroads afford the inhabitants of Watson ample opportunities for the shipment of produce. The Allegan and Southeastern road, which is operated by the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Company, enters the township on the west line of section 30, and, passing nearly due east, leaves it A variety of soil is found in Watson, nearly all the kinds * By E.

He entered 160 acres on section 17, May 20, 1836, and the same year built a log house upon it, bringing help from Allegan to assist in the raising. This was the first house in the town ship, and Mrs. Miner on her arrival was the sole female representative of the Caucasian race in Watson. Mr. Miner devoted himself at once to the improvement of his land, clearing and sowing wheat, and assisting, as far as he was able, the later settlers in the township. He was the earliest postmaster in Watson, the office, which was legally known as Proctor, having been located at his house. He died in 1876, on the farm he had cleared up, which is now occupied by his two sons, Charles M. and William Miner. His widow resides with her daughter in Allegan.

He at first built and occupied a board shanty 12 feet square, but the next year erected a log house. Mr. Miner spent his subsequent life upon this farm, where he died in the fall of 1876. It is now occupied by his children. His brother, Joseph Miner, who arrived in the fall of the same year, located himself on section 17 and resided with his mother, who survived for several years her removal to the West. Sir.

They were employed by Alexander L. Ely in clearing lands in that township, and were induced to make a purchase there, but Daniel, not being satisfied with his location, exchanged his land for 80 acres in Watson, on section 20. This he cleared and improved, and became one of the most enterprising citizens of the township. He was largely instrumental in the erection of a Catholic church in Watson, and contributed liberally to its support. His brother James, who survives him, is still a resident of Allegan. land on which he first located, and was succeeded in the ownership by his widow and his son, Gilbert A. Dunning. William Allen, a former resident of Vermont, came to Allegan in 1837, and for a while had charge of the board ing-house erected by Alexander L. Ely for the accommoda tion of the men employed by him on the various improve ments that engaged his energies. Soon aster, he purchased land on section 27, upon which he erected a log house. He was for some time employed upon the Justin Ely farm, in the township of Allegan, but in 1841 became a perma nent resident of Watson, and occupied the house he had already built. He improved his land and rendered it among the most desirable farms in the township. He has since erected a substantial frame house, in which he now resides. Eli Watson, a previous resident of Jefferson Co., N. Y., entered the east half of the northwest quarter of sec tion 20 in 1836. He did not remove to the township until August, 1837. He came with his family to what is now Trowbridge in July of that year, and accepted the hospitality of Mr. Granger, of that township, for about six weeks, until their own log house was ready for occupation. Their household goods were stored in an empty house owned by Dr. Bigelow, and there they slept at night, living during the day at Mr. Granger's. As soon as their cabin in Watson was completed, they moved into it. He was a successful farmer and public-spirited citizen, devoting a por tion of his time to the interests of the township, but he at length removed, with the tide of emigration, to Nebraska, where his son now resides. Still later Mr. Watson returned to Allegan, the scene of his early efforts, and died there. John Hicks, an emigrant from the Dominion of Canada, arrived in 1837, and obtained a fractional 80 acres on section 24. A year later he returned for his family, and on his arrival at home hired a conveyance to bring him as far as Marshall. His limited means would permit of no further expenditure for traveling purposes, and the family pursued the remainder of their journey on foot. A wheelbarrow was employed during their progress, which served to render the pilgrimage less wearisome to the little ones. Mr. Hicks and his family found the log house he had built very inviting aster the fatigues of travel. He resided in the township during his lifetime, most of which was devoted to labor upon his land. His death occurred in 1878, at the advanced age of eighty-four years. Samuel A. Atkins, a former resident of Tompkins Co., N. Y., was among the foremost pioneers of 1838, and lo cated upon the east half of the northeast quarter of section 26. On section 24 was a squatter named David Updyck, who, aster a brief residence, disposed of his improvements to a permanent settler. With him Mr. Atkins remained until he had completed a house, to which he speedily brought his family. Mr. Atkins experienced all the hard ships of pioneer life, and was on one occasion obliged to carry a bag of corn on his back seven or eight miles to Pine Creek to be ground, and to bring back the grist in the same manner. Perseverance and courage, however, ulti mately brought him a competence, which he still lives to enjoy. His son, A. W. Atkins, who came with his father in 1848, now resides upon a tract of 200 acres on sections 23 and 26. From New York State came N. K. Lonsbury, first to Lenawee County, and in 1839 to Watson. He entered at Kalamazoo \u2014 that having at the time been the site of the land-office \u2014 80 acres on section 17. On this he erected a log house, to which he later brought his wife. His neigh bors were the Miner brothers, \u2014 Joseph, William, and Chester Miner, \u2014 Daniel Leggett, and Eli Watson. There were at this time no roads, and Mr. Lonsbury was obliged to open a highway to his farm through the dense forest. He cleared five acres the first year and sowed a portion with wheat, which yielded an abundant harvest, meanwhile laboring in various portions of the county to obtaiu means wherewith to live. He had no horses, an ox-team having aided in his pioneer labors. In 1856 he erected a sub stantial house, in which he has since resided. Mr. Lons bury was married, in 1841, to Miss Lucy A. Miner, the earliest marriage in the township. His brother, Henry Lonsbury, came some years later, and located 80 acres on the school section. This land was unimproved when he settled upon it, but industry and energy have rendered it a well-cultivated farm. At this time a pilgrimage of sev eral miles was necessary to obtain lumber for building pur poses. In 1859, William S. Miner erected a saw-mill on Schnable Brook, which after that date supplied much of the building material of the township. Caleb D. Carmen, another pioneer from Tompkins County, N. Y., located in 1838 upon 40 acres on section 25. He was the father-in-law of Mr. Atkins, and found with him a temporary home until he could build a log house for himself. Mr. Carmen was by trade a shoemaker, and during the early years of his residence numerous de mands were made upon his skill. He resided on the place he first occupied until his death, ten years later, at a very advanced age. Amos D. Dunning, another of the Monroe County pio neers, arrived in 1837, and found a home with William S. Miner, and later purchased 80 acres on section 22. He was selected by his fellow-townsmen as their choice for supervisor aster the organization of the township, aud filled other local offices acceptably. Mr. Dunning died upon the Peter Richart, another pioneer of 1838, came from Pennsylvania and located on section 21, where he purchased SO acres, which as yet was unimproved. He cleared the principal portion, and resided for several years upon it. Later he removed to Otsego, where he engaged in milling, and ultimately chose Pine Creek as a residence. 44"], [504, "346 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. The arrival of Job Moon occurred at the same date, and a farm on section 29 absorbed his attention for many years. The attractions of the West were, however, superior to the advantages Michigan offered, and he departed for Nebraska. Later he removed to Missouri, where he has since remained. chose the township as his residence, purchasing 80 acres on section 22, upon which he built a log house. He soon after began the cultivation of the land, which he rendered productive, but ultimately removed from, and located upon the same section, adjoining the residence of his son Sam uel, who has 60 acres on seetion 22. The farm, improved by Nelson Fisk, is now occupied by Samuel Martin. Among the foremost citizens of Watson is Jesse D. Stone, who came from Rochester, N. Y., in 1836, and located 80 acres on section 23. Though an early pur chaser of land, he did not become a permanent resident until 1840. Amos D. Dunning welcomed him to his hum ble quarters while procuring material for the erection of a house. The township presented a very primitive appear ance at this early date. A dense forest covered most of the land, the Miner settlement alone affording an exception to this fact. Wolves and deer were abundant, and Indians roamed the wilderness in pursuit of game, or wandered along the streams which afforded them subsistence. Two acres had already been planted with corn on Mr. Stone's arrival, which yielded the family a supply of food until a greater variety could be obtained. The log house was later supplanted by a comfortable frame residence, in which Mr. Stone, as advancing years overtake him, spends peacefully the remainder of his life. J. Pulsifer, a former resident of Ohio, found an at tractive home on section 9, upon which he located in 1853, and on which he built a log house. A cooper-shop, which had done duty on previous occasions in affording shelter to pioneers, performed the same kind of office for his family during the interval. He was the earliest pioneer in the immediate neighborhood. A brother, William Pulsifer, followed a year later, and aster a temporary residence with him removed to section 10. Still later another brother, Horace, located on the same section. Both are now dead. John Grant, formerly of Lyons, N. Y., erected on sec tion 22 a frame house in 1856, having on his arrival re ceiA'ed a welcome from S. V. Borne, who Avas then a neighbor, but has since removed to Monterey. Mr. Grant afterward changed his location to section 26, where he also erected a frame house, and now resides. He is by trade a carpenter, and numerous residences in the township bear evidence to his taste and skill. Lloyd Austin, on his arrival from New York, located first in Allegan. The land on section 27 offered strong attractions, and induced him, in 1842, to purchase 160 acres, which he converted from a wilderness to fruitful fields. He died, in 1878, upon this farm, having left a record for excellence of character which made his death universally deplored. John McLaughlin, one of the band of Irish pioneers that helped to populate Allegan County, purchased 95 acres in 1856 on section 14, the former owner having been Alfred Stone. A tract of five acres had already been cleared, but no house was built upon it. William Kent's hospitality was extended to him for seven weeks while material was being prepared for the erection of a house, to which his family removed on completion. His improvements the first year embraced five acres, which were gradually increased until the whole farm reached a high degree of cultivation. A convenient frame residence has since taken the place of the log structure. Mr. McLaughlin suffered much from poor health on his arrival, but has since become thoroughly acclimated. Edward Flannagan, the second arrival among the Irish population of Watson, was a pioneer of 1845. He cleared a portion of the 80 acres he purchased on section 8, and erected a log house. His death occurred in Allegan in 1877. William Kent emigrated from Canada to the wilds of Michigan in 1840, and found a home in Watson in 1848, having selected 15 acres on section 15. He was accom panied by five sons, of whom William, James, and George now reside in the township. This venerable gentleman is now in his eighty-fourth year, and in his advanced age enjoys the filial care of his son George, with whom he resides. Randall Brooks became a resident of Watson in 1846, having located on section 27, where he still resides. He found temporary shelter at the house of Charles Dunning, who had located 80 acres on section 26, but who subse quently removed to Iowa, where he died. Wells Field, a native of Phelps, Ontario Co., N. Y., emi grated to the village of Allegan with his wife in July, 1836, and took charge of a store of Joseph Fisk, where he re mained for a year, when he assumed the position of \" mine host\" of the Allegan, and in the fall of 1840 he purchased the west half of the southwest quarter of section 19, in Watson township, near his brother-in-law, William Pullen, who settled in Allegan township a year or two previous. Mr. Field and his family remained at Mr. Pullen's for about a year, and returned to the village of Allegan, where they resided three years, and again removed to the farm and purchased the east half of the southwest quarter of 19. At this time he built a frame house and resided there for three years, when he moved to Allegan and spent three years, and in 1849 again went back to the farm. He now lives in Allegan, still owning the southwest quarter of sec tion 19. William A. Reynolds, a former resident of New York State, removed to Gun Plain in 1845, and to the township of Watson one year later, having chosen a location upon section 12, where he now owns a farm that has been culti vated to a high state of productiveness. In 1852, George W. Gorton became a permanent resi dent of Watson, having arrived on a prospecting tour two years previously. He chose a home upon 80 acres on sec tion 13, upon which he built a substantial residence. He enjoys the reputation of being a successful farmer. Three years later came James Anderson, from Monroe County, who chose a farm of 139 acres on section 15. A log house had already been built by one Stratton, the for mer owner, but no improvements were made. Later, Mr. Anderson removed to section 10, where he erected a com fortable habitation, which he now occupies. Nelson Fisk came from New York State in 1850, aud"], [505, "WATSON TOWNSHIP. 347 From Livingston County came William Wheatley in 1855, who located on section 8, where he found productive land and where he resided until his death, in 1873. ginning on section 6, in Otsego, and pursuing first a north erly, then an easterly course, and terminating at the quarter post between sections 5 and 6, in Watson. Other roads followed as the township became more thickly populated, Allegan or Otsego having been the objective point. Among other pioneers whose enterprise entitles them to especial mention are Nicholas Skinner, J. A. Caughcy, L. Brewer, A. W. Beals, A. Durkee, J. Potter, II. Bartlett, E. C. Osborn, L. Howe, F. Goldspring, W. Wetherill, H. D. Edgarton, Wells Field, Wm. Oaks, Jedediah Morse, and Charles Benson. SCHOOLS The educational interests of the township first received attention in 1840. Until then no effort towards the establishment of a school within the boundaries of Watson had been made. In that year a log school-house was erec ted on section 20, upon land owned by Daniel Leggett, and Miss Mary Ann Stone was employed in the capacity of teacher. Nine scholars received early instruction and dis cipline at her hands. The earliest religious services in the township were held in the first log house erected in Watson, that of Wm. S. Miner. They were conducted by Rev. W. C. H. Bliss, of Allegan, whose zeal in the good cause had made him a pioneer in Christian work in other portions of the county. Later services were conducted in the Miner school-house, which, for a succession of years, was the resort on Sabbath of the church-going population of Watson. Later, district No. 2, having been organized, and em bracing section 27 within its boundaries, a school building, known as the Stone school-house, from its close proximity to the residence of Jesse D. Stone, was erected. The ear liest teacher is, however, not recalled. Nine whole and two fractional districts now include eleven substantial frame school buildings within the limits, the directors of whom are W. H. Miner, James C. Leggett, Harvey J. Chase, J. W. Haynes, Phineas Konkle, John Nevill, Jacob Rautz, J. B. Hall, Dennie De Lano, Alexander McBride, and Ja bish B. Tefft. The number of children receiving instruc tion is 362, of whom 62 are non-residents. Six male and 17 female teachers preside over the various schools, some in summer and some in winter, who receive an aggregate yearly sum of $1400.67. The total resources of the town ship for school purposes is \u00a72494.77. The following list embraces the names of the tax-payers in Watson for the year 1843 : Eli AVatson. John Hicks.

The earliest death in Watson occurred in the family of S. A. Atkins. No ground having been set apart for pur poses of interment, the remains of the little one were taken to Martin for burial. In 1843 an acre of ground was pur chased of Eli Watson, on section 20, neatly fenced, and planted with attractive shade-trees, which has since that date been used by the townspeople as a cemetery. Some years later an acre was secured on section 24, which was inclosed and devoted to the same use. This consecrated spot is located on the borders of a picturesque lake and adorned with evergreens and maples, which combine to make it one of the most attractive localities within the limits of the township. EARLY ROADS. The earliest road which traversed the township of Watson entered it on the western boundary-line, between sections 18 and 19. From that point its course continued until it reached the centre of the section-line between sections 17 and 20, where it diverged to the southeast, passing in an oblique line through sections 20, 21, 22, and terminating at the northwest quarter of section 23, near the residence of Jesse D. Stone. This road, by intersecting with a road in the township of Allegan, made the village of Allegan accessible to the residents of Watson. It is probable that the survey was made by William R. Watson, in 1837. A road which was recorded April 21, 1838, and was sur veyed either by William R. Watson or Aaron Chichester, at a date prior to this, began WATSON CORNERS. The land on which the first building at the Corners was erected was originally entered by A. J. Kent, Dec. 8, 1849, on a warrant obtained for services as a patriot in the war of 1S12. It was purchased from him by Edward Bil lings, who, in 1854, sold to A. W. Atkins. The latter gen tleman sold half an acre to George Harman, who speedily built a blacksmith-shop and partially completed a house \"At a post on the section-line seventeen chains thirty links east of the northwest corner of section 23, in township one north, of range twelve west, and ran as follows : 1st. 4 degrees 15 minutes west 15 chains. 2d. 19 degrees west 28 chains 50 links. 3d. 9 degrees west 38 chains 50 links. 4th.

WATSON LODGE, No. 226, I. O. O. P. The charter of Watson Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd-Fellows bears date Feb. 19, 1876, the charter members having been Judson A. Frost, James E. Lons bury, David R. Miller, Zachariah Foster, S. Van Duzen, William C. Rowe, Daniel K. Davis, David Bracelin, and Charles E. White. Its first officers were James B. Lons bury, N. G. ; David R. Miller, V. G. ; J. A. Frost, Sec. ; William R. Rowe, Treas. Eugene Bartholomew arrived in 1879 and built a black smith-shop, which he still conducts. One of the school buildings of the township is also located here. CHRISTIAN CHURCH. The society of Christians in WTatson had its begin ning as early as 1854, under the fostering care of Elder Manchester, who first preached to the small flock in the Stone school-house, on section 18. The members increased, and the need of a larger and more permanent place of wor ship was felt. Under the spur of this need an effort was made to erect a house of worship, which resulted in the present frame edifice on section 23, built in 1856 by sub scription. The clergymen in succession aster Elder Man chester have been Elders Daily, Deyo, and Fowler. The pastor of the Baptist Church of Otsego, Elder Buck, now holds a service each Sabbath, but the society has no stated pastor. The present trustees are John Edgarton, Samuel Fisk, Nelson Fisk. The convocations of the lodge are held on Saturday night of each week, in a spacious and well-appointed hall which was built for the purpose, and is the property of the lodge, the first floor being used as a public hall. The present officers are B. C. Palmer, N. G. ; J. F. Austin, V. G. ; G. V. Goueher, Sec.; J. C. Leggett, Permanent Sec. ; J. W. Kent, Treas. THE WATSON LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. This association was organized by a few citizens of liter ary taste in 1877, and holds its meetings semi-monthly at the residences of the various members. Its object is the accumulation of a class of wholesome and entertaining literature for the use of those interested in the association. The members have been successful in gathering a choice collection of reading matter, which is dispensed at the residence of Mr. A. W. Atkins, whose son is the efficient librarian. The present officers are Smith Albertson, Presi dent; Samuel Fisk, Secretary; Alfred Fassett, Treasurer; L. G. Atkins, Librarian. ST. MARY'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. In 1857 the first movement was begun which later re sulted in the establishment of a permanent and successful Roman Catholic society in Watson. In that year Father Labelle, of French descent, made a pilgrimage to the town ship from Kalamazoo once in three months, and ministered to the people, services having been held first at the house of Daniel Bracelin, and subsequently at the houses of other residents. ORGANIZATION In 1867 an effort was made to build a church, and so zealous were this people to further the interests of the cause that several members of the congregation secured a loan of $500 by mortgages on their farms, which three years later were canceled. This amount, together with small sub scriptions and contributions in labor and material, enabled them to build the present edifice on section 8. The pastors in succession since Father Labelle's advent have been Father Quinn, -Father Herwig, who remained three years, Father Seybold, and the present incumbent, Father Brog ger. A Sabbath-school connected with the society is held during the summer months, with about 40 children in at tendance. The present trustees are Patrick Gilligan, Wil liam Kavanaugh, John McLoughlin. The survey of township 2 in range 1 2 was made by Lucius Lyon, being completed April 30, 1831. It was first in Allegan township and then in Otsego, but by the following act, passed Feb. 16, 1842, it became independent: \"sAll that part of the county of Allegan designated as townships Nos. 2, 3, and 4 north, in range No. 12 west, is set off into a separate township and organized by the name of Watson, and the first township-meeting shall be held at the house of Eli Watson.\" This included the townships of Hopkins and Dorr, which later became distinct orga nizations and left the township of Watson with its present geographical boundaries, Dorr having been set off in 1847, and Hopkins in 1852. WATSON GRANGE, No. 154. CIVIL LIST. The first effort to establish a grange in Watson was made in 1874, which soon aster resulted in the present prosperous organization, its first officers having been John F. Beebe, Master ; B. C. Palmer, Overseer ; William Kent, Steward \u2022 Joseph Miner, Chaplain ; J. B. Alexander, See. ; James W. Kent, Treas. A convenient hall for the use of the or ganization was soon after erected on section 15. The Wat son grange is among the most flourishing in the county, having now a membership of 150, and enjoying a steady increase in members and influence. Its meetings are held twice a month. The present officers are S. P. Albertson, Master; Ransom Leach, Overseer; William A. Reynolds, The first meeting of the township of Watson after its organization occurred on the 4th day of April, 1842, at the house of Eli Watson, on section 20, Daniel Leggett, Chester A.

From the age of nine until his fourteenth year, his home was with a cousin. At the expiration of that time he became inde pendent of friendly aid, having earned a comfortable sup port by hard labor. On the 5th of February, 1837, he was married to Miss Mary, daughter of Robert and Eliza beth Russell, both natives of the State of New York. Iu 1844, Mr. Reynolds followed the tide of emigration to the West and located at Gun Plain, where he remained one year. In 1845 he removed to the land he at present owns, having pre-empted it. The home of Mr. and Mrs. Rey nolds was brightened by the happy faces of six children, \u2014 three boys and three girls. Mrs. Mary Reynolds having died on March 30, 1872, her husband, on the 22d of March, 1873, was united to Mrs. Mary Palmer, widow of David Palmer, formerly of Pine Plains. The parents of Stephen Case were both natives of New York State, the father having died when the lad was but six years of age. This son, the tenth in a family of thir teen children, whoso birth occurred in Henrietta, Monroe Co., N. Y., May 20, 1824, found a home with an uncle until his' twenty-second year, when he engaged in labor elsewhere in the same township. He purchased land in Michigan in 1848, and two years later married Miss Sarah Harris, daughter of Thomas and Mary Harris, who was born in Monroe Co., N. Y., March 19, 1828. In the spring of 1855, Mr. and Mrs. Case became pioneers in the township of Watson, Allegan Co., where he erected a log house, which is the inevitable accompaniment of the life of the early settler, and chopped thirty acres soon after his advent. This was not, however, a permanent abiding-place. In 1870 he sold, and the year following purchased his present attractive home. Mr. Reynolds is associated with the Baptist Church, of which he is an active member, as he is also of the lodge of Odd-Fellows of Watson. In politics he affiliates with the Greenback party. He is an enterprising and public spirited citizen, and by his consistency of character has won the respect of acquaintances and neighbors. The family circle of Mr. and Mrs. Case includes four children,\u2014 Mary E., born Oct. 5, 1851 ; Ardell S., born Dec. 5, 1853; Ella A., born Jan. 27, 1856; and Julia P., whose birth occurred Sept. 28, 1858. Mary E. was mar ried in April, 1876, to James R. Fenner; Ella A. became Mrs. William H. Hooper, Dec. 19, 1877; and Julia P. was united to Delavan R. Hooper in May, 1879. They all occupy homes in the vicinity of that of Mr. and Mrs. Case, forming a neighborhood linked by the ties of rela tionship and affection. CHARLES MINER. Though not a pioneer in the sense of age, Mr. Miner was among the earliest arrivals in Allegan County, and has ac complished as much of the preliminary labor of clearing as others whose silver locks are evidence of the rapid flight of time. His birth occurred in the town of Brighton, Monroe Co., N. Y., Jan. 3, 1835, and with his father, Chester A. Miner, he made his advent in the State soon aster. His residence was at the homestead until twenty one years of age, when he returned to the East, and during this period married Miss Lucy R. Edgarton. Together WILLIAM A. REYNOLDS. The parents of William A. Reynolds were born in the State of New York, and he, the eleventh in a family of twelve children, was a native of Jefferson County, in that State. He was early placed in the family of William Hewitt, with whom he remained until his ninth year,"], [511, ""], [512, "Residence of G..W.G-C. JON, WatsonTp., /.lle&an Co., Mich. Residence of O.F.A Y RES, Watson Tr>, Allegan Co., Mich"], [513, "WATSON TOWNSHIP, 351 they embarked for Michigan with little else than courage and ambition as their capital. Mr. Miner purchased a farm in Watson, and their energies were directed to liqui dating the indebtedness upon this land. To acquire means for this purpose was a much less arduous task at the East than in Michigan. Mr. and Mrs. Miner's family circle has been made happy by the presence of sour sons. Frank M. was born June 7, 1858, and died Oct. 1, 1862; James was born in Hartland, N. Y., May 26, 1860; the birth of Martin C. occurred June 8, 1868; and that of Fred C., June 20, 1871. Mr. Miner is a Republican in his politi cal convictions, but is rarely interested in party differences or local contests. The cares of the fine property he has accumulated occupy at present his time and energies. 1801. His mother, whose birthplace was in the same State, was Miss Electa Hitchcock, who was born Feb. 14, 1799. The birth of their son Gorum W., a native of \u25a0Monroe Co., N. Y., and the fourth in a family of six chil dren, occurred Aug. 29, 1829. In 1849 the latter em barked for Michigan, having previous to his twentieth year assisted his father in his farming pursuits. His grandfather had entered land in Watson, which had by inheritance fallen to him. On his arrival he remained one year, and then returned to his native State, where he was married to Miss Mary A. Mellows, who was the daughter of Thomas and Jane Davis Mellows, and was born in Monroe Co., N. Y., June 30, 1830. She was the third in a family of eight children, her parents having formerly resided in England. In 1852, Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Gorton became permanent residents of the State. He had previously hired twenty acres chopped, and upon this he built a log house, to which they removed, and experienced all the privations of the Western pioneer. Three children have graced their family circle, \u2014 Electa J., born Dec. 15, 1851 ; Russell J., whose birth occurred May 12, 1857; and J. W., born Oct. 5, 1863. These children still enjoy the protection of the parental roof. In religion Mr. Gorton is liberal ; in politics a Republican, though not an active partisan. ISAAC PAGE. Mr. Page was formerly a British subject, having been born (the fifth in a family of nine children) in Sussex, England, Feb. 15, 1829. In 1855 he sailed for the hos pitable shores of America, and in the same year arrived in Watson, Allegan Co., where he engaged in clearing land and other labors of a similar character until a fa\\7orable op portunity occurred for the cultivation of a farm on shares. He meanwhile purchased eighty acres of land, which was sold again in 18C7, he having bought a more desirable tract elsewhere. To this he has from time to time added, until two hundred and fifteen acres are embraced in his present estate. Having been possessed of little or no prop erty on his arrival, Mr. Page may, in an eminent sense, be regarded as entitled to a prominent place among the self made men of this county. D. F. AYRES. In a family embracing eight sons and ten daughters, Mr. D. F. Ayres was the eleventh child, having been born in Pennsylvania, March 3, 1822. He remained under the parental roof until twenty-one years of age, when employ ment was sought in an iron-foundry in Ohio, his family having meanwhile removed to that State. On the 9th of January, 1845, he married Miss Sarah, daughter of George Mason, who was a native of Essex Co., N. Y., and born Feb. 6, 1828. Mr. Ayres came to the State in 1852, and secured the land -he at present owns. It was entirely un improved, and indicates much labor and enterprise in its present cultivated condition. A log house was early erected, which has been the comfortable home of the family to the present day. Mrs. Page was formerly Miss Susan A. Clay, a native of Virginia, to whom he was married March 24, 1872. In 1869 Mr. Page visited the home of his childhood, which he had left many years before almost penniless, but now as a successful and independent farmer. In politics Mr. Page is a Democrat, and has held the offices of justice of the peace and highway commissioner, both of which positions he has dignified by administrations characterized by ability and integrity. Iu religion he is a liberal, but his opinions are marked by a profound respect and regard for the convictions of others. Mr. and Mrs. Ayres have had four children, \u2014 George F. and G. F. (2d), Cora A. and Tull B., the last of whom is still a member of the home circle. In politics Mr. Ayres was formerly a Republican, but his political affiliations have more recently been with the Greenback party. He is one of the most conspicuous examples of the reward which follows industry and ambition, having borrowed the means with which to reach Michigan. GORUM W. GORTON. The father of G. W. Gorton, the latter of whom is the subject of this biographical sketch, was William H. Gorton, a native of the State of New York, who was born Nov. 15,"], [514, "352 wayland: This township, situated on the eastern border of Allegan County, north of the centre, embraces territory designated in the field-notes of the original survey as township num ber 3 north, of range number 1 1 west. It was formed from Martin in 1843, and began a separate existence, April 1, 1844. The adjoining townships are Leighton on the north, Hop kins on the west, Martin on the south, and Yankee Springs, inBarry County, on the east. Its surface, generally rolling, was cumbered originally with a heavy growth of timber, the deciduous varieties common to this region predominating. In the vicinity of the pres ent village of Wayland, also in the northeastern and south eastern parts of the township, extensive pine-groves once existed. These beautiful and valuable monarchs of the forest, however, with the exception of Balch's tract, fell early victims to the rapacity of the all-pervading \" shingle weavers\" of the pioneer period ; many of them, indeed, before the land came into market, or while assessed as non resident. Wayland soil affords no exception to that which charac terizes Michigan lands generally, \u2014 ie , alternating belts or strips of clay and sandy loam, with here and there, in the lower portions, alluvial deposits. Intelligently cultivated, it is productive, and yields generously of fruit, grain, etc. The people are chiefly engaged in agricultural pursuits, wheat, live-stock, and lumber, being the principal articles of shipment. The water-courses are unimportant, the principal one being Babbit Biver, or the outlet of Mud Lake, which flows to the northwest. Several lakes dot the surface, and together embrace an area of about 900 acres, the largest among them being known as Selkrig's, Boot, Geneva, and Mud Lakes. Gun Lake, the largest body of water in this vicinity, includes within its limits the extreme southeast corner of the township. The Grand Bapids and Indiana Railroad, which was completed in 1870, running in a north-and-south course through the western part, traverses sections 6, 7, 18, 19, 30, and 32, Wayland and Bradley being the stations in this township. EVENTS PRECEDING SETTLEMENT. The history of Wayland properly begins with the year 1826, when Deputy Lucius Lyon ran its boundaries. A period of over four years then elapsed, when the denizens of its forests were again disturbed by a second surveying party. This party was headed by Sylvester Sibley, also a deputy United States surveyor, who had contracted to run * By J. S. Schenck. out the sectional lines of this and many other townships in this part of the State. His work in this township was completed during the month of March, 1831. Although this small portion of the public domain was soon after placed in market, it was not until Jan. 9, 1835, that the first individual purchase of land was made in the present township of Wayland. On the date last mentioned Col. Isaac Barnes, who had become the first settler of Richland, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., in 1830, purchased a portion of section 9. Three other tracts only were purchased during the remainder of the year 1835, to wit : part of section 29, Azor Forsyth and Alan son Beals, Washtenaw Co., Mich., Sept. 10, 1835 ; part of section 6, Isaac and George W. Barnes, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., Dec. 25, 1835 ; part of section 10, Isaac and George W. Barnes, Kalamazoo Co., Mich., Dec. 25, 1835.

FIRST AND OTHER EARLY SETTLEMENTS. During the years 1835, 1830, and 1837, Col. Isaac Barnes, of Gull Prairie, and his son, George W. Barnes, purchased large tracts of government laud in the counties of Allegan, Barry, Eaton, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren. In this township they owned lands on sections 2, 3, 6, 9, and 10. On Rabbit River, in the southwest part of section 2, was a mill-site. Surrounding it, and on other lands owned by them in the immediate vicinity, were exten sive forests of pine.

Barnes built a log house on the site of F. F. Wait's present residence. Upon its completion this house was occupied by Daniel Jackson and wife, from Gull Prairie, Jackson having been hired to come here, keep the house, and board the men then engaged in lumbering and the construction of a saw-mill. The Jack sons remained but about four months, Mrs. Jackson be coming so lonely and homesick in the wild woods that life here was no longer endurable.

It was necessary, however, that some one should attend to household duties in caring for the wants of the workmen, and, as the owners intended to make this place their perma nent residence, Lucius A. Barnes \u2014 son of Isaac \u2014 was induced to remoA'e from Gull Prairie and occupy the house just vacated by Mr. Jackson. With his young wife he first began housekeeping here in the month of September, 1837.

Barnes, principally \u2014 to Marshall, Battle Creek, and Kalamazoo. For five or six years the water-supply was abundant, the flow in Rabbit River being about four times its present volume.

His wife followed him but three days later. Among others who settled during the year 1839 were Oziel H. Rounds on section 27 ; Joel Brownson on section 20 ; his son Apollos P., who early settled upon section 5 ; Rev. James Selkrig at the mission ; and Nelson M. Pollard, who first worked for Mr. Selkrig, but afterwards purchased land on sections 23 and 29. Lucius A. Barnes, still a resident of this township, is entitled to prominence as one of the earliest pioneers of Southern Michigan. In 1830 he carried the first mail west from Jackson,* the route extending from the latter place to Gull Prairie. The dwelling of Rev. Mr. Fassett, who lived some six miles west from Sandstone, was then the only one between the two points mentioned. Trips were made on horseDack. The following year, with horse team and wagon, he carried the mail from Marshall, vid Battle Creek and Gull Prairie, to Schoolcraft. He also claims to have driven the first horse-team from Gull Prairie to White Pigeon and Niles, to have entered at the White Pigeon land-office, for Louis Campau, the lands now occu pied by the city of Grand Rapids, and to have driven the first sleigh into Grand Rapids when its only white inhabi tants were Louis Campau, the French trader, and Rev. Leonard Slater, the Indian missionary. Since his first settlement in this town, in 1837, Mr. L. A. Barnes has resided in Ohio and at Green Lake, in Leighton, Avhere he kept hotel for some years in the old building erected by Louis Campau in 1833 or 1834. He again became a citizen of Wayland in 1854. SELKRIG AND THE INDIAN MISSION. Rev. James Selkrig was born in the town of Claverack, Columbia Co., N. Y. His father, Jeremiah Selkrig, gained distinction during the war of the Revolution as one of Washington's aids. Quite early James sought the dangers and excitement of a seafaring life, and served under both the French and American flags. He finally became a resi dent of Pompey, Onondaga Co., N. Y., a convert and preacher of the Methodist Episcopal faith, and for some years preached at various places in that region. He then adopted the tenets of the Episcopal Church, and was ordained by Bishop Onderdonk, of New York. In 1836 he moved from Onondaga Co., N. Y., to the village of Niles, Mich., where he soon after built the first Episcopal church edifice in that portion of the State. Desirous of having music to aid him in the services, with his own hands he constructed an organ, and presented it to the church. He remained at Niles two years. Orrin Orton, who settled in the present township of Gun Plain in 1835, purchased portions of sections 25 and 36, in this township, in the spring of 1837, and became one of the earliest settlers in Wayland by locating upon the north east quarter of section 36 during the fall of the latter year. At about this time the scattered bands of Indians still re maining among the settled districts of Michigan attracted the attention of the general government, and a plan was devised of bringing them together under various religious denominations by appropriating certain sums of money to the churches then in existence here, for mission purposes, in lieu of granting yearly annuities to the Indians them selves. Timothy Gregg, of Hector, Tompkins Co. (now Schuyler Co.), N. Y., bought lands on sections 27 and 28 in Decem ber, 1836. Joseph M., his eldest son, was then a resident of Kalamazoo, Mich. During the spring of 1837, Timothy Gregg, accompanied by bis son William H. H., came to Michigan and occupied a rented place on Grand Prairie, Kalamazoo Co. One year later the father and sons removed to this township and began the improvement of land pur chased in 1836. The family first occupied a shanty which stood near Shelby Station. During the summer a road was cut to Barnes' saw-mill, where plank was obtained, when a dwelling, composed of that material, was built upon the premises now owned by William H. H. Gregg. This family were assisted in their labor by George Haywood, who ulti mately married Mr. Gregg's daughter and became one of the well-known pioneers of the township. The Greggs raised a crop of corn on John H. Adams' land the first year, and excellent potatoes upon their own, four or five hills of which would fill a bushel-measure. They also cleared and sowed to wheat some nine acres. Members of this family affirm that their settlement was made prior to that of Orrin Orton, while there are others who assert that Orton was the second settler in the township. Desiring to improve this opportunity, Bishop McCoskry, then the Episcopal head of this diocese, began looking about him for subjects upon which to bestow the blessings of civilization and the protection afforded by his church. His search was rewarded by the discovery of Chief Saga maw's band of Ottawas and a few Pottawattamies, \u2014 about 150 in number, \u2014 who were dwelling on a peninsula jutting into Gun Lake. These destitute savages, once, with their fellows, the proud and undisputed owners of a large por tion of the State, had been gradually forced back from their ancient hunting-grounds, until they knew not where to lay their heads. In 1838, Rev. James Selkrig was deputed by the bishop to visit this Indian encampment and to offer those assem bled there the benefits of a mission home. Securing the personal aid of Rev. Leonard Slater, an Indian missionary of the Baptist denomination, an audience was had with Sagamaw at his encampment. The chief requested more time for thought upon the matter, and a second meeting was appointed to be held on the north bank of the beautiful sheet of Avater now known as Selkrig Lake. The bishop was present at this meeting, and at its close the Indians con sented to settle on lauds to be located near the lake last mentioned. Thereupon there was purchased for mission purposes, from the government, 160 acres situated on section Nelson Chambers, the first settler in the northwest quar ter of the township, came in with a sleigh during the winter of 1838-39. In June, 1839, he was assessed as owning 80 acres on section 5, valued at $240, and one yoke of oxen, valued at $70.

His family consisted of himself, his wife, and three children, named James E., Jer emiah, and Charles F. He settled upon the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter of section 28. His first house was of peculiar construction. The walls consisted of hewn timbers tenoned at both ends, which were set up right, and secured to both sills and plates by entering a continuous mortise. standing. In his recollections of events of that time, and of the pioneers who preceded him here, Mr. Lincoln recalls the names of all those already mentioned. He believes that the principals in the first marriage were Richard S. Sage, of Kalamazoo County, and Eveline, daughter of Joel Brownson, and that the ceremony was performed during the winter of 1841 and 1842. The second marriage was that of himself to Miss Brown, Oct. 12, 1843, and the third, The Indians were established upon the same 40 acres during the summer of 1839, and their first work under the supervision of Mr. Selkrig was the building of their wig wams and a large arbor or bower-house, where religious ser vices were held.

Marion Filkins, son of Solomon Filkins, was born the same year. An early death was that of Mary Hamblin, a granddaughter of Abijah Brown. Orrin Orton erected the second framed barn, and George W. Barnes the first framed dwelling, \u2014 the building now occupied by F. F. Wait. Mr. Lincoln was also a pioneer in the township of Leighton. He now These meetings were also regularly attended by many of the early pioneers of the township. A few years after his settlement Mr. Selkrig built the dwelling now occupied by his widow and family, and the old building was then used as the chapel. Until his death, which occurred Oct. 5, 1878, he continued active in the discharge of his labors ; and if he did not succeed in educating his proteges up to a higher degree of excellence than they have attained else where, most certainly he was afforded the gratification of seeing them become self-supporting as agriculturists, and as a class generally law-abiding. Their first chief on these grounds, Sagamaw, was killed by his son-in-law, in 1845, during a drunken quarrel. Pen-ah-see, or \" Bird,\" then became their chieftain, and upon his death was succeeded by Moses Foster orShe-pe-quonk, meaning \" Big Thunder,\" who is their present chief. There still remain upon the mission-lands 14 families of those people, or about 75 per sons all told. They are Indians still, however, and aster more than forty years of daily contact and intercourse with their white neighbors, they retain all the prominent char acteristics of their race in features and habits, and as a re sult their cabins are squalid in appearance, while their style of farming cannot be commended. resides in the village of Wayland. In years prior to 1842 among the additional settlers of Wayland were Joseph Heydenberk, on section 7 ; Solomon Filkins, on section 3 ; Abijah Brown, sections 27 and 28 ; John Frantz, section 24 ; John A. Brown, Hiram Loomis, Thomas Loomis, Calvin Lewis, Joseph and Abel Angel ; and before the organization of the township we find here Stephen S. Germond, Luther Martin, John Haywood, and Dr. David Bradley. Dr. Bradley came from Tompkins Co., N. Y., and was an early postmaster ; also the first physician, merchant, and tavern-keeper in the township. His place was on the old stage-route, section 28. He re moved to Martin Corners in 1854. Twenty-sour voters were present at the first township-meeting in 1S44, and 28 persons were assessed as resident tax-payers the same year. Their names, location, and acres owned by each will be shown on another page. Other well-known pioneers \u00a7 Avho settled in Wayland before the year 1850 were Humphrey Gardner, who came in 1846 ; John Woodward, Justus Taylor, Myron Briggs, Levi Mosher, Amasa Eldred, Cooper Eldred, Levi D. Taylor, Ralph Pratt, William Buchanan, Ambrose Mosher, Alfred Mann, Rev. Samuel Newberry, David Brown, E. F. Waldo, Harlow J. Dean, Tyler Johnson, and George Samuel E. Lincoln, a native of the State of New York, with his parents, moved to Ohio at an early day. In 1837 he came to Kalamazoo and worked at his trade as a house carpenter. During the spring of 1840, accompanied by his brother Horatio, he came to the present town of Way land, and built for Timothy Gregg the first framed barn in the township. This was a large structure, 32 by 44 feet ground plan, with posts 16 feet in length, and re quired to raise it the presence of all the able-bodied ment of the territory comprised in the present towns of W.

This township, originally forming part of Plainfield, was set off as part of Martin in 1839. By an act of the State Legislature, approved March 9, 1843, with Leighton, it was organized as Wayland. Section 1 of an act to organize certain townships in the State of Michigan reads as fol lows : \" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Stale of Michigan, That all that part of the county of Allegan designated by the United States Survey as townships number three and four north, of range number eleven west, now a part of the township of Martin, be and the same is, hereby set off and organized into a separate township by tbe name of AVayland, and the first township-meeting therein shall be held at the house of Col. Barnes, in said township.\" FIRST TOAVNSHIP ELECTION, Etc. It seems that the first township-meeting was not held, however, until the spring of 1844, for we find, by referring to the township records, that the legal voters assembled at the house of Isaac Barnes, April 1, 1844, for the purpose of holding their \" first township-meeting,\" and organ ized by choosing Isaac Barnes moderator, Joel Bronson, George W. Barnes, and Joseph Heydenberk inspectors, and Luther Martin clerk pro tern. Twenty-four voters were present, and the election resulted in the choice of the following township officers: George W.

At the first township election in Wayland, held April 1, 1844, Isaac and G. W. Barnes were elected school inspectors. On the 4th of May, 1844, the Messrs. Barnes, acting in an official capacity, organized three school districts, describ ing their boundaries as follows : \" District No. 1 will contain sections 34, 35, 36, in township four north, of range eleven west, and sections 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, and 12 in township three north, of the same range.

Brownson, as moderator of district No. 2, took his oath of office, and on the 15th day of May the inspectors were notified that all the districts were duly organized. Miss Belinda Eldred, daughter of the first settler of Martin, received a certificate to teach in district No. 2 (the Chambers neighborhood) June 25, 1844, and upon as suming control of the twelve little barefoots intrusted to her supervision, became the first teacher in the township. The house, a small log structure which had formerly done duty as Chambers' shingle shanty, was situated in the village of Wayland, and among the principal patrons were Nelson Chambers, Joseph Heydenberk, and John Parsons. The following winter Miss Eldred taught in the Gregg neighbor hood. In later years she became the wife of Ebenezer Wilder, of Martin, where both reside at present writing. SCHOOL INSPECTORS.

In the spring of 1845 the electors of Wayland voted that the sum of $25 be appropriated for township library. Twenty-five volumes for library purposes were purchased soon after, and the township clerk appointed librarian. Among the rules established by the inspectors for his gui dance were the following : \" For tearing out a leaf, or obliterating so as to destroy the sense, the fine shall be the price of the book. For breaking a cover, half the price of the book; for turning down a leaf, five cents; for every grease spot, five cents.

The bonded indebtedness of school district No. 2, in the village of Wayland, at the close of the school year, was $3000. VILLAGE OF WAYLAND. This is an incorporated village of some 700 inhabitants, situated in the northwest corner of the township of Way land. It is a station on the Grand Kapids and Indiana Railroad, distant twenty-seven miles north of Kalamazoo, twenty-one miles south from Grand Rapids, twenty miles northeast of Allegan, the county-seat, one hundred and seventy-two miles from Detroit, and one hundred and sixty eight from Chicago. The first settler on its site was Nelson Chambers, who came here in the winter of 1838-39, and began an im provement on the west half of the southwest quarter of section 5. His earliest work seems to have been that of a shingle-maker, and the products of his labors were hauled with ox-team to the distant markets of Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. About the year 1840, Apollos P. Brownson settled north of him, on section 5, Joseph Heydenberk to the southwest, on section 7, and John Parsons on the west, in the extreme northeast corner of the present township of Hopkins. These were the first families to settle in the neighborhood for many years known as \" Chambers' Corners.\" In 1844 a school was established here, but nothing indicated this point as the site of a village until the projection of the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank-Road in 1852. This road was completed in 1854. Nelson Chambers then opened the Wayland House. The Wayland post-office was removed from Barnes' Mill to the Corners, and Norton Briggs became postmaster, and tollgate-keeper. In 1857 and '58, Eli F. Clark, Isaac N. Hoyt, William V. Hoyt, and Edwin E. Hoyt settled here. Oliver Edwards sold the first goods in 1860, and vas fol lowed in the mercantile business by Theo. D. Van Valken burg, William E. White, J. M. Berry, and Clark &Henika. In 1861, Israel Kellogg, who owned an extensive tract of pine in this immediate vicinity, also saw-mills and a tannery one-half mile north of the Corners, placed on record a village plat* known as \"Lomax City.\" In 1865 the business of the village was conducted chiefly by William Seaver, hotel-keeper ; Nelson Chambers, Wil liam E. White & Sons, and J. M. Berry, general merchants ; T. D. Van Valkenburg, drugs and groceries ; George Henika, furniture-store; William E. White & Co., pail factory and planing-mill; Jonathan Sessions, shoemaker; H. T. Stringham and David Stockdale, blacksmiths ; Dan. * The original plat was dated Aug. 10, 1861. Additions have since been made by Norton Briggs, Aug. 15, 1862 ; by Albert E. Sawyer, May 2, 1866; by Franklin M. Miles, Dee. 31, 1866; and by Israel Kellogg, Oct. 8, 1870. Miss Alsina Rose received a certificate to teach in dis trict No. 3, Nov. 15, 1845, and Miss Julia Brownson suc ceeded her in the same district on the 15th of May, 1846. James Davis, the first male teacher, was the only one re ceiving a certificate during the year 1847 (November 6th). During the summer of 1848 Euretta Dexter and Mary Jane Forbes received certificates. October 1, 1848, district No. 2 reported 16 scholars ; district No. 3, 46 scholars. No report received from dis trict No. 1. Other early teachers are mentioned by years, as follows : 1849. \u2014 John Parsons, Myron Briggs, Sarah M. Standish. 1850.\u2014 Huldah C.

After the close of the war, and during the excitement produced by the building of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, many families settled, and in 1869, at the time the village was incorporated, there were quite as many here as the village can boast to-day. May 13, 1869, Joseph W. Hicks, county surveyor, established a point between sections 5 and 6, 160 rods north of tbe south line of said sections, as the place from which to predicate and describe the commencement of village streets. The Lake-Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad was first completed, and, as its road-bed at Hilliard's Station was but four miles distant west from Wayland, there were many here who did not believe the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Company Avould run their line through that village. Consequently, an exodus (though a small one) took place. The latter road, however, was completed in the summer of 1870, since which time not many important changes have occurred, except at the station where are situated William E. White's grist-mill, a saw-mill, and a large unoccupied building erected for the purpose of manufacturing chairs. In the village proper the most recent acquisition is a com modious brick school building, which was completed in 1879 at a cost of $4500, including site, etc. In February, 1873, Nelson Chambers and others peti tioned the State Legislature, praying that the village incor poration be vacated. They did not succeed, as counter remonstrants claimed that taxation was not more burden some here than to people outside of the village, and that corporation property to the amount of $2500 would revert to the county of Allegan in case of vacation. During the same year, however, that portion of the village territory belonging to Leighton was excluded from the corporate limits. Another ineffectual effort was made in May, 1874, to annul and vacate incorporation. This petition was signed by Nelson Chambers and forty-six others. WAYLAND POST-OFFICE. The elective officers of the village are a president, six trus tees, a recorder, a treasurer, an assessor, and a marshal, all of whom are elected annually, except trustees, who serve two years, three of their number only being elected annually. Street commissioners, fire-wardens, and poundmasters are appointed. Theo. D. Van Valkenburg succeeded Norton Briggs as postmaster, under Lincoln's administration, and was in turn succeeded by John Chappie, the present incumbent, who was appointed by President Johnson. VILLAGE CORPORATE HISTORY. At the fall meeting of the Allegan County board of su pervisors, held in the year 1868, tbe village of Wayland was duly incorporated, and section 6 and the west half of section 5 designated as its limits. By this act inspectors of election were appointed, and the electors directed to as semble on the first Monday in December, 1868, for holding their first charter election. VILLAGE OFFICERS.

Ten years later he became a resident of the State of Iowa, and remained there eleven years, all this time continuing the practice of medicine. During the years 1864-65, as surgeon, he served with Gen. Sully's command against the Indians in the Northwest. He was mustered out of the United States service at Sioux City, Iowa, and arrived in Wayland in December, 1865, where he still con tinues his practice.

Davison, surgeon-dentist, formerly of North ampton, Mass., removed to the village of Wayland in May, 1865, and opened an office for the practice of his profession. He has been very successful. Drs. Piper, of Allegan, and Coats, of Otsego, were then the only practicing dentists in the county. Both have since died, leaving Dr. Davison the pioneer dentist of Allegan County. He has also always taken an active part in the advancement of the re ligious and educational interests of the village of Wayland. At a regular meeting of the village common council, held Jan. 30, 1869, the first action was taken for the pro tection of property against fire, and by a majority vote hooks, ladders, fire-buckets, etc., were ordered to be pro cured and placed under the orders of Fire- Warden Wil liam H. White. Ladders and pike-poles were supplied in April, 1869, and 100 buckets in November of the same year. It was voted at the charter election in March, 1873, by a vote of 52 to 39, to obtain a supply of water by hy draulic power. But this scheme went no farther than making a preliminary survey, submitting reports, etc. Attorneys. \u2014 Hiram Averill, who settled here in 1866, was the first resident expounder of Blackstone in the vil lage. He is now a citizen of Dorr township. During the year 1875 the hooks and ladders were mounted on a truck. A cistern, costing $130, was com pleted, and Fire Engine No. 119, of the city of Grand Rapids, together with 200 feet of hose, couplings, etc., was purchased at a cost of $400. L. Chase Goodwin, now of Grand Rapids, came a year or so later. Col. Edward M. Fitch, who served during the Mexican war as lieutenant-colonel of the Third Ohio Cavalry, also settled in the village at about this time. He became the first president of the village in 1869, and has since filled most worthily many other positions. On the 23d of March, 1876, the following persons were accepted by the council as firemen of the village : E. E. Hoyt, T. B. Garrett, Frank Henika, J. H. D. Snell, N. II. Sherwood, W. H. White, H. C. Garrett, A. H. Garrett, William L. Heazlit, Frank Carr, M. Kellogg, and A. B. Blanott for the engine company, and Frank Hoyt, Fred. Quinlan, W. H. Schuh, Frank Sooy, L. D. Chappie, Carl Snell, Gus Sooy, Jonathan Sessions, Otto Gleason, W. Olds, Chauncey Halbert, and Myron Carpenter for the hose company. Two hundred feet of additional hose was pur chased in 1877. The fire apparatus of the present consists of the engine, hose-cart, hook and-ladder truck, etc., already mentioned. Albert H. Fenn, now of Allegan, became a resident about 1870. The present attorneys of the village are Edward M. Fitch and David Stockdale, the latter the supervisor of the township since the spring of 1876. SECRET BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATIONS. WAYLAND LODGE, No. 129, I. O. 0. F.f This lodge was instituted Feb. 24, 1869, by Grand Master J. S. Curtis, of East Saginaw. The officers first installed were Edward M. Fitch, N. G. ; Titus Doan, V.

Five new members were initiated the same evening, viz., W. W. Briggs, William V. Hoyt, C. H. Daugherty, O. D. Rowe, and G. L. Doan. The first meetings were PROFESSIONAL MEN. Physicians. \u2014 The first physician to practice in the vil lage was Dr. Remington. The country was sparsely set tled, his patients few in number, and when not profession ally employed he worked in Hoyt's shingle-mill. Dr. Slack, an eclectic, succeeded him. Neither of these re mained here long. John Chappie appointed to fill vacancy, Dec. 15, 1876. t From data furnished by Col. E. M.

About $300 have been expended for furnishing the hall, etc. At the first Quarterly Conference, held in Wayland, Dec. 6, 1856, the following was ordered placed on record : \" Be it remembered that the Wayland Circuit of the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized by Bishop S. A. Morris at the annual session of the Michigan Conference, held at Coldwater Oct. 1, 1856.\" From the minutes of this Quar terly Conference it also appears that the estimating com mittee recommended the paying to Brother Williams a salary of $100 per year. The people, however, were more liberal than the committee, and paid him $180.86, for which increase Brother Williams was undoubtedly grateful.

Regu lar meetings are held Tuesday evening of each week. During the pastorate of Mr. Blowers, in 1862, measures were entered into for the erection of a church edifice. Be fore completing the work, however, he entered the army as chaplain, where he died. JAMES FENTON LODGE, No. 224, F. AND A.

The present board of officers are I. N. Hoyt, W. M. ; V. P. Fales, S. W. ; F. G. Chamberlain, J. W. ; Eli F. Clark, Sec. ; Geo. B. Chambers, Treas. ; E. Sigler, S. D. ; A. Wallbricht, J. D. ; Milo Carpenter, Tyler. In 1864, during the pastorate of Rev. Charles H. Fisher, a neat and commodious building, with a seating capacity for 200 persons, was erected at a cost of $2750, on the curner of Church and Maple Streets; but it was not completed and dedicated until the following year, \u2014 August 10th, \u2014 when Rev. George B. Joslyn, late president of Albion College, conducted the dedicatory services. The Wayland \" Boys in Blue\" ornamented the pulpit with a magnificent Bible, while the trustees adorned the building with a $G00 mort gage. The latter was finally removed in 1870, through the exertions of Rev. James E. White. Previous to October, 1866, a union Sabbath-school had been conducted jointly by the Congregational and Methodist Episcopal Churches; but, this union school having outgrown the seating capacity of either church edifice, the Methodist Episcopal Sabbath-school Avas organized with H. S. Warren as its first superintendent, aud $100 Avas raised for a new Sunday-school library. RELIGIOUS. FIRST METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF AVAYLAND.t This church is by several years the oldest religious or ganization in the township. For about ten years previous to 1856 a class had been formed, and religious services held in the \" old red school-house\" by preachers from the Gun Plain and Otsego Circuits.

During 1S73 there was purchased for parsonage purposes a house on Maple Street, fronting the public square. The present members of this church are 60 in number. A flourishing Sabbath-school, of which C. E. Davison is superintendent, numbers 80. The pastoral labors of Rev. Amos Wakefield, in the fall of 1856, resulted in a large addition of members, and in response to a petition from this class the session of the Michigan Annual Conference held at Coldwater, Mich., in October, 1856, established the Wayland Circuit, also ap pointing Bev. Porter Williams to its pastorate. CHURCH OF CHRIST. This society was organized April 2, 1877, the original members being H. T. Stringham, I. B. Smith, P. Smith, M. Blowers, E. Blowers, H. D. Spaulding, E. Spaulding, E. S. Linsley, T. Ide, J. Gleason, R E. Woodard, L. Mc- Kean, L. Judson, S. Nelson, and D. Allen. Their first pastor was Rev. D. N. Severance.

In 1837, at the age of nineteen years, in pursuance of a cherished desire to become a citizen of the great West, he proceeded by the usual routes and conveyances then in vogue to Kane Co., 111., Blackberry township, where he pre-empted an eighty-acre lot. There were very few people then in a county which is now one of the most prosperous and populous in the State of Illinois. Its inhabitants were all known by him. He remained in Kane County, following various occupations, until 1846, when he came to Wayland and purchased of the general government forty acres, sit uated on section 22, and from the latter date he has been prominently identified with the history of this township. To his original purchase additions have been made until he now owns four hundred and ninety acres in one body. OTHER AVAYLAND CHURCHES. A Congregational society was organized in January, 1860, and a church edifice erected the same year. The original members were 17 in number, \u2014 Rev. A. McKay their first pastor. Official members of this church were requested to furnish data concerning the history of their organization, but failed to do so, owing doubtless to the animosity shown his enterprise by their present preacher. At the village of Bradley is a Methodist Episcopal soci ety of some 75 members. Their meetings are held in a hall. They propose, however, to erect a commodious church edifice at a time not far distant. In 1844 he married Miss Mary BroAvn. Two children were born to them, viz.: Florence, Aug. 16, 1845, and Loren, Sept. 9, 1847, died March 30, 1871. His wife died Feb. 3, 1865. He subsequently married Sylvia, the sister of his first wife. This marriage has resulted in the birth of three children, viz. : Olive, Oct. 27, 1867 ; Humphrey, Feb. 8, 1872; and Clay, Aug. 27, 1876. VILLAGE OP BRADLEY. Bradley is a station on the line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, three miles directly south of Wayland. It contains a store of general merchandise, drug-store, hotel, several small mechanical shops, and about 100 inhabitants. Its name is derived from David Bradley, who was the first postmaster of an office of the same name, situated on sec tion 28, on the old mail-route iu use prior to the building of the plank-road. Mr. Gardner's first vote was cast for Gen. Harrison in 1840, and he continued a member of the Whig party until its disbandment. Upon the organization of the Bepublican party he joined its fortunes, and remains a steadfast mem ber of the same to the present time. Socially he is held in high and deserved esteem. A quiet, unostentatious demeanor, coupled with great integrity, has gradually but surely placed him in the proud position he now occupies in the hearts of his friends. Joel Brownson, Esq., was the first settler in the vicinity of the* present village of Bradley. On the completion of the plank-road, in 1854, several other families settled here, and proposed the establishment of a village. The post office was removed from its origiual location to this point, a hotel built, and other interests projected. Shortly after, Uriah Gregory, who had a steam saw-mill, store, etc., on section 10, through political influence got the post-office transferred to his place of business, and himself appointed postmaster. Another turn of the political Avheel, however, established a new office at Bradley, and Joel Brownson became postmaster. Among the earliest merchants were Jarvis J. Joy and Josiah E. Harding. As showing the estimation in which he is held by his townsmen at large, we need but add that he has held the office of township treasurer twenty-one consecutive years. AMAZIAH R. BALCH. The Balch family are of Welsh origin, and were early settlers in New England. Vermont finally became the home of one branch, and there, in the town of Athens, Windham Co., was born Ama ziah R. Balch, Dec. 18, 1821. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. His father was a farmer, and the early years of young Batch's life were passed in the Green Mountain State, assisting his father in farm duties through the summer, obtaining the rudiments of a common-school education during the winter. As years passed, and he arrived at manhood's estate, he varied his occupation during the winter months by teaching. HUMPHBEY GARDNER. This gentleman was born in Attica, Genesee (now Wy oming) Co., N. Y., Dec, 27, 1818, His ancestors came from England and settled at Brimfield, Mass., very early in colonial days. His father, Daniel Gardner, removed from Brimfield to Attica soon after the close of the war of 1812, and became one of the pioneers of the latter region, Here he married Miss Lorena Ensign for his second wife, aud Humphrey was the second child born of this marriage. In 1851 he came to Kalamazoo, Mich., and soon became known as one of the successful teachers of that county. He was also employed by Mr. Arnold, of Kalamazoo, and proved an invaluable aid by the successful manner iu which he managed all business details intrusted to his care. About the year 1857, with Guild as a partner, he became identified with the history of Wayland by the purchase of a large tract of pine-lands situated near the southeast corner The early days of young Gardner's life, passed upon his father's farm, were uneventful, and marked by no epoch varying them from those of his associates in old Genesee.

A steam saw-mill was built, and for a few years the firm of Balch & Guild lumbered quite ex tensively. In 1861 he bought Guild's interest, and there after conducted the business independently, adding many acres to his landed estate, owning at one time more than fifteen hundred acres. GEORGE H. JACKSON. George H. Jackson was born in Thimbleby, Lincoln shire, England, Nov. 26, 1839. His father, Charles Jackson, was born in Anwick, of the same shire, April 22, 1800. In 1835 he (Charles) married Miss Ann Maltby, of Sansthorpe, and settled upon his farm in Thimbleby, where he remained until June, 1845, when he emigrated to America. After a five years' residence in the State of New York, he removed with his family in October, 1850, to the farm in Wayland now occupied by him. Of his family of ten children, viz., six sons and four daughters, five were born in Thimbleby, England, three in Monroe Co., N. Y., and two in Wayland, Mich. Mr. Balch was first married at Athens, Vt., May 3, 1846, to Miss Abby Davis. She died June 1, 1851. His only child by this marriage was Dorr M., who was born Jan. 11, 1848, and now resides in this township. On the 24th of November, 1861, he was again married, at Kalamazoo, Mich., to Miss Mary Williams, whose people came from Lower Canada, and settled in Kalamazoo town ship, Mich., in 1855. Five children were born to them, viz.: Edgar D., Feb. 9, 1863, died June 4, 1863; Cora Bell, April 15, 1864; Nathaniel A., Feb. 18, 1866 ; James B., Sept. 10, 1868; Mary E., Jan. 9, 1872. The four last named all reside with their mother on the home-farm. Since their settlement in Wayland, the Jacksons have done more than the average of pioneer-work. Dense forests have disappeared beneath their sturdy strokes, well-culti vated fields and beautiful farm-buildings have taken their place, and to-day, by dint of their own individual exertions, the father and sons are the possessors of fourteen hundred acres of land, distributed among them as follows : Charles, the father, forty acres ; George H., four hundred and eighty acres; Robert C., one hundred and sixty acres; Joseph, one hundred and sixty acres ; Andrew, three hundred and twenty acres; John E., one hundred and sixty acres; and James, eighty acres. Mr. Balch died May 29, 1879. He was a prominent and respected citizen of Wayland, a staunch Democrat, and an ardent admirer of Stephen A. Douglas and the princi ples enunciated by him. Although not a member of any religious denomination, he freely contributed to their support. In educational mat ters he was especially earnest and active, and served as township school inspector several times. He was the can didate of the Democratic party of this district for the State Senate in 1868, and ran largely ahead of his ticket, but very naturally failed of an election in a Republican strong hold. George H. Jackson, to assist his father, began working for others at the early age of eleven years, aud continued as a farm-laborer until reaching his majority. He then pur chased one hundred and sixty acres of wild land in 1860, soon clearing and paying for the same. As years haA'e passed he has added to his original tract, and is now the proud OAvner of four hundred and eighty acres. On the 7th of September, 1875, he married Miss Mary Davis, of Thornapple, whose father, Samuel Davis, settled in the latter township in 1845. In his political convictions Mr. Jackson is a staunch Republican, and proposes to con tinue as such to the end. Socially and as a public-spirited citizen, he is highly respected by all who know him. HORACE J. TURNER. Dr. Horace J. Turner, a view of whose beautiful residence in the village of Wayland adorns one of these pages, is the son of a physician, Dr. Horace C. Turner, and was born in the township of Greenwood, McHenry Co.. 111., Jan. 11, 1849. A few years subsequent to his birth his father removed to Barry Co., Mich., where, during early boyhood, young Turner pursued the usual course of studies prevailing in the public schools. At the age of seventeen years he was admitted as a student to the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, and after successfully passing through the va rious phases of college life and its studies, especially that of medicine and surgery, he graduated with honor during the session of 1868-69. ABEL ANGEL. Prominent of all men living in the toAvnship of Wayland to-day is the subject of this brief sketch, Abel Angel. His ancestors were English people, and early settlers in tbe State of Bhode Island, where his grandfather, Abiatha Angel, was born. Abel's father, Joseph Angel, was a native of the State of Vermont. Abel Angel, the ninth child in a family of eleven chil dren, was born in the town of Pownal, Bennington Co., Vt., Sept. 12, 1821. When fourteen years of age he re moved with his father's family to Erie Co., N. Y., where he remained three years, following the pursuits of farming. Meanwhile, he had obtained such educational advantages as the public schools of Vermont and New York afforded. He then practiced medicine with his father for a period of six months. After a short experience in the city of St. Louis, Mo., he again returned to Michigan and began the practice of his profession in the village of Bradley. A year later he removed to the village of Wayland, where well-mer ited pecuniary success has attended his professional labors. On the 2d of October, 1874, he was married to Miss Eva Crittenden, the accomplished daughter of one of Mar tin's pioneers, T. G. Crittenden, Esq. In his political con victions Dr. Turner is a Republican of the stalwart type. Socially and professionally, he is held in high esteem by all who know him. In 1838 he with other members of his family settled in Livingston Co., Mich. He remained in the latter county until 1842, when he came to the township of Wayland, and has since been prominently identified with its eA*ery public interest. His first purchase of land was made in the yeur 1845, \u2014 forty acres. By subsequent purchases his lauded"], [540, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 364 estate now aggregates nearly three hundred acres, the major portion overlooking that beautiful sheet of water known as Gun Lake. born Sept. 22, 1851, died Sept. 25, 1852 ; and Florence I., now the wife of Noble Gardner, Oswego Co., N. Y., who was born April 12, 1852. His wife, Helen, died Sept. 22, 1853. Mr. Angel held his first official position in 1845, when he was elected highway commissioner over territory which then included the present township of Leighton. But in 1849 began a series of office-holdings which have scarcely a parallel in the annals of any township in our common country, and the position he held was such as to render him more familiar with the history and people of Wayland than any other citizen in it. In the year last mentioned he was elected supervisor, and was re-elected again and again for a period of twenty-five years, almost consecutively ; this, too, very frequently when by a strict party vote his op ponents were in a large majority. In September, 1851, Mr. Harding became the first set tler on section 6 in the township of Martin, this county. His purchase embraced the southeast quarter, all unim proved. After clearing some sixty acres of this tract, he sold the same, and in 1856 purchased forty acres on section 19 in the township of Wayland, his present residence. He has since added by purchase, until one hundred and sixty beautiful acres in the home-farm greets the view of travelers on the line of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, which here intersects the farm from north to south through the centre. On the 17th of December, 1854, Mr. Harding was again married, to Miss Hannah M. Gardner, his present wife. Seven children have been born of this marriage, viz. : Irwin, Dec. 31, 1855; Emma J., May 6, 1857, died Sept. 25, 1863; Ida Dell, Dec. 18, 1859; Mina May, Sept. 16, 1861, died Oct. 22, 1863; Trudie Bell, Jan. 2, 1864 ; Vine, May 17, 1866 ; and Myrtle G., Nov. 3, 1875. He was married July 22, 1852, to Mrs. Mary Gardner. Five children have been born to them, viz. : Eleanor, June 29, 1853 ; William, April 26, 1855, died Dec. 9, 1876 ; Mary, Jan. 9, 1857; Clara, May 11, 1860; Lucy, June 28, 1862. Mrs. Angel, formerly Miss Mary Pease, was born in Easton, Washington Co., N. Y., in the year 1820, and was first married to Nelson Gardner, in 1840. Of her children by her first marriage, viz., Lewis, Sarah, Edwin, and Nelson, Sarah, now Mrs. Hefiry Buxton, of Plainwell, Mich., is the only survivor. In his political convictions Mr. Harding is known as a Democrat. Not an office-seeker, yet he has served his townsmen as justice of the peace for several terms, and iu various other capacities, and in 1878 was the candidate of the Democratic party of this district for the State Senate. Mr. Angel has been a life-long Democrat and an agricul turist. As evidence that he has succeeded beyond the ex pectations of most men, it is only necessary to refer to the beautiful farm-view which embellishes one of these pages, and to what has already been said. Of large stature, genial and urbane in his manners, a successful farmer and merchant,* a good citizen, a kind, in dulgent husband and father, Mr. Harding may well be con sidered a true representative of his class, \u2014 i.e., a genuine, unaffected American gentleman. JOSIAH E. HABDING. Josiah E. Harding was born in the town of Sandy Creek, Oswego Co., N. Y., Oct, 10, 1825, being the fifth child of Solomon S. and Phila Harding. SAMUEL S. GUNN. The Hardings are of English origin, three brothers having come to America at an early period in our colonial history, of whom, finally, one settled in Connecticut, an other in Kentucky, and the third became a sea captain. This sketch pertains more particularly to the Connecticut branch, of whom Benjamin\u2014 the great-grandfather of Jo siah E. \u2014 is the most distant landmark. He lived and died in Connecticut. His son, George, espoused the cause of the colonists during the war of the Revolution, and in 1794 became one of the first settlers of Oswego Co., N. Y. Solomon S., the son of George, was, during the war of 1812, with the United States forces at Sacket's Harbor. He became a successful farmer, and at the time of his death was the owner of more than six hundred acres. The ancestors of this gentleman came from England prior to the war of the Revolution, and settled at or in the near vicinity of Waterbury, Conn. Jobalmah Gunn, the grandfather of Samuel S., was in sympathy with the mother-country during the long strug gle for American independence. His sons Avere Isaiah, John, Jobalmah, Jr., and Isaac. Jobalmah, Jr., who died April 13, 1815, was the father of four children, viz. : Hannah, Jane, Samuel S., and Jo balmah. Samuel Shelton Gunn was born in Waterbury, Conn., July 21, 1810. His father was a farmer, and here young Samuel passed his early boyhood days. At the age of sixteen years, however, he was bound as a carpenter's ap prentice to one William Hurlburt, of Woodbury, Conn. He remained with Hurlburt sour years, when, having bought his time, he began work under instructions, at low wages, with Jason Bassett, of Humphreysville, Conn. He was with Bassett one year, and shortly after began a re- The school advantages enjoyed by Josiah E.

Arriving at years of manhood, he received as his share of the paternal estate an eighty-acre lot, upon which he de voted all his energies until removing to the State of Michi gan. In September, 1847, he married Miss Helen M. Wood. The three children born of this marriage were Cora E., Jan. 7, 1849, who died May 6, 1856 ; Ernest B., * Mr. Harding bought out J. J.

Cordelia E. Swett, nee Truax, Feb. 3, 1865. By this mar riage there have been born to them three children, viz. : Shelton J., Oct. 21, 1867; Milton S., Feb. 19, 1868; Clinton P., Sept. 27, 1873. In 1832 he proceeded to the city of Syracuse, N. Y., where he worked at his trade for two years. Early in 1834 he returned to Connecticut, and for some time was engaged assisting his mother in some matters of business. In the fall of the same year he journeyed to Mobile, Ala., and, working at his trade, remained there until the spring of 1836. From thence by boat to New Orleans, La., Louis ville, Ky.,and up the Wabash to Logansport, Ind. Thence to Michigan City, Ind., and Niles, Mich., on foot, ar riving at the latter place in May, 1836, where he in vested his all \u2014 some four hundred dollars \u2014 in village lots. In July, 1836, he went to St. Joseph, Mich., and with William Doane worked at his trade until the fall of 1837. He also entered one hundred and sixty acres of land in that vicinity. He then visited Connecticut, and returned from thence to Niles, Mich., in March, 1838, where he erected a small house on one of his village lots. Wildcat banking and an era of wild speculation had com pletely prostrated business in Michigan, and, utterly dis couraged, in July, 1838, he fled her confines, bringing up in the city of St. Louis, Mo. From thence he proceeded, in November, 1838, to Little Rock, Ark. He remained in the latter city, working at his trade in company with Wil liam Lankford, until July, 1839. A violent illness then ensued. He was enabled to travel to St. Louis in October following, and from that time to April, 1840, he was con fined to his room by sickness. He then pursued his occu pation in St. Louis until 1844, when he abandoned car pentry forever. He then engaged in buying and selling produce at points on the Mississippi River; his principal places of transfer, however, were at St. Louis and New Orleans. In political matters Mr. Gunn is a Democrat of the old school, conservative, and a staunch supporter of good prin ciples, no matter by which party advocated. Socially, both Mr. and Mrs. Gunn are highly respected by all who have the honor of their acquaintance. ROLLIN M. CONGDON This gentleman, the eldest member of a family of ten children, was born in the town of Middlesex, Yates Co., N. Y., Sept. 2, 1831. The family is of English origin, and was largely repre sented among the earliest settlers of the Green Mountain State. Here was born George Congdon, the grandfather of Rollin. Erastus Congdon, son of George, was born in Clarendon, Rutland Co., Vt., Feb. 20, 1799. In 1821 or 1822 he removed to Yates Co., N. Y., and there married, in 1830. In the spring of 1834, accompanied by his wife and infant son (Rollin M.), he journeyed to Kalamazoo Co., Mich., where he remained until 1839. He then settled in that part of the township of Otsego now known as Hop kins, becoming the fourth settler in the latter township, and where he remained until his death, which occurred May 3, 1871. The early years of Rollin M. Congdon's life were passed in assisting his father in farm duties. Schools were distant, and none were established in the vicinity of his father's residence until he was thirteen years of age. At the age of eighteen years he began work for himself, and for a period of ten years was employed by many farmers, for whom he worked by the month and by the day. On the 15th of November, 1859, he married Miss Lucy I. Eldred,* of Wayland, whose father, Cooper Eldred, was born in Butternuts, Otsego Co., N. Y., in 1796, and removed from Steuben County, of the same State, to Wayland, Mich., in 1846. After his marriage Mr. Congdon became a resident of Wayland. His only child, Almon B., was born Aug. 21, 1860. In 1850 he proceeded to New York and took passage for San Francisco, Cal., on board the sailing-vessel \" Hoqua,\" bound, via Cape Horn, to Canton, China. He paid three hundred dollars in gold for his passage, and arrived in San Francisco July 20, 1850. For one and one-half years he worked at placer-mining. He then changed his business to that of buying and slaughtering beeves for the mining trade. It proved to be very lucrative. He sold whole quarters for thirty-five cents per pound, and frequently real ized one hundred dollars profit per head. At a time when business was most prosperous, the Rough and Ready Quartz-Mining Company became indebted to him in a large amount, and in the endea\\*or to save himself he be came first part owner and finally sole owner and manager of this interest, then one of the largest in California. He ultimately sold out and paid all creditors, but with a loss to himself of several thousand dollars. In March, 1856, he re turned to the States via the Isthmus, and, after visiting his old Connecticut home, he again came to Michigan. IJis present place of residence \u2014 the Nelson M. Pollard place \u2014 Avas purchased the same year. Then for several years he was in Berrien County, and in charge of the mission lauds in that township. In August, 1864, Mr. Congdon enlisted in the First Regiment of Michigan Engineers and Mechanics, and, joining his regiment in Georgia the following month, par ticipated in all its subsequent campaigns through Georgia and the Carolinas. Returning to his home in Wayland, June 19, 1865, he has since made this township his place of residence and devoted his energies to the pursuits of agriculture. Mr. Congdon now owns the northwest quarter of sec tion 19, \u2014 the premises formerly owned by Cooper Eldred, \u2014 which is a beautiful and fertile tract of one hundred and sixty acres, lying near the village of Bradley. On the 1st of September, 1861, he married Mrs. Eliza Chambers. She was killed, July 26, 1862, by horses run niug away.

WILLIAM SEAVER. to fourteen years of age he attended school three months in each year, and finished his studies by subsequently at tending two winter terms of four months each. Yet, en dowed with much natural ability, great physical strength, and unusual powers of endurance, all aided by good judg ment, tact, and conservatism, he has been enabled, although suffering heavy financial reverses at Oldtown, Me., and at Bradley, Mich., to accumulate a handsome competency. In early years he was a Whig. Since the disruption of that party he has voted for those whom he deemed the best men. He has been an Odd-Fellow since 1840, joining that society in Havre de Grace, Md. He has served as presi dent of the village of Wayland several years (see history village of Wayland), and to-day is one of its most promi nent citizens. William Seaver was born in Westbrook, now Saccarappa, Maine, May 4, 1809. His progenitors were Scotch people, and first settled at Cambridge, Mass., early in the eighteenth century. At the age of eight years he went to live with his ma ternal grandfather, George Crockett, and when fourteen years of age began to take care of himself by proceeding to Bangor and engaging in lumbering on the Penobscot River. On the 6th of September, 1835, he married Miss Mary J. Clark, of Bangor. About 1839 he, with other robust men of Maine, was engaged to go to Havre de Grace, Md., to assist in the construction of wharves, canals, block-houses, etc. Remaining in Maryland five years, he returned to Bangor, and resumed lumbering operations on the Penobscot, where he remained for several years. From thence he repaired to Lowell, Mass., and engaged in lum bering at that point for a period of fourteen years. Sub sequently he was employed in the same business on the St. Croix River, Maine, again at Lowell, Mass., and on the Merrimac River, in New Hampshire. Mrs. Seaver was born in Bangor, Me., Aug. 5, 1815. Through several generations her family has been remarka ble for the longevity of its members. John T. Clark, her father, was born in the town of Jay, on the Kennebec River, Maine. He was a soldier in the war of 1812, the father of twelve children (ten of whom are still living, the youngest being fifty years of age), and died at the age of ninety years. Her mother, the daughter of Dr. Tourte lott, a Revolutionary hero, lived to be ninety-four years of age, and died within a few rods of the place where she was married. In the spring of 1858, with his family, he removed to Wayland township, Mich., and for a few months was en caged in lumbering* with A. R. Balch. He then settled at DO O Whitney's Comers, now Bradley, where he was extensively engaged in lumbering, merchandising, etc. Subsequently, in 1860, he became proprietor of the \" Half-way House,\" in Bradley. Selling the same, he again engaged in mercan tile pursuits at the latter place, became the village post master, and remained there until the spring of 1864, when he bought and removed to his present hotel property in the village of Wayland.

Dibble, Kingsbury, and Kendall were residents of Mar shall, and on the 25th of August following the purchase they, together with Andrew L. Hays and Samuel Camp, organized the Hastings Company for the purpose of laying out upon the land bought of Hastings a village which was to be called in his honor. To that end they sent out men and material for the erection of a saw-mill, which was put up on the creek just south of the present Hastings flour mill. Slocum H. Bunker was engaged to come with his family for the purpose of boarding the men during the construction of the mill. The government of Hastings is vested in a mayor and board of councilmen, eight in number, two being chosen from each ward. The business quarter contains several fine brick blocks, and upon the various thoroughfares one may see many commodious and handsome residences. The Union school building is the architectural feature of the city, and is justly an object of local pride. The prosperity of Hastings is based upon the substantial foundations of agriculture and manufactures ; and although it has for a time been nearly stationary, yet it is likely, with the re newed prosperity of the country, to go steadily forward in accordance with the progress of the farming region around. In quick time Mr. Bunker rolled up a log cabin on the lot now occupied by the Newton House, and besides a boarding-house for the mill-hands he kept also a house of entertainment for anybody chancing to pass that way. Although he did not then expect to remain at Hastings after the mill should be completed, yet he did in fact stay there several years, and may, therefore, be rightly consid ered the first settler in the city of Hastings. EARLY HISTORY. On the 26th day of July, 1836, Eurotas P. Hastings, president of the Bank of Michigan, and auditor-general of the State, sold to Philo Dibble, Lansing Kingsbury, and Cornelius Kendall, for $3000, a tract of land.jn town 3 north, range 8 west, known as the \" Barry County-seat purchase.\" and covering the northeast quarter and east half of the southeast quarter of section 18, and the northwest quarter and west half of the southwest quarter of section Simultaneously with the movement to erect a saw-mill, the Hastings Company determined also to lay out a village, and they accordingly platted the tract now including the business portion of the city and called it Hastings. Ad ditions to the original plat of Hastings were subsequently laid out by Messrs. Striker, Kenfield, Chamberlain, Grant, Dunning, and Bennett. With Slocum H. Bunker came also his brother, Thomas, who gave valuable assistance in carrying on the primitive hotel, and who Avas chosen in 1839 the first clerk of Barry Couuty. In June, 1837, Willard Hays, who had come from Massachusetts to Detroit the previous year, made his way to Hastings on a tour of observation, and was per- * By David Schwartz. f Although from the identity of name the city and the township of Hastings aro frequently classed together, yet in fact, from the time of the organization of the city, it became legally distinct from the town ship, and their organizations are entirely separate.

He moved his place of busi ness shortly afterwards to a building on what is now known as the bank-corner, and since November, 1840, has been steadily engaged in trade in Hastings. suaded by his brother, Dr. Hays, of Marshall (one of the Hastings Company), to remain in Hastings and look after the doctor's interests thereabout, and soon concluded to make a permanent settlement at that point. About then Abner C. Parmelee came to the new settlement from Mar shall, when he and Hays put up a log cabin near Bunker's boarding-house, in which for a while they kept bachelor's hall together. The village then included Parmelee, Hays, Bunker's family, and a few men engaged on the mill. Mrs. Bunker was the only woman in the place, and for eight months after her coming she saw no representative of her sex save Indian squaws. In the spring of 1841, Alvin W. Bailey came from Marshall and opened a store on the corner east of Good year's. He was, accordingly, Hastings' second trader, although he did not at that period remain in trade very long. He is now, however, and has been for many years, one of the merchants of the city. The trade carried on by Messrs. Goodyear and Bailey was naturally not very exten sive, for at that time there were but few white settlers from whom to draw patronage. They had, however, a good many Indian customers ; indeed, the greater part of their trade was with these sons of the forest. A decided advance in the progress of the new village was made in 1839, when Hays and Dibble built a grist mill. Slocum H. Bunker was engaged as the miller and managed the business a few years, when he returned to Battle Creek, where he subsequently resided until his death. In August, 1840, Henry A. Goodyear came hitber from Detroit on a prospecting-tour, finding the following inhabitants in the village: Slocum H. Bunker, with his family and brother Thomas, as living in a log cabin near the grist-mill ; Abner C. Parmelee, register of deeds and acting county treasurer, was in a log house northwest of where the Newton House stands; Levi Chase was keeping tavern on the bank of the river, near the bridge and north of Parmelee's ; Alexander McArthur was carrying on the saw-mill, and keeping a place of entertainment in the log house previously kept by Bunker ; Willard Hays, the sheriff, was in a framed house (the first one in Hastings), erected by Dr. David M. Dake, on the corner now occupied by the Union Block, where he also kept the post-office ; Philander Turner, a carpenter, was living in a shanty near the grist-mill ; and Hiram J. Kenfield, carpenter and In dian trader, lived in a board shanty on a lot about opposite the site of Mr. Goodyear's hardware-store. The third merchant was Dr. William Upjohn, who in the spring of 1842 started a store near Levi Chase's tavern, and engaged Marsh Giddings, a young lawyer from Gull Prairie, in Kalamazoo County, to look after the business. The enterprise was discontinued iu the fall. It was after wards successively continued by a Mr. Teed and a Maj. Tombs, neither of whom, however, stopped in the place more than a few months. Among the next traders were Vespasian Young, who had a store about 1844, near where the bank building stands; W. S. Goodyear, who joined his brother Henry in 1843; Ezra Convers, who came in 1844, and a Mr. Hatch the same year; W. C. Hoyt & Brother, in 1847, in a building adjoining Barlow's hotel, now known as the Hastings House ; R. J. Grant, Ferris & Edgeomb, Barlow & Robinson, A. W. & Norman Bailey, etc., etc. R. J. Grant, the present mayor of Hastings, came West with his father in 1836, and located in Eaton County. In 1849 he settled in Hastings as a merchant, and since that time has uninterruptedly pursued a mercantile career in the town. At the time of his coming he found in trade here William C. and H. T. Hoyt and H. A. & W. S. Goodyear. In 1851 the Hoyts sold out to Nathan Barlow. Norman Bailey, who entered trade in Hastings with his brother in 1853, is now living in the city in retirement. Mr. Kenfield was an active man, who was then buildintr the first bridge over the river at Hastings. He traded with the Indians, and kept his stock of goods in a trunk. He was one of the early sheriffs of the county,* and through out his life was a man of much local prominence. Mr. Kenfield came to Michigan in 1837, and to Hastings in November, 1839. It was directly upon his coming that he took the contract for building the bridge over the river north of the present Newton House. He aftenvards took the contract for building the court-house,f and was active in various ventures, but more especially in buying and sell ing land. He died in Hastings, June 29, 1877. His father, W- L. Kenfield, settled in Irving township in 1844. One of his sisters, who married I. A. Holbrook, one of Hast ings' earliest lawyers, yet resides in the city. Among the early comers in Hastings, not elsewhere mentioned, may be noted 0. N. Boltwood, the miller, who came in 1850, J. P. Roberts, who, in 1851, opened the first drug-store in Hastings, L. W. Hitchcock in 1840, D. G. Robinson in 1851 (when he embarked in trade with Nathan Barlow), George Preston in 1851, William T. McNair in 1852, W. A. Sartwell in 1853, D. R. Cook in 1854, Thos. Altoft and Samuel Powers in 1855, and G. G. and O. D. Spalding, who have been in trade in Hastings about twenty years. PIONEER MERCHANTS. When H. A. Goodyear came to Hastings, in August, 1840, a store-building was then being erected by Hiram J. W. S. Goodyear, now one of Hastings' leading merchants, came to the village in 1843, when the only store in the place was kept by his brother, H. A. Goodyear. That place of trade, now the building west of the bank, stood then where the bank building now stands. W. S.

Although there was but one store in the village in 1843, Hastings was then beginning to thrive, and gave promise of developing into a prosperous town, \u2014 a promise which was fulfilled within a brief space of time. Hastings, as Mrs. William H. Hitchcock. The first couple married in Hastings came from Yankee Springs for the purpose, aud were united by A. C. Parmelee. The first resident of the place to be married was Willard Hays, who wedded Ann, daughter of Daniel McClellan, who, with his brother James, had located iu the southern part of the present township of Hastings in 1S37. The ceremony was performed at the house of the bride's father, on section 34, Nov. 24, 1839, by \" Squire\" A. C. Parmelee. It was in the spring of 1843 that Nathan Barlow, Jr., also came to Hastings to occupy the office of county clerk, to which he had been chosen. His father, Nathan Barlow, Sr., had located in 1837 upon section 7, in Yankee Springs, and resided there until his death, in 1855. Nathan Bar low, Jr., who had been in St. Louis, joined his father in Yankee Springs in the fall of 1840, and in 1843 moved to Hastings. Upon the expiration of his service as county clerk he was chosen county treasurer, and in 1851, after serving one term in the Legislature, he engaged in mercan tile business in Hastings, and continued to be a merchant until 1879, when he retired from active business. South of the present Union school the village proprietors laid out a cemetery, in which, in the summer of 1840, there were the graves of a Mr. De Groat, Lorenzo Cooley, and Mrs. Maria Rush, wife of Harmon Rush, a mill-hand in the village. De Groat, who was the first person buried there, had been living in Rutland, as had also Mr. Cooley, the second one buried in the place. Mrs. Rush's death was the first in the village. This cemetery, now a ceme tery no more, was the village burying-ground for many years. The bodies interred there were transferred to the present cemetery upon the laying out of the latter, and since then the old ground has remained undisturbed. Vespasian Young, whose widow resides in the village, came with his wife to the village in October, 1841, erected a store-building west of where the bank now is, became a merchant, and remained one until his death, in 1848. During Mr. Young's time, W. W. Ralph and one Rowley kept a stock of goods next door to his place, but did not remain a very long while. Harmon Rush, above alluded to, was a mill-hand, black smith, and gunsmith, and came to the place in 1838. There were, from time to time, numerous persons engaged upon the building of the grist-mill and saw-mill, but they tarried only long enough to complete their specific labors, and could scarcely be considered as residents. SURVIVING PIONEERS. Among the early settlers of Hastings now living there, those who have been there longest are Mrs. Willard Hays, Mrs. Philander Turner, Henry A. Goodyear, A. W. Bailey, Dr. AVilliam Upjohn, Mrs. Vespasian Young, \u2014 all having become residents before the close of the year 1841. Mention should have been made of J. W. Buckle, the pioneer tailor of Hastings. Mr. Buckle came to the place in the spring of 1842, opened a tailor-shop shortly after, and pursued his trade until his death, which occurred in March, 1880. There was no school iu the village previous to 1840, for the reason that the only children there of a school-going age were two belonging to Slocum H. Bunker. In the winter of 1840-41 the population was reinforced by the families of Tillotson Munger and George Beardsley, and that same winter Ellen McArthur taught the first school in the village in a room in her father's tavern, her scholars being four in number. In the spring of 1841 a public school-house was completed, the first teacher in which was Luthera S. Spaulding, of Prairieville. She still lives in that township, being now known as Mrs. Henry Knappen. That school-house was also used for holding court until the court-house was finished. THE SPOTTED FEVER. The spotted fever, which raged in Detroit in 1847 and carried off many of the men enlisted for service in the Mexican war (among them being Levi Chase, Charles Chase, George Tabor, and others of Hastings), appeared in Hastings in 1848, and inflicted serious ravages in the little village. Of this fever there died, between January and April, Mrs. John Gaines, George Fuller, Mrs. Tinkler, George Marshall, and Vespasian Young, the latter being the last to fall a victim. In the earliest years of its existence Hastings was a vil lage in the woods, and was divided, at about the point now occupied by H. A. Goodyear's hardware-store, by a deep ravine running from south to north. As the population multiplied the topographical features of the town improved, and this village ditch Avas filled up, but there was a time when merchaut Goodyear, standing at his store door, couldn't see Sheriff Hays' house, only a few hundred feet away, on account of the trees. At that time the street, now the busiest thoroughfare in the city of Hastings, was doubtless the playground of squirrels, while its leafy recesses re sounded with the music of the birds of the forest. Mr. Munger, already mentioned, was Hastings' pioneer blacksmith, and set up his shop on the river-bank, near Chase's tavern. Mr. Beardsley, who came the same year, was a carpenter. With them, in the winter of 1840\u201441, came also Elisha Alden, a shoemaker, and his two sons, Perry and Elijah, both carpenters. One J. Carlton, a shoemaker, took up his residence in Hastings in 1842, and opened a shop on State Street, near H. A. Goodyear's store. Dr. David Dake, Hastings' first physician, had come and gone, and in 1841 was succeeded by Dr. William Upjohn, who is still in practice. The first birth in Hastings is believed to have been that of a child of Slocum H. Bunker. Its death occurred soon afterwards, in Marshall. The second white child born in the village was Angela, a daughter of Willard Hays. Her birth occurred Aug. 28, 1840, and she still resides in VILLAGE TAVERNS. Although Slocum H. Bunker built the first house devoted to \" entertainment,\" it was properly a boarding-house for mill-hands, \u2014 yet he accommodated travelers who could IT"], [550, "370 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. find no other lodging-place. Levi Chase was the proprietor of the first Hastings tavern, a rude log building, which stood near the river's bank, north of the present Newton House. Chase gave up the tavern, in 1842, to Heman I. Knappen, who was its last landlord. The latter retired about 1847, and died in Hastings in 1854. Chase enlisted for service in the Mexican war, but died in Detroit, of spotted fever. until 1877, when he retired, he was one of the leading physicians of the town. Dr. A. P. Drake, now in practice in Hastings, has been a physician in the village since 1851 without interruption, except from 1855 to 1858, when he was in Nebraska, and in 1864 when he served as assistant surgeon of the \" new\" Third Michigan Infantry. Dr. F. C. Cornell came in 1850, and in 1855 removed to Idaho. The first hom\u0153opathic physician to locate' in Hastings was Dr. C. S. Burton, who came to Michigan in 1848, but, finding no supporters of hom\u0153opathy in the State, returned to the East. In 1850 he came West the second time and located at Battle Creek, whence he removed in 1851 to Hastings. Hom\u0153opathic physicians were not very plentiful at that time in these parts, and Dr. Burton rode at first over a wide stretch of country, reaching to Grand Rapids on the northwest, and Bellevue, Eaton Co., on the east. Mr. McArthur, who took Bunker's house and made a tavern of it, kept it about a year. Hiram J. Kenfield, the next landlord, added a framed front to the log structure, and after Kenfield, George Fuller, the third landlord, built the present Newton House, \u2014 considerably improved since his time, \u2014 and moved Kenfield's addition to the rear, where it still does duty as a portion of the hotel. In 1845, Na than Barlow built a framed house on the lot now occupied by the Hastings House, and kept it from 1846 as a stage slouse on the route between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids, which he was instrumental in establishing. In 1849, Mr. Barlow transferred the tavern to Henry Edgcomb, and after him J. B. Foote was the landlord, beginning about 1850. The hotel now known as the Newton House was taken in 1848 by Waterman Parker, previously a hotel-keeper in Jackson, Mich. He was a landlord in Hastings two years, and died in 1873. Dr. J. M. Russell, who retired from active practice in 1873, came in 1855, about which time came also Dr. Bonestell, who remained only about two years. About 1802 the new-comers were Drs. Frost, Johnson, and Burt. Dr. Burt remained until his death, in 1866. Drs. Frost and Johnson departed after a brief stay. Dr. Charles Russell, who entered upon practice in Hast ings in 1866, remained until 1879, when he removed to Allegan, his present home. In 1862, Dr. H. J. Haney entered the field, but left it in 1875. The stage-route through Hastings from Battle Creek to Grand Rapids was opened July 1, 1846, and proved a line of busy travel. H. A. Goodyear, H. I. Knappen, and other residents of Hastings were conspicuous in urging its establishment, Knappen being one of the earliest stage owners and drivers on the route. The second hom\u0153opathic physician to locate in Hastings was Dr. J. B. Brown, who came in 1869 and remained until his death, in 1871. His father, B. F. Brown, came in 1870 and left in 1879. I. W. Brown opened an office in 1875 and closed his practice in 1878. Dr. E. H. Lathrop joined Dr. C. S. Burton in practice in 1872, moved to Grand Bapids in 1874, returned in 1875, and is now here. Dr. William E. Upjohn, now in practice, began his medical career in Hastings in 1875. In 1876, I. De Vere became a partner with B. F. Brown, after whose departure, in 1879, Dr. De Vere continued the practice, and still retains it, in connection with Dr. Grant. Dr. Amasa Blaso, who came in 1875, Dr. Woodmansee, whose resi dence dates from 1872, Miss Dr. Delight Wolfe, who began her practice here in 1878, Dr. J. C. Lampman, who came in April, 1879, and Dr. W. H. Snyder, who located in February, 1880, are still among the city practitioners. Dr. Joseph Adolphus, who should have had earlier mention, was one of the pioneer physicians of the county, and prac ticed in Hastings more or less from 1862 until 1875, when he moved to St. Louis. Dr. J. H. Cox, of whom mention has not been made, practiced for a time previous to 1875, when he went West. THE PHYSICIANS OP HASTINGS. Dr. David M. Dake made a location in Hastings in 1838, and built the first framed house the town boasted. It occupied the corner upon which the Union Block now stands, and subsequently served as the residence of Willard Hays. Dr. Dake came for the purpose of practicing medicine, but for some reason he moved away after remain- ing about six months. Hastings was after that without a physician until July, 1841, when Dr. William Upjohn came hither from Kalamazoo County. He had removed from Monroe Co., N. Y., to Kalamazoo County in 1835, intending to give his energies to farming for a time, al- though, having studied medicine, he designed to become eventually a physician. Upon his arrival in Kalamazoo County he found much sickness prevalent, and was induced by the circumstances to begin his medical practice forthwith. When he fixed upon Hastings as his new home, he opened an office in Levi Chase's tavern, on the river's bank, where business flowed in upon him in ample volume. He was then the only physician in the county, and his numerous calls from far and near kept him riding through the country night and day. Since his advent, in 1841, Dr. Upjohn has been in continuous active practice in Hastings, except from early in 1862 until Dec. 11, 1865, when he was in the military service, first as surgeon of the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, and later as brigade surgeon. THE LAWYERS OP HASTINGS. In the spring of 1842, Dr. William Upjohn, then prac ticing medicine in Hastings, opened a store just north of where the Newton House stands, and engaged a young man named Marsh Giddings, from Gull Prairie, to look after the business, the latter also following his profession as a lawyer when occasion offered, in connection with the storekeeping. In the fall of 1842 the store was discon tinued. Mr. Giddings continued his law practice but a short time longer, when he returned to Gull Prairie. Late Dr. John Roberts, now living in Hastings, began practice in 1840. He came to the village in 1845, and from then"], [551, "DR. A. P. DRAKE. A. PHILO DRAKE, M .D. In the history of the medical profession of Barry County do one occupies a more deservedly popular position than the Bubject of this biography. A residence of over a quarter of a century, during which time he has been in the active practice of his profession, has fully demonstrated his general worth and assigned him a conspicuous place in the history of the city of Hastings. He was born in Macedon, Wayne Co., N. Y., July 31, 1828. At the age of ten the family emigrated to Michi- gan and settled near Saline, Washtenaw Co., where the elder Drake purchased a farm. The doctor obtained a common-school education, and in 1846 commenced the study of medicine with Dr. A. G. Crittenden, of Saline. In 1848 he entered the Cleveland Medical College, where he was graduated in 1850. Soon after his graduation he went to Wisconsin for the purpose of establishing himself in the practice of his profession, but fail- ing to find a desirable location he returned to Michigan, and in July, 1851, came to Hastings, where he has since resided, with the exception of a few years spent in Nebraska. In 1864 he received the appointment of assistant surgeon of the 3d Michi- gan Infantry ; he accompanied the regiment to the field, but by reason of ill health was compelled to resign his position. He returned to Hastings, and upon the recovery of his health re sumed the practice of his profession. In 1860 he married Marion C. Palmer, of Hastings, a lady of culture and refine ment. She died in 1878. cessful practitioner and a gentleman. He is president of the County Medical Society, and a member of the State Medical Society and the Western Michigan District Medical Society. The doctor has taken an active interest in the development of Hastings, and has identified himself with all measures tending to the advancement of the interests of education or society. He has been a prominent member of the board of education, and has been president of the village. He is a believer in the pre cepts and teachings of Freemasonry, and has held prominent positions in that order, notably among the number that of Master and High Priest. Dr. Drake is well and favorably known, and one who is highly respected and esteemed. He possesses the necessary qualifications of the successful physician other than knowledge, \u2014 geniality of disposition and firmness, coupled with kindness and compassion, \u2014 and his valuable services as a physi cian, and the public spirit he has evinced as a citizen, entitle him to a foremost position among the representative men of Barry County. The doctor is a radical Republican, having been bred a Whig, and the New York Tribune having been his political Testament. His residence in Kansas and Nebraska from 1855 to 1858 gave him an insight into the means resorted to by the pro-slavery party to fasten the peculiar institution upon Kansas. He claims to have been the only Whig in the territory of Kansas in the employ of the government during the period of the forming of its State Constitution.

Loyal E. Knap pen, now prosecutiug attorney, studied law with James A. Sweezy-, and was admitted in 1876. Charles M. Knappen and William H. Powers were admitted in 1877, and J. R.

Hiram Greenfield lived in Hastings from 1850-58, and during that period practiced law to some ex tent. Frederick Young, a son of Vespasian Young, one of the Hastings pioneers, was admitted to the bar in 1873, and practiced in the city from that time until his death, in 1875. After Mr. Giddings' departure, although lawyers came from other places from time to time to attend court, there was no resident attorney until the fall of 1843, when I. A. Holbrook came from Hillsdale and entered at once upon a legal practice in which he continued until his death, in 1875. Mr. Holbrook was a man of mark in the commu nity, and held among his numerous public trusts the offices of county clerk and prosecuting attorney. About the same time H. S. Jennings appeared upon the legal field, but tar ried only a few years, when he pushed on westward. In the spring of 1844 a Mr. Rowley came hither from Battle Creek, but retired after a two years' practice. Until 1850 there was no fresh accession to the force of resident lawyers, and Mr. Holbrook had the local business to himself. In that year Norton S. Palmer came fresh from his studies in the office of Johnson & Higbee, at Jackson, and began practice in Hastings, where he re mained until his death, in 1855. HASTINGS VILLAGE INCORPORATION. Hastings Avas incorporated as a village by legislative act approved Feb. 13, 1855, and included the Avest half of sec tion 17, the east half of section 18, the south half of the southwest quarter of section 8, and the southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section 7. May 7, 1855, the first election was held at the court-house, A. H. Ellis and Albert Kingsbury being chosen judges, and Norman Bailey clerk of the election. The whole number of votes cast for president was 134, of which Alvin W. Bailey received 88, Henry A. Goodyear, 45, and Luther Sage, 1. A full list of the village officials chosen on that occasion is as follows : President. Alvin W. Bailey ; Recorder, John M. Nevins; Treasurer, 0. N. Boltwood; Trustees, John Roberts, Wm. H. Hayford, Solomon Burch, Ashmun A. Knappen, John W. Buckle; Assessors, Ira S. Allen, Samuel T. McNair. James H. Sweezy, now in practice in Hastings and the oldest resident lawyer there, came to that village in June, 1851, from Manchester, Mich., where he had studied law in the office of Bradley Granger. Mr. Sweezy has served, during his residence in Hastings, as regent of the univer sity eight years, as member of the Legislature two terms, and as prosecuting attorney four terms. Charles White practiced in Hastings from 1858 to his death, in 1860, and in 1857, Charles G. Holbrook (brother of I. A. Holbrook), now in practice in the city, entered the lists. Mr. Holbrook was the prosecuting attorney from 1865 to 1869, and again from 1871 to 1873. Frank Allen, who came in 1861, died in 1868, and in the latter year Harvey Wright removed his office from Middleville to Hastings. He died upon the eve of his removal to Grand Rapids, in 1876. J. R. Van Velsor began his legal career in Hastings in 1869, and terminated it with his death, in 1874. Thomas Taylor, a school-teacher, studied with Mr. Van Velsor, practiced here a year, and then removed to Tus cola County, where he now lives. H. W. Rolf, who also studied in Van Velsor's office, still lives in Hastings. E. A. Holbrook, who came in 1874, practiced with Harvey Wright from 1874 to the death of the latter, in 1876, and then removed to Rochester, N. Y. At a special meeting of the Common Council, held May 22, 1855, Albert H. Ellis was appointed marshal, and Seth B. Ferster and Nathan Barlow street commissioners.

Bauer has been prac ticing here since 1869, and from 1875 to 1879, served at prosecuting attorney. Lucius Russell came in 1871, and A. D. CadAvallader in 1876, both being still in practice here. William H. Hayford, who has been a justice of the peace in Hastings nineteen years, made the village his home in 1850, but did not engage in legal practice until 1S04, his time previous to that having been occupied in trading and milling.

Hastings City is liberally supplied with schools, and con tains one of the finest school buildings in the State. It is a massive brick structure surmounted by a handsome bell tower, and, occupying a commanding eminence, is an at tractive object as well as the most conspicuous archi tectural feature of the city. The building was finished in 1872, and cost, with grounds and furniture, $45,000. It contains seven school-rooms, and has three depart ments, \u2014 high school, grammar, and primary, \u2014 in which and the two ward schools the aggregate average attend ance for the school year of 1878-79 was 369, out of an actual enrollment of 661.

INCORPORATION OF THE CITY. Under an act of the Legislature approved March 11. 1871, Hastings was incorporated as a city. It was apportioned into four wards, and the first election held April 3, 1871. The full list of the officials then elected is as follows : Mayor, H. A. Goodyear : Recorder, Charles B. Wood ; Treasurer, John Bessmer ; Supervisor, David G. Bobin son; Justice of the Peace (full term), James Clarke ; School Inspector, John R. Van Velsor ; School Inspector (one year), William H. Jewell ; Aldermen, William I. F.

Hams, Williams, Kenfield, and Eastman were chosen for two years, and the others for one year. At subsequent elections four aldermen have been chosen for two years, so that the board of aldermen has always in cluded eight members. At the annual elections since 1871 there have been chosen mayors, recorders, treasurers, and aldermen, as follows: The Hastings board of education was incorporated under a legislative act approved April 2, 1873. At the first meeting, July 7, 1873, Nathan Barlow was chosen president, John R. Van Velsor secretary, and John M. Nevins treasurer. Mr. Barlow, who has held the office continuously since 1873, is still the president of the board. James Clarke is secretary, and R. J. Grant treas urer. The other members of the board in March, 1880, were E. H. Lathrop, William S. Goodyear, John Weissert, Robert Dawson, Earl Brown, E. J. Evans, O. S. Hadley, D. R. McElwain, Clement Smith. The teachers in the public schools in 1880 were J. N. Mitchell, Superintendent and Principal of High School ; Ada Andrus, Assistant in High School ; Miss Mary B. Campbell, Grammar Room ; Sarah L. Barlow, Intermedi ate; Estella Wheeler, Fourth Primary; Belle Throop, Third Primary ; Lida Beadle, Second Primary ; Marian Butler, First Primary ; Edith Valleau, First Ward ; Lilian Estes, Second Ward. 1872.\u2014 Mayor, D.

As a result, a hand engine and hose-carriage were bought, and two companies formed at once. Pioneer Engine Company, No. 1, enrolled 50 volunteer members, who chose W. I. F. Hams fore man, while Frank Decker was elected foreman of the hose company. In 1875 a department was organized by the election of David R. Cook as chief engineer, who was suc ceeded in 1876 by W. F. Hicks. Not long after that the department was disorganized, but within a month or so, in the spring of 1877, it was revived as a pay department. W. F. Hicks was elected chief, James L. Wilkins first as sistant, and W. S. Kelley second assistant. William L. Wilkins was foreman of the engine company, and John Russ of the hose company. 1875. \u2014 Mayor, W. S.

Sheldon was born in the town of Brutus, Cayuga Co., N. Y., Sept. 14, 1819. His parents, Ira and Mary Sheldon, were distantly related, and were natives of Connecticut. They reared a family of six sons. In 1827 the elder Sheldon died, leaving the care of the family and the management of the farm to Mrs. Sheldon. Harvey remained at home until he was sixteen years of age, avail ing himself of such means of education as were afforded by the ordinary district school of that day. In the spring of 1835 he came to Michigan in company with his eldest\" brother, Newton Sheldon, who settled in the town of Lodi, Washtenaw Co., where he became one of its prominent citi zens. Harvey remained with his brother three years, when he returned to the State of New York, where he resided until he was twenty-one years of age, when he came back to Michigan. In 1841 he came to Castleton, and purchased from the government the north half of the northwest quarter of section 1 ; he immediately commenced work upon it, making his home with A. B. Cooper, Esq., then a resident of the town of Woodland. In the spring following he erected a dwelling, and during the summer returned to the State of New York, where, on the 14th of September, 1842, he was married to Miss Lydia Miller, of Steuben Co., N. Y. She was born Nov. 22, 1826. In October, 1842, in company with his wife and two brothers, D. C. and 0. B. Sheldon, and their families, he returned to Castleton. His brothers purchased land, and settled in the immediate vicinity of his home, the former on section 36, in Wood land, where he still resides, the latter on an adjoining farm on section 1, in Castleton. was the loss of their only cow. In the spring Mr. Sheldon was attacked with that disease so dreaded by the early set tlers, the ague, which, in connection with a lame arm, so impaired his health that he was obliged to return East. After a residence there of one year he so far recovered his health that he came back to his farm, on which he resided until 1854, at which time he was elected to the office of county treasurer, which position he filled with credit to himself and to the satisfaction of the people for twelve successive years. Previous to his election to this position he had served his fellow-townsmen as clerk and treasurer! and for three terms had represented Castleton on the board of supervisors, where he was appreciated not only for his sound judgment upon all matters of public interest, but for his sterling integrity. Upon the expiration of his term of office as county treas urer he removed to the township of Hagar, Berrien Co., to engage in fruit-growing, an industry to which he gave all his energies and to which he was very much attached. His reputation as a citizen and an official had preceded him, and soon after his settlement in Hagar he was called upon to take an active part in public matters. He was elected to the office of treasurer, and for three terms has been a member of the board of supervisors. In September of 1846 his wife died, leaving three children. In July, 1847, he was married to Miss Almira Wheeler, of Woodland. The better part of the life of Mr. Sheldon has been spent in Barry County. He saw it developed from a semi-wilderness into one of the productive and important counties of the State. He identified himself prominently with its groAVth and pros perity. He perfected an enviable record as a citizen, and will always be remembered for his ability as an official, his sterling integrity, and his marked social qualities. The following winter was one of unusual severity ; snow fell to a great depth, and Mr. Sheldon and his wife ex perienced many hardships and privations, among which"], [556, ""], [557, "CITY OF HASTINGS 373 The department consists now of Pioneer Hand-Engine, No. 1, with 31 men, J.

It was the pioneer grist-mill of Barry County, and was the scene on July 4, 1840, of the first Fourth of July celebra tion in Hastings. The mill building was finished, but the machinery was not in, and Avithin its spacious mill-room the patriotic citizens from miles around gathered for a jolly Fourth of July dance. Those now living who remember it observe that the dance was a merry one, and they re member, too, that the supper that followed at Levi Chase's tavern was a feast at which the edibles were toothsome and the general happiness contagious. THE FIRE OF 18G7. Hastings was sorely scorched in the winter of 1867 by a disastrous fire, Avhich originated from a defective flue in the old Pioneer office and made short work of the frame buildings on that block. Although the loss seemed a seri ous one, it proved a benefit in the end, since the burnt dis trict was almost directly occupied by brick structures, which materially improved and adorned that portion of the village. NEW BUILDINGS. Hayes & Dibble's miller was Slocum H. Bunker, who lived in a log cabin near the mill, and who was further distin guished as the first permanent white settler in Hastings. The fine brick structure known as the Union Block was built by Barlow, Goodyear & Grant in 1867, and was the pioneer of its kind in the town. The Empire Block was erected in 1869, and about then, too, the brick stores occu pying the district burned in 1867 were added to the list of valuable improvements. The present mill has 5 run of stone, with a capacity of about 150 barrels of flour daily. From 12,000 to 15,000 barrels of flour are annually shipped. In 1879 it manu factured considerable flour for export in sacks to Glasgow, Scotland, and New Castle, England. MANUFACTORIES AND MILLS. THE SPALDING AND WILKINS MANUFACTURING COiM- PANY. THE HASTINGS MI..L. The chief manufacturing industry of Hastings is the one conducted by the above company, devoted mainly to the production of croquet implements, and also to the manu facture of base-ball bats, Indian clubs, archery and lawn tennis goods, fishing-rods, etc. The company was incor porated in November, 1879, on a capital of $20,000, with A. G. Spalding, as President ; J. W. Spalding, Vice-Presi dent; J. W. Wilkins, Superintendent; and W. T Brown, Secretary and Treasurer ; these four gentlemen comprising also the list of stockholders. The Hastings Mill was built by A. W. Bailey about 1803, and now belongs to W. S. Goodyear & Parsons, who rent the property to Hitchcock & Eaton. This mill was remodeled in 1S60 by Goodyear, Barlow & Hadley, they having succeeded A. W. Bailey in possession. BANKING IN HASTINGS. In the spring of 1857 William H. Skinner, of Battle Creek, opened a private bank in Hastings, and in the fall of that year H. A. Goodyear purchased the business, and carried it on until 1808, when he sold to Bowne & Gal loway, a firm then just started in the banking interest as the continuation of a bank opened in 1807 by F. N. Gal loway. The business of making croquet implements and base ball bats was begun at Hastings by James L. and Walter L. Wilkins, in 1876, when they bought the buildings and property originally occupied in 1874 by Dwight & Burial for the manufacture of cultivators. In the summer of 1 878, James L. Wilkins purchased the entire interest, and in No vember, 1879, assisted in organizing the present corporation. Bowne & Galloway continued their private banking business until Jan. 1, 1871, when it became absorbed by the organization of the Hastings National Bank, with a capital of $50,000. The directors first chosen Avere A. J. Bowne, President; F. N. Galloway, Cashier ; R. B. Wight man, D. R. Cook, D. B. Pratt, J. A. Sweezy, and L. D. Gardner. A statement issued by the bank, Feb. 21, 1880, included the following exhibit : Circulation. $45,000 ; de posits, $110,000 ; loans, $186,000 ; surplus, $50,000. The fine building now occupied and owned by the institution was erected by Bowne & Galloway in 1869. The present directors are A. J. Bowne, President; Daniel Striker, Vice- President ; George E. Goodyear, Cashier ; D. B. Pratt and L. D. Gardner. The business is the most extensive of its kind in America, and gives regular employment to about 100 per sons. In 1879 upwards of 1000 cords of wood were used in making base-ball bats, while, during the same period, 33,000 sets of croquet were sold. The factories and grounds cover three acres, and are owned by the company. MANUFACTURE OF SASH, DOORS, Etc. About 1865, Dickey & Prentice began the manufacture of sash, doors, and blinds, hard-wood lumber, agricultural tools, etc., but in a short time sold out to Dickey & Bent ley, who were succeeded in 1S69 by J. W. & C. G. Bent ley. In 1878 they gave way to Bentley Brothers & Wil kins, the firm noAV carrying on the business, which has so expanded that from 30 to 40 men are now employed in it. Connected with the factory is a saw-mill, which, in 1S79, cut 2,000,000 feet of hard-wood lumber. HASTINGS POST-OFFICE. Previous to the spring of 1839 the few people living in Hastings and near there depended upon getting their mail at Gull Prairie, forty miles distant, but the dependence was of that uncertain character which followed upon the iu frequency and irregularity of communication.

A new school-house had been built the same year I came, and in that house we assembled for worship. From this point I went into all the settlements of Barry County, the western part of Eaton County, and the northern part of Kalamazoo County, preaching wherever I could assemble a congregation. Previous to my coming to this work Brother Daubney, a local preacher from Gull Prairie, had visited Hastings a few times and preached to the people. at Hastings, and April 29, 1839, the application was an swered favorably by the issuance to Willard Hays of a postmaster's commission. Although letter-postage in those days was 25 cents, the business at the Hastings office was so limited that during the first three months of his term Postmaster Hays' receipts were less than $1. The first mail-route that touched Hastings passed by way of Coldwater, and over that route the mail was at first carried by Daniel McClelland on horseback once a week. Later, when the stage-route Avas opened between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids in 1846, Hastings, being a station on the route, received a daily mail. \" I heard of a Methodist man who lived several miles northeast of Hastings by the name of Alonzo Barnum. I made him a visit, and found him chopping down a tree. I introduced myself, and when I told him that a new mission had been formed and that I was the preacher in charge, he raised his hands and eyes to heaven, great tears rolled down his face, and he exclaimed, ' Praise God, my prayers have been heard at last !' AVe both knelt at the roots of the tree and held a prayer-meeting. A class was formed there, and we made it a regular preaching-place. Mr. Hays continued to be the postmaster from 1839 until 1847, when he resigned, and succeeding him W. S. Jennings took possession. In 1849, H. A. Goodyear be came the incumbent, and following him H. I. Knappen. Mr. Knappen's successors were Nathan Barlow, R. J. Grant, J. W. Stebbins, Dr. John Roberts (in 1867), and John M. Nevins, the present postmaster, who was appointed in 1875, and reappointed March 3, 1879. \" I preached in Eaton County in the Hagar settlement. I preached in Zebulon Burnam's school-house, northeast of Hastings, and in the Carpenter settlement, north of Hastings. West of Hastings I had an appointment at Mr. Ingraham's, and also at John AV. Bradley's. I preached at Mr. Hill's, where the village of Middleville now stands, and farther south, at Judge Barlow's. I had also an appointment at Yankee Springs, and preached during the year at 'Yankee' Lewis' tavern. I preached also during the year at Pine Lake, where we had a class, and there we held a quarterly meeting. East of Hastings there was a considerable settlement near the county-line, and there I preached to a class at the house of Lorenzo Mudge. During the summer of 1842 I held, with Rev. Franklin Page, in charge of Alle gan Circuit, a camp-meeting near Gun Marsh, on a line between our respective changes. This was the first camp-meeting ever held in this part of the State, and it was attended with gratifying results. For the three months ending Dec. 31, 1879, the busi nese of the Hastings post-office was, \u2014 Stamps sold $742.11 Postal-cards sold 83.00 Stamped envelopes sold 149.39 Box-rents 104.50 Total $1079.00 Number of money-orders issued \"594 Value of same $6051.86 Money-orders paid $2844.56 \" The free use of intoxicating drinks in Barry County suggested work in the temperance cause. There was a lawyer in Hastings by the name of Marsh Giddings, a very good talker, who was always ready for a temperance speech. John Van Arnam, a lawyer from Battle Creek, who came to Hastings to attend court, assisted us in the good work. We soon organized a temperance society, and nearly all the people took the pledge. At every place where I preached I delivered temperance discourses and offered the pledge. A great majority of the people joined the temperance ranks. AVe had a Fourth of July celebration and passed through the usual formalities of such an occasion. I had the honor of being the first chaplain in Hastings. Our band consisted of a fife and drum, and did excellently well.\" The office sends and receives two daily mails, two tri weekly mails, and one semi-weekly mail. RELIGIOUS HISTORY. PIONEER AVORK. Rev. Daniel Bush, a Methodist missionary preacher, was the first minister to locate at Hastings, or do any stated work at that point, and, as he has happily preserved, in a recently written letter, many interesting details touching his experience as a preacher in Barry County, liberal extracts from that letter are given to our readers, in the belief that they will be found interesting and worthy of preservation. Mr. Bush says : FIRST METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. The first quarterly meeting Conference for Hastings mis sion was held at Hastings, Nov. 6, 1841, on which occasion there were present James F. Davidson, Presiding Elder ; Daniel Bush, Missionary ; and Alonzo Barnum, Lorenzo Mudge, Elisha Carpenter, and Aaron L. Ellis, Leaders. Alonzo Barnum was appointed recording steward, and Lo renzo Mudge, Aaron L. Ellis, Richard Witherel, and Joseph Merriman stewards. \" Early in the fall of 1841, I rode into Hastings on horseback, and announced myself as a minister of the gospel, sent by the Methodist Conference to bibor among them as a missionary. The people received me as a messenger of God, and with a cordiality and warm-hearted ness that ut once inspired me with confidence and hope. I never met with a warmer reception than I did at Hastings, although there was not a professor of religion in the place. There were at this time, if my memory serves me, some ten or twelve buildings in Hastings, the most of them being built of logs, while the people were all very poor. Forty dollars in missionary money had been appropriated for the support of my family, but the people were quite liberal, and we passed through the year very comfortably. At a meeting held July 13, 1843, Henry Worthington being the preacher in charge, it was resolved to build a par sonage at Hastings. The building committee was composed of A. C. Ketchum, Isaac Messer, and John W. Bradley. At a stewards' meeting of Hastings Circuit held Sept. 30, 1843, Rev. Edward L. Kellogg being the preacher in charge, he appointed Asahel Tillotson, Alonzo Barnum, Lorenzo Mudge, Isaac Messer, and Aaron L. Ellis to be trustees for the Methodist Episcopal Church for Hastings Circuit. \" As the people would not consent to my living outside the village, the first thing in order was to procure a residence for my family. Failing to find a house, we were offered a temporary home in Alex ander McArthur's house, where we were given an upper chamber, which was reached by a ladder, and there was established the first Methodist parsonage in Hastings. A movement, headed by A. AA\\ Bailey and Thomas Bunker, for the erection of more comfortable quarters for my family, resulted in the completion of a house on the 1st day of January, 1842. The firewood needed for the household I obtained by felling trees that grew in profusion about tbe house. Mr. Kellogg's successor on the circuit was Rev. A. C. Shaw, who, at a meeting in June, 1846, reported that he had raised $50 for the purchase of a circuit Sabbath-school library, and that eleven schools had been organized. Rev. * c * . * I"], [559, "CITY OF HASTINGS. 375 George King was the preacher in 1847, and in 1849 he was succeeded by Rev. Ransom Goodell. Following him came Revs. T. Clark, M.

FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. Upon the day of the dissolution of the Congregational Church, the First Presbyterian Church of Hastings was organized in the village school-house. Rev. Zerah T. Hoyt was moderator of the meeting, and Lewis H. Ensign secre tary. Those who were received into the church at the organization, besides those mentioned in the sketch of the First Congregational Church, were Henry Standish and Abbey, his wife, Mrs. Sophia E. Kenfield, Lewis H. En sign and Abby, his wife, Sarah M. S.andish, Gorgietta E. Standish, and Mrs. Esther Dowd. Lewis H. Ensign was chosen .ruling elder. In March, 1849, the ordinance of baptism was conferred upon George H. Ensign, Georgiana A. Ensign, and Henry A. Ensign, and at the same meet ing Abel Rice was elected elder. At a meeting held Feb. 8, 1853, the church adopted new articles as to the form of church government, and changed the name of the organi zation to The First Presbyterian and Congregational Church of Hastings. On the 10th of February 24 members were added upon a profession of faith. From this time for ward the church rapidly received accessions and gained in strength. The First Methodist Episcopal Church of Hastings, founded, as has been seen, by Rev. Mr. Bush, enjoys now an abundant prosperity, and embraced in March, 1880, a membership of 198. The church stewards are R. J. Grant, 0. D. Spaulding, Daniel Striker, S. C. Prindle, Eben Pen nock, J. C. Lampman, J. F. Hale, and W. H. Schantz. The trustees are It. J. Grant, 0. D. Spaulding, Eben Pen nock, Daniel Striker, S. C. Prindle, Manning Doud, and S. C. Whitcomb. The class-leaders are It. J. Grant and 0. D. Spaulding. Mrs. Clement Smith is superintendent of the Sunday-school, which has 13 teachers and an average attendance of 130 scholars. The pastor, Rev. Levi Master, entered upon the charge in the fall of 1877. His predecessors, dating from 1866, were Revs. A. P. Moors, J. H. Ross, J. I. Buell, T. H. Jacokes, and G. W. Sherman. FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OF HASTINGS. The court-house was long used as a place of worship, but on the 13th of December, 1854, the newly erected Presbyterian and Congregational house of worship was ded icated. Rev. Zerah T. Hoyt, who had thus far been the pastor of the church, retired from the charge late in 1855, and on April 27, 1856, Rev. A. H. Gaston entered the pastorate. Mr. Gaston served until the spring of 1863, when he was dismissed. Shortly after that several mem bers of the congregation withdrew to the Protestant Epis copal Church, aud for a year the congregation was so weak that regular services were not maintained. Early in 1864, however, an earnest effort led to a revival of interest, and in April of that year Rev. E. G. Bryant was secured as pastor. The church moved forward again upon a prosper ous career, and iu September, 1865, material improvements were begun upon the church edifice. This work required five months to complete, and during that time no meetings of any kind were held. Mr. Bryant retired from the pas torate in the autumn of 1866, and in January, 1867, Rev. William S. Messmer was obtained as stated supply, and remained until January, 1S68. From that time until August the church was Aacant. Rev. Theodore D. Marsh was then engaged as pastor, and remained until Feb. 7, 1875. Rev. R. W. Fletcher, the next pastor, commenced his term of service April 1, 1876, ami closed it Jan. 20, 1878, and in December of that year Rev. D. R. Shoop was called to the charge, which he still occupies. The elders of the church at preseut are J. P. Roberts, John M. Nevins, George Putnam, and W. II. Holmes. At a meeting of the First Congregational Church of Hast ings, held in the village school-house, Jan. 7, 1849, the following members were present: Mrs. Lucina Hanne, Mrs. Hannah Kellogg, Mrs. Susan Pierson, Mrs. Sarah M. Hoyt, Mrs. Arvilla B. Ralph, Mrs. Elizabeth Horton, Mrs. Nancy Young, and Mr. Abel Rice. Two members were absent, Mrs. Clarissa Bailey and Mrs. Louisa Tabor. The meeting was called to order by the pastor, Rev. Z. T. Hoyt, who stated that the object of the meeting was to urge the neces sity of reorganizing the church and adopting the Presby terian form of government in consequence of difficulties that existed in the Congtegational Church, and which ap peared then beyond their power to settle, the pastor stating further that a Presbyterian Church had already been organ ized. The members present then voted to donate the com munion-service and all other property belonging to the First Congregational Church to the First Presbyterian Church of Hastings, and, letters of dismission being granted to the members named above, it was resolved \" that the First Congregational Church of Hastings be hereby dis solved.\" The Congregational Church just mentioned had been or ganized in 1842, in the Hastings school-house, by Rev. Mr. Cochran, of Vermontville. The first members were A. C. Parmelee and wife, Marsh Giddings and wife, Mrs. Clarissa Bailey, Mrs. Vespasian Young, Mrs. Horton, and Nathan Barlow and wife. Mr. Cochrane came to preach only occa sionally, but when Rev. Z. T. Hoyt settled in Hastings there was regular preaching from that time on. After a while dissensions arose in the congregation, and as the only way out of the trouble it was decided to dissolve the church as above stated, which action, however, was only prelimi nary to a change of form, since the First Presbyterian Church straightway succeeded to the place of the First Con- The trustees of the society are John Greble, George Putnam, W. H. Holmes, C. G. Bentley, Geo. M. Dewey, J. P. Roberts. The church membership is now 56. The Sunday-school superintendent is W. H. Holmes, who is assisted by 12 teachers. The average attendance at the school is 05."], [560, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 376 the church has confirmed 132 persons and received 155 communicants. The communicants number now 80. The Suuday-school, which is in charge of the rector, has 12 teachers and an average attendance of 60. Although it is generally supposed that the church is the First Presbyterian Church, it is really the First Presby terian and Congregational Church, since the latter name, adopted in 1853, has never been formally changed. The name of the society has, however, been changed, and is legally the First Presbyterian Society of Hastings. CATHOLIC CHURCH. Previous to 1869 priests used to come from various points to hold occasional worship in Hastings at private houses for such of the Catholic faith as lived here. In 1869, John Stanley agitated the organization of a Catholic Church, and with Patrick Ryan aud Thomas Haney effected the purchase of a building formerly used as a cooper-shop, and converted it into a house of worship, which has since been in use for that purpose, although a handsomer and roomier edifice is soon to be erected on Jefferson Street, where the congrega tion owns three lots. Among the early priests were Fathers Ernstrasser, Pulcher, and McManus. Father Algier, the first stationed priest, remained two years, and was followed by Father Wicart, whose term of service was likewise two years. Father McManus comes now from Grand Rapids once in two weeks and holds services, which are numerously attended. EMMANUEL (PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL) CHURCH. Doubtless the first Episcopal sermon preached in Hast ings was delivered by Rev. Dr. Cummings, of Grand Rapids, on the occasion of his tarrying briefly at the vil lage in 1847, while en route to his home. In the early part of July, 1851, Rev. V. Spalding, of Three Rivers, having been sent by Bishop McCoskry on a missionary tour through Michigan, stopped at Hastings and preached an Episcopal sermon in the court-house. During 1856 and 1857 Rev. Robert Wood preached occasionally in the village, but until 1863 there was no movement looking to the holding of regular religious services according to the Episcopal faith. In June of that year, J. W. Bancroft, principal of the Union school, was consulted by Dr. H. J. Haney and F. D. Ackley touching the feasibility of having Episcopalian church service every Sunday. Mr. Bancroft agreed to read service, and upon a return from a vacation held the first meeting at his house, Aug. 30, 1863, on which occa sion there were present, besides his own family of four, Mr. and Mrs. F. D. Ackley and their daughter. On the next Sunday Dr. Haney was present, with those heretofore named, and on the third Sunday the congregation numbered about 20. Interesfin the church continuing to increase Rev. L. H. Corson, of Jonesville, was invited to preach, and on the 4th and 11th of October he held forth in the Presbyterian church. THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH. A meeting was held in the court-house Dec. 11, 1868, to organize a Baptist Church, Bev. E. Curtis being moder ator and J. G. Runyan secretary, but, the number in attend ance being few, an adjournment was ordered to the 22d instant. Previous to this, Oct. 18, 1868, the First Baptist Society of Hastings was incorporated, with T. L. Pillsbury, J. G. Runyan, A. H. Tyler, Mr. Otis, John Michael, and Wm. Morgan as the charter members. On the 22d of December the church was organized with 21 members, of whom Rev. T. Pillsbury, Mrs. M. M. Pills bury, J. G. Runyan and wife, Sarah Kelley, Hannah Salis bury, Wm. Morgan and wife, C. W. Cassaday and wife, John Michael and wife, Mrs. A. M. Dean, Sarah Morgan, and Deborah Hall are still members. On that occasion trustees were elected as follows : For three years, J. G. Runyan and T. W. Hewit ; for two years, E. Curtis and J. Michael; for one year, J. M. Rogers and T. L. Pillsbury. The result of his visit was the organization of a parish, and on the 17th of October, 1873, articles of association were signed by H. A. Goodyear, D. G. Robinson, Nathan Barlow, H. J. Haney, F. D. Ackley, and J. W. Bancroft. The first subsequent services were held in Masonic Hall, Oct. 25, 1803, Mr. Bancroft conducting lay services. On the following Sabbath a Sunday-school was organized, with 25 scholars and 8 teachers. Jan. 17, 1864, Bishop Mc- Coskry made his first visitation, Avhen services were held in the Methodist Episcopal church. Dec. 18, 1864, Em manuel Hall, in the Brower building, was occupied as a place of worship. Mr. Bancroft conducted lay services until Sept. 19, 1865, when, having been admitted to dea con's orders, he was called to the rectorship of Emmanuel Church, and entered upon the charge Oct. 1, 1865. The following year the chapel now in use was completed, and occupied Oct. 14, 1866. May 22, 1867, Mr. Bancroft was advanced to the priesthood, and still remains in charge of the parish, his continuance therein having been without in terruption since 1863. The court-house was used as a house of worship, and meetings were continued with more or less regularity until the summer of 1871, when they ceased, by reason of a de cline of the church membership to but a handful. No effort to revive the church was made until June 20, 1877, when in response to the efforts of Rev. C. W. Palmer, the evangelist, a meeting was held for the purpose of reorgan izing it, and to such good purpose that 18 members were gained at the outset. Affairs prospered, and in 1878, upon the death of Mrs. E. M. Hand, a member of the church, the society came into possession under her will of her late residence, and that building, at once remodeled, has served as a house of worship since. Mr. Palmer labored with the church until September, 1877, and in the following October came Rev. W. S. Wilkinson, who is still the pastor. The church has now a membership of 77. The Sabbath-school, in charge of I. N. Mitchell and eight teachers, has an average attendance of from 75 to 100. The church trustees are T. L. Pillsbury, J. M. Rogers, and C. W. Cassaday. The deacon is B. W. Morgan. The vestry appointed in 1863 was composed of H. A. Goodyear and D. G. Robinson (wardens), H. J. Haney, Nathan Barlow, and F. D. Ackley. Messrs. Goodyear and Robinson have served as wardens continuously from the beginning. The other members of the vestry are M. W. Riker, E. B. Throop, and Charles L. Young.

Two lodges of this order, known as Barry and Pioneer, were at one time in flourishing existence, but they have for some months been inactive, although there is present talk of their speedy revival. In the winter of 1876-77, Henry Reynolds, the noted temperance agitator, visited Hastings, and labored to such good purpose that Jan. 17, 1877, the Hastings Reform Club was formed, with a membership of 40. The first officers chosen were James Clarke, Pres. ; H. H. Bailey, Sec. ; C. G. Bentley, Treas. Since the organization the club has had a prosperous and fruitful history. Public entertainments of an inviting character have been given each Tuesday night, and a gospel temperance meeting on each Sunday afternoon. The cause of temperance has been materially encouraged, and in March, 1880, the club membership was upwards of 200. Then the officers were John F. Hale, Pres. ; George M. Dewey, Sec. ; O. D.

RIVERSIDE CEMETERY COMPANY Fifty acres of land within the limits of the city, occu pied by what is known as the Riverside Cemetery, belonged originally to the township, but were transferred in 1870 to the control of the Riverside Cemetery Company, incorpor ated September 30th of that year for the purpose of laying out a burial-ground upon the tract and maintaining it for that use forever. The incorporators of the company were H. A. Goodyear, President ; J. P. Roberts, Treasurer ; BIOG.KAPHICAL SKETCHES. and engaged in merchandising. He was one of the suc cessful merchants and prominent citizens of the place, and was closely identified with its interests, and held many mu nicipal positions. At the age of twenty-two he was elected magistrate, and for six years was one of the selectmen of the town. In 1848 he came to Michigan and purchased one hundred and sixty acres of new land in the town of Hastings, upon which he remained one and a half years, during which time he built a log house, planted an orchard, and partially cleared thirty acres. This experience demon strated to his satisfaction the fact that he was not likely to prove a success as a farmer ; he therefore sold his farm and removed to Hastings village, then a little settlement of a few families, and associated himself with Nathan Barlow in trade. The copartnership existed three years; then Mr. Barlow purchased Mr. Robinson's interest. From this time until 1869 he was actively engaged in business, and Daniel G. Robinson, one of the early settlers of Hastings, and for many years one of its prominent merchants, was born in China, Kennebec Co., Me., Jan. 11, 1811. His father, Benjamin Robinson, was a thrifty, industrious far mer, and a man of some local prominence Iu 1816 he removed from China to Vassalborough, where he died. He was a man of undoubted integrity and irreproachable character. He reared a family of four children, Daniel being the eldest. The early life of our subject was like that of farmers' boys generally ; the summer's campaign upon the farm was alternated by a few months at the district school in winter. He obtained a good common-school edu cation, and at the age of sixteen commenced life as clerk in a store. Five years' labor in this capacity demonstrated his ability as a tradesman, and upon attaining his majority he established himself in trade at St. Alban's, Me., where he remained two years, when he returned to Vassalborough"], [564, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 380 Somerville, Mass. Politically, Mr. Robinson is a Democrat. He has occupied several positions of trust and responsi bility, notably among the number that of supervisor, which office he filled to the entire satisfaction of his fellow townsmen for fourteen years. In his religious belief he is au Episcopalian, and has held the office of vestryman since the organization of the church in Hastings, of which he is one of the original members. All in all, he is one of those kind Christian gentlemen whose identification with any identified himself largely with the growth and develop ment of the place. He has witnessed its transition from a hamlet to a busy and thriving city, and in his own person typifies many of the agencies that have wrought these change: In 1833 Mr. Robinson was married to Miss Sarah B.

Here he remained until March, 1840, when he removed to Battle Creek. The following November he came to Hast ings, brino-ing a stock of general merchandise, and estab lished the first store in Barry County, on the corner of what is now Creek and Main Streets. At this 'time he might perhaps have been more properly called an Indian trader than amerehant, as his customers were mostly Indians. He drew his goods from Detroit, a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, for many years. In 1843, Mr. Goodyear was married to Miss Mary, daughter of Nathan Barlow, one of the pioneers of the county. After five years of uninterrupted happiness, Mrs. Goodyear died, leaving three children,\u2014 William H., George E., and Nathan B. In 1850, Mr. Goodyear was again married, to Miss Ermina, sister of his first wife. By this union there have been four children,\u2014 Mary R., Anna M., David S., and John F. Mr. Goodyear has identified himself prominently with all the varied inter ests of the county, and has occupied many positions of trust and responsibility, the duties of which he has discharged with fidelity and with credit to himself. Hon. Henry A. Goodyear, the pioneer banker and mer chant of Hastings, and whose name is so prominently iden tified with all the initial events in its history, was born in York, York Co., Pa., June 30, 1818. His grandfather, George Goodyear, was a soldier in the Revolutionary war. After its close he settled in York, Pa., where George Goodyear, father of Henry A., was born. He acquired the trade of a cabinet-maker, and for many years dealt extensively in lumber. He was a successful business man, and prominently identified with York County. He held several municipal offices, and Avas highly esteemed for his integrity and ability. Henry A. acquired an academi cal education, and remained at home until he was sixteen years of age, when he went to Philadelphia and entered the employ of a druggist by the name of William Youngs. At the expiration of two years he left the employ of Mr. Youngs, intending to go to the West Indies, but an in surrection breaking out, and seeing an advertisement in a Detroit paper for a drug-clerk, he changed his plans and started for Detroit, where he arrived in October of 1838."], [565, "CITY OF HASTINGS. 381 In 1845 he was elected to the representative branch of the Legislature. In 1854 he was elected to the State Sen ate. In 1874 he was again elected to the House, serving on the committee of \" Ways and Means.\" In 1852 he was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention at Balti more, which nominated Franklin Pierce for President. He has held various municipal offices, \u2014 was the first president of the village, and was elected the first mayor after its organization as a city. Mr. Goodyear has been a firm and fast friend of educational interests, and has for years been a member of the board of education. He took a prominent part in the erection of the high-school building. In his re ligious affiliations he is an Episcopalian, of which denomi nation he has long been a member, and is senior warden. HIRAM J. KENFIELD. Among the early settlers and prominent citizens of Hast- ings, none are more worthy of conspicuous mention in its history than Hiram J. Kenfield. He was a man of much more than ordinary ability and energy, and his name is stamped upon all the initial events in its history. He was born in the town of Virgil, Wyoming Co., N. Y., Nov. 16, 1812, and was descended from Revolutionary stock. His maternal grandfather was a member of that historic \" Tea Party\" who took the initiative in opposition to British op- pression and tyranny. His parents were William Lee Ken- field and Mary Popple ; the former was a native of Old Hadley, Mass., while the latter was born in Vermont. They reared a family of nine children, Hiram J. being the eldest. The elder Kenfield was a farmer, and came to Michigan in 1844 and settled in what is now the town of Rutland ; he was a valuable citizen, an exemplary man in all respects, and a worthy and consistent member of the Presbyterian Church. He died in Hastings in 1858. the development of the little hamlet, in connection with his ability and foresight, soon gave him a leading position among the settlers. He built the first court-house, the first store, and the first hotel, and in 1842 he was elected sheriff of the county and empaneled the first jury. He discharged the duties of that office creditably for two years, and at various times he held important municipal offices, notably that of alderman and member of the board of education. He was a man of sterling integrity, unfalter ing energy, and left on record his mark in all that pertained to the county from its earliest settlement. He was public spirited in the fullest sense of the word, and to his energy and persistent efforts, in a great measure, was due the early completion of the Grand River Railroad, which was so essential to the growth of the town and county. All parts of the city show his interest in the growth and prosperity of the place, and he will ever be remembered as one of Hastings' most valuable citizens. In business matters he The emigration of Mr. Kenfield to Michigan was in 1837, stopping first near Duck Lake, in Calhoun County. Here he resided two years, at the expiration of which time he came to Hastings, then almost an unbroken wilderness, and in November of 1S39 built the first bridge across the Thornapple River, on the site of the present bridge on Creek Street. The vim and energy which he evinced in was methodical, prompt, and energetic ; his word was as good as his bond, and it is said that in his extended and varied experience as a business man he never sued a man and was never sued but once. Socially he was affable and courteous, winning and retaining the esteem of all with whom he came in contact. In his political belief he was a Democrat, liberal to his opponents, and during the dark"], [566, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 382 days of the Rebellion a true patriot. He was a valuable member of the Presbyterian Church, with which he united in 1853, and at the time of his death was one of the elders. Mr. Kenfield was twice married, \u2014 in 1840 to Polly, daughter of Frederic Ingraham, one of the first settlers of Rutland ; she died in 1846 ; the second time in 1848, to Sophia E., daughter of Henry Standish, of Hastings ; she is still living. Mr. Kenfield died June 28, 1877. He left five chil dren, \u2014 one son by his first marriage, two sons and two daughters by his second marriage. WILLIAM UPJOHN, M.D This gentleman, the first resident physician of Barry County, and whose name and history are so prominently associated with the city of Hastings, was born in Shastes bury, Dorsetshire, England, in March, 1807. His father, also named William, was a civil engineer by profession, and extensively known throughout the West of England for his integrity of character and ability in his profession. He married Mary Standard, of Fisbury, in 1795, and reared a family of twelve children, \u2014 three boys and nine girls. The boys received academical educations, chose the pro fession of medicine, and have made their mark not only as successful practitioners, but useful and honorable citizens ; they have been engaged in the practice of medicine in the aggregate for over one hundred and thirty-five years. At the age of twenty-one William decided to emigrate to Amer ica, and in company with his brother Uriah, left the old home at Shaftesbury and sailed for the United States, where they arrived in the year 1828. The succeeding two years was spent in travel through different States for the purpose of finding a suitable location for permanent settlement. Two years subsequent to their emigration the elder Upjohn, accompanied by his family, folloAved his two sons, and, after a residence of one year at Hyde Park, N. Y., pur chased a farm in the town of Pittsford, Monroe Co., N. Y., where he resided until his decease, which occurred in 1848. He was an exemplary man in all respects, of a deeply re ligious nature, and of more than ordinary culture and refinement. He was the author of several religious works, and a regular contributor to several religious newspapers. For over forty years he preached. In 1835 the younger Upjohns came to Michigan and settled in the town of Richland, Kalamazoo Co., where William bought a new farm, to Avhich he devoted his time and energies for the succeeding two years, but clearing land and tilling the soil was not congenial to his tastes, and, in 1837, he joined his brother in the practice of medicine, with whom he re mained about four years. At the expiration of this time he came to Hastings, then a little hamlet of perhaps a dozen or fifteen families, and established himself in the practice of his profession, in which he has been eminently successful. In 1842 the doctor met his destiny in the person of Miss Affa Connet, whom he married in Decem ber of that year. After one year of uninterrupted happi ness, Mrs. Upjohn was \" called home,\" and, in 1847, he was again married, to Lydia Amelia, sister of his first wife. They have been blessed with three children, two of whom are living, \u2014 Marie, now Mrs. John Beamer, and Affa, wife of Geo. Davis. The doctor has devoted himself strictly to the practice of his profession, but has identified himself largely with educational and political matters. In 1852"], [567, "ASSYRIA TOWNSHIP 383 he was elected register of deeds, and in the same year was elected a member of the first board of regents of the State University ; the duties of both positions he discharged with fidelity to the trust reposed in him and with credit to himself. In 1862, Governor Blair, knowing his ability as a surgeon and physician, tendered him the position of sur geon in the Seventh Michigan Cavalry, which he accepted, and soon after went with the regiment to the front. In the field as at home his dignified bearing, kindness of heart, and ability won for him an enviable reputation among his superior officers, and the respect and esteem of those soldiers who were so unfortunate as to require his professional services. From the position of regimental sur geon he was promoted to that of surgeon-in chief of the First Brigade of the First Division Cavalry of the Army of the Potomac. The doctor was with Kilpatrick in his raid on Richmond, and accompanied Gen. Sherman in his raid up the James River. He served with distinction throughout the war, when he returned to his home and resumed the practice of his profession. As a physi cian he possesses the necessary qualifications other than knowledge, \u2014 geniality of disposition and firmness blended with kindness and compassion. In the early days he was ever ready to answer the call of the sick and needy, and, whether in storm or sunshine, night or day, he would find his way, ofttimes guided by only an Indian trail, to the rude home of the pioneer. Possessed of most of the virtues and having but few of the faults of humankind, he has endeared himself to the people in such a way that his name has become a household word, and no history of Barry County Avould be complete without some sketch of his life, labors, and character. ASSYRIA.1 dotted with graves gave token that these savages had been for many years located in this locality. TOAVNSHIP 1 north, in range 7 west, was named Assyria on its organization, in 1844, and lies in the southeastern cor ner of Barry County, having Maple Grove township on the north, Calhoun County on the south, Eaton County on the east, and Johnstown township on the west. When first settled the township consisted mainly of oak-openings, with tracts of hard-wood timber in the eastern part. Old settlers say it was a most attractive-looking country, particu larly in early summer, when wild-flowers covered the earth in profusion, and the numerous glades offered a charming perspective in every direction. With these neighbors Mr. Blaisdell soon became a char acter of importance. He traded with them, and generally gained their warm friendship. Nevertheless, some of them gave him on one occasion a serious fright. He was awak ened one night about twelve o'clock by a furious uproar in his cabin, and, springing from his bed, was confronted by a party of eight redskins, evidently as drunk as white man's whisky could make them. They brandished their knives in a threatening manner, and uttered the most diabolical of howls. Mr. Blaisdell, making sure that the savages meant to scalp him, attempted to escape from the cabin, but they headed him off, and compelled him, as a measure of safety, to dodge behind the cabin stove. They chased him, how ever, not only aAvay from there, but all over the house, yelling like mad, and at every jump poor Blaisdell expected to feel his hair parting company with his head. They were evidently, however, only desirous to frighten him, and ere long left the cabin, allowing the terrified pioneer to recover his senses and to thank Heaven that he still lived. Assyria is reckoned an excellent agricultural township, particularly in the production of wheat, of which the yield is said to average 20 bushels per acre. In the west and southwest the surface is rough, and there is some waste land, but generally the surface is level and the soil rich. Assyria is a strictly rural township, but in the matter of wealth and prosperity will compare favorably with any in the county. Township 1, range 7, remained in undisturbed possession of the red man, the wolf, and the deer until the autumn of 1836, when Joseph S. Blaisdell, a Vermonter, came with his family to section 36, and established himself as a pio neer. Blaisdell was the only settler in that part of the township for some time, but was not without neighbors. At the time of his coming there were in the town two Indian villages, \u2014 the larger one, containing about 30 lodges, being on section 24, and a smaller one, of 20 huts, near by, on section 25. In the larger village stood the council house, and in both of them there were evidences that the inhabitants had abided there some time. Rude fences in closed cornfields here and there, and a burying-ground Mr. Blaisdell Avas a man of strong religious feelings, and when he came to township 1 brought with him from Ver mont a Free-Will Baptist minister, to whom he presented an 80-acre lot, the terms of the donation being that he should settle upon the land and should hold occasional religious services. The minister received a deed of the land, lived with Blaisdell, preached in Blaisdell's house and in the neighborhood, but did not settle upon the 80 acres. At the end of a twelvemonth he concluJed that he had had quite enough of Western life, and distressed Blaisdell ex ceedingly by informing him that he would turn his face towards the East and return no more to Michigan. And go he did, selling to Blaisdell the land which the latter had * By David Schwartz. >"], [568, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 384 born on the 19th day of May. She lived less than two years, and died Feb. 17, 1841. donated to him with the expectation that he would become a permanent minister of the gospel in the vicinity. When Mr. Blaisdell settled in Assyria, and for some time afterwards, there was a great hunting-ground for deer in the vicinity of the deer-licks on section 26. There Indians put up stagings in the trees, from which they would slay the deer as fast as the latter could come to the licks.* The first marriage in the township was also in the Ellis family ; Calvin P. White and Pamelia Chapin (a sister of Mrs. Ellis) being the happy pair. They were married Sept. 30, 1843, in Mr. Ellis' new framed house, by a minister from Bellevue. The wedding-guests included, besides the Ellis family, Charles G. Baker and wife, Flagler, the car penter at work on the house, his assistant, and some people from Bellevue. Mr. White bought some land of Ellis, on section 4, and was for many years a resident there. . About 1840 the Indians living in the township moved to other localities, and their council-house, lodges, and villages fell into decay. Indian relics may, however, be found in the neighborhood to this day, and one hears occasionally of arrow-heads, hatchets, and such articles, being turned up by the plowshare of the husbandman. When Mr. Ellis concluded to change his log cabin for a better habitation, he went over to the Quaker saw-mill, in Maple Grove, to buy the lumber, but was appalled at the price asked for it. Old Mr. Mott, the Quaker, the owner of the property, happening to be there at the time, told Mr. Ellis he must pay the price asked, for there was no other mill in the vicinity, and no water-power on which to build one. Capt. C. D. Morris, a retired naval officer on half-pay, owned the land on section 24, having in 1836 purchased upwards of 400 acres on sections 23 and 24. When he settled on the place (in 1850 or soon after), he built a house upon the very spot previously occupied by the Indian council-house, of which portions were standing at that time. Mr. Blaisdell remained the only settler in Assyria until March, 1837, when Cleaveland Ellis, a New Yorker, who had located 680 acres on sections 3 and 4, came to his land accompanied by Calvin P. White, L. P. Hayes, Philo Nor ton, and the family of the latter, all of whom Mr. Ellis had brought with him to assist him in making a start on his land. Upon their arrival they all moved into an Indian hut sound standing on section 4. As soon as possible they built a comfortable log cabin on the same section, upon a spot now in Mr. Hinchman's orchard. \" Well,\" replied Ellis, \" I'll not pay your price for all that, and what's more I'll find water-power and build a mill.\" As good as his word, he found a mill-site on section 12, in Assyria, interested Daniel and Abel Baldwin (then living on section 3) in the enterprise, and set about the building of a saw-mill in 1841. The Baldwins were mill wrights and sawyers, and after the mill was put up carried it on. The irons used in its construction were hauled from Detroit, from which fact some idea may be formed of the difficulty of getting the mill in operation. This mill was sold, in 1843, to Belcher Athern and John T. Ellis, who in that year built a store just east of it, and put up an ashery at the same place, where they made \" black salts.\" Athern & Ellis carried on business at that point about two years, but the amount of trade was not sufficient to make the in vestment a paying one, and it was then given up. After remaining with his hired help until August, Mr. Ellis proceeded eastward, and brought out his father, mother, wife, and three-year-old daughter. Of these five two are living, the widow of Mr. Ellis, who resides in As syria, and the daughter \u2014 now Mrs. Wallace Dingman \u2014 who lives in Battle Creek. Mr. Ellis brought his family into the township with a pair of horses, but, having nothing to feed them, he took them to Bellevue, in Eaton County. When the marsh grass began to come up he brought his horses back to As syria, and turned them out upon the marsh. One of them speedily died, and the other, getting mired in the marsh, fell a victim to the wolves. Mr. Ellis' brief experience with horses in that region cured him of all desire to possess any more until he could make hay to feed them and have roads in which to drive them. Wolves played such havoc with sheep that Mr. Ellis was ten years in doubling his flock, and to save lambs was al most an impossibility. He had to go at times as far as Marshall to mill, but soon found that convenience at Battle Creek, and a little later at Bellevue, so that getting to mill was not a very serious matter. When he first came out he had to go as far as Marengo to purchase supplies, but when he did go he laid in a liberal stock, and saved himself the trouble of making frequent trips. When Mr. Ellis came into the township he followed the Indian trail from Bellevue towards Basquon Creek, in the northwestern corner of the township. At that place the Indians were accustomed to camp in the winter season, and from there to Bellevue they had marked the trail mentioned. Mr. Ellis was an enterprising farmer, and pushed his business with a will that greatly benefited and encouraged his fellow-settlers, while it brought him, in the course of time, a handsome fortune. To start with he had 680 acres of land, and with a large force of men he soon got a great portion of it under cultivation, so that when set tlers began to come into the township he was a heavy pro ducer, and able and willing to help them to the necessaries of life until their first crops were harvested. \" I don't know what we would have done if it hadn't been for Mr. Ellis,\" said one of the early settlers of 1841 to the writer, and that remark is corroborated by others of the old pio neers. When he died, in August, 1867, Cleaveland Ellis owned 880 acres of land in Assyria, and had considerable other valuable property. The first death in Assyria was that of Mrs. Philo Norton, who, as already mentioned, had come with her husband in the service of Cleaveland Ellis. She died some time durin<* 1839, and was buried upon Mr. Ellis' farm, on section 3. In 1839 also occurred the first birth in the township. It was that of Naomi, daughter of Cleaveland Ellis, who was * There are still at these places strong indications that there is salt in paying quantities there, although there has been no sufficient test to either prove or disprove the theory."], [569, "Residence ofGEO.W. KNAPP, Assyria Tp., Barry Co. ,Mich."], [570, ""], [571, "ASSYRIA TOWNSHIP. 385 When Artemas W. Chapin, a young man, came to the township, in the spring of 1840, the population of Assyria had increased to five families, besides which Stephen Ray mond, a shoemaker, had made a settlement there, but had temporarily retired. The families in question were those of Henry Smith, on section 3 ; Patrick Heffron, on the same section ; Joseph S. Blaisdell, on section 36 ; John S. Van Brunt, on section 2 ; and Cleaveland Ellis, on section 4 ; numbering, all told, 24 persons. Within a few years, however, additions to the infant settlement were made in the Ellis neighborhood by the arrival of David L. Talbot, on section 2 ; Abel and Daniel Baldwin, on section 3 ; Charles G. Baker, on section 2 ; and James Heffron, on the same section. In the latter year Oliver Halsted had bought 320 acres on section 23, and John Rogers a small tract on section 25. Rogers sent three of his sons to the place in the spring of 1837 to make a clearing, but they had only put up their cabin and made a start as pioneers, when their father sent for them to assist him in carrying on a tavern he had taken hold of in Battle Creek, and Assyria knew the Rogers family no more, at least as pioneers. Mr. Knapp had been living in Battle Creek since 1840, and had there been engaged in the business of sign-paint ing and glazing. He relates that he hung the first piece of wall-paper ever hung in Battle Creek, and cut the first pane of glass, and painted the first post-office sign in that village. He also painted for H. A. Goodyear, of Hastings, the first store-sign ever painted in Barry County. He cut all the glass put into the present Barry County court-house, and as a glazier was regarded as one of the most expeditious workmen in Western Michigan. Mr. Baker, who came out from New York in 1842 and bought his land, worked a while for Cleaveland Ellis, and chopped in the mean time seven acres upon his own place. In 1843 he went back to New York, married, and returned with his bride to Michigan. He had put up a cabin on his clearing, but when he brought his bride to her future home it presented itself in a far from inviting condition. The cabin had neither window nor door. It did have a stick chimney, a mud hearth, and a floor of rough ash boards. The rain, however, had flowed in a stream into the cabin, disarranged the flooring, and covered it with mud, besides giving a generally dismal appearance to the rude interior. As the young wife stood on the threshold, she was appalled at the cheerless prospect, and cried aloud, \" For pity's sake, is this to be my home?\" After he settled in Assyria he walked many a day to Battle Creek and back to earn 51-50 for a day's labor at his trade, and esteemed himself lucky in being able to do so. His skill as a glazier was such that he was called from his clearing to Battle Creek to win a wager made to the effect that he could set 1020 lights of glass in ten hours, the field of operations to be Ward's factory, then being erected in that village. He walked to the village before breakfast, began his task at seven o'clock, and by eleven had set 540 lights. The party of the opposition, seeing that he was certain to lose the bet, refused to furnish any more glass, and the performance therefore came abruptly to an end. Speaking now of her early experience as the wife of a pioneer, Mrs. Baker says : \" As forbidding as my home looked, I recollect it as a place where I took much comfort after all, and, although many a meal Avas simply dry bread and salt, we were philosophers in those days and thanked God matters were no worse.\" Provisions were scarce at times because they were not to be had short of a two or three days' journey. Generally, however, Cleaveland Ellis had supplies, which he dealt out to all comers. Nearly every settler, too, could find work with cash pay at Mr. Ellis' when a little money was needed ; and needed it was sorely by many a pioneer while waiting to get his crops to market. Mr. Knapp's house was in dense timber, and to it, from the Bellevue and Hastings road, there was not even a path through the forest. Nearing his home by the shortest route, he would invariably call out to his wife, so that on hearing her response he would know that he was close to his house. Without taking this precaution he was as liable to pass on and lose himself in the woods as he was to find his cabin door ; indeed, he did more than once pass his house, and found considerable difficulty in making his way back to it. Before he was quite ready to move to his shanty from Battle Creek he went over to the marsh on section 26, and cut hay enough to winter his cow, but when he went to haul it home some one had been before him and carried it off. As there was no more hay to cut, he had to sacri fice the straw in his bedtick to save the cow from starving until he could earn money to buy better feed for her. The marsh spoken of was a popular resort for early settlers when seeking food for their cattle. Joseph Blaisdell's first near neighbor was Stephen Ray mond, before mentioned, who, in 1837, made a settlement upon the south line of the township, on section 34, where, besides clearing his land, he plied the trade of a shoemaker whenever occasion required his services. Another early mechanic in that neighborhood was one Wample, a black smith, who set up a shop on section 20, on the line of the Bellevue and Hastings road, about 1840. His stay was, however, not a long one, and when he disappeared no one knew whither. About 1840 two settlers named Eaton and Button made commencements upon section 14, but did not tarry a great while, Eaton selling out to Mathew Mulvaney and his son James. Then came Abel Giles to section 20. Russell Hartom to section 25, Oliver Martin, Daniel Mil ler, Henry Wilbur, and Richard Wilbur. Among the settlers who came in shortly aster Mr. Knapp were Samuel P. Tuttle (who sold his place to M. W. Thomp son), Lebbeus Hodgman, John Cronk, Hiram Tripp (called Big Tripp, with Avhom came T. H. Bartram, now living on section 34), Edwin Wilbur, John Wilbur, John H. Keith, G. P. Stevens, A. W. Wilcox, S. H. Young, and, later, Henry Hare. Mr. Wample, the blacksmith, has al ready been mentioned. He bought 20 acres of land of Abel Giles on section 26, and after he had built his house and shop and put down a well he found that they were all within the bounds of a north-and-south road which had been The persons just named were in the neighborhood wheu George W. Knapp made a settlement in April, 1843, upon 120 acres on section 26, which he had purchased in 1836. 4'J"], [572, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 386 TOWNSHIP TRAGEDIES. surveyed, but not opened. When it was opened the com missioners accommodatingly allowed the shop, house, and well to stay where they were, and carried the highway around them. A tragic love-story marks the early history of Assyria, and indicates that the rough experience of pioneering did not entirely eradicate the more delicate feelings of le grande passion. James Evans, of the adjoining town of Pennfield, fell madly in love with Betsey Blaisdell, of Assyria, and courted her with a persistency deserving abundant suc cess. She looked, however, with much disfavor upon his suit, and upon his visit to her father's house some time in 1842 refused point-blank to marry him, although he im plored and prayed her to have him. He lodged that night in Mr. Blaisdell's house, and, under the crushing influence of a hopeless love, cut his throat with Mr. Blaisdell's razor. Although he was then snatched by a surgeon from the jaws of death, he never recovered from the hurt, and, after lingering a few months, died. Another pioneer blacksmith of the township was D. W. Ellis, who came to Assyria in July, 1844, to work for his brother Cleaveland, on whose place he soon set up a black smith-shop. The next comer to the Ellis neighborhood was Benjamin Jones, who occupied land upon section 9 in 1847, being followed in 1848 by his brother, Richard, previously (from 1838) a resident of Hillsdale County, who still lives on section 9 in Assyria. During Mr. Jones' first year in Assyria he cleared, with the help of his seventeen-year-old son, 60 acres of land, and put in 50 acres of wheat. Charles Davy also came to section 9 in 1849, and soon afterwards A. G. Kent and J. B. Tuckerman_settled in the same neighborhood. In 1847, James Tompkins made a settlement upon section 21 with his sons, John, James, and George. His nearest neighbors were Jacob Hartom, a half-mile east, and Mathew Harvey eighty rods south. In 1849 another of his sons, Cornelius W., located himself on the same section. In 1845, Russell Hartom was accidentally killed at a \" raising,\" and later Mathew Mulvaney was the victim of a fatal runaway accident while driving home from Battle Creek. In 1858 a man by the name of Fox was killed by a falling tree, Augustus Ford was thrown from a wagon load of wood in 1865 and killed, a tree killed a Mr. Coats in 1877, and in 1878 Henry Sackett was gored to death by a bull, and Mary Tasker, a demented person, hung herself. In 1844, G. P. Stevens came to the township on a pros pecting-tour, and bought 80 acres of land on section 23. He came to occupy the place permanently in 1846, having meanwhile caused a tract of 20 acres to be cleared on his lot. Part of the work was done by Elisha Andrus, who lived on the clearing until Stevens came, in 1846, and then bought Abel Giles' farm, on section 26. Stevens' neigh bors were Knapp, Amos L. Parkhurst, J. H. Keith (a car penter), Calvin Austin (two miles north, and the nearest neighbor in that direction), Abel Giles, Elijah Mills, John Cronk, Lebbeus Hodgman, and Phineas Walker. A CELEBRATED CASE. Assyria had its celebrated case in 1848, when not only the township, but the county, was much agitated over the stealing of the body of Joseph S. Blaisdell from the South Assyria Cemetery, and the subsequent sensational trial of persons charged with the robbery. Mr. Blaisdell died March 10, 1848, and two days after his burial his grave was found to have been opened and his body stolen. A prompt investigation led to the conclusion that certain medical men of Battle Creek and neighboring places were concerned in the affair, and Mr. Blaisdell's friends accord ingly caused the arrest of three persons charged with having participated in the theft. When Stevens began his pioneering he had to go four miles to a blacksmith's shop in Bellevue whenever he wanted any tinkering done, and more than once he carried his plowshare and tools on his back through the woods to that shop. He started one stormy night for Bellevue to fetch a doctor for his sick child. He reached the doc tor's residence all right, but in coming home he lost his way, got into a swamp, and wandered about until morning, unable to extricate himself. The case came on for a preliminary examination before G. W. Knapp, a justice of the peace of Assyria, and so large was the attendance that he adjourned the case to the school-house, and even that building failed to accommodate half the people who came to the trial. Judge Abner Pratt, of Marshall, appeared as attorney for the prosecution, and John Van Arnam for the defense. A host of wit nesses was examined, and a remarkably sharp display of legal learning was vouchsafed to the spectators. Aster two days' proceedings the prosecution, having failed to make a case, retired from the field defeated. The prisoners were set free, and, although continued efforts were put forth in search of the true offenders and of the dead man's remains, nothing further was ever discovered. In the western portion of the township settlements did not begin at a very early day, nor did they advance rap idly after they did begin, for the reason doubtless that that section was rough, and in some places marshy. Rev. Mr. Rogers, the Methodist preacher, was one of the earliest settlers there, as was also Volney Hyde, who lived on section 18 as early as 1844, and farmed 160 acres. He sold his place to Z. Hyde, whose widow married James B. Norris, an- early comer to Assyria, and still a resident upon the old Hyde place. When George L. Briggs located upon section 6, in April. 1850, there was no settlement in his neighborhood, and none south of him nearer than the Hyde farm. After Briggs came David Miller, J. H. Miller, the Woods, George Bennett, E. T. Telling, to the Wood place; Austin Stanton, Jonathan Mead, and, farther south, W. H. Jewell, at one time county register. SCHOOLS. The residence now occupied by the widow of Cleaveland Ellis was the first framed house built in the township, the year of its erection being 1842, and in that house, in 1843, Lydia Warren, of Verona, taught the pioneer school of Assyria, her scholars being six in number. The first district school, opened for the benefit of the"], [573, "ASSYRIA TOWNSHIP 387 residents of the northwestern portion of the township, was just over the line, in Calhoun County, and in that school house Betsey Blaisdell was one of the earliest teachers. The first school-house built in the towuship stood in school district No. 1, upon section 26. It was a framed structure, and was built in 1844. The early school records, not only of district No. 1, but of the township, have been lost, and it is therefore difficult to give reliable data concerning school matters. Touching district No. 1, however, it may be ob served that it has long ranked high in more respects than one. In its schools eight persons have taught, who ob tained or began their education in the district, while many of its pupils have taught in other localities. Its lyceum or debating society is an intellectual organization, and through energetic encouragement has grown to be an im portant factor in the improvement of the district. In the fall of 1844, Charles G. Baker and Daniel L. Talbot built the first school-house in district No. 2, upon section 2. In that school-house 0. B. Sheldon, of Castleton, taught the first school, and Jane Farnsworth the second. The official school report for 1879 presents the following corner of section 4. The same day a survey was made of a road from the southeast corner of section 36 to the quar ter-post on the south side of section 34. M. S. Brackett surveyed a road beginning at the quarter-post between sec tion 3, in township 1, and section 34, in township 2, and ex tending eastward to the west line of Eaton County ; also a road commencing at a quarter-post between sections 25 and 26, in township 2, running south to the southeast corner of section 26, thence northwesterly to the northwest corner of section 23 ; also a road commencing sixty links south of the quarter-stake between sections 34 and 35, in town ship 2, running thence south on said line to the southwest corner of section 35 ; and still another, beginning at a point nine chains and sixty-one links north of the quarter-stake between sections 9 and 10, running thence south to a point twenty-two chains and thirty-seA'en links south of the north east corner of section 16. The same day another road was run from the northeast coiner of section 30 to a point thirty-seven chains west of the southeast corner of the same section. On the 24th day of January, 1839, a road was laid be tween township 1, range 7, and the town of Pennfield, beginning at the northwest corner of section 3 in Pennfield, and running thence along the lines of sections 3 and 2. On the 15th day of January, 1841, C. Robinson and Cleaveland Ellis, commissioners, laid out a road beginning at the quarter-stake on the east side of section 12, in town ship 1, and running thence west and north to the north west corner of section 10 ; and on the same day another road, beginning at the southwest corner of section 23, in township 2, and running east to the quarter-post on the south side of the section ; thence south 39} degrees east four chains, thence south 49 j degrees east ten chains and fifty-five links. On the 21st of April, 1841, Commissioners Ellis and Collier laid out a road beginning on the base line, twenty chains west of the southeast corner of section 35, township 1, running north to a road on the line of the southeast quarter of section 26. statistics : Number of districts (whole, 6; fractional, 3) 9 \" children of school age 44 3 Average attendance (except from the First Dis- trict, from which there is no report) 349 Value of school property (except the First and Sixth Districts, from which there is no report)..

HIGHWAYS. The highway records of Johnstown township indicate that the first road laid in township 1, range 7, was the one afterwards known as a portion of the BelleA'ue and Hastings road. It was surveyed June 21, 1838, by F. Burgess, the highway commissioners being Cleaveland Ellis and W. P. Bristol. It began at the quarter-post, between sections 9 and 10, passed southeasterly over a part of the Indian trail between Bellevue and Basquon Creek, and terminated on the eastern line of the county, seventy-three links north of the southeast corner of section 25. This road became a much-traveled route, upon which farmers from the north drove to market at Battle Creek. A line of four-horse coaches kept up daily communication over it for a time be tween Battle Creek and Hastings, and two inns were opened on this road, in Assyria. Shortly after 1850 one Osborn, a Baptist preacher, built a tavern of tamarack logs at the centre of the township, and leased it to John Loomis, who carried it on for a while, and then gave way to Seth Davis. The present hotel at the Centre occupies the site of the \" Tamarack Tavern,\" and was built by Edward Cox, who was for a time its landlord. Jonathan Park likewise built a tavern of maple logs on the same road, half a mile north of the Centre, in 1857, and called it the Maple House. Its career ended under the proprietor- Aster 1842 road surveys were made rapidly, and from that time on to 1850 the highway commissioners were actively engaged in providing for the pressing needs of set tlers, and especially of the new-comers, who lived in the woods without decent highways by which to reach or leave home. As labor on the highways was about the only work by which settlers could earn money, which came from the tax upon non-resident land owners, they were eager to see roads opened, and to work for even the small pittance they received. THE MAIL IN ASSYRIA. While township 1 was yet apart of Johnstown a post-office was ordered to be established in it, in accordance with the efforts of Cleaveland Ellis. Mr. Ellis was to be the post master, and on being requested to choose for the office a name not possessed by any office in the State, hit upon Assyria. The mail-route between Bellevue and Hastings passed via Ellis Prairie, where Mr. Ellis lived, before 1840, and by furnishing a dinner and horse-feed to the mail-carrier Mr. Ellis had his mail brought to him from Bellevue. Presently it occurred to him that his neighbors ought also to have mail conveniences, and so it was that in 1841 or 1842 he obtained the establishment of the office called Assyria. ship of George W. Foster, a few years afterwards. On the 21st of June, 1S38, a road was surveyed from the base-line, seven chains west of the quarter-stake on the south side of section 31, northeasterly to the uortheast"], [574, "388 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Mr. Ellis retained the office until 1847, when he turned it over to Calvin P. White, who kept it until 1855. His successor was Richard Jones, and from Mr. Jones it passed successively to A. G. Kent, James Potter, Henry Sackett, Cornelius W. Tompkins, and others until March 11, 1874, when the present incumbent, Mrs. Philena Abbey, received her commission as the successor of Amos W. Bowen. them two years, when the enterprise was abandoned. The next store was opened at the Centre by Jonathan Park, who had for some time the only store in town. That store, now kept by Mrs. Abbey, and B. T. Kent's store, also at the Centre, are the only temples of trade of which the town ship can boast. TOWNSHIP ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. A second post-office in Assyria was established on the Bellevue and Hastings mail-route in 1850, and called South Assyria. Samuel H. Young, who Avas instrumental in the creation of the office, was appointed postmaster, and retained the place until 1858, when it was transferred to George W. Knapp. Mr. Knapp was the postmaster until the office was abolished, in 1860. A legislative act approved Feb. 29, 1844, divided the town ship of Johnstown and gave a separate organization to towns 1 and 2, in range 7 west, under the name of Assyria, which was chosen because the post-office in township 1 was thus called. The first town-meeting was held at the house of Cleaveland Ellis, April 1, 1844, and at that meeting forty three votes were polled. Cleaveland Ellis was chosen mod erator, David Baldwin, John F. Fuller, Henry Mallory, and Orin Ball inspectors of election, and John S. Van Brunt clerk. The first mail-carrier through Assyria was Calvin Sailer, who rode on horseback and carried the mail once a week. Later a line of daily stages was put on the road between Bellevue and Hastings, and then there was a daily mail. Travel over the route was considerable by both stages and freight-teams, but the period of such busy traffic was not of extended duration. The following is a full list of the persons chosen as officers at the first township-meeting : Supervisor, Cleave land Ellis; Clerk, John S. Van Brunt; Treasurer, C. P. White ; Assessors, Peter Downs and Joseph S. Blaisdell ; Justices of the Peace, Joseph S. Blaisdell, Samuel Andrus, Peter Downs, and Peter Dillin ; Highway Commissioners, Henry Wilbur, Charles G. Baker, and Eldredge Austin ; Inspectors of Schools, Joseph S. Blaisdell and Archelaus Harwood ; Directors of the Poor, Henry Mallory and C. P. White; Constables, Charles Dodge, Henry Dean, Ed ward Cox, Harlow Lapham ; Overseers of Highways, Cal vin Austin in District No. 1, David Talbot in No. 2, Cleaveland Ellis in No. 3, Volney Hyde in No. 4, Henry Wilbur in No. 5, Rufus Brooks in No. 6, A. S. Quick in No. 7, and Joseph Badcock in No. 8 ; Poundmaster, C. P. White. PHYSICIANS. In 1844 Assyria received a settler named Rogers, who straightway upon his arrival introduced himself as a Meth odist Episcopal preacher, and in the Baker school-house, in district No. 2, conducted public worship every Sunday for some time. Subsequently he forsook Methodism, embraced Spiritualism, preached that doctrine, and in a short time announced himself as a clairvoyant doctor. He depended also upon herbs to effect his cures, and was quite a popular physician. He established a considerable practice, and carried it on profitably in Assyria until his death. Dr. Archelaus Harwood, of Maple Grove, was, however, the favorite physician for miles around in the pioneer days, and in the southern portion of the county was knoAvn and esteemed of all men. \"\u2014 At the same meeting $200 were appropriated for contin gent expenses, and $50 for the support of the poor. The names of those chosen annually from 1845 to 1880 to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, aud justices of the peace are herewith given : *r. After \"Dr.\" Rogers' demise there was no resident phy sician in Assyria until Dr. Youngs came, iu 1858. Dr. Youngs retired after a practice of two years, and then there was a hiatus in Assyria's medical history until about 1876, when Dr. Chase located at the Centre. He remained about a year, and was followed in rapid succession by Drs. Delano, Sessions, and Armour, neither of whom stayed much more than a year. Dr. J. I. Baker, the only physician now in the township, located at the Centre in the spring of 1880. SUPERVISORS. 1845, C. Ellis; 1846-47, D. L. Talbot; 1848-49, C. G. Baker ; 1850, P. Mulvaney; 1851, C.

THE FREE-AVILL BAPTIST CHURCH The Free-Will Baptist minister who accompanied Joseph S. Blaisdell to Assyria in 1836, as before mentioned, and who for a year conducted occasional public worship at Blais dell's house and in other houses across the county-line, was undoubtedly the first preacher to hold religious services in the township. Rev. Zerah Hoyt, a Presbyterian missionary stationed at Hastings, preached in Assyria at an early day, and in 1844 the Rev. Mr. Rogers, a resident in the west ern part of the town, preached a few Methodist sermons in the school-house of district No. 2. The first religious body in the township was a Free-Will Baptist Church, which was formed through the efforts of Joseph S. Blaisdell, and which, during his life, held regular services in the school-house of district No. 1. Upon his death, in 1848, the organization also lost its life, and was no more heard of. Just previous to Mr. Blaisdell's death, Rev. Elijah Cook, a Free-Will Baptist, preached at the school-house, and held a series of revival-meetings, the success of which promised much for the future of the church. SOUTH ASSYRIA METHODIST CLASS. About 1847 or 1848 the South Assyria Methodist Epis copal Class was organized in the school-house of district No. 1, and since that time services have been regularly maintained. The class is now on the Pennfield Circuit, in charge of Rev. Mr. Daniels. Daniel Sackett is the class leader aud Joseph Grinnell superintendent of the Sunday school. A Methodist Episcopal class was organized at the Centre about 1S54, and after a few years was joined to the South Assyria Class. This class was formed about 1855, and until 1866 wor shiped in the school-house on section 6. In the year named a church edifice was erected close by, and is still in use. The class membership is about 20, the leader is Charles Clark, and the trustees G. W. Briggs, Jonathan Stevens, Wesley Clark, and J. B. Norris. Connected with the EARLY JURORS.

Eleven children blessed their union, of whom the fifth is Richard, who first saw the light in Richfield. March 15, 1807. His earlier boyhood days were employed in schooling and farming, and at the age of twelve he journeyed afoot to Franklin Co., Mass., loaded with a ten-pound pack, and in Leverett, his father's native town, tarried six years. THE ADVENT CHRISTIAN CHURCH. The Advent Christian Church at Assyria Centre was organized in the summer of 1871, in Tompkins' Grove, by Elder Philip Holler, and had at the outset a membership of 17. A. Quimby was chosen elder, and A. W. Bowen deacon. Elder Holler, of Nashville, preached once in two weeks for about a year, and for five years after that he and Elder Berr}' managed between them to supply the church with preaching every Sunday. For about two years, to August, 1879, dependence was placed upon occasional sup plies, and at the time noted Elder A. M. Smith, of Prai rieville, now preaching at the Centre once a fortnight, began his term of service. The Centre school-house served as a house of worship until the summer of 1874, when a church was built just east of the Centre. The membership is now about 20, the deacon is A. W. Bowen, and the trustees are E. H. Fox, P. Holler, Chester Berry, Augustus Saekett, N. P. Hall, and A. W. Wilcox. At the age of eighteen he returned to New York to live with his stepfather, who agreed to give him six weeks' schooling each year for three years, but the schooling had amounted at the end of the three years to but tAventy days all told. Sept. 26, 1830, Richard married Amelia, daught er of Benjamin Tuckerman, of Richfield, and directly aster that the young couple moved to a farm in Oswego County, where they stopped four years, and after a further four years' sojourn in Otsego County, setting their faces towards the West, entered Hillsdale Co., Mich., in September, 1838, as members of the grand army of Michigan pioneers. They battled bravely for existence, and, although sorely beset by hardships and privations, they heroically overcame every obstacle, and wrought a happy home out of the waste of wilderness. Illustrative of the scarcity of money in those days and the long journeys necessary to reach a market, Mr. Jones relates how he made a trip to Toledo with forty bushels of wheat, Avhich he sold at fifty cents per bushel, half trade and half cash. He was gone nine days, traveled seventy-five miles, and when he got home had, in place of the wheat he took away, one barrel of salt, one pair of geese, fifty pounds of nails, and twenty-five cents in money. Even twenty-five cents in money was almost impossible to get for farm truck at home. Mr. Jones says he more than once begged a Jonesville merchant to give him just two shillings in money on a trade in butter and eggs, so that he could pay the postage on a letter which had lain in the post-office perhaps a week, but the merchant's heart was adamant, and the two shillings were not forthcoming. THE PROTESTANT METHODIST CHURCH. This church, which is also located at Assyria Centre, was organized Sept. 26, 1873, by Bev. William Kelly, in the Centre school-house. A revision of the class-book in 1876, when a church edifice was built at the Centre, certi fies that Jacob Hartom was then the class-leader, and Rev. J. H. Webb the preacher in charge. Mr. Hartom is still the class-leader ; the preacher in charge is Rev. John Mc- Phail, and the Sunday-school superintendent W. H. Pres cott. Preaching is supplied once in two weeks. The trustees are George W. Tompkins, Thomas Tasker, Charles C. Gage, Colemau Russell, and Jacob Hartom. ASSYRIA GRANGE, No. 128: Mr. Jones remained with his family in Hillsdale County until 1848, when in September they removed to section 9, Assyria township, Barry Co., and there, renewing their pioneer experiences, have resided to this day. The first year of his settlement in Assyria, Mr. Jones cleared, with the assistance of his eighteen-year-old son, sixty acres, and put in fifty acres of wheat. He bought at first two hun dred and twenty acres, and these he increased within three years to upward\u00ab of five hundred. So energetically did he devote himself to the business of agriculture that out of the products of his lands during the first three years he paid the purchase money for the entire five hundred acres. was organized during the winter of 1873, in A. W. Chapin's log house, with about 30 members. William W. Cole was chosen Master ; A. G. Kent, Sec. ; D. W. Ellis, O. ; J. R. Powers, L. ; Leroy Cummings, Treas. The Masters of the grange have been William W. Cole, C. W. Taylor, A. W. Chapin. The active membership is now about 20. The officers are A. W. Chapin, M. ; D. W. Ellis, O. ; William W. Cole, L. ; Augustus Dow, S. ; Bichard Jones, Treas. ; O. B. Spalding, Chaplain ; Mrs. A. W. Chapin, Ceres ; Mrs. W. W. Cole, Pomona ; and Mrs. Leroy Cummings, Flora. Mr. Jones has served as supervisor of Assyria township, as postmaster from 1855 to 1863, was chosen to the lower house of the Legislature by the Republicans of his district in 1867, and has at various times filled offices of local trust. A life-long Republican until lately, he affiliates now with the National Greenback party. In religion he is independ ent and liberal, and holds fast to the creed that \" if we do right here, it will be all right there.\" BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. RICHARD JONES. About the year 1790, Jonathan Jones and Polly, his wife, \u2014 both natives of Massachusetts, \u2014 passed from New Eng land to Otsego Co., N. Y., and in the town of Richfield entered upon the work of Western pioneering. There they spent the remainder of their lives, Jonathan dying in 1816, Amelia Tuckerman Jones, his wife, was born in Rich field, Otsego Co., N. Y., April 1, 1800.

Her father took an active part in the incidents attendant upon the Shay's Rebellion in New England, and later served as captain and major in the war of 1812. He died in New York in 1854, his wife having preceded him by thirty-four years. A. Goodyear, of Hastings, the first store-sign painted in Barry County, hung the first piece of wall-paper hung in Battle Creek, painted the first post-office sign and cut the first pane of glass in Battle Creek, and afterwards set the window-lights in the second court-house built in Barry County. In February, 1843, he became a pioneer in As syria township, upon land in section 26, which he had lo cated May 19, 1836, and wrestled energetically with the hardships and privations of a pioneer life and grinding pov erty. To earn money for the necessaries of life, he walked eleven miles to Battle Creek many a morning and back again at night with twelve shillings obtained by labor at his trade as glazier. Mr. and Mrs. Jones' children have been five in number, of whom three are living : George T., who was born July 16, 1831, lives in Colorado; Flora T., born March 9, 1833, died Feb. 4, 1879; Mary A., born June 14, 1838, is now Mrs. Henry Talmage, of Bellevue; Fannie E., born June 9, 1841, is Mrs. George McCollum, of Van Buren County; Henry B., born March 28, 1847, died in 1847. Mr. and Mrs. Jones will on the 26th of September, 1880, celebrate their golden wedding, \u2014 the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage-day, \u2014 and towards that event they as well as a host of friends are now looking with pleasurable antici pations, for the incident will be a joyous one, marked by a large gathering of guests from far and near, and signalized as a memorable occasion in the history of human life. Mr. Knapp's history is a portion of the history of Assyria township. He has for thirty-seven years been closely identi fied with town affairs, and ranks as one of the town's leading citizens. He has served as supervisor one term, justice of the peace three terms, notary public eight years, postmaster at South Assyria, and in the business of laying out roads at an early day performed valuable and important services. He was the third of four sons, each of whom is living at an advanced age, viz., William, aged seventy-nine; Charles H., seventy-seven ; George W., seventy-three ; and Julius, sixty-three. Mrs. Lucy Knapp was born in Cherry Valley, N. Y., March 29, 1810, her father, Jonathan Tripp, hav ing been born in Dutchess Co., N. Y., in 1769, and her mother (Anna Suscomb) in Otsego County, 1781. Jona than Tripp was a farmer throughout his life, and died in Assyria, Dec. 25, 1867, aged ninety-eight years and six months. The last ten years of his life were passed at his daughter's home, and to the hour of his death he was bright, active, and cheerful. His wife died in Wisconsin in 1856, aged seventy-five. Mr. and Mrs. Knapp have been married nearly fifty years, and March 1, 1882, will celebrate their golden wedding. Their children have been Sophia, born Nov. 4, 1835, and died in infancy; Jared M., born Nov. 16, 1837, and now living at home on the old farm; Priscilla H., born Feb. 9, 1840, and now Mrs. B. F. Bullis, of Johnstown ; Harriet F., born July 21, 1842, and now Mrs. Alonzo Lamkin, of Mason Co., Mich. ; Mary E., born March 12, 1845, and died June, 1848 ; Emma O, born June 8, 1849, and now Mrs. Joseph H. Parmelee, of Spencerport, N. Y. Jared M., the second child of this worthy couple, electing to remain with his parents rather than marry, has never left the parental roof (save for a brief season), and still remains to comfort and cheer with his presence and labors the declining years of his father and mother. He was a pioneer student in the State Agricul tural College at Lansing in 1S37, and passed there a period of two years and a half, from which experience he emerged with much credit. Early in life he evinced a strong sym pathy for the life of a student, and, although he has always been engaged and is still engaged in active farm labor, he has devoted much time to profitable study and mental im proA'ement. He taught school three terms in Barry and Calhoun Counties, takes an earnest interest in literary mat ters, owns a fine library of valuable books, is well known as a strong and intelligent debater in the lyceums of his township, and occupies, in short, a place in social existence of which he may justifiably feel proud. GEORGE W. KNAPP. In the year 1836, George W. Knapp located a tract of land in Assyria township, and since 1843 he has resided upon the place which he wrested from the wilderness thirty seven years ago, and now, in the stead of that wilderness, rests his gaze upon a beautiful home and the broad acres of one of the finest farms in Barry County. He was born in Litchfield Co., Conn., July 21, 1807. His father, Jared, was born in Stamford, Conn., July 27, 1749, and died in Wyoming Co., N. Y., in the fall of 1848, aged ninety-nine years. Jared Knapp entered the service of his country upon the outbreak of the Revolution, in 1776 ; served first as private, then as orderly sergeant, and eventu ally as captain ; was with Gen. Washington in all his cam paigns, and after a military career of seven years and seven months returned to the walks of peace. At the age of ninety-three he had a third set of teeth ; at the age of sixty obtained his second sight, and so retained it that up the age of ninety he used no glasses, and to the day of his death was hearty and active. He was much in demand in the late years of his life as a public orator, and attracted crowds from far and near to hear his public recitals of the stirring times of the Revolution, through which he passed. His wife, Catherine Baldwin, was born in Derby, Conn., in 1769, and died in Hinsdale, N. Y., in 1853, aged eighty four. Three of Mr. Jared Knapp's sisters lived to the re spective ages of ninety-seven, ninety-nine, and one hundred, and illustrated, as did their brother, the truth of the asser tion that they came of a long-lived race. George W. Knapp spent his earlier years at home in Wyoming County, and March 1, 1832, married Lucy, daughter of Jonathan and Anna Tripp. He had been in boyhood apprenticed to a painter and glazier, and after farming in Wyoming County until 1836 removed to Buf falo, N. Y., where he pushed forward in business as a house, ship, and ornamental painter. There he remained until 1840, when he moved westward to Battle Creek, and re sumed his trade.

On the north lies the township of Hastings ; on the south is that of Johnstown ; on the western side is Hope ; while the eastern boundary is the western line of Maple Grove. It is designated in the United States survey as township No. 2 north, in range 8 west, and was erected as an inde pendent civil township in 1849. Even at the late date just named a very large part of its territory was still covered by the primeval forest, and comparatively few clearings suggested the presence of settlers. The lands of Baltimore are watered by numerous lakes and streams. The most important body of water is Clear Lake, a part of which occupies portions of sections 32 and 33. Mud Lake lies on section 21, and a portion of Long Lake on section 1, while the area of sections 2 and 18 is par tially covered by smaller sheets of water. High Bank Creek enters the township on the south line of section 35, and, flowing northeasterly, leaves it on the east line of section 12. Cedar Creek enters on the west line of section 30, runs northeasterly, and passes out on the north line of sec tion 4. Both these streams furnish excellent water-power. The surface of Baltimore is varied. The southeast por tion is le\\Tel, while in the south there are also many tracts of level land. Numerous hills and abrupt elevations are to be seen in the northern and northeastern portions, while the centre presents a gently rolling aspect. Elm, ash, maple, oak, and hickory are the prevailing forest trees. Very little pine or hemlock is found, but the tamarack flourishes in the swamps and marshes. The list of soils includes clay, sand, and gravel, the north being sandy, while in the south clay and loam prevail. In the west is found a preponderance of clay. The swampy land is confined chiefly to sections 9, 10, and 30. The lands of Baltimore are well adapted to the growth of both corn and wheat. The various fruits peculiar to the climate also abound, though peach-trees do not produce very large crops. Apples of superior quality are raised in large quantities, and a well-kept orchard is to be found on every farm. The farmers of the township are within convenient reach of both the city of Hastings and the village of Nashville, at which places and at intervening points on the Grand River Valley Railroad their products can easily be shipped to the Eastern markets. \u2022 By E.

Its lands bad been purchased from the government as early as 1837, but for five years afterwards remained in their primitive condition. In 1842, Andrew Kelley and Thomas Dowling, brothers in-law, came from Baltimore, Md., and chose a farm on the above section, which they at once began to clear. Mr. Dowling is described as an eccentric character, whose previous life had ill fitted him to endure the privations of a pioneer. He was a man of intelligence and education, who affected the free-and-easy ways of the settlers, but exagger ated them so as often to appear ridiculous. He spent much money in improvements, which were never of practical value, and at one period of his pioneer career evinced some political aspirations, which were very promptly checked by his townsmen. He speedily tired of his laborious and mo notonous life and sought diversion in California, where he died a few years later. Very graphic descriptions are given of the raisingof Messrs. Kelley and Dowling's log house. Several ladies accompanied their husbands to the raising, and as the distance rendered a return home the same day inconvenient, most of them remained over-night. An ample repast of game, potatoes, and other substantial food was spread before the laborers, who used jack-knives for table-knives and splinters for forks, while pieces of clean bark from a neighboring tree did service as plates. The bestowal of the assembled guests at night was a matter of some difficulty. However, as the new house had an upper story, or half-story, the men of the company occupied that apartment, while the ladies were cheerfully accorded the right to the more convenient room below. The bedding of the two families was fairly appor tioned among the numerous guests, and after some incidents at once amusing and annoying, all slumbered peacefully and departed the following morning for their distant homes. Bardsley R. Blanchard, the next pioneer in order of settlement, came from Niagara Co., N. Y., in 1845, and purchased 80 acres on section 28. It had not been im proved, aud Mr. Blanchard found it necessary at once to erect a log house for the comfort of his family, which con sisted of his wife and six children. Meanwhile, Mr. Kelley tendered them the hospitality of his primitive abode, on section 15, and a pilgrimage of three miles was made by Mr. Bianchard every day while constructing his own simple habitation. Mr. Blanchard at once began the work of clearing his land, but made slow progress, and ultimately removed to Berrien County, having sold his farm to Wil liam Manning. His present residence is Rutland, whence, though now eighty-five years old, he makes occasional pil grimages to the homes of his old neighbors in Baltimore. SECTION 35. SECTION 36. The earliest wedding in the township was celebrated at the house of Mr. Blanchard, his daughter, Miss Caroline, being united to Mr. Elkanah Morford. The ceremony was performed by Henry P. Cheney, then clothed with authority as a justice of the peace. Very near the home of Mr. Blanchard occurred the first death in Baltimore, that of a Mrs. Farr, the date of which is not remembered. Joseph Judd, formerly of Niagara Co., N. Y., located in 1846 upon 40 acres on section 28. He built the tra ditional log house, but made little progress in clearing his land, and ere long removed from the township. His pres ent residence is Battle Creek. He was chosen as inspector of election at the first township-meeting, and was one of the few voters present on that occasion. Eli D. Eaton, a former resident of Huron Co., Ohio, became a settler in 1849, on the northwest quarter of sec tion 12. This he obtained on a land- warrant given him for services in the Mexican war. He remained with Joseph Judd while building a shanty, aster which he de voted his energies to clearing and improving his land. His progress was slow at first, but ultimately a large and productive farm was the result of his industry. J. Denton Hodges was at this date his nearest neighbor. Mr. Eaton still resides on his farm, which has been increased, however, to 185 acres. Mr. Kelley and his family remained some years after, but ultimately followed their relative to the Golden State. A child was born to Mr. and Mrs. Kelley soon after their settlement, whose birth was the earliest in Baltimore. The year 1849 brought also J. Denton Hodges, who entered 160 acre3 on section 9, and James Norton, who acquired 160 acres on the same section by means of a 60"], [584, "394 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. land-warrant issued to him for his Mexican war services. Mr. Hodges did not until a year later effect any improve ment upon his land, and he subsequently sold out and removed from the township. Mr. Norton remained until the outbreak of the civil war, when he entered the military service of the United States, in which he lost his life. widoAv survives, and resides with her son Gilbert, whose birthplace was Baltimore. He is the present occupant of the farm. John H. Day, a native of St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., came, in 1850, from the Buckeye State to Baltimore, and pur chased of Solomon M. Allen 80 acres on section 12. It was a wilderness on his arrival, with no settlers immediately near. Mr. Day became a member of the household of Eli D. Eaton, and remained so until his marriage, in 1854, when he removed to his own place, having during the in terval erected a log house. He ran in debt for his land, but worked hard at anything he could find to do until he liquidated his debt. He meanwhile hired the clearing of 14 acres, which was completed in 1852. Mr. Day has been largely identified with the development of the town ship, and held many official positions in it. He still resides on his original purchase. Another pioneer of 1849 was John Houghtalin, who was originally from Livingston Co., N. Y., and later from Battle Creek, Mich. He located himself upon 80 acres on the southeast corner of section 2, to which he secured a title two or three years later. Eli D. Eaton was at that time his nearest neighbor. Mr. Houghtalin was made wel come by Mr. Kelley, and at once began the erection of a framed house, after which his time was devoted to clearing and improving his land. His death occurred in August, 1867, his widow surviving until 1871. Two sons, George and Charles W., are residents of the township, and Henry is the present popular sheriff of the county. Pliny McOmber and William and Porter Harwood had arrived a year before the advent of Mr. Day, and had erected a saw-mill on section 9. The year following, Dar win McOmber came, and purchased Mr. Harwood's interest. Pliny McOmber subsequently returned to Maple Grove, his former residence, and Darwin assumed entire control of the mill business, which he conducted until 1875. This was the earliest saw-mill in Baltimore, and sawed much of the timber used in the construction of the first homes of that township. I. F. Hodges entered, in 1850, 160 acres on section 2, upon which he settled a year later. This he subsequently sold, when he removed to 80 acres upon section 9. This he improved, but eventually departed from Baltimore and made Hastings his residence. Two of the representative pioneers of 1850 were J. L. Fox and B. C. Cramer, the former of whom came from Kent County and purchased 100 acres on section 21. His residence in Baltimore was brief. Aster making a small improvement he sold to Jas. S. Tuxbury, and removed to Grand Rapids. Mr. Cramer purchased 187 acres on section 2, to which he removed the following fall. He converted this wilderness into an attractive and valuable estate, upon which he still resides. In connection with the mill Darwin McOmber owned 80 acres of land, which he cleared, and on which his present residence stands. In the beginning his nearest neighbor, James Judd, was two and a half miles away, both Kelley and Dowling having left the township. At this time, and for several years after, there was no school nearer than three miles. Mr. McOmber now has an estate of 640 acres, lying on sections 8, 9, 10, and 16, a large portion of which is cultivated. Gilbert Striker, a native of Dutchess Co., N. Y., removed in 1818 to Wayne Co., N. Y., and in 1835 to Michigan, where he found a home in Jackson County. In 1850 seven brothers entered 316 acres of land on section 3, in Balti more, which was subsequently purchased by Gilbert of the remaining owners, upon which he located in 1851. It was entirely unimproved. John Baker, another pioneer from Ohio, made his advent in 1S50, and located land on section 11, but never resided upon it. He erected a plank house on section 9, and occupied his time in hunting, varied by occasional labor among the settlers. His home was afterwards con sumed by fire, and it is related that Mr. Baker, for the pur pose of securing a can of powder as well as averting an ex plosion, rushed through the flames and obtained the dan gerous package. I. F. Hodges had already made a beginning on his land, and his house sheltered Mr. Striker's family until material was prepared for the erection of a cabin. They removed to this latter structure during the spring, and the mild and balmy air of that season made them unconscious of the want of doors or windows to their home. Forty acres of the standing timber on the land was girdled and cleared of undergrowth the first year, and with the help of three yoke of oxen 30 acres were prepared for and sown with wheat. Mr. Striker cut a portion of the State road from Battle Creek to Hastings, which was after wards the chief highway of the township. The latter village was the nearest point from which supplies were obtained. \u25a0> Samuel Weeks, though not the first settler, made the first clearing in Baltimore. He entered at tbe land-office in Kalamazoo, as early as 1838, 200 acres on section 29, being at this time a resident of Calhoun County. The same year he chopped an acre on his land, after which it remained undisturbed until 1851. He then hired a few acres cleared and a log house erected, to which he removed in 1852, and began in earnest the labor of improving his land. Guy R. Dursce was at this period the nearest set tler, and the most convenient school-house was on section 28, to which Mr. Weeks' son made a daily pilgrimage. Early preaching was held in this school building, where ministers from the more thickly settled townships officiated. James S. Tuxbury, E. B. Warner, and Dayton Hall were all pioneers of 1852. Mr. Tuxbury located first upon On Mr. Striker's farm was set apart, in 1851, the first burial-place in the township. Mr. John Houghtalin hav ing lost a son in April of that year, Messrs. Striker, Hough talin, and Day selected the ground in question, and the child was buried there. It was afterwards neatly inclosed, and was legally selected by the township as a cemetery.

His widow still re sides on the homestead with her son. George Roush, a former resident of Huron Co., Ohio, located during the year 1853 upon 120 acres on section 11. He engaged at once in the preliminary labor of house-building, meanwhile occupying a framed cabin near by, which had been vacated by Michael Holes. He sowed his first clearing of 14 acres with wheat, and reaped a boun tiful harvest. Mr. Roush, in 1879, changed his location for land upon section 11, his present residence. Guy R. Durfee, an emigrant from St. Joseph County in 1852, settled upon 80 acres on section 28, which was pur chased of P. Y. Baldwin, who had previously built a log house upon it. James L. Fox was already located upon 100 acres on section 21, and was tho nearest settler. Mr. Durfee, finding a more eligible site upon section 28, changed his location, and in 1855 removed to his present home, on section 14, which embraces 100 acres, less 1, given to the Methodist Episcopal Church as a parsonage. John Mer shon, a former resident of Ross, Kalamazoo Co., located, in 1852, upon 80 acres on section 19, which he cleared and made productive. He died in the township in 1866, and his son became the owner of the property. Another emigrant from the State of Pennsylvania was Robert Bliven, who came from Bradford County to the township in the summer of 1853. He chose 89 acres of uncleared land upon section 6, and enjoyed the hospitality of Richard Stilson, of Hastings, while preparing for the establishment of his family on his own purchase. On that purchase he still resides. We have now noticed the principal pioneers of the first twelve years of Baltimore's history, and must greatly cur tail our remarks regarding later comers. Among the promi nent settlers of Baltimore from the close of 1853 until the outbreak of the Rebellion were Joseph Gaskill, of Monroe Co., N. Y., who located on section 7, in 1854, and died there in 1876 ; A. N. Warner, of Cayuga Co., N. Y., who settled on section 36, the same year, worked as a cooper, opened the first grocery in Baltimore, and finally gave his life for his country in the war for the Union ; Robert Haynes, of Summit Co., Ohio, who chose a home on section 8 in 1854, but moved to section 18 in 1857, where he still resides; John Harrington, of Onondaga Co., N. Y., who occupied, in 1855, a fractional quarter previously purchased by his brother, on which he still lives ; Peter Jendreau, of Canada, who located on section 28, in 1855 ; William Henry, of Hillsdale Co., Mich., who was killed by accident while chopping, in 1870; Aaron Durfee, who came from Oakland County in 1856, and four years later located on section 16, where he still Yives; Robert T. Garrison, of Tompkins Co., N. Y., who settled on section 5 in 1856, where he died in 1867 ; D. C. Sanborn, who came from New Hampshire in 1859, located on section 21, and has gained much fame as a breeder of blooded hunting dogs, some of which have won numerous prizes at canine exhi bitions ; John T. Hinchman, who moved from Johnstown into Baltimore in 1860, located on section 32, and still resides there ; Samuel F. Hinchman, who came at the same time, and subsequently purchased a farm near his brother, where he now lives ; and David Ickes, of Ohio, who settled on section 11 in 1860, which is still his home. Thomas Barber, of Ontario Co., N. Y., purchased, in 1852, 320 acres on section 7. He dwelt in a camp on his arrival, but soon completed a framed house, to which he re moved. A portion of this purchase was early improved, and additions were made as time and opportunity offered. Mr. Barber was an excellent farmer, and a man of much energy. He died in the township in 1863, and his farm is now owned by William H. Hendershot. Lucius Nichols purchased 200 acres on section 18, upon which he settled in 1852. He built a house and made a good-sized clearing, but did not long survive to enjoy his purchase. George Sheffield made his advent in the town ship in 1853, and found an eligible location upon section 21, where he remained for several years, finally removing, hoAvever, to Johnstown, his present residence. He was interested in the earliest Sabbath-school in the township. William M. Warner, who came from Ohio in 1853, entered 160 acres on section 22, upon which he still resides. The family repaired to the house of Hubbard Baldwin, on section 27, while a shelter was being prepared for them. He now owns a well-improved and productive farm, embracing 220 acres. Isaiah Hendershot left the State of Pennsylvania in the fall of 1853 for the forests of Michigan, and on his arrival purchased 80 acres on section 8 in Baltimore. After a life of industry, he died in January, 1874. His widow survives and resides upon the homestead, which is managed by her sons, William and Charles M. Hendershot. William Eaton, another Ohio pioneer of 1853, owned 80 acres on section 11. He traveled via Branch County with two yoke of oxen and a pair of horses, the latter of which he soon traded for 80 acres of land. He and his family occupied a shanty, with a puncheon floor, on the land of Eli D. Eaton, while erecting a framed house. The family was prostrated with ague, and very little work was accomplished the first year. The next season 17 acres was cleared, and much of it covered with a luxuriant crop of wheat. Even at this late period Indians were occasional visitors when passing on their hunting excursions, but their conduct was not obtrusive, and their bearing was always EARLY HIGHWAYS. The earliest recorded highway through the present town ship of Baltimore was surveyed by John Mitchell in 1838, and Avas known as the \" State road,\" its terminal points having been Battle Creek and Hastings. It entered the township between sections 31 and 32, and pursued a north easterly course to the centre of section 29, ran thence north to the centre of section 20, then bore somewhat to the wst, and again to the east, and left the township on the north line of section 5. But a small portion of this road is now in use."], [586, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 396 The highway just described was superseded by another road, connecting Battle Creek Avith Hastings, also known as the \" State road,\" which was surveyed by Albert E. Bull in July, 1844, and which is still one of the most fre quently traveled roads running through Baltimore. Lampman, who, two years later, sold to Horace Hall, who in turn sold to John Riley, from whom it passed into the hands of Royal G. Rice, the present owner, in 1872, who is also the postmaster. There are a blacksmith- and wagon shop, kept by Ormsbee & Bro., and a few dwellings em braced in the hamlet, and a resident physician, Dr. A. L. Van Horn, also enjoys an extensive suburban practice. Its principal importance is derived from the fact that it is the point at which the township mail is received. SCHOOLS. The earliest school building in Baltimore was erected on section 28, the lumber having been sawed by John H. Day, and the structure built by Maj. Thomas. PRITCHARDVILLE. Miss Sarah Blanchard, daughter of Bardsley R. Blan chard, and now Mrs. George Sheffield, first instructed the growing youth of the township. The second school-build in;: was located on section 2, then embraced in district No. 2, and was erected in 1851. The pioneer instructor in this district was Daniel Striker, then a resident of Balti more and now of Hastings. Mr. Daniel S. Chase in 1853 purchased 120 acres on section 20, upon which he erected a saw-mill soon after his advent, and in 1855 a grist-mill. Having at first no bolts with which to produce a superior quality of flour, he ex cited the mirthful proclivities of customers by his advocacy of Graham flour as being more conducive to health than a finer grade of flour, which his mill was unable to grind. He soon after found in George Swanson a purchaser for the property, who subsequently conveyed it to John Brit ton, and he to a buyer named Crandall. The territory of the township is at present divided into seven districts, under the supervision of the folloAving beard of directors: A. L. Van Horn, Orson Johnson, David Jakes, H. C. Fisher, John CraAvley, D. C. Warner, A. N. Warren. Seven male and eight female teachers are em ployed in the various districts in the course of a year, and have in their charge 376 pupils, 3 of whom are non-residents. The value of the school property in the township is $4125, which embraces seven capacious school-houses. The total resources of Baltimore for educational purposes are $2333.44. It Avas bought of the latter gentleman by Messrs. Pritch ard & Dixon, and later the firm became Pritchard Bros., the present proprietors. The mills are run by water-power furnished by the Cedar Creek, and do custom-work exclu sively. A foundry is also owned and managed by the pro prietors. A store was formerly kept at this point, Avhich is at present closed. EARLY TAX-PAYERS. The following list shows the tax-payers in Baltimore for the year 1849: B. R. Blanchard. H. Paul. Joseph Judd.

A post-office has been recently established at Pritchard ville, of which George Pritchard is the postmaster. METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH. Notwithstanding the fact that a class under the auspices of this church has existed since 1855, repeated interviews with its older members have failed to discover any early records or secure information relative to its history. Preaching was for many years held in one of the school houses of the township, and in 1873 measures were taken for the erection of a church edifice, which were successful. In 1874 the building was completed and dedicated. It is a spacious and substantial frame structure, standing on sec tion 21. Services are at present held semi-monthly, and conducted by Elder Janes, of Johnstown. A flourishing Sabbath-school is connected with the church, under the superintendence of A. Heath. The board of trustees are Dr. A. L. Van Horn, Moses Aldrich, Julius Crosby, J. C. Arnold, Joseph L. French, Harrison Mershon. BALTIMORE GRANGE, No. 472. This organization was first established in 1873, its earliest officers having been John Lichty, Master ; A. E. Durfee, Overseer ; G. R. Durfee, Lecturer ; E. B. Warner, Sec; R. K. Stanton, Treas. The meetings are at present held at the house of John Harrington, though the mem bers are now obtaining subscriptions for the erection of a spacious hall on section 33, to be devoted to the interests of the grange. Its present officers are E. B. Warner, Master; Samuel Jones, Overseer; G. R. Durfee, Lecturer ; Mrs. S. Granger, Sec. ; Albert Granger, Treas. The Baltimore Grange embraces 84 members, and is in a flourishing con dition. The ground on which the hamlet known as Baltimore Post-Office is located was originally owned by John Stall who later conveyed it to Peter Gendro. Sixty acres of this land were afterwards purchased by John Harrington. This was subsequently divided between William Match and A. C. Crandall, each having secured 30 acres. Cyrus Alt man obtained 20 acres of the portion originally secured by Match, one acre of which was purchased by David Ed wards, who, in 1864, erected a store thereon, in which he placed a general stock of goods adapted to the wants of a country trade.

He was, at this time, induced to go to Wood Co., Ohio, but remained only for a short time, as he was very desirous of realizing his day-dreams of a life in the West. He soon journeyed to Missouri, and located in that State in 1838. This being the year of the Mormon war in Missouri, he found life to be almost unbearable; so very unpleasant was his sojourn there, so different from what he had hoped, that it was very easy to accept the lures thrown out to tempt him back to Hancock County, where he eventually went, tarrying, however, in Illinois for eight months. 1S72.\u2014 Supervisor, R.K.

Y., and for several years was the pro prietor of a store on Pearl Street, in the city of New York. On his mother's side, Mr. Weeks' genealogy is traced back to the Carpenter family, his grandfather being Silas Carpenter, of Kings Street, Westchester County. Samuel Weeks was born in North Castle, in the same county, Oct. 3, 1S17, and lived in New York City until he was eight years old, when his father moved to Cayuga County, where they lived on a farm for some time ; but his father, being of an enterprising taken from the almshouse, but he explains this circum stance in his life by telling how he got lost in the city when quite young, when being much frightened he was unable to tell his father's name, and was taken to the alms house, where he was soon sound, and taken home to make the sad heart of his mother glad. Mr. Weeks has been twice married. His first wife was Mary C. Miller, a native of Cayuga Co., N. Y., and the mother of two children, \u2014 Isaac, born Jan. 20, 1844, now a farmer in Baltimore township, and Sarah Jane, born April 27, 1851. nature, pushed farther west into the Genesee country, and settled on a farm in Monroe County. Here Mr. Samuel Weeks remained until he reached the age of nineteen, when he started West, coming to Battle Creek, Mich. After a short stay he returned to New York, and in 1839 came to Michigan again, locating in Baltimore township, where he purchased two hundred acres of land from the government, paying for it in United States treasury notes, they being the first ones received at the land-office in Kalamazoo. His deed is from the government, and bears date of May 1, 1839. On this farm, in the same year, Mr. Weeks cut the first tree felled in the then forests of Baltimore. He still owns the same farm, and by good management has added to it until his acres now number over five hundred. His present wife, Abbie C. Terry, a lady of more than ordinary ability, is also a native of the Empire State and Monroe County, born July 31, 1828; her only child is Mary A., born Dec. 20, 1863. His first and present wife are descendants of Jonathan Horton, who came from Eng land in the early settlement of Long Island, and settled at Southhold, where his tombstone is still seen. In politics Mr. Weeks is a Bepublican, although not a politician, devoting his time to his farm instead of politics. He has, however, served as justice of the peace and assessor. In the early days of Michigan he surveyed a great deal of land, and was in many ways a valuable acquisition in the settlement of the country. He is not a member of any church, but descends from the Quakers, inheriting many of the sterling qualities of that sect. In speaking to the writer he said in his mirthful way that he had prospered well considering that he had been 399"], [592, "BARK Y* section 34. The same year Ephraim B. Cook located the south half of section 32. He was killed in 1837, by the falling of a heavy limb from a tree which he was felling. He lest a large family, one of whom, his son Edwin, now lives on part of the original purchase. The township of Barry was organized in March, 1836,f and then comprised the whole territory of the county. In 1838 this territory was divided into four civil townships, thus reducing the subject of this sketch to survey-town ships 1 and 2 north, in ranges 9 and 10 west. In 1841 the western half (survey-townships 1 and 2, in range 10) was set off as Spaulding, reducing Barry to survey-townships 1 and 2, in range 9. On the 25th of March, 1850, survey township 2, range 9, was set off from Barry as Hope, bringing the former to its present limits. Unless otherwise specified, the term \" Barry township\" will be applied in this sketch to its present territory only. David Nye, of Cortland Co., N. Y., emigrated to Mich igan in 1836, reaching Gull Prairie in October of that year. He lived there a short time, and then purchased 114 acres on the northeast quarter of section 19, in township 1, range 10. After living there one year he removed to New York on account of ill health. He sold the farm to his brother, George W. Nye, who had come to Gull Prairie with him in 1836. George W. Nye married Esther M., a daughter of Ephraim B. Cook, who had located on section 32 in 1834. Mr. Nye lived on this farm about three years, when he removed to Prairieville, where he now resides. NATURAL FEATURES. The western part of the township, like the eastern part of Prairieville, originally consisted of belts of prairie and oak-openings. The soil in that region is very productive. The eastern part of Barry is more hilly and stony, and in some localities the soil is not so good. But the township as a whole is justly considered one of the most productive in Barry County. Wheat is the staple product, but all the grains and fruits are produced in abundance. Samuel Case, also from the State of New York, came to this region in 1836, and purchased 240 acres on the west half of section 9, in this township, and lived there till his death, nearly thirty years later. Ambrose Mills, the second clerk of Barry township, reached that township probably in the early part of 1836. He entered a part of section 7. George Jones, a native of England, settled on section 28, in 1836. He is one of the two survivors of the second town-meeting held in Barry County. Zaphna Barnes, with his family, a wife and two children, settled in Barry in the early spring of 1837, where he bought a part of section 21. His daughter, Miss Emily Barnes, was married to H. I. Knappen soon aster. This is regarded as the first marriage in Barry township. The widow of Mr. Barnes is still living on the place, at the age of eighty-three. In 1837 two families of Willisons ar rived. Samuel Willison, from Cayuga Co., N. Y., located tracts on sections 23 and 24, while his brother, James, en tered the southwest quarter of section 24. Daniel Cross and family, from Lockport, N. Y., also arrived in 1837. He purchased a part of section 30 from a Mr. Pomeroy, who had entered it some years before. John Bowne, who had reached Prairieville the spring previous, and lived during the summer on the farm owned by Asahel Tillotson, moved to Barry in the fall of 1837 and located a part of section 7, but subsequently returued to Prairieville. EARLY SETTLEMENT. The first settler in Barry township was the Rev. Moses Lawrence. In the summer of 1834 he entered 120 acres of land in the government land-office, \u2014 80 acres of section 28, and 40 of section 27. After locating his land he re turned to Madison Co., N. Y., and in the fall of the same year brought thence his family, consisting of a wife, four sons, and three daughters. He was accompanied by his brother-in-law, Aaron Fargo, and his mother-in-law, Mrs. Edith Fargo, who died the following spring. Mr. and Mrs. Amasa S. Parker, who lived on section 35, in Prairieville township, were the nearest neighbors, and came nearly seven miles to assist at the funeral. Mr. Lawrence built a log cabin, which was 14 feet wide, 16 feet long, and one story high, with a roof sloping but one way. The ceiling was about 6 feet high at the lower side. To economize room an ingenious plan was resorted to. Two of the bed-frames were attached to the wall by a pair of home-made hinges, and so arranged that they could be folded up against the wall and fastened to a hook on the rafter. Mr. Fargo located just north of Mr. Lawrence. Linus Ellison settled first in Prairieville township, on section 24. He sold his property there to Isaac Otis and came to Barry, where he entered 115 acres of section 20. Wells Byington, the other survivor of those who attended the second town-meeting of Barry township, was born in Connecticut in 1808. He came to Michigan first in 1831, and helped to build the Yorkville Mills, iu Ross, Kalama zoo Co. In 1834 he traveled through Prairieville and Barry townships. He returned to New York, and after a The next settler to reach Barry was Benjamin Hoff, accompanied by his family, consisting of a wife, two sons, aud one daughter. He purchased a considerable tract on \u2022 By G. A. McAlpine. t See Chapter XIII. of the general history. *oo"], [593, "Rets/ oence of SOLOMON LA W R EN CE, B arry Tp.

Lake settled on the western part of the same section. He soon sold out and went to Yorkville, where he still lives. Garretson Rogers was the first settler on the school section. He reached the township first in 1837. summer of 1838. At the first meeting of the school com missioners of the old township, which embraced the whole county, in April, 1837, township 1, in range 9, was set off as school district No. 14. On the 9th day of May, 1837, the board directed a letter to Ephraim B. Cook, instructing him to call a school meeting at his house for the purpose of organizing a school district and electing the necessary officers. There are no minutes of this meeting, but the district was undoubtedly organized. In the fall of that year the structure known as the \" white school-house\" was built. It was the first in the township, and, with the exception of the house of Moses Lawrence, was the first building at Hickory Corners. It was a neat framed structure, capable of accommodating from 40 to 60 scholars. The first term was taught by Miss Theoda Spaulding, a daughter of C. W. Spaulding, of Prairieville. In the spring of 1838 Hiram Tillotson came from what is now Prairieville, where he had lived since 1835, and en tered a part of section 7. The summer of 1838 was long known and is still re ferred to by old settlers as the sickly season. In the month of August a terrible epidemic broke out, which continued its ravages until the last of September. Whole families were prostrated at the same time. Those who partially escaped were exhausted by the care of the sick. Ambrose Mills, the first in a list of twenty, died soon after being taken sick, and was buried on section 27. Benjamin Hoff and his elder son died the same day. The younger son died soon after. His daughter was re moved to Gull Prairie that she might receive better care, but lived only a short time after her removal. Aster bury ing her husband and three children Mrs. Hoff returned to New Jersey. In the mean time the township had been divided into four, and the board of the one which kept the name of Barry met and renumbered the districts. This occurred on the 12th of April, 1838. At this time the present township of Barry was designated district No. 1 ; the present Prai rieville, as No. 2 ; Orangeville, as No. 3. The tract which is now Hope, which was also in the Barry township of that day, seems to have received no attention, as it is not men tioned in the minutes. In February, 1838, sections 18, 19, and 30, in township 1, range 10, together with the adjoining sections in Prairieville, were formed into a new school district. The log school-house in this district was one of the first in the township, but it is believed that the one in the Willison district preceded it. A Mr. Skillman, who. with his family, had reached the township the spring previous, died, as did also his two chil dren. Mrs. Skillman also returned to New Jersey. As cold weather set in the epidemic abated, but not until there had been twenty deaths in the little settlement. During that summer there were but few new settlers in the township. Salmon C. Hall and family arrived in the fall. Mr. Hall taught the first winter school, in the winter of 1838-39. Among the early settlers who should be mentioned in a work of this kind are Robert Marshal, David and Warren Bowker, and William Woodard. Salmon C. Hall taught the first winter school, in the winter of 1838-39. It was the only one in the present township, and several of the scholars walked three or four miles and back, daily, throughout the winter. On the 28th day of December, 1844, a new school dis trict was set off. It contained the south half of sections 11 and 12, and all of sections 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, and 26. On the 6th of December, 1845, sections 5, 6, 7, 8 were set off, and together with the territory of Hope were formed into still another district. On the 1st of January, 1846, sections 31, 32, 33, and the south part of sections 29 and 30 were annexed to the northern school district of Ross, in Kalamazoo County. The districts have been rearranged from time to time since then, but it is not necessary to specify all these changes. EARLY ROADS. The first road in the present township of Barry was es tablished in 1837. It extended from a black-oak tree, at the north end of the \" Beaver Dam,\" southwest to section 12, in Prairieville, from which place it ran south on the line between the two townships. The \" Cook road\" was the next established. It was named from Ephraim B. Cook, who lived on section 32, and before whose house it passed. This road has never been much changed ; it ex tended from the base-line, in the neighborhood of Jones' mill, north between Gull and Long Lakes, and thence east from Thomas' mills, through sections 31 and 32, to the centre of section 33, where it met the highway commonly known as the Mill road, leading to the Yorkville mills. The first statement of money apportioned by the board was in 1849. At that time there were six districts, and the primary school fund amounted to $40.62. The fol lowing year the six districts received $57 from the same fund. The first complete report entered on the records is that made in 1854. There were then seven districts, whole and fractional, with 132 names enrolled, the primary fund amounting to $63. In 1860 the number of districts had increased to nine, and the number of scholars to 200. In 1879 the number was 300, and the number of districts ten. The total amount of school money expended was This latter road ran from the base-line north through section 33 to the centre of 28. It was subsequently ex tended north \" to a post on the fenced field of Zaphna Barnes,\" on section 21. These were the early roads of the township, and formed the usual routes of travel. With them nearly all the roads located in Barry for a number of y&rrs* were made to connect. The road east and west through Hickory Corners was established June 20, 1837. $1653.52. Several of the early teachers in Barry were residents of Prairieville, and their names are given in the history of that township. SCHOOLS. As near as can be ascertained, no public schools were taught in what is now Barry township previous to the 51"], [596, "402 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. HICKORY CORNERS. records do not give the names or number of the electors at this meeting, but the number did not probably exceed thirteen. It might be considered one of the most pleasant and satis factory elections ever held in Barry County, since it seems there were no disappointed candidates, each man going home at night bearing the honor and responsibility of from one to three offices. The following are the names of the electors, as near as can be ascertained : Linus Ellison, C. W. Spalding, Moses Lawrence, C. G. Hill, Orville Barnes, Isaac Otis, Benjamin Hoff, Amasa S. Parker, Nich olas Campbell, William Campbell, Henry Leonard, Luther Hill, Lewis Moran. After voting to hold the next annual meeting at the house of C. W. Spalding, the meeting ad journed. The village of Hickory Corners is located at the centre of section 28. It has a population of 150. There are three general stores, a drug-store, and several wagon- and black smith-shops, two harness-shops, a millinery-shop, and a hotel, built in 1868 by Bradley Thompson. The first house built in the village was the school-house, built in 1837. Solomon C. Hall built the first dwelling-house, about the year 1839. The next house built was the rear part of the large store on the northwest corner, at present occupied by a drug-store. CHURCHES. On the 12th day of March, 1842, two Methodist minis ters, named respectively E. B. Wooster and Orrin Gregory, came from Jackson County to the house of Moses Law rence. After holding a series of meetings in the school house at Hickory Corners, lasting four days, in which time 16 persons expressed a desire to unite with the church, a class was formed. The members met in the school-house until 1858, when their church, just east of the village, was built. At the next meeting, in 1837, the number of voters had increased to 36. The most important action taken was the appointing of a committee to assist the commissioners in locating a road from Gull Prairie to the Thornapple River. It was also voted to pay a bounty of $5 for every wolf killed in the township. During the year Mr. Tillotson's bounty amounted to $20. The Baptist Church of Barry was organized in 1858. Several members had belonged to a similar society in Hope, but when that was discontinued the one in Barry was formed. Their present place of worship was erected in 1870. Previous to this time they met in the Willison school-house. The following is a list of the officers elected April 4, 1836: Calvin G. Hill, Supervisor; Orville Barnes, Town Clerk ; Benjamin Hoff, Henry Leonard, C. W. Spaulding, Assessors ; Amasa S. Parker, Nicholas Campbell, Calvin G.

Spaulding, Benjamin Hoff, Luther Hill, School Commissioners ; Linus Ellison, Moses Lawrence, Directors of the Poor ; Lewis Moran, William Campbell, Constables. The first Sabbath-school was started by the Rev. Moses Lawrence and Benjamin Hoff in 1837. Mr. Hoff was chosen superintendent. CEMETERIES. At a special election held on the 10th of May of the same year, choice was made of Isaac Otis for supervisor in place of Calvin G. Hill, and Moses Lawrence commissioner of highways in place of the same person. Mr. Hill prob ably resigned. The land for the first public cemetery was donated to the township by Zaphna Barnes in 1847. It is on section 21, and is usually known as the North Cemetery. The one near the village of Hickory Corners was purchased in 1854. At the town-meeting in the year 1 837 36 voters were present, whose names are given below: Huston Lister, William Lewis, Samuel Wickham, Hiram Lewis, John King, George Buck, John Hanyen, Henry Leonard, Isaac Otis, Zaphna Barnes, Aaron Fargo, Ephraim B.

There has been no death in the society since its organization. At this election Isaac Otis received 33 votes for super visor, and was declared elected. Ambrose Mills was elected township clerk. On the 6th day of March, 1838, an act was approved by which the township of Barry, then comprising the whole county, was divided into the four townships of Hastings, Thornapple, Johnstown, and Barry; the latter by the act comprised townships Nos. 1 and 2, in ranges 9 and 10 west. The first election was held at the house of John Mills on the 2d of April in that year, when 41 votes were cast. The records for 1838 and 1839 are very meagre, but in 1838 Ambrose Mills was supervisor and POLITICAL HISTORY. By an act of the Legislature of the State of Michigan passed in March, 1836, the township of Barry was formed, comprising the whole territory of Barry County. The first town-meeting was held in what is now Prairieville, at the house of C. W. Spalding, on the 4th of April, 1836. Mr. Spalding was chosen moderator, and Orville Barnes clerk. The names of the officers are given a little farther on. The"], [597, "BARRY TOWNSHIP. 403 Peter Folk town clerk, and in 1839 Salmon C. Hall was supervisor. There is no record of the number of votes cast previous to 1850. In that year the number cast for supervisor was 86 ; in 1860 the number reached 226 ; iu 1870 275 \u2022 and in 1880, 324. The following is a list of the officers of Barry township from 1840 to 1880: At the annual meeting held April 6, 1840, John Bowne was chosen supervisor, Eli R.

At a special town-meeting called on the 28th day of December, 1863, a proposition to raise $3000, to pay $200 to each volunteer who should enlist and be credited to the township of Barry, was carried by 180 votes in favor of it to 22 against it. Soon afterwards the town voted $100 additional to be paid to each volunteer. On the 4th of April, 1864, the town bounty was increased another $100. At a special meeting held July 28, 1864, bonds were voted for the purpose of paying an additional $100 as bounty to each soldier. Still another addition of $100 was voted on the 21st of January, 1865, making the whole amount of town-bounty $600. The money was usually raised by direct tax or by township bonds, although private parties contributed considerable sums from time to time, which still more increased the bounty. The bonds were negoti ated by Adam Elliott at par, and drew 10 per cent, in terest. 1840, Moses Lawrence; 1841, Ebenezer King; 1842, no record ; 1843, David Bowker; 1844-45, Linus Ellison; 1846, Isaac Tolles; 1847-49, Allen Morey; 1850, A.

It paid the families of those who were in the field $1300, while the sums paid as bounty to volunteers amounted in the aggregate to $15,000. Previous to the organization of the Republican party the Democratic and Whig parties were so nearly balanced in the township of Barry that slight causes sometimes gave one or the other the lead. But on the formation of the first-named party the Democrats took the lead and held it until 1859, when the first Republican victory was gained in the township. From that time until the formation of the National Greenback party, in the winter of 1878, the Republican party remained in power. In the spring of that year there were three tickets in the field, and the new party elected all its candidates. The same thing occurred in 1879, but in 1880 the vote for supervisor was a tie be tween the National and Republican parties, and the candi date of the latter party was declared elected by casting lots.

Of the many whose portraits and biographies grace the pages of this work, none are more worthy of mention than the subject of this brief history. He was born Oct. 15, 1777, in Cayuga Co., N. Y. His father, William Willison, was born in Ireland, but came to America in 1774, and married Miss Hannah Bowker, raising a family of four boys and four girls. He served in the American army through the Revolutionary war, and was taken prisoner by the Hessians. Samuel's early days were spent at home as a farm-laborer up to 1824, when he married Miss Eliza beth Banks, who was born in Connecticut, June 15, 1800. Her parents were of English descent. After marriage they moved to the western part of New York, Allegany County, and bought a wild lot and improved the same, re maining there thirteen years, or until 1837, when with his wife and two boys, Elias and Samuel R., they started for Michigan, driving through with an ox-team, camping out nights, \u2014 Elias being twelve years of age, Samuel, two, \u2014 arriving in Michigan safe after a long and tiresome journey. They settled on the farm of one hundred and sixty acres now occupied by Samuel, which his father had purchased pre vious to his departure from New York, and which was then a dense wilderness of heavy oak-timber, their nearest neigh bor being some three miles away ; leaving his family with Mr. Mills until he could erect a rude shelter to protect his family from the chilling blast ; this took but a few days, as CONSTABLES. 1840, Heman I.

In September, 1850, he was bereft of his companion. In 1852 he was again married, his second wife being a Mrs. Barnes. She is still living with her son in Barry township. Mr. Willison died at his old home, Oct. 2, 1865.

Samuel, like most boys of his day, when he arrived at a capable age, had plenty of hard work and but little time for pleasure, yet by improving the advantages within his reach he acquired a practical knowl- nary business. He helped to clear up their once forest home, where he has always lived. When fifteen years of aoe he was bereft of the dearest of friends, \u2014 a mother.

He is found among the Republican voters ; represented his party as township treasurer two terms, as school inspector nine years, always taking great interest in schools, doing cheerfully anything pertaining to their ad vancement, serving as superintendent two years. He is at present serving his second term as justice of the peace. He is a member of no church, but always willing to help support the cause, believing that our society is preferable to what it would be were the churches excluded from our midst. He chose farming as his avocation on his return from the war, Avhich he has since diligently pursued. one battle in which his company engaged. June 4, 1864, in the battle of Cold Harbor, his right foot was cut off by a cannon-shot. The most important battles in which he was engaged were Fredericksburg, in 1862 ; siege of Vicksburg and Knoxville, in 1863 ; battle of the Wil derness and Spottsylvania and Cold Harbor, where he was wounded. After being discharged he came home, and, March 28, 1866, married Miss Celinda Jewett, of Richland, Kalamazoo Co. She was born in Illinois, March 28, 1846. Her father was a native of Vermont ; her mother, of Con necticut ; they both died in Richland. She is one of a fam ily of four boys and four girls. After marriage they settled on the old homestead, where they have since lived, and where his parents both died. His home farm consists of two hundred acres, one hundred and seventy improved, MRS. ADAM ELLIOTT, ADAM ELLIOTT. ADAM ELLIOTT. This gentleman traces his origin with commendable pride to an English ancestry. He was born in Norfolk Co., England, Oct. 31, 1815. He was one of a family of five children. His parents were both natives of England, where they both died in 1861. His father was a farmer, and Adam remained at home until the spring of 1836 ; having then arrived at the acknowledged age of manhood, he came to America, landing in Monroe Co., N. Y., with seven dollars. Here he remained working by the month some seven years. Sept. 30, 1843, he married Miss Cath erine Mallock, who was then living in the same county, but was born in Perthshire, Scotland, April 3, 1815. Her parents were natives of Scotland, but emigrated to America, settling in Monroe Co., N. Y., in 1817, where the father died in 1852, the mother in 1859. After marriage they came to Michigan, settling in Orangeville upon section 3, buying a farm of eighty acres of dense forest. Here they remained five years, when they sold, and bought their present home of one hundred and sixty acres at Hickory Corners, Barry township, which then had small improve ments, but is now one of the best in that section of country. Of their once unbroken family of seven children five are living, \u2014 Dr. James M., married, and lives at Hick ory Corners ; Edwin C., married, is a merchant at Hickory Corners ; Maria S., now Mrs. Rorabeck, lives in Augusta, Kalamazoo Co. ; Isabel, now Mrs. P.

In politics, Mr. Elliott cast his first vote as a Democrat ; he was afterwards a Free-Soiler, until the formation of the Republican party, since when he has voted with that organi zation, representing it in the Constitutional Convention at Lansing in 1867, as a member of the House of Represen tatives in 1869-70, as supervisor of Barry township nine years, as justice of the peace twelve years.

BARBEE Among the honored names of Barry County that of Walden T. Barber stands prominently as one who has done his share to give the old county its position in the Peninsular State. He was born July 28, 1823, in Auburn, Cayuga Co., N. Y. His twin brother, William O, is now in California. These and one sister are all that are left of a family of ten children. Their parents were Ira and Esther (Bennett) Barber ; they were both natives of Vermont, where they were married in 1813, though Walden's father traces his origin to Ireland. He was a carpenter and joiner Middleville. His father died Dec. 20, 1867, at the ripe old age of eighty-four. Walden T. was married June 11, 1856, to Miss Clara Keys, who was born in Cattaraugus Co., N. Y., Jan. 16, 1836 ; she was one of a family of four girls, and is a daughter of Andrew and Betsey ( Walrath) Keys, who were both natives of New York. He was a farmer, and came to Michigan in 1855, locating in Barry township, where the mother died in 1869, the father living until Jan. 3, 1880, aster the death of his wife making his home with his daughter, Mrs. Barber. To Mr. and Mrs. Barber was given but one child, Viola E., born April 19, 1857, now Mrs. Cartright, and living at Hickory Corners, though they have an adopted son, Bertie J., a promising boy of eight summers, whom they took when but two years of age. Mr. Barber was a Whig up to the formation of the Repub- lican party. Since then he has always been found among the most prominent men of his party, representing it in all the minor offices of his town, such as township clerk ; treasurer, two terms; justice of the peace, sixteen years, which office he now holds. He is a member of no church, though liberal with time and means towards anything per- taining to the advancement of Christianity. His advantages for education were better than most boys had in those days, he having at the age of nineteen acquired sufficient knowl edge to enable him to do any ordinary business. He is what might be termed a mixed farmer, making a specialty of no one thing. He has a nice farm of one hundred and twenty acres, well improved, within one-half mile of the village of Hickory Corners. by trade, and worked at it most of his life, though he owned a small farm, which was carried on by his boys. When Walden was nineteen years of age, failing to obtain employ- ment there, he conceived the idea of coming West. His father, having previously traded for the land which he now occupies, made an offer to him of a deed of one-half of the farm, considering it worthless; he accepted it, and in May, 1842, found himself here, where, instead of a lake or marsh, as he expected, he found twelve hundred acres of good oak- openings, which he began to improve. If the eye of man ever looked upon nature in a more beautiful mood or aspect than she exhibited to our subject, it has not been revealed to the writer to what portion of the earth he must go to find the record of such vision. The original oak-openings which comprised the greater portion of the township were in the summer indescribably lovely. One year from the next fall after his arrival his father and mother came also ; his mother only lived to endure pioneer life a brief time, and died June 27, 1855.

In politics he is a Democrat, casting his first vote for Jackson, and has represented his party at different times in minor offices. Mrs. Byington is a worthy member of the Baptist Church, \u2014 his views on religion being liberal. Mr. Byington's grand father was a native of Connecticut, and held a commission as lieutenant from George III. in the French war, but when the Revolutionary war broke out he took up arms with the colonies, serving through the struggle. Died in May, 1824, at the advanced age of eighty-seven years. WELLS BYINGTON. Among the venerable pioneers who by their own indus try laid the foundation for the present wealth they now en joy, we offer the gentleman whose name heads this brief history as an example, feeling that what is said of him is but a fitting tribute to his sterling worth. He was born Nov. 8, 1808, in Connecticut, was the third in a family of six children of Daniel and Hannah (Alcox) Byington, who were both natives of Connecticut. When Wells was but seven years of age his parents moved to Chenango Co., N. Y., where they both died, the mother in 1835, the father struggling against the vicissitudes of life until 1843, when he too was called to the unknown. His father was a farmer, consequently his boyhood days were similar to those of the majority of farmers' sons, \u2014 plenty of hard work, and but little time for education or recreation. When he reached his majority, he started in life for him self, hiring out by the month, which he pursued for three years, or until 1832, when he turned his face towards the far West, leaving home and friends behind, having one hundred dollars laid by of the wages earned by the sweat of his brow. The first two years he worked for Mr. Barnes, with whom he came to Michigan. In 1834 he located the farm where his son now lives, section 28, Barry township, it being the second farm located in that town. In the fall of 1834 he returned to New York. Oct. 6, 1836, he secured a helpmeet by marrying Miss Betsey Gordon, of Madison Co., N. Y., where she was born March 7, 1809, she being the oldest in a good old-fashioned family of eleven children. Her father was a native of New Hampshire, her mother of Connecticut, but both died in New York. the father in 1827, the mother in 1850, and now lie quietly resting, side by side, with naught but a marble slab to mark the sacred spot. Aster marriage, he, with his young bride, started for the West, arriving in Kalamazoo County, Nov. 8, 1836, working by the month some two years on Gull Prairie ; then moved on their farm, located in 1834, and com menced in earnest to improve their new home. Here they SOLOMON LAWRENCE. None are so well qualified to speak of pioneer life as those who have experienced it. This gentleman comes under that heading. He was born in Lenox, Madison Co., N. Y., Jan. 17, 1820, and was one of a family of eight chil dren. His father, Moses Lawrence, was born in England, but came to America when eighteen years of age. He was a minister of the gospel. The mother, Jerusha Fargo, was a native of New York, where she married Mr. Lawrence. They owned a small farm and followed grinding plaster. When Solomon was fifteen (in 1834) his father moved to Michigan, he having located land the previous spring on sections 27 and 28, Barry township, being the first white man to settle in the town, where they both died, the mother, in 1838, only surviving pioneer life a few brief years ; the father in 1864. Solomon remained at home until he was"], [603, "CARLTON TOWNSHIP. 409 of age, when he started for himself, going back to New York, where he worked some thirteen months ; then re turned to Michigan, working by the month for a short time. He then worked his father's farm one year. In 1844 he made his first purchase of land of one hundred and twenty acres, on section 28, where he still lives. A sketch of his residence can be seen in this work. He has since added to his original purchase, so that his farm now contains five hundred and ninety-five acres, besides other lands farther north. In 1849, being then twenty-nine, he married, in Kalamazoo County, Miss Mary Piper, who was born in England, Sept. 7, 1829, and one of a family of thirteen children. Her parents came to America when she was quite young, locating first in New York, where they remained two years, when they moved to Michigan, locating in Kalamazoo County. The father died in Calhoun County in 1840, the mother in Barry County in 1804. To Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence were born six children, as fol lows: Philetus H., born March 9, 1852; George W., Sept. 28, 1854 ; Alfred P, Dec. 24, 1859 ; Frank E., June 2, 1863 ; Sarah A., Feb. 16, 1806 ; Otis S., March 21, 1868, \u2014 all living, the two oldest married and settled on farms near the homestead ; the rest still remain at home. In politics Solomon is the same in principle as his father, \u2014 Democratic up to the formation of the Republican party, since that time voting with it. His school advantages were similar to those commonly enjoyed by boys of that time, \u2014 plenty of hard work with but little opportunity for education or recreation. Himself and wife have been mem bers of the Wesleyan Methodist Church for the past twenty years. Mr. Lawrence, in his early days, took great interest in hunting deer, killing as many as four in one day. Did our space permit we. could pen many stories from his lips both ludicrous and pathetic. CAKLTON: Carlton, lying south of the Ionia county-line, north of Hastings, east of Irving, and west of Woodland, consists of township 4 north, range 8 west, and dates its municipal existence from 1842, when it was formed from Hastings. The township is well watered by a branch of the Thorn apple River, which flows from the southeast towards the northwest. Although this stream affords considerable good water-power, it has never been utilized except for saw mills. where Fuller and his wife, Harrison Wickham and wife, and Elizabeth Wickham (Harrison's sister) had been living since 1834. In September, 1836, Samuel Wickham and wife, Harri son Wickham and wife, and George Fuller set out for Carl ton by wagon. They passed by Hastings, which was then making a first effort in the way of a saw-mill, and, reach ing in due season the bank of the Thornapple, close to the road now passing east and west through the centre, there pitched their tents, \u2014 that is to say, they kept house in a tent by day, and at night the women-folks lodged in the wagon, while the men slept on the ground. As speedily as could be all hands rolled up a log house for Fuller, and in January, 1837, along came George Fuller's wife and Eliza beth Wickham, in company with Nelson Sprague, who had engaged to move them, coming by way of Gun Lake and Yankee Lewis' Tavern in Yankee Springs. Carlton Centre \u2014 boasting a store, post-office, the town hall, and a collection of a dozen houses\u2014 is the only sem blance of a village the town contains. Although there are several religious organizations in Carlton, there is but one church edifice, and that has existed only since 1874. Generally the surface of the country is level or gently undulating, although there are a few hills of tiresome mag nitude. Carlton is esteemed a good wheat-town, and is gen erally a locality much in favor with farmers. As soon as Fuller's house was up, Harrison Wickham was similarly provided for, and in the fall of 1837 the elder Wickham had a comfortable home. Mrs. Samuel Wickham was a woman eminently fitted to be a pioneer's wife, and, although her husband, her son, and Mr. Fuller rather objected to taking their women when they made their first trip to Carlton, Mrs. Wickham and Harrison Wickham's wife insisted upon participating in whatever hardships there might be in store for their husbands, and, as may be well understood, gave valuable aid in the work of pioneering. THE MAKCH OF THE PIONEERS. Near the centre of the town, on the banks of the Thorn apple, Carlton received its first settlers, in September, 1836. They were Samuel Wickham and wife, Harrison Wickham (his son) and wife, and George Fuller (Samuel Wickham's son-in-law). George Fuller had come out from Jackson Co., Mich., in 1835, on a land-looking excursion, and, drift ing into the wilderness now known as the town of Carlton, took a fancy to the land near the centre, and there located five 80-acre lots for himself and 40 acres for his father-in law, Samuel Wickham. Fuller went back to New York, where Samuel Wickham was living, and with the latter and his family moved westward as far as Jackson County, One day, while the men were away, Mrs. Wickham's cow broke through the ice into the river, and was in im minent danger of being drowned, whereupon that lady, breaking the ice before her, waded into the river and brought the bovine by the horns safely to shore, although she herself came near losing her own life as a result of * By David Schwartz. 52"], [604, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 410 would frequently repair to indulge in their weekly dance. They were industrious savages in the business of gathering sugar, and on the banks of the river held occasional \" pow wows\" of an uproarious character, although entertaining to those who visited them. the adventure. Elizabeth Wickham (now the widow of E. R. Carpenter) tells, among other incidents of pioneer life, that more than once, while walking towards home, was she so closely followed by deer that she had to drive them away from her, and that on one occasion she saw seven wolves in her father's yard at one time. THE BARNUM SETTLEMENT. Samuel Wickham was a soldier of the war of 1812, at the outbreak of which he was living in Canada. Refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the British crown, he was imprisoned, but, escaping over the border, at once entered the United States military service. He lived in Carlton long enough to see the wilderness changed to a prosperous town, and about 1852 removed to Grand Haven, where he died. Harrison Wickham moved to Lowell about 1850. George Fuller made an early change of location to Hast ings, where he kept tavern until he died. Zebulon Barnum was living in Jackson Co., Mich., in 1836, and in that year, determining to seek a home farther West, started with his son, I. H. Barnum, Nelson Sprague, Myers Lovell, and Harrison Leslie on a land-looking tour. They had not been out long before swollen streams and the loss of a horse discouraged them, and all hands retraced their steps. Sprague and Barnum got a Mr. McOmber to locate some land for them in Carlton, and he secured for Barnum the northeast quarter of section 25, while for Sprague he located tracts on sections 24 and 36. In the fall of 1837, Zebulon Barnum, his son A. H. Barnum, and Nelson Sprague came to Carlton, finding Myers Lovell on section 25 and Senter Blood on 26. Sprague had hired Sen ter Blood, Stephen Barnum, and I. H. Barnum to come out early in 1837 to do some chopping for him, and had supplied them with sufficient provisions to last a week, at the end of which time he was to send more. They chopped away like heroes, and like heroes ate, until at the close of the week they had eaten all their provisions save a few potatoes, never doubting, of course, that Sprague would be at hand, as promised, to revictual them. Sprague was, however, detained beyond his expectations, and while they waited for him fully a week, they lived meanwhile on roasted potatoes, and of those they had so few that they were compelled to ration them. Deer, the only game to be thought of, they couldn't get, because the snow-crust on the ground gave the hunter no chance to surprise his game. Harrison Barnum got tired of the roasted-potato diet before the last week was ended, and made a start for Yankee Springs, but before he reached that place he had to fast twenty-sour hours, and was altogether in an unhappy condition. THE ROGERS SETTLEMENT. Late in the year 1836 Carlton received quite a little ac cession to its infant settlement in the families of J. S. Rogers and J. S. Henyon, and a young man named E. R. Carpenter, all of whom came in company from New York State. Rogers, Carpenter, and Henyon cut a road from Hastings to section 20, in Carlton, and when they had got a log house rolled up took out the Rogers and Henyon fam ilies, who had meanwhile been stopping at Bunker's, in Hastings. Rogers, who became a man of much local promi nence, died in 1854. His widow and sons, Jeremiah M., Hiram, W. S., H. C, and D. W., are residents of Carlton. Henyon lived on section 18 a year and a half, and then, with his wife, went over to Bull's Prairie to work for A. E. Bull. Henyon chopped and his wife kept house for Bull, who had upwards of twenty men at work on his land. For these men Mrs. Henyon did the cooking, chopped trees herself when she wanted firewood, boiled sugar, and performed, indeed, quite enough labor to keep her busy sixteen hours out of each twenty-four. Henyon died in Irving in 1863. Mr. Carpenter bought 80 acres on section 20, and in Janu ary, 1838, married Samuel Wickham's daughter Elizabeth. He was conspicuous, during his residence in Carlton, as the occupant of local offices, and for twenty-five years served as justice of the peace. He was one of the justices of Hast ings before Carlton was set off, and after that event con tinued to act as a justice in Carlton, although not newly elected. When Judge Ransom's attention was called to the matter, he promptly decided that Carpenter was no justice, and had not been since the division of the towns. At this announcement there was considerable trembling of hearts among those whom Carpenter had married, and much anxious inquiry was made as to the status of the married ones. Judge Ransom decided, however, that, as the marriages had been performed by Mr. Carpenter in good faith, they must therefore be considered valid, and peace reigned accordingly in many a bosom erstwhile lacerated with distressing doubts and fears. After Zebulon Barnum and Nelson Sprague had put up a house on Barnum's place they went back to Jackson for their families. On the way Barnum met Moses Durkee and Thomas Senter moving westward on a prospecting-tour, and, engaging them to go out to Carlton to chop for him, they turned their steps thither without delay. On the road to Carlton they overtook Timothy Loughead, bound for the same place, and so they journeyed on in company. When Barnum and Sprague returned in the fall of 1838 they found in the neighborhood Jesse Townsend and Richard and John McAuley. Timothy Loughead had made a settlement on section 11, and was the first settler in that part of the township. Durkee chopped a few months for Barnum, and then, bargaining with him for 40 acres of land, became himself a settler on section 25. Melvin Barnum and Mr. Durkee chopped through the summer at such a rate that directly after commencing in the morning their shirts would be soaked through and through with perspiration. Then they'd take them off, wring them out, hang them up to dry, work until noon naked to the waist, when, their shirts Mr. Carpenter became quite intimate with the Indi ans, and many a time joined them in hunting excursions. One of their favorite camping-grounds was about a half mile up the river from Carpenter's, and to his house they"], [605, "CARLTON TOWNSHIP. 411 being decently dry, they would don them and march to dinner. \" That's the way,\" says Mr. Durkee, \" the pio neers had to work, and I tell you I don't think you'll find such workers nowadays.\" of thirty or more persons to give him a friendly list, and a right merry time they had too, if current report is to be relied on. Going to mill meant a trip to either Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, or some equally distant point, and an absence of from three to eight days, most frequently the latter. When a settler announced it as his intention to go to mill, his neighbors came from far and near with grists for transporta tion, and there was always a full load, for the oppor tunity of sending to mill was far too unfrequent to pass unheeded. Sometimes it happened that even after a tire some journey to mill there would be no chance to get anything ground for a day or two, and so while waiting his \" turn\" the pioneer would use his team in hauling wood or doing anything else at hand, so that he might earn at least enough to pay his board. Among the early settlers in the Barnum neighborhood may also be reckoned James Lancaster, Samuel Durkee, Elihu Covey, Israel Hale, Abel, Philander, and Stephen Barnum, Anson Wood (who in 1844 occupied a portion of the land settled by Jesse Townsend in 1838), J. J. Fuller, M. P. Fuller, Richard Young, and James Townsend. THE CHENEY NEIGHBORHOOD. As already related, Timothy Loughead was the first to make a location in the northeast, and near him, at about the same time, Jedotham Freeman made the second clear ing. Joseph Whitney, who came to Michigan in 1835, moved to Carlton, upon section 15, in 1842, and in 1844 moved over near Loughead's. That portion of the town ship did not appear to invite much attention until about 1856. when David Myers and the Cheneys reinforced the population, and from that time forward arrivals were rapid and numerous. As au illustration of the difficulties to be encountered in making a journey, whether long or short, it is recalled that in 1838 Alpheus Moore started for mill with an ox-team, and such was the roundabout course he had to pursue that aster traveling all day he found himself at night not more than two or three miles, in an air-line, from home. His next day's journey carried him only to Bull's Prairie. To that point the journey was always slow and painful, for it was over a zig-zag road through a heavily-timbered country. From Bull's Prairie, however, to Comstock's, there was a decent trail over which traveling was comparatively easy. OLD TIM'S OX. In this place it may be appropriate to repeat the story about Timothy Loughead's ox. The animal, it appears, strayed away, and, being attacked by a bear or bears, was slain and partly devoured. When \" Old Tim\" looked for his ox, and sound but a half-eaten carcass, he swore most savagely, and straightway organized a small party of friends to hunt the ursine assassins down. The hunters lay in wait for the bears about twenty-four hours, abundantly prepared to work dreadful slaughter, but, the bears not ap pearing within that time, the party retired for a brief season of refreshment. At the close thereof they came again on guard, but alack ! during their absence the nimble bears had appeared, consumed the balance of the carcass, and disappeared. Old Tim swore worse than ever, but swearing did no good, and he never got a chance to re venge himself upon the destroyers of his ox. Mr. Messer says he bought a barrel of salt of Yankee Bill Lewis for 813.375, and paid for it by splitting rails. While he was at work on the job he walked seven miles every morning through the snow to his work, and back again at night to do his chores. He was at one time seven teen days and at another fifteen days without flour or meat, and with his family had to subsist on potatoes and salt. Reference to meat suggests a story about one-hog pork, in which Samuel Wickham figured. That young man had been to Battle Creek, or some point near there, for a supply of provisions, and among the lot had, of course, a barrel of \" one-hog pork,\" \u2014 that is, the pork of a hog large euough to fill the barrel. OTHER PIONEER RECOLLECTIONS. In fording a stream he got into deep water, was swamped, and lost his load, but by great exertions saved himself and cattle. It must have been a very powerful Christian resignation that aided him, if he really submitted to the unhappy accident without a murmur. It was bad enough to work for a week on abominable roads to reach a market and to get back again, but to lose the result of his toil, and to feel doubtful about his immediate ability to raise funds for another purchase, was indeed a sore trial. In this par ticular case Wickham did eventually recover his barrel of one-hog pork, but as if to aggravate him still further with a sense of misfortune it was found to contain thirteen pigs' feet, a number quite out of keeping, as any one must con fess, with the generally conceived idea as to the number of pedal extremities usually attached to one porker. Isaac Messer, an emigrant to Michigan in 1835, and to Orangeville in 1836, and a settler in February, 1839, upon section 20, in Carlton, still lives in the latter township, and retains some very keen recollections of the incidents attend- ant upon his experience as a Michigan pioneer. Upon his arrival in Carlton he moved into a log shanty, put up by E. R. Carpenter, on the place now occupied by William Jones, in section 20. The residents of Carlton at that time, as he hoav remembers them, were Jared S. Rogers, John S. Henyon, James Gilson, and Alpheus Moore on the west, E. R. Carpenter, Harrison Wickham, George Fuller, Samuel Wickham, John McAulcy, Myers Lovell, Zebulon Barnum, his sons, Jesse Townsend, Moses Durkee, Samuel Durkee, Nelson Sprague, and Abel Barnum on the east, and Timothy Loughead away off in the northeast. When Mr. Messer came to Carlton he sought to ford the Thornapple at Bull's Prairie, but the stream was thick with anchor ice, and when about half-way across his cattle parted from the wagon, and he, in subsequent efforts to re cover them and to convey his goods to shore, crossed the Although the near neighbors were few, there were plenty of people within reach, for when Messer was ready to raise his barn he issued invitations to the people of the neighboring townships, and as a result he had a company"], [606, "412 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. river naked thirteen times. When he got through with his task he sound himself so bruised and bleeding that he gave the strongest kind of indications that he had been in a slaughter-pen, while he was so deplorably chilled and ex hausted as to be scarcely capable of motion. On another occasion he was engaged nearly a half-day in a similar adventure. At that time he had his family with him, and so enfeebled had his cattle become by their travel that they gave out when within a mile of home. The snow was deep, the track was, of course, unbeaten, and OA'er the mile that intervened between them and home they would only move as Messer tramped and packed the snow before them for the entire length and breadth of the road. Nor was that all. When the family reached home and were thank fully eating their supper Messer suddenly bethought him self to look after the oxen, which he had lest at the door. Alas ! they had wandered off, and away he went through the darkness and deep snow to hunt them. Tired as he was it was a painful task, and Avhat made it worse was the fact that he had to wander through the woods at random and wade through three feet of snow. Finding his team at last, and housing them at a settler's, he set out for home. Within a mile of his cabin he lost his way, and then, utterly worn out and discouraged, he lay down to die. \" I couldn't die,\" says he ; \" and so making another effort I found my way at last and got home about daylight, and found my family, as you may imagine, in a state of distressing anxiety.\" day to pay for the land. Fish settled just south of Dryer. These two were noted hunters and trappers, and played sad havoc among the bears and wolves. On one occasion when Dryer had shot a bear, he thought Bruin was so far gone that he could be handled with impunity. When Dryer caught the brute by the tail to drag him away, the animal turned upon him with a show of considerable life, and for a time there was a sharp contest, but Dryer proved the more successful, and not only whipped but killed the bear beyond any possibility of a resurrection. John Fish's brothers, Nehemiah, D. F.,and Milo W., were early comers in that neighborhood, and were also famous as hunters. Mr. Doty remarks that although the settlers could find a mill at Hastings it took them a good two days to go there and get back, and he recollects that he was gone two days on a short trip to Woodland for a few potatoes, although he made all the haste he could. Franklin Peck, now living on section 5, came to town from Calhoun County in 1844. Milo and Reuben Bunn came to section 5 in 1853, James Freeland, with his sons, Jacob and John H., to the same section in 1855, and Daniel Yarger to section 10 in 1857. Mr. Yarger has ac quired considerable distinction in Carlton as a land-owner, stock-raiser, and sugar-maker. Maxfield Ludlow was a settler on section 5 in 1845, and in 1856 T. L. Pillsbury built a cabin upon section 7, which until then had received no settler, and upon which for about ten years Mr. Pillsbury was the only resident. When he moved in he had to cut his road from the Rogers settlement to his place. From Rogers' Corners to the northern town-line, he found the settlers then to be A. E. Fowler, Sanford Sisson, John Strausbaugh, Jonathan Rumsey, Osro Van Wormer, the Fish families, Franklin Peck, the Freeland families, Ira Hoyt, Stephen Doty, and the Bunns. Money was a much-desired boon, and hard to get. About the only way the settlers could get hold of cash was through their labor on the roads, kept up by the payment of taxes by non-residents. So eager were some to get a little money that they hauled wheat for A. E. Bull from Bull's Prairie to Grand Rapids for a shilling a bushel. Dry bread suf ficed to sustain them on the journey, and in the woods they would find their nightly lodging place, sometimes sleeping there while the snows descended upon them. An old settler tells how he went to Detroit for a cow and two bar rels of salt, and that on the trip home he slept in tho woods and lived on simply the milk he got from the cow. In 1843, Truman P. Barnum came to Carlton, taught school a while, went back to New York, and in 1844 came again to Carlton. He, with his half-brother, 0. F. Munion, worked upon Nelson Sprague's farm three years. He sub sequently occupied land in Woodland, then exchanged it for the saw-mill property of Levi Herron, on section 16, and ultimately settled on the same section, where he now lives, upon land first improved by Oscar Smith. Jacob Odell located on section 21 in 1841, and in 1844 his son-in-law, J. 0. Foster, came to the town. Both died upon the same day, in~1846. William Morgan, who settled in Carlton in 1852, married Foster's widow. L. B. Barber came to sec tion 23 in 1858, and in 1850 Austin Durfee (a settler in Michigan in 1822) located on section 29. Ira Leach, who located in Jackson County in 1835, set- tled in Carlton in 1839, upon sections 31 and 32, and in December of that year, with his son Henry and one Cyrus Griffin, put up a shanty. Griffin became a settler in the Rogers neighborhood, but removed soon to Hastings, where he followed the trade of carpentering until his death. With Leach also came two brothers named Strong, who owned land on section 32, and put up the body of a log house on it, but, becoming dissatisfied with their brief experi ence as pioneers in that region, returned to Jackson County, and there remained. Mr. Leach died on his farm in 1841, and was buried there. LOST CHILDREN. Many people still living recollect very clearly the inci dent of the loss of Jedotham Freeman's two children, and the subsequent protracted but fruitless search for them, and there are also many residents of the county who took part in that search, \u2014 a search that engaged the energies of people from as far even as Kalamazoo and Battle Creek. In the year 1839 the pioneer settlements in the north western portion of the town where made by Enos Dryer and Charles Mitchell, who in that year came from Calhoun County. Both were on section 5, close neighbors, \u2014 Dryer on the place now occupied by J. H. Freeland, and Mitchell on the Franklin Peck place. Following them came Stephen Doty and John Fish in February, 1840. Doty bought 40 acres on section 5 for $100, and worked at five shillings a It was during the year 1846 that Freeman, who lived in the northeastern corner of the township, gave out that his two sons, Alonzo and Newton, aged respectively eight aud ten, had gone into the woods and had not returned, his"], [607, "T. L. PI LLS BU RY. MRS. T. L. PILLSBURY Residence of REV. THEODORE L. PILLSBURY, Caplton.Mich"], [608, ""], [609, "CARLTON TOWNSHIP. 413 expressed opinion being that the boys had been carried off by Indians. The story circulated rapidly, and enlisted pop ular attention and sympathy to such a degree that there was an immediate and organized search for the lost ones, and people came not only from Hastings and neighboring towns, but from Kalamazoo and other counties. The searching-party, composed at times of upwards of 300 people, was thoroughly organized, and was conducted in part by Dr. Upjohn and H. A. Goodyear, of Hastings. The country was scoured for miles around, the sharpest lookout was kept, and while a ray of hope remained the interest in the affair widened and deepened, but, after a week's unavail ing work disclosing neither the presence of the children nor a clue to their whereabouts, they were abandoned to their fate. The mystery attendant upon their disappearance has to this day remained a mystery, although there were not wanting those at the time of the search to hint that Free man had murdered and made away with the children. In deed, it was afterwards remembered that he had on more than one occasion threatened to kill them, and his nature was of such a rough and violent character that in fits of rage he was a furious demon. It was believed that he struck one of them in a passion, unwittingly inflicting a fatal blow, and had then slain the other and destroyed the bodies of both in order to hide the previous crime. No person seemed, however, inclined to press the matter by means of legal in vestigation, and Freeman was therefore undisturbed except by public suspicion. Soon aster the loss of his children he moved away from the township, and within a short time fell suddenly dead while standing one day within the door way of his home. sides the father and mother of the bride, there were present George Fuller and wife, George Fowler, Harrison Wick ham and wife, and Jared S. Rogers and wife. There was a wedding-feast, an abundance of good cheer, and a good time generally. Town cemeteries were laid out in 1843 near the Centre and in the Barnum neighborhood ; Hart Covey, son of Elihu Covey, being the first buried in the latter place, in 1843. In 1853 a burial-ground was staked at the Centre, but before any bodies were laid there the project was aban doned and an addition was made to the ground on the Car penter place. At the same time a burial-ground was laid out in the Cheney neighborhood. THE MAIL Carlton post-office was established in 1844, and Jared S. Rogers appointed postmaster. Jeremiah M. Rogers, his son, then but thirteen years of age, carried the mail in 1845, on the route from Hastings to Ionia via Carlton, on horseback, once a Avcek, and through a country then so wild that over a nine-mile stretch of the road there was not a house to be seen. In 1853, Enos Dryer was appointed to the office, but Rogers did the work at his house as usual, as deputy, the cause of the transfer being the change of ad ministration from Whig to Democratic. Aster the death of Mr. Rogers, in 1854, Rowley Gifford became postmas ter, and aster him Truman P. Barnum. When Barnum retired and Peter Covert was appointed, the office was transferred to Carlton Centre, but shortly thereafter the mail-route that way was abolished, as was of course the office. In 1874 a mail-route was established from Hastings to Woodland, and the office in Carlton was revived, but re named Carlton Centre. James M. Covert was appointed, but resigned in 1878, and was succeeded by Thomas Blinston, the present incumbent. THE PIONEER SAW-MILL. Carlton is not, nor has it ever been, much of a town for mills. There is a good water-power on the Thornapple, but it has not been employed except for a few saw-mills. Grist-mill there has never been. Nelson Sprague built the first saw-mill, in 1843, on section 23, and after sawing a few logs saw it undermined and overturned by a sudden freshet. Sprague did not restore it, but disposed of the machinery to Moses Durkee and several of the Barnum boys, who transferred the concern to section 26, and there carried it on some time. PHYSICIAN. Dr. Joseph Adolphus was an early settler in Carlton, the first physician in the township, and the only one therein for many years. He had an extensive practice, was well and popularly known throughout the county, and was moreover a man much given to eccentricities of expression and action. When he courted the lady who afterwards became his wife, he used invariably, in his journeys to the house of her father, T. C. Smith, to ride into a hole that graced the side of the highway, led thereto doubtless by absent-mindedness and a disposition to let his horse have its own way. As often as he fell into the opeuing and off his horse he would exclaim with considerable emphasis, \" If I live until morn ing I'll have that hole filled up.\" Although he tumbled into the excavation regularly every night he made the trip to Mr. Smith's, and although he always vowed the hole should be filled up if he lived until morning, it is mod erately certain that the hole continued to yawn for him during his residence in Carlton. He Avas somewhat distin guished too for au extraordinary capacity for driving sud denly from bridges into the streams they crossed, but, des pite his mishaps in that directiou, he never came to greater hurt therefrom than an occasional ducking. Dr. Adolphus was esteemed a skillful physician, and previous to his BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS. Reuben Fuller, son of George Fuller and Lovica Wick ham Fuller, was the first white child born in Carlton. His birth occurred some time during 1837, and his death in 1838, so that he was likewise the first white person to die in the town. He was buried on the Fuller farm, upon the river-bank, and there his bones still repose. Harrison Wick ham's son Giles, born also in 1S37, was the second native, and Harrison Wickham's wife, who died Feb. 25, 1S43, was the first person buried in the cemetery near Carlton Centre. Elisha R. Carpenter and Elizabeth Wickham were the first couple married in the town. The wedding took place at the residence of the bride's father, Jan. 28, 1838, and to perform the ceremony Squire Henry Leonard, of Middle ville, walked over to Carlton through a deep snow.

The State road, \" from Hast ings to the Tyler settlement and Ada in Kent County,\" passed through Carlton, and was laid as to that portion by H. A. Goodyear and John Henyon, the commissioners, Dec. 9, 1846. JURORS IN 1816-47. In the year 1846 the labor performed on the highways in The jurors in 1846, chosen from Carlton, were John Barnum, Isaac Messer, P. K. Barnum, Paul Dennis, Jas. O. Foster, and Leonard Hale as grand jurors, and M. C. Barnum, Jacob Hale, John Henyon, E. R. Carpenter, Enos Dryer, and John Fuller as petit jurors. In 1847, Moses Durkee, I. H. Barnum, Stephen Riggs, Paul Den nis, W. G. Wooley, and Joseph Whitney were the grand jurors, and Elihu Covey, Wilson Odell, Alpheus Moore, Timothy Titus, George Fowler, and Wm. Vester were petit jurors. Carlton, under the assessment, aggregated 129 days. In 1850 the apportionment of highway money was as follows: District No. 1 $8.50 District No. 6 $3.75 \" \" 2 20.90 \u25a0' \u2022' 7 18.95 \" \" 3 18.17 \" \" 8 8.48 \" \" 4 13.55 \" \" 9 1.44 \" 5 12.40 \" \" 10 4.60 ORGANIZATION AND OEFICERS. Township 4 north, range 8 west, was included in Hast ings until Feb. 16, 1842, when, under an act of the Legis lature, it was separately organized and called Carlton, in accordance with the suggestion of Zebulon Barnum, who came hither from Carlton in New York State. The first town-meeting was held at \" the school-house, near John McAuley's,\" and on that occasion E. R. Carpenter was chosen supervisor. The early town records \u2014 from 1842 to 1846\u2014 were loosely kept on scraps of paper, and, these hav ing long since been lost, no details touching the election of town officials can be given antedating the year last named. From 1846, even, the list is not complete, but, such as it is, it is herewith given, including those who have been chosen annually to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and jus tices from 1846 to 1880 : CARLTON'S SCHOOLS. Carlton's first school was taught in 1839 by Elizabeth, wife of E. R.

After an ex perience of a few months Mrs. Carpenter gave up the task disheartened, declaring that she couldn't control the chil dren, and vowing that she wouldn't teach school another term for 40 acres of land. In 1840 it was decided to build a district school-house on section 20, but there was some public dissatisfaction at that choice of location, and a compromise was accordingly effected by the construction of two school-houses, \u2014 one at the Rogers \" Corners,\" and one at the centre of the town. Among the earliest school-teachers in Carlton were Caroline Wickham, Chloe, Ruth, and Lydia Benson, Eliza Dryer, Mary Kenfield, and Amy Benson. Truman P. Barnum, SUPERVISORS. 1846, E. R.

Mr. Daubney, of Gull Prairie, who preached the pioneer sermon in Hastings, and performed in Barry County excellent service as a Methodist Episcopal circuit-preacher in the days of its early history, visited Carlton early in 1840, and after preaching at the houses of John Henyon and Isaac Messer organized a Methodist Episcopal class in the Rogers school-house during the year mentioned. The organizing members of the class were E. R. Carpenter and wife, Mrs. Loisa Rogers, Mrs. John Henyon, Isaac Messer and wife, and George Fowler. Carpenter was appointed leader and Messer steward. Among those who joined the class directly after organization were Alpheus Moore, Lo vica Fuller, and Caroline Wickham. The class was in the Hastings Circuit, and, after Daubney, was in charge of Rev. Messrs. Bush, Worthington, and others. Since 1840 the class has maintained its organization continuously and enjoyed preaching quite regularly. Cynthia AVeller, April 8, 1854.

The Holmes Methodist Episcopal class of Carlton was organized in 1843, by Rev. E. L. Kellogg, of the Hastings Circuit, in the school-house on section 25. The organizing members were Levi Holmes and wife, Elizabeth Barnum, Henry Covey, and Esther Durkee, of whom Mr. and Mrs. Holmes and Esther Durkee are still members. The class was attached to the Hastings Circuit until 1863, when it was transferred to the Woodland Circuit. For a few years the class maintained only its original strength, but a revival then set in by which the membership was materially in creased. Preaching was at first supplied but once in four weeks. Since the transfer to the Woodland Circuit the ser vices have been fortnightly. Levi Holmes has been leader of the class ever since its formation, and was also stew ard until within a few years. He is likewise the local preacher, having been appointed in 1873. The present class-steward is Henry Hewes. The school-house served as a place of worship until 1874, when a handsome church edifice was erected on section 24. The class has 30 mem bers, and the Sunday school an average attendance of 25, John P. Phillips being the superintendent. The church trustees are Levi Holmes, P. R. Holmes, John P. Phillips, Henry B. Barnum, and Walter Sackett. JEREMIAH M. ROGERS. Jeremiah M. Rogers, son of Jered S. Rogers, one of the first settlers of the town of Carlton, and up to the time of his death its most prominent citizen, was born in the town of Hector, Tompkins Co , N. Y., March 17, 1832, and was the eldest son in a family of five boys and three girls. In 1836 there was a heavy emigration to the then Territory of Michigan, induced by the low price and fertility of its lands, and the elder Rogers, foreseeing the ultimate advan tages to be derived by his sons from an early settlement, de cided to emigrate. Accordingly, in the early part of 1836, he came to Carlton, and purchased a farm in the vicinity of what is now known as \" Rogers' Corners.\" Barry County at this time was one dense wilderness ; here and there a few adventurous pioneers had erected rude log cabins. Hast ings had not reached the distinction of a hamlet, and the first few years of Mr. Rogers' life in Carlton were marked by many an incident of privation and hardship. Jeremiah, or Jerry, as he is familiarly known, was at this time five years of age ; he recollects distinctly, however, the old \" Bunker Tavern,\" at Hastings, the first habitation built in the town. The elder Rogers was a thrifty, industrious farmer, and a man of remarkable energy, and he soon be came comparatively forehanded, and took a leading position among the early settlers in all matters. Jeremiah obtained his education at the log school-house, but what he failed to get there he has since obtained by reading and observation. He lived with his father up to the time of the latter's decease, when he purchased a part of the old farm, to which he has made repeated additions. He now owns about three hun dred acres of valuable land, and is one of the important farmers and stock-growers of the county. CARLTON CENTRE FREE METHODIST CLASS. This society was organized in 1876 by Rev. B. R. Jones, with a membership of 8, and attached to the Sanfield Cir cuit. The class is now on the Saranac Circuit in charge of Rev. Mr. Johnson, who preaches once in two weeks. Augustus Carpenter is the class-leader, and Wm. Jones the class-steward. SOUTH CARLTON UNITED BRETHREN CLASS. This class was formed in January, 1879, by Rev. B. F. Hungerford, in the Leach school-house, with 10 members. It is in the Thornapple mission, in which there are five points. A. H. Ickes is class-leader, and Z. T. Halstead, of Middleville, preacher in charge. R. J. Hinckley is class steward, and A. H. Ickes superintendent of the Sunday school, which has 4 teachers and about 30 scholars. In 1855, Mr. Rogers was married to Miss Betsey J. Furster, of Eaton Rapids. They have been blessed with four children, \u2014 Miles J., Nellie May, Clarence H., and Claude. In his political and religious affiliations he is a Repub lican and a Baptist. There are but few men in Carlton, if any, who have been more prominent in its history than he, no enterprise having for its object the advancement of the interests of the town but has found in him an enthusiastic patron. He has taken an active part in all religious and social matters, and his name is so stamped upon the his tory of the town that it cannot be effaced. CARLTON GRANGE, No. 264.

His grandfather, Joseph Pillsbury, was a soldier in the Revolution. He was a member of Washington's Life Guard, from which he was transferred to that of Gen. Lafayette. He served with distinction throughout the war, and at its close settled in Maine, where he died at an advanced age. Patriotism has always been a salient point in the character of the Pillsburys. Johnson Pillsbury, son of Joseph, and father of Theodore"], [613, "Residence of JEREMIAH M. R O GERS . Carlton Tr.BarryCo.,Mich"], [614, ""], [615, "CASTLETON TOWNSHIP. 417 L., was in the war of 1812. He was a man of positive character and inflexible integrity. He was married in 1781 to Miss Priscilla Cooper, a descendant of Governor Bartlett and a cousin of Peter Cooper, and reared a family of thir teen children, \u2014 nine girls and four boys. Theodore received an academical education, and upon the completion of his course entered a theological school, where he spent several years as a teacher and pupil. At the age of twenty-seven he was ordained, and commenced his ecclesiastical labors. He preached in Maine until 1844, when he was sent by the Baptist Home Missionary Society to Wisconsin. He located in Milwaukee, where he remained several years. As a minister he was zealous and energetic, and his labors were successful. regiment to the front, and evinced the same energy and en thusiasm in the field that he did in the pulpit, aud the tem poral and spiritual welfare of the soldiers in his charge were never neglected. He was compelled, however, to re sign his position before the close of the war on account of ill health. He returned to his home and assisted in raising a company for the Eleventh Michigan Cavalry. In 1835 the elder was married to Miss Mary N. Keene, of Waldoboro', Franklin Co., Me., where she was born, in 1814. She is a lady of culture and refinement, and highly esteemed by all who know her. Elder Pillsbury is a man of pronounced temperance principles, and has been an earnest worker in temperance reform. He delivered the first lecture upon temperance in Hastings, and perhaps no man in Barry County has done more in the advancement of the cause than he. From Milwaukee he went ten miles above Oshkosh, and founded the town of Omro ; from thence to Racine, where he preached several years. About this time his health failed, and he resigned his pastorate and engaged in the manufacture of carriages and wagons. In this enterprise he remained two years. He then sold his business and came to Barry County, and purchased the farm on which he now resides. He continued to preach, however, and for two years was the pastor of the Baptist Church in Woodland. He then established a church in Carlton, over which he presided until 1862, when he was elected chaplain of the Twenty-First Michigan Infantry. He accompanied the In his political belief Mr. Pillsbury was originally an Abolitionist, and many a fugitive slave he aided in obtaining freedom. On the organization of the Republican party he became an able exponent of its principles, and has since labored in its interests. Socially he is genial and courteous, winning and retaining the regard of all with whom he comes in contact. He has taken a conspicuous position in all enterprises devoted to the interests of Carlton, and is in every way worthy of the position he holds among the representatiA*e men of the county. \u25a0 i > tqflp < ti CASTLE TO N:* Castleton ranks with the leading townships of the county in enterprise, in the excellence and improved condi tion of its land, and in the number and influence of its rep resentative farmers. It is also distinguished for containing one of the most flourishing and rapidly growing villages in the State. which enters the township near the southwest corner and runs north into Thornapple Lake, affords an excellent water power for mill-purposes. Elm, oak, maple, and ash are the woods that most abound, though tamarack is found on the swampy land. Pine does not flourish, and the presence of even a single tree is a matter of remark. Castleton is designated on the United States survey as township No. 3 north, iu range 7 Avest, and is bounded on the north by Woodland, south by Maple Grove, east by Vermontville (^Eaton Co.), and west by Hastings. The surface of Castleton varies greatly. There are many declivities, some quite abrupt, but the larger proportion of the surface is moderately rolling. Level stretches of land are to be seen on some of the sections, which are very easily tilled and especially productive. The soil of these tracts is a gravelly loam with clay subsoil. In some localities a large proportion of sand is mixed with clay, while the usual quality of muck prevails in the low land which was formerly too wet for use, but which has mostly been reclaimed by an excellent drainage system. Wheat and other grains find here a congenial soil. The last census gives 1638 acres as the surface covered by wheat in 1873, which produced 25,689 bushels, while 1032 acres of corn gave a return of 28,479 bushels. Of other grains 21,277 bushels were har vested, while 1 145 tons of hay were also cut. The amounts of these crops raised last year are greatly in excess of the foregoing figures, but cannot be exactly stated at the time The Grand River Valley Railroad enters Castleton on the west line of section 30, runs thenee east, making a bend to the south, and leaving the township at section 36. Be sides a depot of considerable consequence at Nashville, it has a station formerly known as Sheridan, and now as Morgan, on section 30. Thornapple Lake lies on the western boundary, covering portions of sections 19 and 30, while a small body of water known as Mud Lake is found on section 16. Thornapple River flows from the southeast corner of the township northwest into Thornapple Lake, and Mud Creek enters on the north line irf section 2, meanders to the southwest, and pours its waters into the same reservoir.

The earliest birth in the township was that of Mr. Mudge's daughter Cordelia, who was born May 5, 1838. At his house was also held the first religious service in Castleton, Elder Bush having officiated. Mr. Mudge still resides on his old farm, and, though at an advanced age, actively superintends the work upon it. In the summer of 1837, James W. Clapp, of Syracuse, N. Y., bought 240 acres on section 25 and 80 acres on section 26, but did not locate upon his purchase. William P. Wilkinson, of Vermontville, Eaton Co., purchased of him a portion of the land on section 25, and iu the winter of 1837 became the second resident in the township. These two early pioneers saw but little of each other, the want of roads and difficulty of travel making social inter course almost impossible. Harvey N. Sheldon, section 1 89 0. B.

Indians there were in abundance, who came eA'ery year to occupy their wigwams in the sugar-groves or dwelt along the streams, the banks of which were frequented by deer, and the waters of which were well supplied with fish. The neighboring townships were dotted here and there with settlers' cabins, but none were to be seen in Castleton. The third man in order of settlement was Dimmick Bennett, a native of Brockport, in the Empire State, who had made a brief sojourn in Calhoun County before his removal to this township, in the winter of 1838. Mr. Wilkinson welcomed him to his humble abode, where he and his family remained during the winter, repairing the following spring to a log house which he had erected on an 80-acre tract on section 26. He afterwards moved to sec tion 32, where he resided until his death, in 1848. In the spring of 1838 came also William Cross, who remained with Wilkinson during the summer while preparing a home for his household. Ebenezer Seeley had in 1836 entered 640 acres, one-half of which was on section 32, which was divided between Lorenzo Mudge, Kenyon Mead, and Anson Seeley. Lorenzo Mudge, a native of Vermont, removed to Mich igan from Koyalton, Niagara Co., N. Y., and was the first settler in what is now the township of Castleton. He pur chased the southeast quarter of section 32. He and his family, consisting of his wife and two children, besides a hired man, arrived at Eli Lapham's house (now in Maple Grove) on Monday night, Sept. 18, 1837, and took up their abode in a shanty which Mr. Lapham had just va cated. The next day after their arrival Mr. Mudge and the hired man commenced to chop a road through to the the land of the former, on section 32, which occupied them sour days. On Saturday, the 23d of September, the fam ily and household goods were moved over to the place that was to be their new home. Ansel Seeley was also a pioneer of 1838, having re moved from Niagara Co., N. Y., and located upon a portion of the land before mentioned as having been entered by his brother, Ebenezer Seeley, in 1836. Mr. Seeley entered the township via Battle Creek, following an Indian trail, then the only species of highway to be found in the eastern part of Barry County. He repaired at once to the house of his brother-in-law, Lorenzo Mudge, where his family remained while a shanty was being built on section 32, Mr. Mudge assisting in its erection. Stout ropes made of elm-bark were found to be very useful in handling the logs. Mr. Seeley brought with him a pair of small sashes, which served the purpose of a window, while a door was extem porized from a blanket. The Indians were of much service in providing supplies for the table. They were also skillful in dressing the skin of the deer, which made serviceable garments for use during the rough labor incident to clearing. Mr. Seeley had a suit of this material which did excellent service. In 1877 Mr. Seeley removed from his original farm to one of 130 acres on section 34, where he now resides. Upon the land were three wigwams in which the Indi ans dwelt duriug the sugar season. From one of these Mr. Mudge removed the sap-troughs aud other accompaniments of the sugar-bush, and occupied it as a temporary residence. When the original owners, on their return from a hunting expedition, discovered the intruder, they showed much in dignation, hut became friendly when assured of considerate and fair treatment at his hands. They often appeared at his house for purposes of traffic, and occasionally made him social visits. Joseph Rasey and four son9, Oliver, Otis, Joseph H., and Jonah B., residents of St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., re moved thence to Ohio in 1836, and to Castleton in 1838. There they located upon 80 acres on section 13, purchased of Tolman C. Hall, of Battle Creek. Mr. Clapp's house was opened to them until a log shanty could be erected, to which they then repaired. Mr. Mudge erected a one-story log structure, to which he added another story when settlers arrived who were able to assist in raising. Mrs. Mudge for eight months did not behold the face of a white woman, though she was visited by plenty of squaws. Mr. Mudge pays a high compliment to the integrity of the Indian race, declaring that dishonesty was the rare excep tion in their transactions with the whites. Their besetting vice was a fondness for whisky. Even when intoxicated they never annoyed him, for, although their approach to his place was heralded by frantic shouts and yells, these imme diately ceased on their entering his clearing. One sober man usually accompanied the party and maintained order. In Mr. Racey's family was celebrated the first marriage, the parties being Mr. William P. Wilkinson and Miss Eleanor Racey. Mr. Racey died in the township in 1869. His son, Jonah B., is now a resident of Nashville; Joseph H. resides in Charlotte, Mich., while Oliver and Otis are both deceased."], [618, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 420 From Saratoga Co., N. Y., William Cross came to Mich igan in 1834, though Castleton did not claim him as a resident until eight years later. He purchased 160 acres on section 15, upon the half of which he settled and built a log house. Mr. Cross early planted an orchard, which grew among the stumps and logs, but ultimately yielded excellent fruit. He died in 1860. His son James now resides on the estate. A. B. Cooper left Covert, Seneca Co., N. Y., in 1838, for Michigan, and on his arrival settled in what is now Woodland, across the road from his present residence. In 1843 he purchased and moved upon the farm he still occu pies, in Castleton. When the Indians of this vicinity were ordered to move West, they visited Mr. Cooper and asked his counsel. He advised them to purchase small tracts of land and become citizens. Many of them adopted this suggestion, and re mained for years unmolested by the government. A few of the original band and their descendants still remain. Early religious services were conducted by Elder Shaw at the house of Mr. Cooper, though the meagre population af forded but few Avorshipers. D. W. Smith, a native of New York, removed from In diana to this township in 1844. He purchased, on section 13, 40 acres, which he has since increased to 200. Mr. and Mrs. Smith remained in Battle Creek while a shelter was being erected, to which they repaired before the struc ture was completed or even the floor laid. They were not, however, dismayed by these inconveniences, and began their pioneer labors with brave hearts. Hastings Avas then the most convenient place to go to mill, and Battle Creek the emporium of trade, to which a pilgrimage was made with ox-teams whenever crops were to be sold or supplies purchased. Early religious services were held at the houses of the settlers, and at the various school-houses as they were, from time to time, erected. Mr. Smith is still a resident on his original purchase and actively engaged in the supervision of his farm. Kenyon Mead, of Niagara Co., N. Y., located in the fall of 1834 upon 80 acres on section 32, originally entered by Ebenezer Seeley. A shanty erected for the manufacture of maple-sugar afforded his family a habitation until a house could be built during the following Avinter. His near neighbors at this early date were Lorenzo Mudge, Eli Lapham, of Maple Grove, Ansel Seeley, aud Seth Davis, who located on section 33 in 1840, and was appointed postmaster in 1842. He removed from the township afterwards. Mr. Mead at once cleared seven acres, which he sowed Avith wheat the following soil. To have the wheat ground when the harvest was reaped involved a journey of eighteen miles to Bellevue. Mr. Mead has since removed to section 35, within the limits of Nashville. William Clifford, formerly of Wayne Co., N. Y., was a pioneer of 1845, having purchased 80 acres on section 2, upon which section he chopped the first tree. A brother had previously located in Woodlaud, with whom Mr. Clifford's family remained while a log house Avas in process of erection. Cyrus Buxton, a former resident of Vermont, became a settler on 160 acres on section 33 in 1840, which he found wholly uninproved. He erected a shanty and aftenvards a framed house, the first in the township. Ten acres of cleared land bore evidence of his industry the first year of his settlement, and bountiful crops Avere soon after har vested. Mr. Buxton later purchased the whole of section 34, and in 1873 removed to 80 acres, where he now resides. James Walker, a pioneer from the Buckeye State, pur chased, in 1845, 40 acres on section 22. A rude cabin had been erected, but no clearing had been made, except that the timber on a small area had been chopped down. Mr. Walker performed almost the entire labor of clearing this land without the aid even of a yoke of oxen, which he did not acquire until several years afterwards. Maple-sugar was a sort of circulating medium at that date, and many household supplies were purchased with it. A band of In dians were encamped near by at the time of Mr. Walker's arrival, who had been on very intimate terms with David Sparks, the former owner of the land and the occupant of the cabin before mentioned. He would sometimes indulge in a boisterous revel with them. On one occasion he in duced them to share their whisky with him by promising that when it was exhausted he would reciprocate the favor from an ample supply which he claimed to have. But when the time came for him to redeem his promise it was found that there were no assets in the bank, or, in other words, no whisky in his cabin. Asa Ware came to Calhoun County in 1836 and to Cas tleton in 1842, where he located himself upon 80 acres of section 29, purchased the year before. His son, William A. Ware, had purchased, in 1840, 80 acres on section 33, and had already made a clearing and erected a house, where Asa Ware lived while making his own farm habitable. Mr. Ware cleared 10 acres the first year, and continued to improve his place until his decease, in 1868. His son Anson is now a resident of section 32. William A. Ware, at whose house the early electors convened for the first township meeting, was an active resident of the township, holding many public positions until his death, in 1869. Harvey N. and Orson B. Sheldon each entered land on section 1 in 1843, upon which they located and made im provements, although they did not remain permanent residents of the township. Harvey N. removed to St. Joseph County, and Orsou B. made Hastings his residence, where his death occurred. Isaac E. Everts was a pioneer of this date, and an active citizen of the township. I. B. Riggs, formerly of Niagara Co., N. Y., purchased 82 acres on section 5 in 1843, upon which he made his home. He passed through the usual vicissitudes of pioneer life, and died upon the farm first mentioned, which is now occupied by his son-in-law, D. H. Hager. They were greatly enraged at this, and threatened to fire his building and to slaughter him and his family. The counsels of their chief and of some of the older men in duced them to forego their revenge, but they never forgave the deceit practiced upon them, aud were frequently heard by Mr. Walker and his family threatening vengeance against their enemy. The wise of Mr. Walker, now Mrs. Erikson, still resides upon the farm. Thomas Blasdell, a pioneer from Wayne Co., N. Y., in 1846, located upon his present farm, embracing 160 acres"], [619, "LORENZO MUDGE. MRS. LORENZO MUDQ-E. LORENZO MUDGE. sticks, while one window, which he had brought from the East, admitted all the light. This was the first house in Castleton ; the nearest settlement was at Hastings, while north was an unbroken wilderness. One day, during mid winter, an Indian brought the welcome intelligence that a white man had settled north of the Thornapple. Mr. Mudge got the Indian to conduct him to the place, where he found Dimmick Bennet and family, who had just arrived ; it was eight months, however, before Mrs. Mudge had the pleasure of seeing a white woman. The pioneer life of the family was fraught with many trials and privations ; his only resources were an ox-team, a cow, and a small store of provisions. As showing his impecunious condition and the rigid economy they were obliged to practice, he refers to the fact that for some time he was obliged to clothe his boys in buckskin, bought from the Indians, cloth being a luxury that his limited means would not allow. But Mr. Mudge has lived to see the wilderness transformed into one of the most fertile and productive regions in the county, and the town' of which he is virtually the founder take a foremost position. , This venerable pioneer, the first settler in the town of Castleton, was born in Plymouth, Windsor Co., Vt., Dec. 26, 1809. His father, John Mudge, was a farmer, and a native of Massachusetts. He married a Miss Emma White, of New Hampshire, and reared a family of eight children. In 1821 the family removed to Niagara Co., N. Y., where the elder Mudge purchased a new farm in the town of Hartland, where he resided until his death, which occurred in June, 1834. Upon this farm the boyhood days of our subject were passed, sharing the privations of a pioneer family and receiving a limited common-sehool education. He acknowledged obligation to his father in his labor until he was twenty-one, when he engaged in farming, in com- pany with his brothers. In March, 1834, he was married to Miss Emeline Seeley, of Niagara County, a young lady of many personal attractions. In February, 1837, Mr. Mudge started for Michigan with his family, which con- sisted of his wife and two sons, Royal and Justice. After a journey devoid of incident worthy of mention, he ar- rived in Battle Creek, where he spent the summer. In September he came on to the farm where he now resides, whioh had been purchased, in 1836, by his brother-in-law, Ebenezer Seeley. The journey from Battle Creek to Cas- tleton was attended with great labor and difficulties. Six miles north of Battle Creek, Mr. Mudge came to the end of the road, and from that point to where he now lives was a trackless wilderness, and he was obliged to cut his road the entire, distance. He came by the way of Eli Lapham's, in Maple Grove ; five days of hard labor were oonsumed in getting from that point. On arriving at his land he found three Indian wigwams ; he moved into one of them while he constructed a log house, an exceedingly primitive affair, with its roof of shakes, floor of hewed logs, a chimney of In 1843, Mrs. Mudge died, and June 17, 1844, he was again married, to Miss Ruth K. Hyde, daughter of Eliphalet Hyde, one of the early settlers of Hastings. Upon the organization of the town Mr. Mudge was elected its first treasurer, and he has since filled many positions of trust He was a member of the first grand jury, and his name is affixed to all the initial events in the history of Castleton. In his religious belief he is a Methodist. Politically, he was originally a Whig, but identified himself with the Republican party upon its formation. He has always been a pronounced temperance man and an anti-Mason. In his domestic relations he is a devoted husband and a kind father, and in every way an exemplary man and a valuable eitizen."], [620, ""], [621, "CASTLETON TOWNSHIP. 421 on section 15, which he had purchased from Matthew Lock head as early as 1838. It was secured by him as early as 1838, and remained unimproved during the interval. On his arrival Mr. Blasdell remained three weeks at the home of Benjamin Winans, on the same section, who, together with Mr. Cross, were near neighbors. With the aid of a carpenter from the East he erected a house and barn, and, having hired ten acres cleared, he sowed it with wheat, which afforded him a much-needed crop. He also brought a pair of horses from New York, but, soon learning the superiority of oxen in pioneer labor, exchanged his horses for those useful animals. Mr. Blasdell still resides on his place. The honor of christening the new township fell to Wil liam P. Wilkinson, who, desiring to perpetuate the memory of his native village in the Green Mountain State, named it Castleton. At the first township-meeting the moderator neglected to appoint a clerk. This necessitated a second meeting, which was held at the house of William A. Ware, on the 19th day of April, 1842, when 18 offices Avere filled by 20 elec tors. The following were the officers chosen : Ansell Seeley, Supervisor; Cyrus Buxton, Township Clerk; Lorenzo Mudge, Treasurer; Cyrus Buxton, Isaac E. Everts, and John W. Stedge, School Inspectors; W. P. Wilkinson, Asa Ware, Directors of the Poor ; J. W. Stedge, I. E. Everts, Dimmick Bennet, Highway Commissioners ; Seth Davis, I. E. Everts, Cyrus Buxton, Justices of the Peace ; W. P.

George Feighuer, a former resident of Ohio, purchased 40 acres on section 22 in 1847. He found a welcome among his neighbors until a house was erected. Immediately afterwards he devoted himself to the work of improving his land, and cleared 10 acres the first year, besides doing a great deal of work for others. Mr. Feighuer subsequently removed to Hastings, but in 1869 resumed his residence in Castleton, on section 22. During the same year the United States government es tablished a post-office within the township, when Seth Davis received a commission as the earliest postmaster. The second one was Sheldon Whitcomb, and his successor was Lorenzo Mudge. The officers elected since that time haA*e been as follows : Alexander Price, who purchased 80 acres on section 23, previously owned by John Jeffries, found it inclosed on his arrival, in 1847, and tenanted only by Indians, who had erected shanties and were disinclined to vacate. Mr. Price at once built a log house, enjoying the hospitality of Wil liam P. Wilkinson during its construction. He is still a successful farmer on the same land. 1843. \u2014 Orson Sheldon, Supervisor ; John AV. Stedge, Township Clerk; Isaac E. Everts, Treasurer; H. 0.

Corsett, a grist-mill was built (the latter having been a mill wright), containing two run of stone, which was conducted by them until 1877 successfully. Mr. Lathrop, in 1880, removed to Ripon, Wis., and Mr. Corsett made Middleville, Barry Co., his residence, where his death occurred. Their successors were Norton & Higdon, the latter's interest hav ing, later, been sold. The present proprietors are Messrs. Norton & Walker. It is exclusively confined to custom work, both flour and feed being ground. E. E. Cook opened a blacksmith-shop in 1865, but the year following removed to Morgan. The earliest road in the township was probably surveyed by Cephas Smith, in 1841 or 1842 (as nearly as recollected by the first settler), and beginning at the base-line between sections 32 and 33, ran north one and a half miles, then west on the quarter-section line two miles, passing the farms of Lorenzo Mudge and Kenyon Mead. In August, 1842, a highway was surveyed by Cephas Smith four rods in width, c6mmencing at the southwest corner of section 26, thence due north two miles to the southeast corner of section 15. The highway commis sioners at this time were Isaac E. Everts and John W. Stedge. MORGAN. Mr. E. E. Cook may be said to have been the leading spirit in founding this little burg, which was formerly known as Sheriden. He purchased, in 1866, 80 acres of land of James Sweezey, of Hastings, and erected a saw-mill, which was later sold to its present owner, David Ruckle. Mr. Cook then returned to his former occupation as presiding genius of the anvil and forge. Z. B. Wilson made his advent as a merchant in 1869, and erected a store which contained a general stock adapted to the wants of his neigh boring patrons. Four years later he sold to Horace Hall, who erected a building and now conducts the enterprise, while he holds also the commission of postmaster. David Ruckle came in 1871 and opened a store, in which he keeps a general stock of goods. He has also bought the saw-mill property. Dr. C. 0. Seott is the practicing physician of the hamlet. Another road, the survey of which was made by Cephas Smith, dated Aug. 31, 1842, \" Began at the southwest corner of section 24 and followed a course due north, one mile, to the northwest corner of section 24.\" As settlers moved into the north and east portions of the township, roads were surveyed in accordance Avith their needs. SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL STATISTICS. The year 1842 witnessed the earliest effort towards the establishment of a public school in Castleton. A school house of logs was built during that year on the northwest quarter of section 32, then embraced in district No. 1, by Messrs. Mudge, Ware, Davis, Mead, and Buxton. The young lady who guided the youthful minds of that early period was Miss Ellen Gilbert. Kenyon Mead was repre sented by one scholar, Lorenzo Mudge by two, Ansel See ley by two, and Seth Davis by four. A small school had previously been taught by Mrs. 01iA*e Racey, at her house, with a few scholars from her own immediate family and the homes of a neighbor or two, but this was strictly speak ing a private enterprise. The second school building in Castleton was soon after erected on the farm of Mr. Racey, on section 24. THE VILLAGE OF NASHVILLE. The importance of this young and aspiring village should not be gauged by the duration of its history, which as yet barely numbers a dozen years of activity and growth. The major portion of the land on which it is built was pur chased from the government during the years 1836-37 for purposes of speculation. From that date until 1855 no improvements whatever were made. A little later a mill was erected, as well as a few rude structures necessary to accommodate the men employed iu its operation, and these remained until about 1864 the only forerunners of the future flourishing village. The township now embraces seven whole and three frac tional districts, who have as a board of directors the follow ing gentlemen: C. Ainsworth, D. W. Smith, Albert C. Gallatin, George Wellman, Ira Bachellor, Edward Cook, Walter Barnhart, H. P. Feagles, H. E. Downing, Elmer Cole. Six hundred and eight scholars receive instruction, of whom 17 are non-residents. They are under the super vision of 8 male and 15 female teachers, who receive an aggregate yearly sum of $2363.25. The total value of school property in Castleton is $4615, which embraces one brick and ten frame structures. The total resources of the township for educational purposes are $3475.25. In 1865 the village was first platted by Robert B. Gregg. In 1866 the Grand River Valley Railroad was projected, and the preliminary survey made. In Jan uary, 1869, the first train passed over the recently-com pleted railroad, and then began an almost unprecedented era of progress. The land embraced within the corporate limits of Nash ville was originally purchased from the government, as follows : BARRYVILLE. IN CASTLETON. This place can hardly be called even a hamlet. It is simply the point where a custom grist-mill is situated. The first to utilize the water-poAver was Solomon M. Allen, avIio built a saw-mill on the bank of Higbbank Creek. It passed successively to Elijah Alden, Oliver C. Comstock, and Lathrop & Corsett. On Section 25. \u2014 The southwest quarter by Ichabod Clark, of Genesee Co., N.

IJenry Feighuer, a previous resident of Ohio, came in 1852, accompanied by his brother Solomon, to the town ship of Castleton. He had been intrusted by his father with the purchase of land in the vicinity, and accordingly located 880 acres in that township, including the land upon which stood the saw-mill before mentioned, then owned by Hiram Hanehett. Solomon Feighuer became the successor of Mr. Hanehett in the management of the mill, but car ried it on only a short time, when it became the property of his brother Henry. Mr. Feighuer, after the sale of the property, repaired to the farm he now occupies, which is within the corporate limits of the village, though not platted. His father and three brothers, John, William, and Solomon, also became residents of the village and town ship. IN MAPLE GROVE. On Section 1. \u2014 The north half by Simeon Griffin, of Tioga Co., N. Y., April 6, 1S37. On Section 2. \u2014 The northwest quarter by Benjamin Tate, of Hillsdale Co., Mich., April 17, 1837 ; the northeast quarter by Charles S. Briggs, of Windham Co., Conn., July 11, 1837. It will thus be seen that Nashville embraces portions of the townships of Castleton and Maple Grove, two of the most attractive townships of the county.* Pursuing its devious way through the central portion of the village limits is the Thornapple River, a stream which, aside from the picturesque beauty it imparts to the landscape, serves a more useful purpose in affording an excellent water-power, which has been for a quarter of a century utilized tor com mercial purposes. Jacob Purkey, who had moved from Eaton County in 1856 to the northwest portion of Castleton, subsequently exchanged his land there for property within the present village limits, to which he removed in 1860, and upon which he still resides. The only improvement on his land at that time was a log house erected by the former owner, Archibald A. Graham, only a short time previous. Henry P. Ralston, also a former resident of the Buckeye State, after residing from 1852 to about 1857 in another part of the township, purchased 70 acres now embraced within the limits of Nashville. No indication of the suture enter prising village was apparent when he became a settler. PLATS AND ADDITIONS. The earliest plat of the village was made, as has been stated, by Robert B. Gregg, the survey having been com pleted on the 2d day of October, 1865, by Joshua Martin. The official record thus describes the territory of the in tended village : \"Located on the west half of the northwest quarter of section thirty-six, in township three north, of range seven west, in the county of Barry and State of Michigan, the survey commencing at the north east quarter of lot number one; bearing taken, stone eighteen inches long, sixteen inches wide, and twelve inches thick, north ten degrees and thirty minutes east three chains and five links. Said stone is north forty-three degrees and fifteen minutes west ninety-five links from the northwest corner of Stauffer and Kuhlman's storehouse, and is the northwest corner of Leonard Stauffer's land. The lots are fifty five feet north and south by one hundred and thirty-two feet east and west, excepting lots number 24, 25, 42, 43, 60, 61, 66, 67, 84, 85, which are sixty-six feet north and south by one hundred and thirty-two feet east and west, and the fractional lots, the dimensions of which are represented in feet by the figures on the margin of the lots in the plat. Main Street and Queen Street are sixty-six feet wide, and run north one degree west from the magnetic meridian. All other streets are sixty feet wide, and run at right angles with Main Street, except ing Sherman Street, which runs north eighty seven degrees and forty five minutes east, and is sixty-six feet wide. The alleys are twelve feet wide, about thirty feet and four inches being given for Middle Street, on the east, which runs north two degrees and tbirty-five minutes west from the magnetic meridian.\" Alanson W. Phillips, who came from Cortland Co., N. Y., to another portion of Castleton in 1857, subsequently acquired 320 acres on the south side of the Thornapple River, a part of which he platted as a portion of the vil lage of Nashville. Samuel R. Clendenin came from the Golden State, and in 1856 secured 33 acres near Hanchett's saw-mill. He was a blacksmith by trade, and found active employment in the exercise of his craft. Mr. Clendenin presided over the anvil and forge for many years, and remained upon the land he purchased until his death in 1872. The house he built is now occupied by his daughter, Mrs. Ralston. O. A. Phillips, a former resident of Broome Co., N. Y., purchased, in 1863, 80 acres on section 36 in Castleton, a small portion of which is now platted, but the greater part of which is still cultivated as a farm. John Webster arrived in 1864, and erected a blacksmith-shop on the north side of the river, which, as business increased, was removed to the more populous south side. To the original plat the following additions have been made : A. AV. Phillips' addition, surveyed by Joshua Martin, and dated Sept. 26, 1866. COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES * Only a small portion, however, is in Maple Grove, and that is outside of the thickly built part of tho place. It may therefore be considered as practically a village of the township of Castleton. The years 1864 and 1865, especially the latter, were fraught with significance in the history of. the hamlet."], [625, "THOS. BLASDELL Residence of THOMAS BLASDELL, Castleton, Mich"], [626, ""], [627, "CASTLETON TOWNSHIP. 425 During the former year Leonard Stauffer became the pio neer in mercantile enterprise. He erected a building on the site of the residence of Philip Holler, and, in connection with William Feighuer, placed in it a small stock of goods adapted to the very meagre patronage they were likely to attract, the rude structure doing duty both as store and dwelling. having advocated the measure. The name it bears was given in honor of Mr. Nash, the chief engineer of the Grand River Valley Railroad, although he was in nowise identi fied with the place. The young lady who has the honor of being the first child born within the present corporation limits is Miss Hattie, daughter of Robert B. Gregg, whose advent oc curred in 1865. The following year Mr. Robert B. Gregg, with a pre monition of the advancement that awaited the little village, determined on surveying and platting the ground he owned. Mr. Gregg having carried out this plan, the lots were offered for sale, the first one being purchased by Enos Kuhlman, a brother-in-law of Mr. Stauffer, who had become associated with him in his mercantile venture. A clergyman was early summoned from Vermontville to unite in matrimonial bonds Mr. M. V. B. Mallett and Miss Alcesta Price, this happy event having been the earliest marriage in the village. On the 4th of July, 1867, occurred the first national celebration in Nashville, when three thousand people as sembled on the river-bank, east of Main Street, and listened to the patriotic strains of a barrister from Calhoun County. After this the forest was rapidly felled to make way for the log structures which followed the arrival of each new settler. Among those who early became owners of lots were George Boyer, Israel Wright, Ephraim Church, and William Killen. William Feighuer afterwards erected a building and opened a grocery-store, while John Markler and William Parker were among the mechanics of the place. Dr. J. H. Palmer guarded the health of the hamlet, and was for at least two years without a rival. In 1874 the prosperity of the village suffered a check by reason of a serious conflagration which swept away property upon Main Street valued at nearly $20,000. The result of this calamity was for a while a general feeling of depres sion, but a reaction eventually followed iu its wake, and new and more imposing edifices arose in place of the old ones. So great has been the growth and success of this village, numbering little more than ten years of develop ment, that it now ranks as the second commercial and manufacturing centre in Barry County, and its course is still steadily onward and upward. A decided impulse was given to business enterprise by the erection of a grist-mill on the Thornapple River by Eli M. and M. V. B. Mallett, and G. W. Johnson. The project of a railroad had also assumed such proportions as to war rant the most sanguine predictions of success. The year 1866 witnessed the arrival of two of Nashville's early merchants, D. C. Griffith and L. J. Wheeler, the lat ter of whom had previously been a resident of Woodland. After an active career of three years in the army he repaired to Nashville and erected a building sixty by twenty feet in dimensions on the site now occupied by the shoe-shop of E. A. Bush. In this, in connection with his partners, \u2014 - the firm having been Wheeler. Downing & Co., \u2014 he opened a store with a general assortment of goods. In 1873 he built the brick store at present occupied by him, and two years later his attractive brick residence. SCHOOLS. During the year 1866 it became apparent that there were a number of children in Nashville for whom educational advantages should be provided. A notice was circulated that at a time specified a \" bee\" would be held for the pur pose of erecting a school-house. The call met a prompt response, and on the day appointed, before darkness ap proached, the school-house was in actual existence. It could hardly be commended for beauty of design, but served well the purpose for which it was erected. After a more spacious structure had superseded it, the former building did service as a barn on one of the neighboring streets. The first school numbered thirteen children, who were under the care of Miss Aggie Smith (now Mrs. C. M. Putnam). The school-house, which was said not to have been discernible from a short distance, so thick was the forest, also did duty as a church and Sunday-school room. Mr. Griffith moved from Ingham County to Nashville early in 1866, and built a store on the site now occupied by Messrs. Francis & Boise, on Main Street. Mr. Griffith subsequently embarked in the grain trade, and in 1875 erected the brick building in which he now carries on busi ness. About 1867 a gentleman named Reed opened a store in Nashville, but his mercantile career extended over a period of only two years. The present school building was erected in 1868, and, although at that time apparently large and comfortable, the growing demands of the place have made more extensive quarters a necessity. The teachers who have filled posi tions in connection with the Nashville school since its first organization are, in order of service by terms, as follows : Lewis Durkee was attracted to the village in 1866, and, in connection with Hiram Coe, embarked in the sale of groceries on Main Street. The railroad having been com pleted in January, 1869, he engaged in its service, in which he remained six years. He is still a citizen of the village and engaged in active business pursuits. Clement Smith began the practice of laAv in 1868, but has since removed to Hastings, and is now judge of probate. Miss Aggie Smith. Mrs. Anna Lamb. Miss Marion Warren. Mr. Clement Smith. Miss Mary Ely. Mrs. L. 0. Crocker. Miss Hattie Burlingham. Mrs. Irish. From this time various professional and mechanical pur suits were represented as the hamlet advanced, and in 1869 the Legislature bestowed a village charter upon it. This act occasioned much apparent surprise to the leading citi zens, and no resident has yet assumed the responsibility of Mrs. L. 0. Crocker. Mr. Frank Lathrop. Miss Mary Barney. Miss Frank M.

He was until 1877 employed in the office of Clement Smith, the present probate judge of Barry County, after which he opened an office of his own, and is still in practice. W. S. Powers began his professional studies in Ohio, and sub sequently graduated from the law school of Ann Arbor University. He came to Nashville from Eaton County in 1877, having for a brief period been a practitioner in Bellevue. Mrs. C. Van Arnam. Miss Alice McNair. Miss Emma Russell. Mr. R. W. Huntington. Mrs. A. J.

The church at Nashville was embraced in the Woodland Circuit until the year 1868, when it was set apart as an independent charge, with the following appointments: County Farm, Mudge's, Castleton Centre, and Martin's School-house. Miss Mary Hindmarch. The present school, under the superintendence of R. M. Payne and an able corps of assistants, is organizad on the \" graded\" plan, and has gained an enviable reputation for thoroughness and excellence in all its departments. The'earliest society in connection with this church was formed in 1866, under the supervision of Rev. T. J. Spen cer, then connected with the Woodland Circuit. The members embraced in the first class were George Gregg, E. M. Mallett and wife, Minor Mallett and wife, L. J. Wheeler, and Mrs. Clendennin. The grist-mill erected by Mallett & Johnson then afforded a place of meeting, the first service having been conducted by Rev. H. J. Richards. Soon after a log building was erected as a temporary school house, which was located in the rear of the present Yates Block. This structure was placed at the disposal of the band of worshipers until a small framed building owned by Mr. Appleman afforded more ample accommodations. THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY OF NASHVILLE. The first physician to establish himself in Nashville was Dr. J. H. Palmer, who followed his profession there from 1865 until 1867 without a rival or a colleague. During the latter year Dr. C. W. Wickham came from Eaton County, his former home. He is still in active practice at Nashville. Dr. Wickham was followed in the spring of 1870 by Dr. H. A. Barber, of Lansing, Mich., who had been a practitioner in Minnesota before returning to his native State. He was the first representative of the hom\u0153o pathic school in Nashville, where he has since remained. He is an active member of the State Hom\u0153opathic Medi cal Society, as well as the vice-president of the Hom\u0153o pathic Medical Society of Barry and Eaton Counties. On the erection of the present school-house a still more convenient place of meeting was offered. The earliest Sunday-school was organized in 1806, with E M. Mallett as superintendent. In 1869, with a view to the erection of a church edifice, lots were purchased of Robert Gregg, and the following year a building Avas erected under the ministrations of Rev. R. Pengally. The pastors in succes sion have been Rev. T. J. Spencer, Rev. J. S. Harder, Rev. R. Pengally, Rev. L. M. Edmonds, Rev. C. H. Ellis, Rev. J. M. Akin, Rev. E. L. Kellogg, Rev. C. G. Thomas, Rev. N. L. Brockway, and the present pastor in charge, Rev. A. D. Newton. A flourishing Sunday-school is connected with the church, of which L. J. Wheeler is superintendent. It numbers 150 scholars, with a constantly increasing attend ance. Arthur Ainsworth is librarian, and J. C. F. Dillon secretary. The present board of trustees of the church are Lorenzo Mudge, Jacob Purkey, D. Staley, H. Coe, Dr. H. A. Barber. Dr. W. H. Young, formerly of Toronto, Canada, became a resident of Nashville in 1870, where he has ever since practiced. He is a graduate of the medical department of Toronto University and of the Detroit Medical College, and is also a member of the State Medical Society. Dr. W. H. Griswold, a native of Olivet, Eaton Co., Mich., en gaged in the practice of medicine in Nashville in October, 1878, having formerly resided in Maple Grove. He is a graduate of the Detroit Hom\u0153opathic Medical College, from which he received his diploma in 1875. Dr. F. A. Jones has just begun the practice of his profession in Nashville, having arrived in the spring of 1880. THE LEGAL PROFESSION. The capacity of the building is unequal to the wants of the large concourse of worshipers, and as a result a more commodious edifice will doubtless supersede it. Lewis Durkee became a resident of Nashville iu 1866, and for several years was engaged in business pursuits. Having during this time devoted much attention to the study of law, he obtained admission to the bar and entered on the practice of his profession, in which he is still actively engaged. Abijah M. Flint, a native of Eaton Co , Mich., came to this village in 1868. He made but a brief stay at that time, removing to Kansas, where he remained six years. In 1875 he returned to Nashville, and is now fol lowing his profession at that place. BAPTIST CHURCH. The earliest meetings of the Baptist Society were held at the school-house, and the subject of organization was dis cussed at a gathering of those interested, which took place Dec. 1, 1868, Rev. P. C. Bassett acting as moderator and L. E. Stauffer secretary pro tern. The following persons on this occasion presented themselves for membership by letter: Rev. P. C. Bassett, Jonah Racey, Rosetta Racey, Mariah Barnes, Lucinda Raymond, P. L. E. Stauffer, Jane C. H. Brady, formerly of Calhoun County, graduated from the law school of Ann Arbor University in 1874,"], [629, "CASTLETON TOWNSHIP. 427 E. Bassett, Rev. J. H. Straight, M. C. Straight, M. Cross, J. Steadman, and S. T. Stauffer. The following were re ceived on profession of faith: Mrs. H. C. Appleman and W. H. Barnes. Services were at this time conducted in the school-house, and later in a hall secured for the pur pose. In 1876, Fred Appleman, W. A. Whittaker, and Mark Detrick were chosen trustees. During the same year measures were taken for the erection of a church edifice, which was later completed, the structure being built of brick, and costing, together Avith the ground upon which it stands, $3300. The pastors in succession since the year of organization have been Rev. P. C. Bassett, Rev. John Dunham, Rev. Lester Monroe, Rev. W. R. Northrop, Rev. C. B. Shear, Rev. L. H. Monroe, and various other clergy men who have filled the pulpit as supplies. The present trustees are Theodore Barnes, Newall Barnes, aud J. B. Racey. The Baptist Society of Nashville is at present without a pastor and somewhat embarrassed by a church indebtedness, but it is confidently hoped that this claim will be released under the ministry of an energetic pastor. ance cause. Many citizens not especially attracted to this peculiar feature of philanthropic work were induced from curiosity to hear the speaker. The logical arguments he advanced and the simple stories of reform which he and his associates related won their attention and sympathy. As a result 100 signed the pledge, and on the 16th of the same month a Red Ribbon Club was organized, with the following as its first officers : William Teaster, President ; James McLain, First Vice-President; J. D. Dickenson, Second Vice-President; Charles Halbert, Third Vice-Pres ident ; Milton Flaherty, Sec. ; Charles Brady, Financial Sec. ; William Jones, Treas. ; Henry Wolcott, First Mar shal ; Frederick Appleman, Second Marshal. The whole number of the persons who haA*e signed the pledge since the organization of the club is 730, and the present membership is 100. There have been 176 club meetings, with an average attendance of 40 at each meeting. There have also been 55 mass meetings, with an average attendance of 250, making a total attendance of 20,790. The club since its first inception has had its periods of growth and decay, but has been during its exist ence a powerful lever for good in the community. Its mission work has been the organization of the Vermont ville, Kalamo, Morgan, West Kalamo, and East Castleton clubs, all of which are flourishing, and are accomplishing much in their respective localities. Many of the most emi nent speakers in the temperance field have at various times addressed the club, and the citizens have been entertained and instructed as well as benefited thereby. THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. The church at Nashville, under the ministering care of Rev. S. Dailey, first became a distinct organization in Feb ruary, 1868. Its early membership embraced the follow ing names: A. Seeley, M. M. Seeley, H. P. Ralston, C. Ralston, S. R. Clendennin, Harriet Bassett, Betsey Hunt, S. S. Ralston, H. Shopbell, M. Shopbell, N. Bassett. A. Seeley was chosen deacon, and S. R. Ralston clerk. The first board of trustees embraced J. Purkey, F. Patterson, R. McCartney, L. Durkee, and C. Hill, R. McCartney having been chosen treasurer. The Nashville Red Ribbon Club is at present in an ex ceedingly prosperous condition, and numbers among its members many of the most prominent business men of the place. Its officers are Dr. H. A. Barber, President ; Charles H. Brady, 1st Vice-President; Henry Wolcott, 2d Vice-President; H. W. Flint, 3d Vice-President; Frauk McDerby, Secretary ; Rev. J. S. Harder, Financial Sec retary ; Mrs. H. A. Barber, Treasurer; H. P. Hoyt, Stew ard; Francis Baker, 1st Marshal ; F. Gokey, 2d Marshal. Under the pastorate of Rev. C. J. Deyo the accessions to the church necessitated more spacious quarters than were then available, and an effort was made to erect a church edifice, which was so far successful that in 1870 a sub stantial building was completed and dedicated, the total cost having been $2100. The church during its most flourishing period enrolled upon its membership list 162 names, though 80 is its pres ent number. AVOMAN'S CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION. With a view to encouraging those who had embarked iu the red ribbon cause, and also for the purpose of co-opera tion in other good work, the union was organized March 27, 1877, with a membership of 20. Its first officers were Mrs. W. H. Young, President ; Mrs. M. J. Zimmerman, Vice-President ; Miss L. A. Nichols, Recording Secretary ; Mrs. L. J. Wheeler, Corresponding Secretary ; Mrs. B. F. Reynolds, Treasurer. With a desire to establish the or ganization on a sound financial basis, a series of entertain ments were arranged, the first having been a temperance lunch on election-day, which netted $17.95. This was succeeded by socials, festivals, and other legitimate means for raising funds, which were used for defraying necessary expenses and furnishing a club-room for the gentlemen. The Red Ribbon Club having finally become self-sustain in<>*, and requiring no further aid, the ladies determined to choose some definite object as an inspiration to future effort, and resolved upon the establishment of a library, to be under the supervision of the Woman's Christian Tem perance Uniou. A series of entertainments was given for The pastors in succession since its organization have been Revs. S. Dailey, who remained one year ; C. I. Deyo, two and a half years; M. W. Tuck, one year; W. W. De Geer, two years ; and C. I. Deyo, three years, having filled a second pastorate. The society is now without a pastor. The present officers are F. D. Soles, Orno Strong, Charles Fowler, Nathan Weeks, G. A. Truman, Trustees ; G. A. Truman, Treasurer ; T. B. Van Wagner, Clerk. FIRST-DAY ADVENTISTS. This society was organized by Elder Philip Holler, Oct. 9, 1878, and has a membership of 13. Its services are held in the school-house of the village. SOCIETIES. RED RIBBON CLUB.

The nucleus of a library was formed, which has already reached $100 in value, and the number of volumes is being constantly augmented by purchases or gifts. vators to a height of 55 feet, after which it is passed through two large suction-sons. The light grain and straw are drawn into these fans, and blown into spouts projecting over the roof. After being thus cleaned it is dropped into a sheet-iron hopper of limited dimensions, connected with which is a small spout. This hopper is placed upon a pipe which runs to the first floor, and a person on this floor is thus able to move the pipe and distribute the grain into whichever bin he prefers, by means of an index corre sponding with the rod which encircles the pipe. There are twenty-four storage-bins in the second story, with a capacity of 30,000 bushels. The society, since it was founded, has increased in mem bership and influence, 40 working members now being en rolled upon its lists. Its officers have been efficient workers and of much administrative ability. The present presiding officers are Mrs. G. A. Truman, President ; Mrs. L. J. Wheeler, Vice-President ; Mrs. L. J. Wilson, Recording Secretary ; Mrs. C. Smith, Corres ponding Secretary ; Mrs. F. McDerby, Financial Secretary ; Mrs. C. L. Collier, Treasurer. Afterwards spouts are attached to the bottom of the storage-bins, the grain being drawn into the cellar and again into two grading-bins, where it is mixed to suit the market. From these bins it is carried by 16-inch cups that are capable of elevating 1000 bushels per hour into a hopper holding 500 bushels, which is placed at the top of the elevator, upon a set of Buffalo scales capable of weighing 30,000 pounds, or 500 bushels of wheat. NASHVILLE LODGE, No. 255, F. AND A. M. The charter of this lodge bears date Jan. 15, 1869, its charter members having been Lewis Durkee, Charles W. Wickham, Orin E. Nichols, D. C. Griffith, Daniel Halbert, Abel Sheperd, Robert B. Gregg, Henry P. Ralston, Myron Hester, William P. Little, and F. N. Francis. The lodge had previously worked under a dispensation, which was granted Nov. 25,1868. Its first officers were Lewis Dur kee, W. M. ; Charles W. Wickham, S. W. ; Orin E. Nichols, J. W. ; Daniel Halbert, Sec. ; D. C. Griffith, Treas. The present officers are Robert McCartney, W. M. ; Harvey J. Bennett, S. W. ; Ira B. Bacheller, J. W. ; John H. Smith, Sec. ; Robert B. Gregg, Treas. The lodge is prosperous, and embraces 70 names upon its roll. The pillars and beams of the scales rest upon the first floor, the first being bronzed and the latter nickel-plated. In loading a car the weight is taken upon the first floor, and, by pulling a suspended rod, the wheat drops into a bin holding 500 bushels, which is designated as the \" shipping bin,\" and from this bin it is spouted into the car. In 1877 a feed-mill, with steam-power attached, was added to the former business of the firm. It has a single run of stone, and grinds all varieties of feed for home consumption. MANUFACTORIES AND MILLS. GRAND RAPIDS CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY. NASHVILLE MILLS. The flouring- and feed-mills generally known as the Nashville Mills were built by Messrs. Mallett & Johnson in 1867, and were located upon the Thornapple River, which furnished an ample power for the two run of stone with which they were first built. Flour and feed were ground, and the immediate neighborhood consumed the product of the mills. They were purchased in 1868 by the present owner, Philip Holler, who removed to the village from Berrien County. He at once made many improve ments, introducing two turbine-wheels of the Dayton pat ent, and adding another run of stone. He has also recently employed the new patent process for the manufacture of flour. The capacity of the mills is 300 bushels for twelve hours. They are principally employed in custom-work and in furnishing' supplies to the home trade. The saw mill originally built by Hiram Hanehett is used by Mr. Holler as a feed-mill. In March of the present year a proposition was made to the citizens of Nashville by W. G. Sears, representing the above company, with a view to locating at the village of Nashville the works they were about erecting. A bonus of $800 was required, which, under the efficient direction of a committee to solicit subscriptions, was speedily raised. On the 12th of the same month ground was broken for the erection of the buildings, having a retort capacity of eight cords of wood each twenty-four hours, the product bein<>* 400 bushels of charcoal, 1200 pounds acetate of lime, and 30 gallons of wood-alcohol each day. The Avorks are under the efficient management of William G. Sears, the officers being Adolph Leitelt, President ; T. M. Peck, Vice-Presi dent ; John L. Shaw, Secretary and Treasurer. NASHVILLE ELEVATOR AND FEED-MILL. This establishment, which is located on West Main Street, upon the Grand River Valley Railroad, is owned by Messrs. Ainsworth & Brooks. It was originally constructed by Messrs. Griffith & Grant, but has been controlled by the present firm since 1874. The building is 40 feet square, and 60 feet high from cellar to cupola, having been made of seasoned timber and unusual care devoted to its con struction. The cellar has two divisions 22 by 44 feet and 10 by 20 feet, with a depth of 10 feet. In this cellar are four receiving-bins with a capacity of 1500 bushels. To receive wheat from farmers' wagons this building is pro vided with a double set of elevator legs, capable of raising 1000 bushels per hour. The grain is carried by these ele- TUCKERMAN'S STEAM SAAV-MILL. The mill and fixtures of this establishment are owned by Philip Holler and leased by Mr. Tuckerman. It is exclusively devoted to the handling of hard wood, a market for which is found in the East, much of it reaching Boston and other large Eastern cities. Two cylinder-saws are used, and seven men are employed about the works in various capacities. The timber is found in adjacent parts of the county, and has heretofore sup plied all the demands of the mill. The capacity of this saw-mill is from 8000 to 12,000 feet per day, but when run"], [631, "ALLEN B. COOPER. MRS. ALLEN B. COOPER. ALLEN B. COOPER. This venerable pioneer was born in the town of Covert, Seneca Co., N. Y., March 24, 1813. His father, Samuel Cooper, was a pioneer of the town of Covert ; he reared a family of seven children to habits of industry and thrift, and gave them such advantages for education as his limited means would allow. Allen lived with his father until he was twenty-three years of age, at which time he was mar- ried to Miss Emeline Napier. She was a native of Ash- tabula Co., Ohio, and was born Nov. 28, 1811. Two years after their marriage Mr. Cooper started for Michigan in company with his brothers. They arrived in Detroit in May, and from thence went to Oakland County, where a cousin of Mr. Cooper's, one James Cole, had settled some time previous. Here they rested a few days, when they again took up the line of march for the town of Woodland, where he had purchased eighty acres of land on section 35. The journey from Oakland was made with an ox-team, and after leaving Vermontville he was obliged to cut his road through a dense wilderness. He arrived safely, however, in the month of June ; three families had preceded him in Castleton, and one or two adventurous pioneers had located in Woodland. The pioneer life of Mr. and Mrs. Cooper was one of many privations and hardships ; their scanty stock of provisions was soon exhausted ; there was no money in the country, and starvation stared them in the face. As illustrative of the desperate condition in which they were placed, Mr. Cooper relates that some months after they came their stock of flour was exhausted, and the only article of traffic he had was a small quantity of leather he had brought from Seneca County. This he carried to Marshall, thinking it possible to exchange it for flour. The storekeeper, a man by the name of Comstock, told him that flour was fourteen dollars per barrel; and was a cash article, and that he could not purchase his leather. \" Where was that leather tanned ?\" asked the merchant. \" In Seneca Co., N. Y.,\" answered Mr. Cooper. \" What is your father's name?\" Upon receiving the reply he gave him an order for two barrels of flour, and stocked him up with a goodly store of provisions. Mr. Cooper was overcome by the generosity of the merchant, and asked an explanation. He replied, \" Your father once befriended me, and I am glad of this opportunity of pay in\u00b0* the debt.\" Many other incidents in their early history might be written showing the privations and hardships they were obliged to undergo, but the one just mentioned will suffice. Mr. Cooper assisted in the organization of the town, and was elected its first road commissioner. Mrs. Cooper taught the first school, and their names are stamped on nearly every initial event in the early history of the town. In his political belief Mr. Cooper was originally a Whi\u00b0*, and identified himself with the anti-slavery move ment upon its inception. Upon the organization of the Republican party he became an ardent Republican. He has never desired political honors, preferring the quiet of home and the cares of his farm to the turmoil of political life. He did his part in the development of Barry County, and is in every way worthy of a prominent place among the pioneers of the county."], [632, ""], [633, "CASTLETON TOWNSHIP. 429 to its extreme limit it can be made to produce an amount greatly in excess of these figures. dttions to the various departments have become necessary to meet the growing demands of their trade. Their manufac turing is done in an extensive brick building erected for the purpose, while a spacious warehouse is being constructed on Main Street for their use. All the varieties of furniture adapted to a general country trade are made by them, for which a market is found in the vicinity. Their wares were formerly shipped, but a later home demand has rendered this unnecessary. OLDS' SAW- AND PLANING-MILL. During the year 1876, Mr. A. W. Olds erected the large saw- and planing-mill at present managed by him. It is run by a steam-engine, with a capacity of 45 horse-power. There are five saws of different styles and dimensions, and a complete line of machinery of most approved design for purposes of planing. It is possible to saw and dress 20,000 feet per day, and even to exceed that amount if necessary. The material, in the shape of logs of hard wood, is obtained from the country surrounding Nashville and converted into dressed lumber, which is shipped to Boston, the principal market. Mr. Olds also purchases the product of other mills to supply the demand of his Eastern From 500 to 800 beds are made by them annually, while 200 bureaus, 100 extension-tables, and a large supply of chairs and lounges are readily sold. OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS. Messrs. Kellogg & Demaray have also a furniture-manu factory in which steam power is employed. They produce tables, bed-room sets, chairs, and other articles peculiar to the trade, and find a home demand for their wares. Their warehouse is located on Main Street. I. W. Powles has a earding-mill in which steam-power is employed, and con templates the erection, during the present season, of a more spacious building for his use. patrons. DICKENSON'S SAAV-MILL. This mill was originally built by A. W. Olds, in 1870, and by him disposed of to H. Lee, from whom it came into the possession of the present owner, Mr. H. R. Dickenson. It is propelled by an engine of 40 horse-power, and is de voted principally to the handling of hard wood. It has a capacity, when run to its extreme limit, of 12,000 feet per day. The market is fouud chiefly at home, though much of the lumber sawed recently has been purchased by Mr. Olds, and shipped to supply an Eastern demand. INCORPORATION AND OFFICERS. The act of incorporation which constituted the hamlet of Nashville a village, and bestowed upon it a chartered or ganization, was approved by the Governor, March 26, 1869, and reads as follows : COOK'S AVAGON- AND CARRIAGE-MANUFACTORY. The business at present controlled by Mr. Cook was origi ally established by him in 1874, on Main Street. It was then almost exclusi\\Tely devoted to the manufacture of lumber-wagons, for which there was a considerable home demand. The firm at that time was Reynolds & Cook, while Messrs. Hobbs & Webster managed the blacksmith-shop connected with the establishment Later Mr. Cook became sole proprietor, and confined his attention principally to the construction of carriages and buggies. \" The people of the State of Michigan enact : That al! that tract of country situate in the town of Castleton and Maple Grove, in the county of Barry, and distinguished and designated on the plat in the land-office of the district as sections thirty-five and thirty-six, and the south half of sections twenty-four and twenty-five, in town three north, of range seven west, and the north half of sections one and two in town two north, of range seven west, be, and tbe same is hereby constituted a village corporate, to be known by the name of the vil lage of Nashville.\" The first meeting for the election of village officers was held at the office of Lewis Durkee, on Wednesday, the 7th of April, 1869, at twelve o'clock, and, the ballots having been cast, the following officers were declared by the in spectors of election duly elected : President of Council, Lemuel Smith ; Recorder, Leonard E.

Twelve men are employed in the various de partments. The present conA'enient buildings were erected in 1878. BUXTON'S GUN-MANUFACTORY. Mr. Buxton first came to Nashville in 1866, and was employed in the saw-mill erected by Hiram Hanehett, where he remained five years. He was later in the workshop of the Remington Armory, at Uion, N. Y., and in 1S70 re turned to Nashville and erected the present shop, which is well stocked with lathes and other machinery of his own construction. He has since that time been engaged in the manufacture of guns, saws, and various mechanical instru ments. He is now engaged in the construction of a spacious warehouse and workshop on Main Street, which will be provided with steam-power, in which he will devote his time to the construction of light machinery and the manu facture of firearms.

In 1837 he went to Boston with his family, and was there engaged in the construc tion of Forts Warren and Independence. He remained in Boston ten years, when he became so broken down by hard labor that he decided to try his fortune in Michigan as a farmer. In 1847 he started for the West, and arrived in Castleton September 20th. He then purchased the farm on which he now resides. He suffered many priva tions, and four years had the fever and ague.

WILLIAM CRABB William Crabb was born in Plymouth, England, Feb. 6, 1805. His father, Edward Crabb, was a stone-mason, and reared a family of nine children, William being the eldest. THOMAS BLASDEL, one of the pioneers of the town of Castleton, was born in Genoa, Cayuga Co., N. Y., April 12, 1815. His father, Medad Blasdel, was a farmer of limited means, and unable to give his children but slight educational advantages. Thomas, however, acquired such an education as the district school of that day afforded, and remained with his father upon the farm until he attained his majority, when he ac quired the trade of a miller, which calling he followed for several years. In 1837 he decided to try his fortunes in Michigan, and in the spring of that year came to Ply mouth, Wayne Co., where he entered the employ of a miller by the name of Holbrook, with whom he remained three years. He then returned East, and the following year was married to Miss Alice Hall. In 1846 he returned to Michigan and settled upon the farm Avhere he now resides. The farm was entirely new, and during the fall he erected a comfortable log house, and the following spring he built a barn. The land was heavily timbered, and the improve ment of a farm was a work of no small magnitude ; but by degrees field after field was added, and Mr. Blasdel is now rewarded for the years of toil and privation in the posses sion of a fine home and one of the most productive and valuable farms in the county. In 1861 his first wife died, a'ud in 1865 he was again married, to Miss Charlotte Bur dick. In 1867 he was again left a widower, and he mar ried Mrs. Phemie Gillis. She died in 1878, and he was married to Miss Bertha D. Bock. Mr. Blasdel has made a reputation for integrity and honorable dealing, and is every where known as a successful farmer and a valuable citizen. WILLIAM CRABB At the age of nine he was apprenticed to a farmer, who was more of a brute than a man. He was obliged to toil from morning until night, and was treated with such brutality that he ran away and bound himself to a stone cutter ; he acquired the trade, which he followed until his emigration to America, in 1831. With him came his mother, brothers and sisters, and relatives, to the number 1"], [635, "CASTLETON TOWNSHII 431 LYCURGUS J WHEELEI Lycurgus J. obtained an academical education, which he made practically useful to himself -and others by teaching. This avocation he followed, in connection with farming, until 1861, when he entered the army as a member of the Sixth Michigan Cavalry. After a period of active service he was detailed for clerical duty at Gen. Copeland's head quarters, where he remained until 1863, when he returned home on recruiting service. At the close of the war Mr. Wheeler returned to Wood land ; the following year he disposed of his property and came to Nashville, where he established one of the first stores in the place. He has since prosecuted a success ful business in merchandising, and has identified himself largely with the growth and development of the village. He has taken the initiative in all religious and educational enterprises, and has done much in building up and ad vancing the best interests of society. In May, 1860, Mr. Wheeler was married to Miss Sarah J., daughter of Reu ben Haight, one of the pioneers of Woodland. She died in 1863, and he was again married, Dec. 26, 1865, to Mary J. Ellis, of Hastings. She died Dec. 20, 1874, and Sept. 10, 1876, he married Mrs. Maria I. McNab, of Big Rapids. Nashville is largely indebted to Mr. Wheeler for the public spirit and enterprise he has evinced in its behalf, and among its leading citizens he occupies a prominent posi tion. He takes decided grounds on the subject of political prohibition, and was the nominee of the Prohibition party for the Legislature for the eastern district of Barry County in 1878. Lycurgus J. Wheeler, the pioneer merchant of Nashville, was born in the town of Wheeler, Steuben Co., N. Y., Feb. 9, 1830. The Wheeler family are of Scotch-Irish extraction, a combination of national characteristics, energy, and intel lectual ability that has done much for the advancement of civilization and the best interests of society. But little is known of the family history previous to their emigration to Steuben from Saratoga County, where they were a promi nent family. Jonas Wheeler, grandfather of the subject of this biography, came from Saratoga and settled in the town which was afterwards named in honor of his brother Silas, who settled in the township a few years earlier. He was a man of wealth, and for many years one of Steuben's most prominent citizens. He reared a family of twenty two children. Asa Wheeler, his son and father of Lycur gus J., was born in the town of Galaway, Saratoga Co., Oct. 8, 1797. He married Miss Henrietta, daughter of Isaiah Betts, who was an officer in the Revolution. He came to Steuben with his father, and was also one of its leading citizens. In 1834 he came to Michigan on a tour of observation, and, being favorably impressed with the country, returned East and the following year (1835) came back and settled in the township of Saline, Washtenaw Co., where he followed his trade, that of a shoemaker, until his removal to Woodland, in 1842. Here he resided until 1866. During this time he identified himself largely with the growth and development of the town. He was its first magistrate, a position he filled creditably for twenty years. He took an active part in political matters, and was an exemplary member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church."], [636, "HASTINGS; The civil township of Hastings, from the subdivision of the old township of that name, on the 16th day of Febru ary, 1842,f until the formation of the city of Hastings, on the 11th day of March, 1871, was identical with survey township No. 3 north, in range 8 west. It now comprises the whole of that territory except what is included in the city just mentioned. It is bounded north by Carlton, east by Castleton, south by Baltimore, and west by Rutland and the city of Hastings, which cuts out sections 7, 8, 13, and 14, and parts of sections 16, 19, 20, and 21. Ambrose Hubbell, who located on section 21, in 1842, still lives there. In 1846, Adam Tinkler, who had become a resident of Ohio in 1836, came into the township on a land-looking tour, and concluded to locate in it. He accordingly traded his outfit of horses, wagon, and harness for 120 acres of land on section 28, which was then a wilderness. The only house between his location and Battle Creek was that of Mr. Bristol, in Johnstown, while on the northwest his nearest neighbor was Ambrose Hubbell. The Thornapple River flows through the township from southeast to west in a sinuous course, and close beside it runs the Grand River Valley Railroad, commonly known as the Grand Rapids division of the Michigan Central road. On this thoroughfare there is one station within the township, which bears the name of Quimby. The township is a productive agricultural district, containing many excellent farms and wealthy farmers. Directly after Mr. Tinkler made his settlement, his father, John Tinkler, and his brothers William, Thomas, John 0., Martin, and Joseph, came from Ohio, and made their homes in the neighborhood. Mr. John Tinkler died in 1860, on the place where he first settled, on section 21. Thomas and John 0., who located on section 21, now live in Hast ings city ; Martin bought a place on the same section, and still resides there ; William took up his residence in Hast ings village, and has since made his home there ; Adam lives on section 21 ; and Joseph, who resided with his father until the death of the latter, has a farm on section 21. It is a circumstance worthy of remark that of the six brothers who began their pioneer experiences together thirty-five years ago, all are still living and are near neighbors, as they were at the outset. THE PIONEER SETTLERS The first settlers in Hastings, outside the village, were James and Daniel McLellan, two brothers, who, in the years 1837 and 1838, penetrated the wilderness south of the Thornapple, and made their homes on section 27. James had come from NeAV York in 1836, entered the land for himself and brother, and returned to the East. Late in 1837, Daniel moved to his place with the family, fol lowed the next spring by James. For some time they were the only settlers in that portion of the township, being shut in by dense woods, through which their only roads were such paths as they themselves could make. Still they were but about three miles from the little village of Hastings, and were not compelled to make such long jour neys to \" mill and to meeting\" as some of the pioneers. Ephraim Shattuck, now resident on section 23, came to Hastings from Orleans Co., N. Y., in the fall of 1844, in response to the persuasions of Seymour Andrus, who had been his neighbor in New York, and who had located in Hastings the same autumn. Mr. Shattuck leased Lewis McLellan's place (now the poor-farm) directly after coming, having for neighbors Daniel McLellan on the south and a Mr. Hutchinson on the west, while about two miles east were the families of Stephen Robinson and Eliphalet Hyde, who had come in together from New York in 1842. North of Mr. Shattuck's place the country was a wilderness, into which there soon after came the Pierson family, Almon Covey, John Fisher, and his brother-in-law, Mr. Cook. C. B. Benham, a pioneer from Ohio, now occupies the place settled by Stephen Robinson in 1842 on section 25. Daniel McLellan was for several years a mail-carrier, and after an active pioneer experience died in Hastings village in 1865. His brother James died on his farm two years after settling there. James and John L., sons of Daniel, also became early settlers in the south part of the township. One of Daniel McLellan's daughters married Willard Hays, a prominent pioneer in Hastings village, and is still a resident of that city. Among those to settle at an early day in the neighborhood of the McLellans were Ambrose Hubbell, Kirk Munger, Mr. Morley, and Mr. Germon. In that neighborhood Adam Sponable and his son Isaac (early settlers in Ohio) made a location, in 1857, on section 27. Washington Sponable, another son, came out in 1859, and in 1861 the two brothers made separate settlements of their own in the neighborhood where James Lewis, John Althouse, H. Hardy, and Elam Crook had already located. S. J. Bidleman, a Branch County pioneer, came to Hastings about the time the Sponables did, and made his home on section 34. E. D. Reid located in Baltimore township in 1855, and in 1857 moved to his present home, on the same section. North of him was John Francisco, * By David Schwartz. As before stated, Hastings township has, since the incorporation of the city of that name, been legally en tirely separate from it. It is therefore given a separate place in this work. Of course, however, the township officers before the sepa ration were largely from the village out of which the city was formed. y See Chapter XIII. of the general history. 432"], [637, "Residence of GEO R QE WHITNEY, HastingsTp, Barry Co., M ich ."], [638, ""], [639, "HASTINGS TOWNSHIP. 433 while on the west his nearest neighbors were John and Gottleib Oberle. 1840 ; \" No. 9,\" Feb. 6, 1841. A new No. 2 was organized March 10, 1843; a new No. 3, March 20, 1844; a new No. 4, Nov. 12, 1846 ; and Jan. 28, 1853, No. 5 was organized, in the north half of section 25, on the petition of seven Indians possessing land on section 25. David N. Lake came from Seneca Co., Ohio, in 1863, and bought a place on section 33, being induced thereto by his son-in-laAV, Daniel Reed, who a few years before had migrated to Hastings village to follow his trade as a carpen ter, and who in 1864 settled upon a farm on section 33 where he now lives. Porter Burton, a member of the Legis lature during the session of 1879, located in Jackson County in 1842, and in 1856 moved to his present home, on section 33, which was even then in the midst of a very wild country. West of Mr. Burton lives G. W. Gregory, a pioneer in Baltimore township, and later a new-comer in Hastings. Adjoining Gregory's on the west is the Bush farm, earlier known as the Toms place, once owned by Maj. Toms, and occupied in 1851 by Richard Stillson, a pioneer in Lenawee County in 1844. His son, J. W. Stillson, settled in 1867 upon a farm on section 28, pre viously occupied by Walter W. Kelley. Ebenezer Pennock, a settler in Kalamazoo County in 1844, moved to the town of Barry in 1845, and to Hastings in 1872. The school inspectors' records sIioav that from Feb. 6, 1841, to May 27, 1854, the following persons received teachers' certificates: John Fowler, in 1841; Dameras Ellis, in 1843 ; Mary Jane West and W. T. Orr, in 1845 ; Sophia E. Standish and Henrietta P. Cooley, in 1847 ; S. C. Sprague, in 1848 ; Harriet Pease, Cordelia Warner, and I. S. Geer, in 1849 ; Rich, and Margaret Young, in 1850 ; Miss Johnson, in 1851 ; Miss Morley, Miss New ton, Miss A. Hawley, John Evans, and H. H. Bement, in 1853 ; Mary E. Johnson, Emeline Robinson, and Miss Phi lancie Hollister, in 1854. The official report for 1879 gives the following statistics touching the township schools: Number of districts (whole, 5; fractional, 2)... 7 \" children of school age 387 Average attendance 340 Value of property $4350.00 Teachers' wages SI 004.75 Seymour Andrus, already spoken of, came to Hastings in 1843, bought 160 acres of Dr. Hays on section 9, and the following year moved his family out from New York. On the way he overtook, at Detroit, Hiram Greenfield, whom he persuaded to come on and settle in Hastings. At the time of Mr. Andrus' settlement he had no neighbors in the township either north or northeast of him. The first to locate near him were John Lewis and Philander Turner, who had been working for a few years as carpenters in Hastings village, and who, in the spring of 1845, moved out upon farms close to Andrus' place. Subsequently the earliest comers into the neighborhood were Edward Bump, Ami Palmer, Hawley Stillson, William S. Meloy, and a Mr. Russ. Upon section 16 Boyd Craig settled in 1850, and even at that recent date found his home in a wild district where now the eye roams over a broad expanse of cultivated fields. The school directors for 1879 were S. Bidleman, James Murray, Robert Newton, Oscar Matthews, Morris Burton, Boyd Craig, and James Cutler. QUIMBY STATION. Southeast of Hastings city, on the railway, is Quimby Station, once a bustling hamlet, but now of much less im portance. H. L. Quimby moved thither from Grand Rapids in 1872, erected a mammoth saw-mill, engaged a force of 30 or 40 men, built a score or more of dwelling houses for them, opened a store, caused a post-office to be established at that point, and, in short, set out to make Quimby a full-blown village. For two years it thrived greatly, but at the end of that time the mill was destroyed by fire, the prosperity of the place came to a sudden halt, and, although the post-office was continued there until 1878, when it was removed to Sheridan, the village has never re covered its former position. SCHOOLS. The annual report of the school inspectors \u2014 S. H. Bun ker and Marsh Giddings \u2014 for 1842 set forth that there was one district in the township, with an enrollment of 35 school children, and that school had been kept seven months. A report from Vespasian Young, director in school district No. 1, dated Oct. 6, 1845, gave 47 as the number of school children enrolled, and Henry S. Jennings, Ph\u0153be Hays, and Mary J. West as the teachers, to whom, for six months and a half teaching, an aggregate of $18 in wages had been paid. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. Under a legislative act approved March 6, 1837, town ships 3 and 4, in ranges 7 and 8, were organized as the township of Hastings, the name being bestowed in honor of Eurotas P. Hastings, a large land-owner in Barry County. An act approved Feb. 16, 1842, separated from Hastings three townships, and called them respectively Woodland, Carlton, and Castleton, leaving to Hastings the territory of township 3, in range 8. The first meeting of the school inspectors was held Oct. 31, 1838, when A. C. Parmelee was chosen chairman. Nov. 3, 1838, the inspectors formed 2 school districts, each composed of 9 sections, and each three miles square. No. 1 included sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, and 18, in town ship 3. No. 2 comprised sections 21, 22, 23, 20, 27, 28, 33, 34, and 35, in township 3. District No. 3 was formed in 1839. Oct. 17, 1839, district No. 1 appropriated $15 for a library-case and $10 for library-books. A. C. Par melee Avas librarian, and the library was ordered kept at his house.

This organization, having a church edifice in the north east corner of the township, was formed in 1875, with 20 members. The church building was dedicated January, 1877. Rev. O. S. Barnes, the first pastor, remained four years, and was followed by Rev. John Grice, now in charge, who preaches once in four weeks. The membership is now about 35. William Smith, B. F. Wolf, James Farrell, A. I. Barnum, and Dexter Sprague are the trustees ; William Smith, Levi Cotton, and Leonidas Farrell the deacons; and B. F. Wolf and James Farrell the elders. B. F. Wolf is superintendent of the Sunday-school, which has an average attendance of 50, and employs the services of six teachers. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. GEORGE WHITNEY. George Whitney was born in the town of Parma, Cuya hoga Co., Ohio, April 12, 1828. He was the son of Joseph Whitney, and was reared on a farm, obtaining a common school education. Upon attaining his majority he com menced life for himself. In 1837 the family came to Michigan aud settled in Jackson County, where the elder Whitney purchased a farm. Here he resided six years; then came to Carlton, where he resided until his death, which occurred in 1875. Mr. Whitney's first venture in business was in manufacturing shingles ; he then went into a saw-mill, in which vocation he became an expert ; for eleven years he was in the employ of Ryerson & Hills, proprietors of the Bay Mill, at Muskegon ; he worked for this firm eleven years without the loss of a day. In 1876 he came to Hastings, and purchased the farm on which he now resides, a view of which we present on another page. In 1854 he was married to Miss Margaret McMannes, of Grand Rapids ; they have an interesting family of eight children. CLERKS. 1839, Willard Hays; 1840, no record; 1841, H. A. Goodyear ; 1842, H. I.

Although a majority of the so-called lakes are no more than good sized ponds, at least four of them are handsome sheets of water, covering considerable territory. Wall Lake in the southwest is a picturesque object, and rests in the midst of an attractive bit of country. Its waters, extending over fully 700 acres, are deep and clear and well stocked with bass, pickerel, etc. Long Lake, Mud Lake, Gurnsey (or Gran ger) Lake, and Big Cedar Lake are worthy of notice, both in respect to size and the possession of great numbers of fish. Anglers from afar off favor these localities, and, while the fisherman finds in Hope much sport to entertain him, the people of the township enjoy a plentiful supply of finny specimens, to be had almost for the asking, at their very doors. These lakes were boons to tbe early settlers in Hope, since fish were exceedingly plentiful and the larder was therefore easily and cheaply filled. In such a region fish stories are of course too numerous to mention, and the tales one hears of wonderful fish having been caught in some of the lakes would fill a good-sized volume. It is, however, true that pickerel and bass of thirty and even forty pounds in weight have been caught in Big Cedar Lake. Although such ponderous specimens have not latterly been taken, there are those who will testify that a pickerel of twenty or tAventy-five pounds is not an uncommon catch. ducts to market is to the farmer a very tedious and tire some one. It is, however, esteemed a good wheat-town, and produces not only a fine average yield to the acre, but so excellent a quality of winter wheat that at some pur chasing points it is preferred to wheat from many other localities in Barry County. The early settlers found the town generally covered with heavy timber, with here and there oak-openings. There is considerable timber and swamp-land in the town to-day, but Avithin the past five years a great deal of clearing has been effected, and that work is now going rapidly and briskly forward. Hope consists of townships 2 north, range 9 west, and is bounded on the north by Rutland, south by Barry, east by Baltimore, and Avest by Orangeville. It has one village, called Cedar Creek, where there is a post-office and the only church-building in the township. THE PIONEERS OF HOPE. Hope was not particularly calculated to attract the West ern pioneer while other more desirable towns lay open to the hand of the horny-palmed sons of toil, for it was a rough and miry land in many places. It remained, there fore, utterly untenanted, save by the red man, until the year 1840, when David Bowker led tho way to its un broken wilds and effected a settlement upon section 36. Although the only settler in Hope for about two years, he was, nevertheless, near to other settlers south of him, and in the matter of neighbors was not badly off. He and his family were the only occupants of Hope until the year 1842, when there came accessions in the families of John Southard and his son Amasa, the former making a be ginning on section 31, along the town-line, and the latter just north of that point. The Southards remained until 1846, when John sold to Hiram Tillotson and Amasa to Alvin Graves, both removing to Van Buren County. The John Southard place was occupied in 1868 by Joseph Burge, an emigrant to Barry in 1846, and now a resident of Orangeville. Shortly after the appearance in Hope of the Southards came Jeekanias Mott to section 35. Similarly, all of Hope's early settlers, hesitating to venture into the interior, pitched their tents close to or upon the southern town-line, where they could be within convenient distance of each other. After 1844 people began to move in more freely, \u2014 sloAvly at first, but presently in considerable num bers, \u2014 although settlement was exceedingly backward in every part of the toAvnship. It is argued, and with some shoAV of reason, that the presence of so much water in the town materially moderates the temperature of the locality, and that for that reason peaches may be as successfully and extensively cultivated as on the shores of Lake Michigan. Indeed, in some portions of the town there has been something of an awakening on the subject of peach-culture, but the general verdict ap pears to be that, although the town is well adapted for growing peaches, the business is not likely to be pushed to any great extent until rapid transit by railway becomes a reality. Such a convenience was at one time promised, and came very near to realization in the proposed narrow-gauge road of the Kalamazoo, Lowell and Northern Michigan Railroad Company. The company obtained in Hope, from private subscriptions, several thousands of dollars, and in deed graded the road through Hope, from southwest and northeast, but just then the project stopped for lack of fur ther support, and in that somewhat chaotic condition re mains to-day ; likely, however, at no distant time to be revived and carried forward to successful completion. In 1847 the settlement in Hope was increased by the arrival of the Campbells, a New York family, consisting of the father (James), mother, and twelve childreu. Campbell had bought 120 acres on section 25, and on that place he lived until his death, in 1857. There were already in the Hope sadly needs railway-transportation facilities, for the country is so exceedingly hilly, and part of it so far from the nearest market-toAvn, that the task of conveying his pro- \u2022 By David Schwartz."], [642, "436 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. town, when Campbell came, the families of David Bowker on section 36, Jeckanias Mott on section 35, Alvin Graves on section 26, Harry B. Day on 25, and Hiram Tillotson on 31. Directly after the Campbells came J. Q. A. John son, Isaac Le Grange, Thomas V. Robinson, John Larrabee, George W. Baird, Simeon Kingsbury, Leman Chamberlain, John Russell, Tunis Russell, Alson Russell, Silas Bowker, Peter Russell, J. H. Parks, and Solon Dowd. turn-load. The mail-carriers between Cedar Creek and Yorkville not only carried the mail afoot, but were daily charged with commissions from Hope people to bring up packages and all sorts of things ; and veracious men even tell the incredible story that on one occasion a mail-carrier went so sor as to lug over a keg of nails for a modest mem ber of the settlement. LATER SETTLERS Jeckanias Mott, above mentioned, died in 1847, and was buried in the Barry cemetery. His death is believed to have been the first in Hope. Isaac Graves, who died in 1848, was the first one buried in the cemetery on section 36, where David Bowker had donated an acre for a burial ground. Thomas Baird, a son of George W. Baird, was the first white child born in town, and Charlotte, a daughter of Alvin Graves, the first female child, but the date of the birth of neither one can now be given. AVilliam Peake and John Brainard, his father-in-law, came to Hope in February, 1854, and girdled a few trees on 160 acres in sections 14 and 15, which Brainard had taken up on a soldier's land-warrant, issued to him by virtue of his services in the Avar of 1812, in which he was en gaged for a space of eighteen months. They came back again in June and made a clearing, and in November of the same year brought their families to the place. The only settler they found in their neighborhood upon their coining, in 1854, was Emory Wilkins, who had pre-empted a piece of land just east of them. Their nearest neighbor on the northeast was Thomas Barber, in Baltimore. South, the nearest was J. N. Chandler, two miles aAvay. The nearest road on the south was the one at Chandler's, and on the east the one to Hastings, which they couldn't reach under a mile's journey. The nearer roads were only Indian trails. The redskins roamed in considerable numbers through those parts, and- near the corners of sections 1 and 2 they had their camp iu the winter season. PRAYING INDIANS. About the time William Campbell came to the township a good many Indians in that portion of the country were taken Avith a religious fever, and were carefully converted by Bradley and Slater, Indian missionaries, who were located on Gull Prairie, but who moved here and there as occa sion pointed the way, to save the souls of the savages. Cer tain of the Indians who had sat under the persuasiA'e teach ings of Bradley and Slater until they had become thoroughly good and pious set out to carry on the good work among themselves unaided. In furtherance of that plan they in augurated prayer-meeting exercises whenever in camp, and especially upon their camping-ground, near Cedar Creek, their devotional enthusiasm was quite extraordinary. To these prayer-meetings they frequently invited the whites, and always counted upon seeing William Campbell and wife, near whose house their camps were laid, and with whom they maintained pleasant friendly relations. Among those who came into the neighborhood soon after Peake and Brainard located were Lyman and Hiram Hickox, Thomas Mosher, and Thomas Lindeman, the latter of whom built a saw-mill on section 10. Hastings was near, but it was very small, and Kalamazoo was tbe market-town most sought, although it was about thirty miles distant. Money was in demand before returns could be had from the first crop, and to get a little cash sor the supply of life's necessaries Peake went as far as Gull Prairie to work through harvest. J. N. Chandler, already mentioned, was from Ohio, and settled in Hope, on section 23, in 1852. At his coming he found on section 25 his brother, Enos P.

Hard times came upon the pioneers of Hope frequently enough, and particularly hard were the times encountered during the winter. It was often said, in jest, that was, that if a man wintered so that ho could in the spring pull a leek out of the ground without soiling over back- wards, he had wintered exceedingly well. It was also a common understanding that for a certain period in early spring, just after the breaking up of winter, the entire population of the township had no time to do anything ex- cept to pull cattle out of the mire and swamps. Money was scarce, and, as there wasn't much in the way of opportu- nity to earn it at home, many settlers would go miles to Avork for somebody that had cash, or they would be glad to work even for some one who could pay them in pork, which was gladly carried home over an eight or ten mile pedestrian journey. C. P. Larrabee, the pioneer storekeeper of the township, says he has many a time walked to Battle Creek for a supply of groceries for his store, and walked home again with his stock upon his back. Lem Thomas, a maker of corn-baskets, used to foot it to Yorkville, four- teen miles, with a load of corn-baskets clinging to him, and soot it back again with a 60-pound bag of flour as his re- Myron Simpson settled about that time on section 27, and in 1854 Harvey Bruce located on section 23. In 1852 \" Uncle\" Thomas V. Robinson's house, about a mile north of Chandler, that of Harvey S. Johnson, opposite Robinson's, and the Stillson house, on the Bush place, in Hastings town, were the only dwellings on the road from Chandler's to Hastings village. The road to Hastings was at best a wild thoroughfare, and those who traveled over it merely kept about the same course, but picked out their route as it best suited them. Do the best he could, Mr. Chandler could not go to mill at Hastings and return in less than about eighteen hours. Usually the start was made about one o'clock in the morning, and the return was not accomplished until after nightfall."], [643, "HOPE TOWNSHIP. 437 Settlements in the northern portion of Hope were de layed until some years after the southern and other sections began to receive residents. Probably the first to locate in the territory mentioned was Donald McCallum, who ven tured as a settler into Orangeville as early as 1838, and who in 1851 moved into Hope, upon section 7. In 1854, Sey mour Tillotson made a start on section 3, but in 1855 sold his place to Moses Schults, who, in that year, came in with his brother Joseph. Tillotson's brother-in-law, J. E. Hall, accompanied him to Hope and bought a place on section 3, now occupied by his brother, J. A. Hall, whose advent in the town occurred in 1855, after an eight years' residence in Prairieville. The northern portion of the town was sparsely populated even until a short time ago, and for years after 1850 much of it was a wilderness. Now, however, it is a locality much esteemed by farmers, although there is yet considerable work to be done there in the way of clear ing off the timber. Acres. Ansel H.

The history of Hope is marked by an unusually long list of tragic episodes, in which there appears a list of one murder, two suicides, and six fatal accidents. First in prominence may be noted the killing of Dean S. Tyler, in June, 1878, by John R. Pitts. The testimony taken upon Pitts' trial showed that trouble originated between the two men by reason of Mrs. Pitts leaving her husband and living openly with Tyler. Such conduct scandalized the community, and the members thereof promptly resented it by appearing before Tyler's house one night and decorating Tyler and the woman with coats of tar and feathers. De spite this exhibition of popular disapproval, they continued to live together in the town as usual until one Sunday morning shortly after the demonstration. On that day Tyler, Mrs. Pitts, and Mrs. Pitts' sister set out for a ride to Nashville, and proceeded peacefully upon their journey as far as a place known as the Dead Sea (just north of Cedar Creek), where Pitts, the injured husband, appeared suddenly in the roadway, gun in hand, and without warn ing shot Tyler instantly dead. Pitts was tried and con victed of murder in the second degree, under which he was sent to the penitentiary for fifteen years, and there he still remains. Turning next to the southern portion of the township, reference may be made to one George Peak, a colored man, and a survivor of the war of 1812, who, in 1848, settled upon section 28, as did his sons James, Nathaniel, and Thomas, each of whom had a place of his own. When William H. Carpenter, now living on section 29, came to his present home, in 1855, he found the residents there about to be Jeruel Phillips and the Peaks, on section 28 ; Simeon Kingsbury, on section 20 ; John Townsend, and Lewis and Miner Barnes, on section 29 ; Gideon Walter, his son-in-law, Horace Eldredge, and Alvin Graves, on sec tion 32 ; James Stewart and Robert Wood, on section 30 ; and Rooney Dake, Daniel Axtell, George Tuttle, O. M. Titus (who had come about 1848), Seth Lewis, and Benedict, on section 31. Simeon Kingsbury settled on section 24 in 1851, and in 1853 moA*ed to section 20, where the same year he built a saw-mill. In 1859, John Replogle made his home on section 18, and occupied land on which one Harper had made a small clearing in 1854. In that year Timothy Collins made a location on section 18, and the following year there came new accessions in George Curtis to section 18, and Abram Hayward to section 17. One of the earliest settlers in that neighborhood was a man named Granger, who lived on the banks of what is called on the county atlas Gurnsey Lake, but which was really named Granger Lake, and is so designated on the map in this Avork. In the spring of 1877, Henry Jenkins hung himself in a fit of despondency, and John Townsend sought a way out of the world by like means. In March, 1877, Abisha Crossman was riding from Middleville to his home in Hope when, by an awkward mischance, a gun which he was carrying accidentally exploded, and killed him on the spot. While at work in the woods in 1872, George Hazel was killed by the accidental discharge of a gun, and in the same year George Collester was drowned while bathing in Long Lake. In 1873, Wellington Bowker was drowned in a lake in the northern part of the town, and in 1868, George Jenkins, son of Henry Jenkins who hung himself in 1877, was kicked to death by a horse. About 1852 a family named Bird lived on section 13, and one day the parents, going out after marsh-hay, left behind them an infant son, whom for security they locked in the house. During their absence the house took fire, and, burning to the ground, roasted the child ali\\'e. His remains, subse quently found near where the front doorway had been, told the pitiful story of his feeble but futile efforts to escape from the devouring flames. THE RESIDENT LAND-OWNERS IN 1850.

ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. A road to Hastings was of course one of the earliest considerations, and that road, constructed about 1852, was the first important highway acquired. Over that route settlers had previously traveled by way of an Indian trail. Township 2 north, range 9 west, was a portion of Barry township until 1850, when, by an act of the Legislature, it was giveu a separate organization and named Hope. The story goes that Salmon C. Hall, then a representative in the Legislature, named the town in remembrance of a peculiar capacity of William M. Campbell for \" hoping that things would improve by and by,\" and the frequency with which he expressed his sentiments in that direction. At the first town-meeting there was evidently some dissatisfac tion with the name of Hope, for there appears in the record the entry, \" A vote of the township was taken to alter the township name to Cedar Creek.\" Although the record does not assert such to have been the case, yet it is evident that the Legislature declined to sanction this, since the name of the town has never been anything but Hope. It is said that the first team over the route from Cedar Creek to Hastings was an ox-team which was driven over with a number of grists from the neighborhood for the Hastings mill. There was no regular road, but there was a trail to show the course, and Silas Bowker, David Bowker, H. B. Day, Columbus Campbell, Lovinus Campbell, Alvin Graves, and William Campbell accompanied the team for the purpose of cutting out a road. SCHOOLS. The first school-house built in Hope was the Mott school house, on section 36, included originally in \" district No. 3, of the towns of Hope and Barry.\" The building occu pied a corner in the town-cemetery, and in 1S48 the first school was taught in it by Julia Woodward. Her pupils numbered about 20, and included seven of William Camp bell's children, four of Silas Bowker's, six of Bunnell's, and two of McNulty's. Among the immediate successors of Julia Woodward as teachers were Julia and Jane Graves, Charles Nichols, and Catharine Campbell. At the first town-meeting in Hope it was resolved \" That school district No. 3, in the towns of Hope and Barry, make their annual report to Hope, and draw of Hope the present year, and of Barry the next, and district No. 6 make report to Barry, and draw their books from that town the present year.\" The first town-meeting was held April 1, 1850, and on that occasion the votes cast aggregated 14. The officers then elected were as follows : Supen'isor, Silas Bowker ; Clerk, H. B. Day ; Treasurer, Geo. W. Baird ; School In spectors, Silas Bowker and Tunis Russell ; Overseers of the Poor, Geo. W. Baird and H. B. Day ; Highway Com missioners, J. E. Russell, Chas. A. Graves, and J. Q. A. Johnson; Justices of the Peace, J. C. Russell, C. A. Graves, J. Q. A.

At the same meeting $80 were voted for township ex penses and \" past indebtedness.\" The report from S. C. Russell, director in school district No. 1, in 1853, set forth that in that year the teacher was Philancy Houster, that she had received 816.25 for thir teen weeks' teaching, that 30 scholars attended the school during the year, and that a school-house was built in the spring of 1853, at a cost of $75.

Previous to the formation of this society the set tlers in that portion of Hope had gone over into Barry to church, but when they had a religious organization at home they endeavored with much spirit to encourage the en terprise. Rev. Mr. Johnson, of Yorkville, who effected the organization, and who frequently preached for the peo ple afterwards, used to say to his Yorkville congregation that they might well learn lessons of Christian energy from the Baptists in Hope, who were so earnest in their attend ance upon divine worship that in many instances they would come from a distance of six miles, with ox-teams, to attend Sunday-evening services. THE YOTERS OF 1853 AND 1859. The poll-list for 1853 shows the following voters : Simeon Kingsbury, Solon Dowd, James Stewart, Peter M. Russell, John C. Russell, Joshua Leonard, Peter Shronts, F. F.

Thomas, Thomas V. Rob inson, Lemon Chamberlain, Alva Mott, Ansel Kingsbury, Emerson Sampson, Enos P. Chandler, Charles V. Robin son, Thomas Newton, Abel Draper, Charles A. Graves, Martin Babcock, and Franklin Harper. Elder Silas Bowker preached a good deal for the church, and with Mr. Johnson performed all the ministerial service during the existence of the church in Hope. Worship was held in the Mott school-house until the structure grew too dilapidated for use, when the place of meetings was transferred to Barry township. About the time of the organization of the Baptist Church- a Methodist Episcopal class was formed at the Dowd school-house, but its exist ence was brief.

There are in Hope three United Brethren classes, known respectively as the Cedar Creek, Hope Centre, and North Hope classes. They are on the Cedar Creek Circuit, which is in the charge of Rev. G. H. Shelley. A United Breth ren class organized at the Dow school-house in 1859 flour ished so well that about 1869 it was decided to make three classes of it. Some of the members accordingly organized a class at Hope Centre, others a class at Cedar Creek, and others still remained as a class at Dowd's Corners. Among the first members of the class at Dowd's were Peter Schronts and wife, L. C. Gesler and wife, A. T. Foot, and Maria Gesler, Peter Schronts being chosen class-leader. Rev. Mr. Jacobs, who organized the class, preached after that once in two weeks for quite a space of time. This class after a brief time was consolidated with that at Cedar Creek. The Hope Centre class, worshiping in the Schronts school house, has a membership of 15. The class-leader is Jacob Kahler, and the class-steward Moses Seeber. The Cedar Creek class worshiped in a school-house until 1876, when the present house of worship was built. Lu ther Brown is the class-leader, H. L. Armour the class steward, and H. L. Armour, Eugene Campbell, L. C. Ges ler, G. H. Shelley, and Henry Newman, the trustees. The church membership is 75, and that of the Sunday-school 40. Luther Brown is the Sunday-school superintendent, George H. Abrams the secretary, and James McDonald, treasurer. The North Hope United Brethren class was organized in 1876, by Rev. Mr. Kilpatrick, with Cyrus Brouse and wife, Lloyd Patterson and wife, and Barbara Tuttle as members. The membership is now 9. William Tuttle is class-leader, and George M. Hudson class-steward. C. H. Stone is superintendent of the Sunday-school, which has an average attendance of from 30 to 40 scholars. The class meets in the school-house on section 10, where also a few Second Adventists have meetings once a week. THE OLD BAPTIST CHURCH. Hope's first temple of worship was the Mott school-house, on section 36, where in 1852 Rev. Mr. Johnson organized a Baptist Church, of which the earliest members were David A. Polley and Avife, Jesse Hampton and wife, Noah BoAvker and wife, Amos Brewster, William Campbell and wife, Richard Stillson and wife, Silas Bowker and wife,"], [646, "440 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. OTHER RELIGIOUS BODIES. village a steam grist-mill, which will much improve the business condition of the village, since the water-power at that point is failing, and in the summer season is apt to fail completely. Although one Dr. J. W. Barnes came to Hope in 1853, and for two years continued a fairly suc cessful medical practice in the township, he is hardly con sidered as having belonged to the medical profession, since he was a graduate of no college. Be that as it may, he was called Dr. Barnes, and had a good many patients during his stay. He was a preacher, too, but he was strongly in clined to a loose belief in moral responsibility, and left behind something of an unsavory reputation. Dr. H. F. Peckham was a comer in 1868, and from that time to the present has been in continuous practice in Hope and neigh boring towns. Previous to his time one Dr. Crandall was at Cedar Creek a few months, and in 1877 Dr. Henry Webster located, but remained less than a year. Dr. Wil liam Smith, now a practitioner at Cedar Creek, studied with Dr. Peckham from 1877 to 1879, when he entered upon practice on his own account. Besides the religious organizations herein named, the town contains a society known as the Church of God, wor shiping at the school-house on section 34, a German society at the Schronts school-house, a Wesleyan Methodist class at the Morey school-house, and a Methodist Episcopal class at the school-house on section 12. The Hope and Rutland Union Sunday-School Institute was organized in August, 1879, for the purpose of ad vancing the Sunday-school interests of both towns. The five schools attached to the institute at the outset have now increased to seven. The promoter of the enterprise, and president of the institute, is S. T. Wright, the secretary L. T. Patterson, and the treasurer William Cline. HOPE GRANGE, No. 144. This grange, now owning a hall on section 22 and having a membership of 17, was organized with 25 members, and officers as follows : C. N. Youngs, M. ; Seneca Larrabee, 0. ; Daniel Newton, L. ; David A. Bowker, Chaplain ; D. S. Tyler, Sec; W. Blackman, Treas. The Masters since the organization, in the order of service, have been C. N. Youngs (three years), John Coleman, George M. Hudson, and C. N. Youngs. The present officers are C. N. Youngs, M. ; D. A. Bowker, 0. ; Mrs. J. A. Hall, L. ; George M. Hudson, Chaplain ; Conrad Kahler, Sec. ; Nich olas Kahler, Treas. ; S. T. Wright, Steward ; Asa Knowles, G. K. ; Mrs. C. N. Youngs, Ceres ; Mrs. D. A. Bowker, Pomona. CEDAR CREEK POST-OFFICE. In the year 1850 Cedar Creek post-office was established in Hope, and Isaac La Grange appointed postmaster. Cedar Creek was chosen as a name because Cedar Creek flowed through the neighborhood, and this creek received its name from the presence, at its source, of a cedar swamp. Solon Dowd succeeded La Grange in 1854, and he in turn gave place, in 1856, to C. P. Larrabee. Following thereafter in the order named were Abram Gordonier, John Robinson, David Bailey, Benjamin Stanton, D. S. Murphy, C. P. Larrabee, A. M. Armour, and Charles Wilson, the latter being now the incumbent. The first mail-carrier in the township was William Campbell, who carried the bag afoot, once a week, from Yorkville to Cedar Creek. GLASS CREEK GRANGE, No. 425, was organized in May, 1874, in the northwest corner of the town, with 30 members. Paul Blake was M. ; William Ellsworth, 0. ; V. Reploge, Sec. ; Philander Otis, Treas. ; and Ira A. Osgood, Steward. The present master is Wil liam H. Otis, and the Overseer, George Reploge. CEDAR CREEK YILLAGE. The place known as Cedar Creek, although a village of no extraordinary pretensions, commands considerable trade, and is, moreover, the only milling-point for miles around. The place boasts three stores, a blacksmith- and wagon shop, a turning-lathe, a church, and a grist-mill, with the promise of an additional grist-mill before the close of 1880. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. WILLIAM H. CARPENTER. William H. Carpenter was born in Livingston Co., N. Y., Feb. 9, 1824. His parents soon after moved to Orleans Co., N. Y., where, in May, 1849, he married Caroline Thompson, also a native of the \" Old Empire State,\" born Nov. 29, 1829. In 1855, Mr. Carpenter came to Michi gan, and settled on the banks of Wall Lake, in Hope town ship, where he still resides, having made for himself and family a pleasant home. His business has been that of a farmer, and all his time has been engaged in improving his farm, except nine months spent in the service of his coun try. He was drafted Nov. 29, 1864, and served in the Eighth Michigan Infantry, and participated in the battle of Petersburg, Va. The first store in that vicinity, and the pioneer store in the township, was opened in 1855 by C. P. Larrabee, in a house put up by a Mr. Abbott for a dwelling. Larrabee sold out to Wing Willison, but resumed business after wards, and is still in the trade at Cedar Creek. He came to Hope in 1853 and opened the pioneer blacksmith-shop in the town. The early merchants had to buy their sup plies of goods at Battle Creek and haul them home at a heavy expense, for it was very difficult work to get a load even from Battle Creek to Cedar Creek over the rough country that intervened, and it is likely enough that store keepers' prices at Cedar Creek were expressed in good round figures in those days. The first saw-mill in the township was built by Isaac La Grange in 1849 on Cedar Creek, and in 1863 Simeon McCaffrey and Philander Clark built at Cedar Creek the grist-mill now carried on there.

Peckham, M.D., who was born in 1844 in Madison, Madison Co., N. Y. His father was David R. Peckham, a native of Rhode Island. He removed to Madison Co., N. Y., when he was twenty-six years of age. His occupation was solely to shoe the soleless maidens, and the boys to boot were not forgotten. He was the parent of three children ; one of them is a daughter, Mrs. Eda Gardner, of Chenango Co., N. Y. The second daughter is a Mrs. Bouck, of Kent Co., Mich. He also has a son, Dr. H. C. Peckham, residing in Otsego Co., Mich., who read medicine with his brother, Dr. H. F. Peckham, the gentleman whose portrait heads this sketch. Dr. H. F. Peckham received his early instruction in the district school of his native town. ton, of Cortland, N. Y. He graduated at the Eclectic Medical College of Philadelphia, Pa., and entered upon his career as a physician at Chenango Co., N. Y. He lived in this county for two years, and then removed to Cedar Creek, Mich., where he has ever since sedulously attended to his profession. I His marriage fortune Avas made on Oct. 24, 1870. He wooed and won the daughter of T. H. Allen, of Barry County, whose first name is Sarah. She was born in Battle Creek, Mich. The doctor is not a member of any church, but his views are inclined towards the Universalist denomination. He is a Democrat politically, and is a strong partisan. He is a very active leader in his own party. During many campaigns he has spoken in nearly every school-house in Barry County, and his speeches were received with great acclamation. At the present time he is building a mill at Cedar Creek, which will be completed during the coming summer, 1880. At the age of sixteen he entered the Madison Univer sity, of Hamilton, where he remained for three years in the literary department. After having studied with great credit he withdrew from school, and, after an absence of one year, commenced the study of medicine with Dr. Hiram Scran- 56"], [650, "IRVING.* reception of their grandfather, father, and brother, \u2014 Amos, Frederick, and Orrin L. Ingraham, \u2014 all of whom then made their appearance as members of the white settlement in Ir ving. Frederick Ingraham had bought a place on the hill just east of his son William's farm, but all lived at first with William and his family, he being the only one of the sons married. While living there, Amos Ingraham died, Aug. 11, 1838, and was buried on the farm. He was a good man, and had been a soldier in the Revolutionary war. This township, known on the government survey as township 4 north, range 9 west, lies upon the northern boundary of the county, and has upon the north the Kent county-line, upon the south Rutland township, upon the east Carlton, and upon the west Thornapple. Within the limits of the township are 2 villages, 4 post-offices, 6 church buildings, and 12 district schools, so that, as concerns mail, religious, and educational facilities, the provision is abundantly ample. There are some manufac tures at Irving and Freeport villages, but agriculture is of course the dependence, and, it may be added, a profitable one. The Thornapple River describes an eccentric cres cent in the southwest corner of the township, across which also passes the Grand Rapids division of the Michigan Central Railroad, upon which Irving village is a station. The surface of the country is hilly, and offers many wide reaching and pleasing natural prospects. Shortly after the State road through Irving was surveyed in 1844, William Ingraham determined to convert his house into a tavern, and by material additions made it a roomy framed structure, as it stands to-day, at the intersection of the two roads, near the town-line, on section 34. He put up a sign, whereon was emblazoned the legend \" Ingraham House,\" and, although business was at first not remarkably brisk, by reason of delay in constructing the State road, the opening of the stage-route between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids, via Hastings, in July, 1846, gave affairs an im petus, and, as the Ingraham House was at one time a point where the stage changed horses, it was then a bust ling place of business. Ingrah.im relinquished the busi ness of landlord to Silas Smith after the lapse of a few years. Smith was the last landlord the tavern knew, for after his departure the sign was taken down, and, although H. J. Kenfield and Orrin L. Ingraham, who occupied the house successively afterwards, occasionally entertained trav elers, the tavern-stand ceased to be such when Smith left it. William W. Ingraham moved from Irving in 1865, and lives now near Battle Creek. Velorous, his brother, died in Irving, and Orrin L. lives in Virginia. Fred erick Ingraham lived on his place, east of William's, until his death, in December, 1848. He was by trade a black smith, and kept a shop near the Ingraham House, down to the time of his decease. The only representative of the family now in Irving is George W., a son of William, who lives on section 27. IRVING'S PIONEERS. Upon a 40-acre lot in the southwest corner of section 33, A. E. Bull, a New Englander, made the pioneer settle- ment in Irving, and the first settlement likewise in Rutland, in which latter town, indeed, he had considerable land on section 5. It was mostly prairie-land, and is to-day known as Bull's Prairie. This tract Mr. Bull purchased as early as 1836, but he did not make any pronounced move towards settling upon it until some time in 1837, when he put up a cabin on the 40 acres in living, and entered vigorously upon the work of clearing, fencing, and cultivating his land. Mr. Bull was unmarried, and about the time he began work upon his place he engaged John Hen- yon to chop for him, and Henyon's wife to keep house and provide the subsistence for his choppers, of whom he had at one time more than twenty. Though Mr. Bull remained a bachelor some years after his settlement in Irving, and though he was away from the township frequently, he con- tinued to preserve his identity as a settler, and that he was in the strict acceptation of the term an active, hardy pio- neer cannot be denied. He was, moreover, an industrious surveyor, and laid out many of the early roads in both Rut land and Irving. While still a resident of Rutland, whither he removed his house many years after his settlement in Irving, he died in 1865, during a visit to Massachusetts. During the year 1838 there also came to Irving Daniel Williams and his family, who made their home on section 19. Mr. Williams died in 1874, having a few years pre vious removed from the town. His son Charles lives near Irving village, on section 31. Until June, 1842, there were no further accessions to the settlements in Irving. A. E. Bull, Daniel Williams, and the Ingrahams were the only settlers, and they were by no means near enough to each other to be more than distant neighbors. At the first town-meeting, in 1840, there were but 7 voters for the two townships, then called Irving. There were but 6 men to occupy the offices, and, as the official positions were to be 21 in number, the 6 were compelled to \" double up\" very briskly, as witness : Until the spring of 1838, Mr. Bull was the solitary settler in Irving. At that time there came to the township Wil liam W. and Velorous Ingraham, two brothers, from New York, and upon section 34, where the Ingraham tavern after wards stood, and yet stands, they built a log cabin, made a clearing, and by summer had matters in readiness for the * By David Schwartz. 442"], [651, "-re\u00a3 ' -\u2022 __^_ ;___^aBBBi Residence of ilAMES C.

Bull was clerk, school inspector, director of the poor, highway com missioner, and justice of the peace ; and Frederick Ingra ham was supervisor, director of the poor, highway com missioner, and overseer of highways. Fortunately for the holders, the offices were almost sinecures, since, in the na ture of things, there could be but little to do in any of them, save, perhaps, such as were concerned with the highways, else their official tasks would have left them little leisure for labor on their own behalf. Even as to highways, there was at first not much labor or trouble. The character of the country was such that travel was easy through the oak openings, and roads to almost any point were to be had with out difficulty. land. This and other similar jocose references a waiter promptly repeated to landlord Evans, and landlord Evans, swelling with rage at the thought that the delicacy of his beefsteak should be questioned, advanced quickly and wildly upon Mr. Balch while the latter still sat at the table, and, falling upon him, so beat, bruised, and maltreated him that from the injuries thus received Mr. Balch died within the ensuing forty-eight hours. Evans was tried, convicted, and sentenced to the State prison for three years, but before the expiration of his term he died. In 1844, too, came William Barton, accompanied by his sons, Willard and Reuben, and his son-in-law, Massena Hop kins. In 1845, L. K. Powers, a settler in Johnstown town ship in 1840, located upon section 32 in Irving. In the same year D. B. Pratt became a settler in the same section, south of the river, and then also John Texter and his father in-law, John Wagner, from Ohio, bought 160 acres on sec tion 35, but made no permanent settlement until 1847, when they returned to the township after a brief absence in Ohio. Michael Strasbaugh accompanied them in 1847, but after a residence of two years in Irving removed to Carlton, whither he was followed three years later by Wagner. In 1846, Geo. K. Beamer, of Western New York, bought of R. N. Hanna a farm on section 33, and that year Harmon Wilcox settled upon section 32. Elizur Lusk located land upon section 30 in 1844, but did not occupy it until a few years afterwards. In the winter of 1841-42, Peter Cobb came from Wayne Co., Mich., where he had been living since 1836, and, as a result of his land-looking expedition, purchased a tract in section 27, and in June, 1842, moved upon it with his family and brother Adna. Upon that place Mr. Cobb has resided uninterruptedly ever since, and is therefore the oldest resident settler in Irving. Following Mr. Cobb, in 1842, came Richard Newell Hanna, who had bought of one Green, a New Yorker, 520 acres on section 33, and 160 on section 28, upon which lat ter he made his own home, and soon afterwards parceled out his land on section 33 to incoming settlers. He died in 1855. His brother, J. C. Cobb, afterward married his widow, and still occupies the old Hanna farm. The first settler on section 33 was Joseph C. Freeman, who, in 1843, located upon a 40-acre lot, and while building his cabin lodged his family with William Ingraham. Section 33 was then an unbroken wilderness, and received no settler after Free man until 1845, when Robert McClintock made a settle ment. Freeman now lives in Middleville, and the widow of McClintock, aged eighty-four, resides in the same town ship. Until 1848 settlements in Irving were confined almost entirely to the vicinity of the southern town-line, while north of Peter Cobb's the township had not been pene trated by the pioneer in any direction. About the year named there was a small colony of Indian farmers on section 6, where they had purchased government land and set about improving and cultivating it. Their attempts, like similar attempts by other redskins in other townships, resulted in the overwhelming conviction that whatever the noble red man might be fitted for he was assuredly not fitted to be a farmer, so after brief and disastrous experiments they gave up the task and returned to a nomadic and more con genial state of existence. In 1848, Sylvanus Travis moved to section 29, and in 1849, Wm. Moulton made a stand still farther north, upon section 23, where he bought a place of William Cole, the patentee. In 1849, Benjamin J. Tre\"o, with a family of seA'en children, settled upou 160 acres on section 34, previously occupied by Q. H. Gorton, who had cleared about 20 acres. Of Mr. Trego's children John and Benjamin J. are living on the old place, Wm. C. on the same section, and D. R. in Rutland. Iu 1849, J. M. Walker settled on section 27, and in 1851 settlements in the northern part of the township began in earnest. William Cole located himself on section 27 in 1843, and in the year 1844 there was a considerable addition to the settlement. Isaac Hendershott, with his son J. J., was among the first, coming in the spring from New York, and making a land-purchase on the southeast corner of section 29. Early in the fall they returned to New York, and brought the rest of the family to the new home in Michi- gan. Isaac Hendershott's widow, eighty-four years old, lives on the old homestead. J. J., her son, has a home on section 29. He married a daughter of Coben Balch, who, in October, 1844, came from Vermont to Michigan and settled south of the river, on section 32, where he lived until his tragic death, in 1863. The circumstances of the tragedy may be thus told. Mr. Balch visited Grand Rapids, and made his temporary home at the Eagle Hotel, whereof one John EA'ans was landlord. Balch made some sport of the beefsteak set before him at supper, and remarked upon its extraordinary toughness, giving it as his laughing opinion that the animal from which the steak had been cut must have been a \" breaker\" \u2014 referring, of course, to the hardened physical system of cattle used in breaking In that year John E. Archer, who had married in Ohio the daughter of Isaac H. Hayek, killed in the Mexican war, moved upon 160 acres, in section 13 of Irving, belong ing to Huyck's widow uuder a soldier's land-warrant. The widow herself came out in 1852, and still lives in the town. When Archer settled upon section 13, in 1851, there was nobody north of him. West were S. W. Chase, Thomas McConnell, and John Tauey. With Archer came also II. G. Jones, who settled upon section 12, and Foster Sisson on section 14. Sisson's widow married Una Bare, and"], [654, "444 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

It was in 1851 that the considerable German settlement now in the northeastern portion of Irving was fouuded. Conrad Beeler and Charles, his brother, who had been liv ing in Ohio since 1833, came to Irving, and located land not only for themselves, but for Jacob Schmelicher as well, who made a settlement in 1854. After that John Reu ter, Gottlieb Nagler, and other Germans followed into the neighborhood. The members of this German com munity are thrifty farmers, and support a church now endowed with a flourishing membership of 40. A. H. Bates, H. G.

The first born in Irving, among the white settlers, was George W., son of William W. Ingraham, the date of whose birth was Dec. 5, 1839, and the place the old Ingra ham house. George Ingraham still lives in Irving, on section 27. The first death in the white settlement was that of Amos, father of Frederick and grandfather of William W. Ingraham. He died Aug. 11, 1838, and was buried on William Ingraham's place, whence his body was removed some years later to the cemetery laid out in that neighborhood in 1846. The first burial in that cemetery occurred Jan. 1, 1847, when the wife of William Cole was laid to rest. In that cemetery lie now the remains of one Revolutionary soldier, Amos Ingraham ; of two soldiers of the war of 1812, Robert McClintock and Isaac Hen dershott ; of one soldier of the Mexican war, James Darling ; and three soldiers of the war of 1861-05, James Travis, Henry Wing, and Jasper Lusk. 1841-42, Maj.

Under a legislative act approved April 17, 1839, township 3 north, range 9 west, previously a part of Yankee Springs, and township 4, range 9, then belonging to Thornapple, were set apart as one township, and called Irving in accordance with the request of A. E. Bull, who, being an ardent admirer of Washington Irving's works, wished thus to honor that author.* By an act approved March 16, 1847, township 3 was set off and named Rutland, leaving to Ir ving the territory it now occupies.

In May, 1841, the grand jurors drawn were Frederick Ingraham, Maj. Mott, and the petit jurors Estes Rich and William W. Ingraham. EARLY ROADS. In 1840 the road-tax aggregated an assessment of four hundred and sixty-nine and a quarter days, of which sixty seven and a half days were worked out on the highways. The same record sets forth that \" $97.75 were received from the county treasurer, and let the same out in jobs.\" In 1840, A. E. Bull (who surveyed many of Irving's early roads) surveyed a road commencing \" at the corners of sections 12 and 13, in town 3 north, range 10 west, and sections 7 and 18, in town 3 north, range 9 west, near Maj. Mott's house ; thence due east ou the section-line 75 rods to a stake ; thence north 45\u00b0 east 34 rods ; thence north 55\u00b0 east 218 rods; thence north 47\u00b0 east 41 rods to the southeast corner of A. E. Bull's land ; thence north 47\u00b0 east 56 rods to the north-and-south State road.\" This was the first survey recorded in the township. Oct. 12, 1840, there was a survey of a road commencing at a point in the section-line 136 rods east of the corners of sections 4, 5, 8, and 9, in town 3 north, range 9 west, running thence on the aforesaid section line 136 rods to the aforesaid corners ; thence north 45\u00b0 west 78 rods ; thence north 66\u00b0 west 27 rods ; thence north 77\u00b0 west 34 rods, there to intersect a road leading from A. E. Bull's to Maj. Mott's. That portion of the State road (\" passing from Battle Creek by way of Hastings, to where the Kalamazoo and Grand River road crosses the county-line between the counties of Kent and Barry\") lying in Irving was surveyed March 8, 1844. This road was, however, not opened as a stage-route until July 1, 1846, when Heman I. Knappen, of Hastings, put on a line of stages between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids, and carried the mail. Knappen was a brisk, stirring sort of man, and urged the completion of the road upon the citizens of Hastings with a good deal of energy. When questioned as to the kind of a road he ex pected to make, he caused a little astonishment and some ridicule by averring that it would be a road over which he would \" trot clear through,\" for roads on which a pair of horses could trot were exceedingly rare in that country aud in those days. That part of the road passing through Irving was well-nigh a natural highway, since the oak-open ings were open enough to afford vehicles ready access in almost any direction. In 1841 the road assessment in district No. 1 was two hundred and eighteen and a half days, of which but twenty five and a half days were worked, and in district No. 2, where the assessment was one hundred and twenty and a half days, the work done amounted to but nine and a half days. The township treasurer's report, rendered March 22, 1842, recited his assets as follows: Notes for road purposes S29 Received of the county treasurer 7.50 Amount of taxes received in township orders (not any money received) 44.51 Total S81.01 SCHOOLS. On the 10th of June, 1844, G. B. Manchester and Chas. Kellogg, school inspectors of Irving township, issued a notice to Estes Rich that school district No. 1 had been formed of the southeast, southwest, and northwest quarters of section 3, the northeast, northwest, and southwest quar ters of section 10, the whole of sections 9, 4, and 5, the northeast and northwest quarters of section 8, and the east half of section 6, in town 3 north, range 9 west, and sec tions 33 and 32, the east half of section 31, the south half of section 29, and the south half of section 28, in town 4 north, range 9 west. The first meeting in said district was directed to be held June 22d, at the house of M. W. Henyon. District No. 2, organized August 31, 1844, included portions of Irving and Thornapplc, and was called a frac tional district in Irving. May 17, 1844, \"district No. 1, of Irving and Yankee Springs,\" was formed, and Oct. 8, 1845, district No. 2 was reorganized as a whole district in Irving'. The order of organizing other districts is thus given: No. 3, Dec. 14, 1850; No. 4, in 1852; No. 5, April 29, 1854 ; No. 6, April 29, 1854; No. 7, Dec. 17, 1859; No. 8, May 31, 1860; No. 9, in July, 1862; No. 10, April 21, 1866; No. 11, Feb. 5, 1870; No. 12, Nov. 12, 1S70. Although district No. 1 was organized, as has been seen, more than a year before district No. 2 was formed, the latter was the first to have a school-house, which was built, in 1846, on section 33. The school inspectors' records make no reference to ap pointments of teachers previous to April 18, 1853, when it appears Martha P. Balch and Eliza J. Dennis were employed May 4, 1853. Martha Messer was given a certificate, and November 5th, the same year, A. D. Rork, Sarah Wooley, and Lucy Archer were appointed. Among later teachers (to November, 1857) appear the names of Mary E. Strasbaugh, Thomas Coyle, Amelia Smith, and Euieline Henyon.

Upon the transfer, how ever, of the class to the Irving Circuit, services were held fortnightly, and such has been the measure to the present time. The Irving Circuit includes now two points in Irving, one in Yankee Springs, and two in Rutland, and is in charge of Rev. John McAllister. The Irving class, with a present membership of 30, has enjoyed regular services uninter ruptedly since 1847, and since that time Peter Cobb has been continuously the class-leader. The school directors for 1879 were C. T. Barton, I. M. Cunningham, R. Billingsley, John Fighter, T. C. Alverson, M. Yearington, J. Teeple, Farrel Burns, Emanuel Bergy, William Mugridge, H. Wilcox, and W. Calkins. IRVING POST-OFFICE. The first post-office established in Irving was one of the results of the opening of the stage-route between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids via Hastings, July 1, 1846. It was located at the house of A. E. Bull (who was appointed postmaster), and called Irving. In 1847 the office was transferred to R. N. Hanna, and in the same year G. K. Beamer, being appointed deputy, kept the mail at his house, and in 1848 was himself appointed postmaster. He was succeeded in 1855 by L. K. Powers, who retained the office at his house until 1865, when it was removed to Irving village, and Asahel Hubbard was appointed his suc cessor. In 1869 the office passed into the possession of F. L. Blake, the present incumbent. ZION METHODIST EPISCOPAL (GERMAN) CHURCH. A German Methodist Episcopal class was organized about 1858 at the school-house on section 14, and included the families of Jacob Schmelicher, Conrad Beeler, and John Reuter, Conrad Beeler being the class-leader. There was preaching onee in three weeks by supplies from Grand Rapids. In 1860 a church was built on section 2, and, although it was not fully completed until 1869, it was oc cupied from 1860 forward. Rev. Mr. Bertrand, of Grand Rapids, was the first pastor after the occupation of the new church, and since him the pastors have been Rev. Messrs. Yahrhaus, Behrens, Grille, Buttenbaum, Mains, Herzog, Weber, Mattae, Schump, Kern, and Heidemyer, the latter being now the pastor, and preaching once a week. After Conrad Beeler, the class-leader was John Reuter, and in 1869, Gottleib Nagler, the present leader, was appointed. The membership is now 42; the trustees are Conrad Beeler, August Gush, Jacob Schmelicher, Sr., Jacob Schmelicher, Jr., Gottleib Nagler, John Timm, and Ernst Gush. NORTH IRVING POST-OFFICE was established in 1858, when Peter Cobb was appointed postmaster, and as such he has remained continuously to the present. FILLMORE POST-OFFICE was established in 1867, and named as a compliment to Millard Fillmore. D. D. Darling, the present postmaster, has been in charge of the office from the first. FREEPORT POST-OFFICE EAST IRVING CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. has existed since 1878, when the present postmaster, Samuel Roush, was appointed. Jan. 12, 1868, Rev. S. H. Smith organized a Wesleyan Methodist class in the school-house on section 14. The members were Philip Segar, Steward ; William Moulton, Leader; Mary Moulton, Eliza Fowler, Daniel Sparks, Francis Ruckle, Anna Jones, Mary Slocum, and B. Eck ert. Revs. Richards, Bliss, Selleck, Ross, and Jones were the ministers who succeeded Mr. Smith until the summer of 1877. At that time, the project of building a church being agitated, William Moulton essayed to push the matter forward, and upon his individual responsibility undertook the task of putting up the edifice, trusting to the support of the members of the class as the work went on. He was, however, disappointed in this expectation, and, receiving no aid from that quarter, sound himself with an unfinished house of worship on his hands. In this emergency he determined to organize a Congregational Church, provided the Congre gational Union would supply the funds necessary for the completion of the building, and, this being pledged, the East Irving Congregational Church was straightway organized by Rev. J. B. Jones (previously pastor of the Wesleyan class) with 18 members. Jacob Wolf and George Coulter, now deacons, were chosen in 1877. Rev. Mr. Jones is still the pastor, and the pastor likewise of the Congrega tional Church at Freeport. The membership is now about 20. North Irving, Fillmore, and Freeport receive each a daily mail over the route from Hastings to Lowell, in Kent County. IRVING'S DOCTORS. The history of the medical profession in Irving may be recited briefly in the statement that the first physician to locate in Irving village was E. M. Rosencrans, who remained but a year. He was followed by Dr. S. Robinson ; then came Dr. L. E. Haskins for a short stay, and in 1878 ar rived Dr. J. Lamoreux, the only physician now practicing in the village. In Freeport, Dr. H. C. Peckham opened an office in 1878, and closed it in 1879, when Dr. L. E. Has kins, now the only physician there, occupied the field. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. THE IRVING METHODIST CLASS. The pioneer religious organization of Irving was the Irving Methodist Episcopal class, organized in 1847, at the school-house on section 33, by William Sprague, presiding elder. The class was in Hastings Circuit, on which Rev. T. B. Sprague was the preacher. The members of the class were Peter Cobb (leader), Hannah Cobb, J. W. Bradley, iSarah Bradley, Polly Bradley, Julia Ingraham, Sylvenus Trayis, Zilpha Travis, Lydia Ingraham, Eleanor Rich, and Rosaniond Ingraham. At first there was preaching once in four weeks, and for about fifteen years, while the class remaine4 on the Hastings Circuit, opportunities for public METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF IRVING. A Methodist Episcopal class was organized at Irving village in 1868 by Rev. S. P. Hewitt, the then preacher on the Irving Circuit.

Beamer, and on September 22d, Rev. W. S. Bugbey preached the first sermon, the edifice being dedi cated ou the 19th of the following November. Rev. Mr. Moore preached as supply until the engagement of Rev. W. S. Bugbey, the present pastor, who preached also at Middle ville. The Irving Church has now a membership of 30. The deacons are G. K. Beamer, F. L. Blake, and J. C. Hanna. The Sunday-school is in charge of G. K. Beamer, assisted by five teachers, and has an average attendance of 40. Following Hewitt, the pastors were Revs. Marsh, Parker, Hayes, Browning, Whitmore, and John J. McAllister, who is now on the circuit. Worship was held in the village school-house until 1877, when the present handsome brick church edifice was erected, at a cost of $3000. The trus tees are Enoch Sylvester, John Texter, Frank Campbell, Harmon Wilcox, William Cridler. William Cridler is su perintendent of the Sunday-school. THE FREEPORT CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OF IRVING. was organized May 27, 1877, by Rev. I. B.Jones, with 21 members. P. H. Segar and J. H. Adams were chosen deacons, and are still in office. The church now occupied was begun in 1877, dedicated July 27, 1879, and cost $2500. The trustees are P. H. Segar, J. H. Adams, and Marcus B. Childs. The church membership is 28. The first public religious services in Irving village were held about 1854, by Rev. Mr. Waldo, a Congregationalist, in a building put up by L. B. Hill, for a chair-factory, and subsequently used for a grist-mill. About that time and subsequently, Rev. Mr. Tapley, a Wesleyan Methodist, Rev. Mr. Osborne, a Baptist, and Rev. Mr. Kidder, a Congrega tionalist, held occasional services in the village. THE FREEPORT UNITED BRETHREN CLASS, Previous to 1870 the pastors of the Presbyterian Church now worshiping in the Methodist Episcopal church, was organized by Rev. Mr. Lane, in 1877, as a revival of a United Brethren class, which had been worshiping in the neighborhood. There were 8 members, of whom Free man Fish, the present class-leader, was then chosen leader. There are now 24 members. Rev. Mr. Stimpson, on tho Bowne Circuit, preaches once a fortnight. at Hastings used to preach in Irving once in two weeks, but in the year mentioned the minister of that church concluded to confine his labors to Hastings, whereupon the Presbyterians at and near Irving requested Rev. D. B. Campbell to organize a church there, and to become the pastor. He- was commissioned a home missionary Oct. 1, 1870, and Jan. 1, 1871, with Rev. T. D. Marsh and Ruling Elders J. P. Roberts and Richard Young, effected the de sired organization at Irving. The members numbered 16, and until April 20, 1877, the church prospered more or less, but at that time it was resolved to dissolve the organi zation with a view to the formation of a Congregational Church. THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH OF FREEPORT was organized in the summer of 1878 with but 6 mem bers, and since then has not grown very materially in strength. There is preaching every Sunday by Rev. F. I. Bell, of Bowne Centre. Elisha Jennings is the class leader. The trustees are Elisha Jennings, Mrs. Susan Jennings, John Freeland, Geo. Salsbury, J. A. D. Vore, and Mrs. J. A. D. Vore. On the 13th of the ensuing May, accordingly, Rev. Levi Warren, of Grand Rapids, superintendent of Home Missions for the American Missionary Society, preached in the Irving school-house preparatory to the organization of a Congregational Church, and on that occasion F. L. Blake, G. K. Beamer, and A. E. Bull, were appointed a committee to call for an ecclesiastical council. May 20th a confession of faith was adopted, and May 25th the organization was completed by the admission of members, as follows : F. L. Blake, Mary E. Blake, Patience Teeple, Lucy C. Teeple, Mrs. Saloma Bierce, and Mary E. Hendershott, from the Wesleyan Methodist Church ; J. J. Hendershott, Martha Hendershott, Nancy J. Dudley, Eliza J. Lee, James C. Hanna, Lucena Hanna, George K. Beamer, A. E. Bull, Anna J. Beamer, Lydia Ann Bull, D. B. Pratt, Violetta L. Gardner, Isabella Campbell, Marietta Campbell, and Euphemia M. Hoyt, from the Presbyterian Church ; Emma M. Campbell, from the Protestant Episcopal Church ; and Mary T. Gibbs, Catharine T. Hendershott, W. S. Gibbs, H J. Dudley, Mrs. Clara Dow, Miss Lizzie J. Nash, Mrs. Alice M. Dudley, and Miss Minnie Lee on profession. A. E. Bull, F. L. Blake, and G. K. Beamer were chosen deacons, and April 9, 1878, the church joined the Grand River Conference. The church building now in use was built at the cost of $4000, and finished in September, 1878. The first services therein were at a meeting of the Sunday school, September 8th, on which occasion the first prayer was IRVING GRANGE, No. 52, was organized Aug. 13, 1873, with 18 members. J. J. Hendershott was chosen first Master, and served through '73, '74, and '75, followed in order by John Campbell, J. C. Hanna, and Isaac Cunningham to 1879, when he was again elected. The chief officers at present are J. J. Hen dershott, M. ; J. C. Hanna, Sec. ; B. B. Travis, O. ; Allen Matthews, L. ; Wm. A. Moore, Chaplain ; James Brew, Treas. The membership is now 23. Regular sessions are held in Grange Hall, at Irving. IRVING VILLAGE In 1832, L. B. Hills, of New York, settled in Wayne Co., Mich., and in 1849 bought six 80-acre lots on the Thornapple River, in Irving township, where Irving village now stands. The fine water-power at that point induced him to make the purchase, and in July, 1849, he let the contract for building a dam. In 1851 he put up a saw mill and himself carried it on. Then too came William Gibbs, a blacksmith, and presently Mr. Hills made a bold push forward by the erection upon the river in 1853 of two buildings, intended respectively for a chair-factory and a foundry. These latter projects, however, were not carried out, and in October, 1854, Asahel Hubbard, coming to the"], [658, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 448 lage, containing three stores, two churches, the handle and rake-factory of Job Cheesbrough, where sixteen people find employment, a wagon-shop, hotel, etc. place, purchased a half-interest in the water-power, and, in conjunction with Hills, converted the proposed chair-factory into a grist-mill, with two run of stone. Hills & Hubbard were the mill proprietors for a few years after that, when Hills disposed of his interest to Jeremiah Hendershott. In 1871, Hubbard & Hendershott erected the mill now carried on at Irving by Gardner, Campbell & Co. It contains five run of stone, represents an investmentof upwards of $30,000, and is accounted one of the finest mills in Michigan. Its capacity is about 150 barrels of flour daily, and, besides doing a large business in custom-work, it ships a great deal of flour to Europe as well as to the New England markets. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. JAMES C. HANNA. James C. Hanna was born in the town of Virgil, Cort land Co., N. Y., Feb. 13, 1815. He was the son of James and Elizabeth (Barton) Hanna, who reared a family of twelve children. James resided at home until he attained his majority, when he entered the employ of David R. Barton, of Rochester, in the manufacture of edge-tools. With Barton he remained three years, when he engaged in the manufacture of scythes and axes at Avon, N. Y. This venture proved unremunerative, and he was next engaged in farming near Geneseo, N. Y. But farming, owing to his limited means, was not a satisfactory pursuit in a pecu niary way, and after two years of unproductive labor he became a boatman on the Erie Canal. In the spring of 1856 he came to Michigan, and settled in the township of Irving, where his elder brother, Richard N., had settled in 1842 ; here he has since resided, and in many ways has identified himself with the development of the town. In his political affiliations he is a Greenbacker, and in religion a Congregationalist. Although not seeking political prefer ment, he has filled many positions of trust and responsi bility, notably that of supervisor, town treasurer, and justice of the peace. Irving village was surveyed by L. B. Hills in 1859, but when the water-power and milling interests passed to the control of Mr. Hubbard the place came to be known as Hubbardville, and as such is popularly known even now, although the post-office and railway-station have always been known as Irving. Mr. Hubbard opened the first village store in a portion of his residence in 1859, but the first full-stocked general store was the one opened in 1861 by F. L. Blake, and still kept by him. In 1865 the post-office at Power's, east of the village, was transferred to Irving; in 1868 the railway now passing through the place was completed. FREEPORT VILLAGE. In 1874 there was a promising prospect that the Kala mazoo, Lowell and North Michigan Railroad would be completed, and, indeed, the grading of a major portion of the route was assured. The line crossed the northeastern corner of Irving township, on section 1, where M. S. and Samuel Roush owned land upon which they conceived the project of laying out a town, and so, in November, 1874, they platted the present village of Freeport. The only business enterprise there at that time was M. S. Roush's saw-mill, which was at once reinforced by a store building erected by Reigler & Roush, who built also a second one, and leased it to J. H. Herrington. Although the railway enterprise failed to culminate, Freeport pushed forward, and, still hoping for a railway at no distant day, is a smart vil- Mr. Hanna has been thrice married, \u2014 first to Miss Mar garet Kimbark, of Livingston Co., N.

He is the architect of his own fortune, and has secured a well-earned competency."], [659, ""], [660, "A. G.DEWEY, ESQ., J ohnstown Tp., Barry Co.Mich"], [661, "JOHNSTOWN: Johnstoavn was named in honor of John Mott, a Quaker preacher, who lived in Jackson Co., Mich., and who, at an early day, purchased a large tract of land in the southeastern part of Barry County, intending to send a colony of \" Friends\" thither. The project, however, was abandoned, and the land was subsequently sold. As Mr. Mott, in accordance with Quaker customs, was generally called \"John\" by his brethren in the faith, early settlers and land-seekers referred to this locality as John's Town. Consequently, when the county was divided into four town ships, in 1838, the southeastern one received the name of Johnstown. In 1844 this township was divided, the west ern half retaining the old name. In 1849 the northern half was set off under the name of Baltimore. Unless when it is otherwise stated, the name of \" Johnstown\" will be applied in these pages to the district of which that township now consists, viz., survey-township No. 1 north, in range 8 west. In the latter part of the summer of 1836, having made what preparation his very limited means would allow, and accompanied by his wife, three sons, and two daughters, he started for the remote and almost unknown Territory of Michigan. He drove a yoke of cattle attached to a covered wagon from Oswego to Buffalo, where the entire outfit was placed on board a steamer bound for Detroit. The wheels were taken from the wagon and the covered box placed on the deck, where it served as a sleeping-room. At Detroit the younger members of the family, with their mother, resumed their places in the wagon. After a toilsome journey of a week the little party reached Hattie Creek. There Mr. Merrill left his family and proceeded to his land in Johnstown. Wishing to be more certain of the location of his prop erty before building, he made an investigation, which showed that the land he had seen was not that Avhich he had bought. Contrary to what might have been expected, how ever, the land his certificate described, which was the east half of the northeast quarter of section 35, was nearly as good as that which the guide had shown him. Not being much disappointed, aud being inclined to consider all things for the best, Mr. Merrill proceeded at once to build a cabin of poplar logs, with a roof made of slabs split from a tree, and a floor of the same material. There was a place for a door and one for a window, but sor the time those places were left unoccupied. After bringing his family to their new home, Mr. Merrill split rails for Albert Shepherd, near Battle Creek, and with the money received from him went to Toledo, Ohio, to purchase some necessary articles. With his faithful cattle, he made the jouruey in about two weeks' time. NATURAL FEATURES. Johnstown is divided into two almost equal parts by a series of lakes which, with their outlets, extend from near the western line of section 30 diagonally northeast across the township. Fine Lake, the largest in the township, is the first in the chain. SaAV-mill Lake and Bristol Lake are also of considerable size. Their waters flow through Highbank Creek into the Thornapple River. The south eastern part of the township is drained by a small stream that flows into the Kalamazoo River through Calhoun County. Along the west side of the chain of lakes is a range of steep and in some places precipitous hills, which terminates in an elevated fertile tract that originally con sisted of prairie and scantily timbered belts. There are a number of low tracts and tamarack swamps in the town ship, most of which can be drained. The tillable land is generally very productive. At intervals during several years Mr. Merrill was in the habit of working in Battle Creek, for which he was some times paid money, but for which he generally received pro visions, which he carried home on Saturday night on his back, the distance being ten miles. At one time a party of Indians, who had been at Battle Creek and become intoxi cated, came to the house of Mr. Merrill, and, finding him and his elder sons absent, began to appropriate everything to their own use. They were very ill tempered and boister ous, whooping and yelling continually. Watching his op portunity when they were all outside, the youngest son, a lad of twelve years, who was at home with his mother and younger sisters, bolted the door, and with a long iron-handled shovel took his place beside the window, declaring he would kill the first that attempted to enter. The Indians swore all the English oaths they knew, but the little fellow re mained at his post. They even fired their guns into the window, but without effect. What might have happened had this not been interrupted it is, of course, impossible to EARLY SETTLEMENT. In the year 1835, Harlow Merrill, a resident of Oswego Co., N. Y., reached Battle Creek, Mich., and employed a man to assist him in locating a piece of government land. Mr. Merrill was conducted along an Indian trail to the southern part of Johnstown. Here his guide pointed out a very fine piece, of about 80 acres, and told him how it was designated on the survey. This, without much delay, Mr. Merrill concluded to buy. For that purpose he imme diately returned to Battle Creek, and proceeded thence to the government land-office. There the money was paid, and Mr. Merrill received a certificate showing his right to the land, to be afterwards supplemented by a patent. \u2022 By G. A. McAlpine. 449 57"], [662, "450 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. to pass the night beneath Mr. Culver's roof. The example of the pioneers might well teach the present generation hospitality. say, but at this point the elder sons, who had been out hunting, returned home, Avhen the Indians withdrew. The same year that Mr. Merrill settled in Johnstown, William P. Bristol, with five other land-seekers, came to the township. Mr. Bristol finally resolved to buy 400 acres on section 4. Another of the party, Rufus Cole, decided on the southwest quarter of section 17 for himself, and the northwest quarter of section 8 and the southwest quarter of section 5 for his brother, Jason Cole. After traveling all day the party, headed by William Bristol, went to the Indian village on the bank of the body of water now known as Bristol Lake, and desired shelter for the night. The village consisted of from 20 to 30 wigwams. The In dians received the travelers kindly through one of their number, named Joseph, who could speak English. He informed them that the only lodge empty was that of the chief, who was absent, and the door of whose lodge was locked. But after considerable deliberation among them selves, they finally concluded to risk the anger of their chief rather than be inhospitable to strangers. The party was conducted to the door referred to. It consisted of pieces of bark placed upright, and the lock was a slender pole leaned against them, not to fasten them in their places, but to signify that the owner was absent. The \" lock\" Avas re moved and the party entered, passing the night in persecct quiet. The next morning Mr. Bristol, with what aid he could obtain, started for his land and began to erect a house. But, as this was to be some time in building, he took a very fine rag carpet which his wife had made in New York for the floor of their new house, stretched it over a pole, and had quite a respectable tent. But it soon began to bleach out, and Avhen they moved into their new house some weeks after, the bright colors had all vanished. In the fall and winter of 1837-38 several other families came to the township, that of S. V. R. York, who had purchased a large tract on sections 28 and 29 the year pre vious, being among the number. Mr. York's family con sisted of a wife and three daughters. Mr. York was first judge of probate in the county. While living in Battle Creek, Mr. York, with Rustin Angel and John Meechim, a surA'eyor, had been appointed to establish a road from Battle Creek through Johnstown to Hastings. This road entered Johnstown near the southeast corner of section 33, ran northwest to a point near the northwest corner of section 20, and thence extended due north on the line be tween sections 17, 8, and 5 on the east, and sections 18, 7, and 6 on the west. It has never been materially changed, and is now known as the old State road. It was the first road located in the township, although a road previously had been surveyed through the eastern part. Early in the year 1837, Stephen Collier reached the township and settled on section 34, just south of Mr. Mer rill. His family consisted of a wife and three children, \u2014 two sons and a daughter. One of the sons, Victory P. Collier, afterwards for two terms treasurer of the State of Michigan, was then a youth of twenty years. Mr. Henry Paul, who now resides on a farm near Fine Lake, was then a young man in the employ of Mr. York. He helped locate this road, and drove the first team over it to the Thornapple River. He was married some years later to a daughter of Elder Emery Cherry, the first preacher in Johnstown. The next settler was John Culver. He was employed by W. P. Bristol to come to Michigan and make some im provements on the land in the northern part of the town ship which Mr. Bristol had bought the year previous. Mr. Culver was to \" build a log house, put in a field of corn, a patch of potatoes,\" and make some minor improvements, for which he was to receive a quarter-section of land. Elder Cherry came to this township in June, 1838, bringing his family, consisting of a wife, two hoys, and two girls, and settled on section 33. Solomon Getman settled on section 35 probably about the same time. After many discouragements, which he was ill prepared to meet (the most serious of which was the destruction by fire of his hay, which he had hauled from Gull Prairie, and the serious injury of his wagon at the same time), he gave up, and, it is said, started to return to New York. Meet ing a land-speculator, however, he purchased 120 acres on section 22, where he built a house much after the plan of Mr. Merrill's, into which he moved before it was completed. Before it was completed, too, Thomas Iden, with his wife, sour sons, and one daughter, arrived, and they were all given shelter with the family of Mr. Culver until their goods should come from Detroit. Soon after, William P. Bristol came with his wife, two sons, and three daughters. He found none of the improvements which he expected, and no place for his family to live. There was still room in the little cabin of Mr. Culver for a few more, and here Mr. Bristol decided to leave his family until he could build a house for them. On the evening of the first day that Mr. Bristol reached the house of Mr. Culver, a party of surveyors also happened along. These, with the mem bers of the families referred to, made a total of 22 persons Nelson Barnum, with his wife and one son, and Jason Cole, with his wife, one son, and three daughters, reached the township probably in the early summer of 1838. Mr. Barnum bought the southwest quarter of section 8. Mr. Cole, as we have seen, owned 320 acres, purchased for him by his brother two years previous. Oris Barnum, a brother of Nelson, came soon afterwards with a family of three children. Seth Hull, with his wife and an adopted daughter, reached the township some time previous to this, and located 100 acres in the York neigh borhood. Alonzo Brundage arrived in the township in the winter of 1837-38. He bought part of section 31. In the spring of 1838, Mr. Bristol started a blacksmith shop, and employed a young man named Erastus Johnson as blacksmith. It Avas the first shop of the kind in this part of the county, and settlers frequently came as far as from Hickory Corners to have work done. It was iu the spring of 1838 that Johnstown was formed. It contained at that time what are now the four town ships of Assyria, Maple Grove, Baltimore, and Johnstown. The first town-meeting was held at the house of William"], [663, "Residence ft Stock Farm OF/..P. & B.W.KING, J ohnstown , Michigan 1"], [664, ""], [665, "JOHNSTOWN TOWNSHIP. 451 P.

At another time, when Mr. Bristol's hogs, which had destroyed a small patch of potatoes belonging to the In dians, had been terribly torn by their dogs, Mr. Bristol Avent alone to their camp and told them he would kill all their dogs if his hogs were again so abused. The chief listened quietly, and then replied that they could settle better if they should wait and see whether the hogs lived or died. The hogs all recovered, and Mr. Bristol had nearly forgotten the occurrence, when the chief one day called and demanded pay for the potatoes. This Mr. Bristol refused. The chief looked grieved, and said, \" Hogs all get well, \u2014 potatoes all destroyed.\" His philosophy was too much for Mr. Bristol, who gave him twice as many potatoes as he demanded and a large plug of tobacco. The chief said, \" Big good,\" and went his way. Mr. Thomas Iden, already mentioned, died in the fall of 1838. There was then no cemetery in the township, and he was taken to Battle Creek for burial. This was the first death in Johnstown. Mr. Bristol, who had become quite expert at the anvil, made a rude knife one day for an Indian at his request. While at work he asked the Indian if he had any money, and the latter replied that he had not. The knife was completed and handed over to the red man Avithout further remark. A long time passed, when one day the same In dian, with a hindquarter of a large deer on his back, came to the door of Mr. Bristol's house and laid down his burden, Avith the exclamation, \" Indian honest, \u2014 Indian pay.\" In the spring of 1839, Henry P. Bowman located in the township. He was married in the fall of the same year to Miss Mary Culver by Squire S. V. R. York. This, the first wedding in Johnstown, took place at the residence of the bride's father, and the happy couple settled on a farm on section 29. The same year a young man named Joseph Babcock came from New York and hired to work for Mr. Bristol \" for a bushel of wheat a day.\" He received for his ser vices, at the expiration of six months, 150 bushels of wheat, which he afterwards sold for 3 shillings per bushel in Battle Creek. It is related of Mr. Babcock that, while mowing in the marsh just ahead of Mr. Bristol, he sud denly dropped his scythe and sprang back, with both hands clutching the top of one of his boots. He whirled two or three times around, exclaiming, '* Oh, I'm ruined, I'm ruined ; I'll be dead in an hour !\" After many questions, Mr. Bristol finally understood that a rattlesnake was in Babcock's boot. Every instant the terror of the latter increased. He was as white as a sheet and as weak as a child. He would have his boot neither cut down nor pulled off, but sat on the ground lamenting his cruel fate. When he became a little more quiet, Mr. Bristol pulled the boot off, and with it came the hind-legs of a frog. The red men of Johnstown displayed many good traits. Their universal good-will and kindness to the early settlers is still the occasion of gratitude on the part of those who shared their hospitality. Further information regarding the Indians of this region may be found in the general history. From the year 1839 until all the tillable land was occu pied the settlement of Johnstown was very rapid. ROADS. The first road in Johnstown, as has been stated, was the Old or West State road, which was established in 1837. The next road was established June 12, 1838. It lay on the base-line, commencing just east of the southeast corner of section 35 ; thence west to the southeast corner of section 34. It was established by William P. Bristol and Solomon Getman, commissioners. It not unfrequently happened that little incidents came up to mar the friendly terms that usually existed between the whites and the Indians, of which latter there were a great many in Johnstown in the early days. The follow ing is an instance: When the township offered a bounty of $2 for every wolf killed, several plans were resorted to in order to catch the wily animals. John Culver made a \" wolf-fall,\" which consisted of a hole dug to a considerable depth, and so arranged that should anything fall into it, it could not get out. Upon going to his trap one morning, Mr. Culver found a wolf (as he supposed) fairly caught in it. The animal was forthwith killed and decapitated. But some of Mr. CuhTer's neighbors were not satisfied that it was a wolf, and an Indian, Avho was passing, was called on to give his opinion. When he was shoAvn the head, he looked uncertain, aud asked for the body. When the The next day the road north from the western termi nus of this one was established. It ran north between sections 34 and 35, 26 and 27 ; thence northwest to a quarter-post on the south line of section 22, from which place it extended northwest to the section-line between sec tions 21 and 22. It was about two and one-half miles long. On the 14th of the same month a road was located, run ning north between the West State road and the one just described. This highway commenced on the base-line on section 33, and terminated at the quarter-post on the north line of section 9. The road between the townships of Johnstown and Barry was established June 24, 1839. These roads were the lines of travel for emigrants into the townships and to the country on the north of Johns town. The east-and-west roads have been established as the settlements in the various localities required."], [666, "452 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. however, that a church organization was not effected, and after a few years the meetings were discontinued. SCHOOLS. At a meeting of the board of school inspectors, held on the 9th day of April, 1838, the northern half of the present territory of Johnstown and all of Baltimore were formed into one school district, called district No. 1. District No. 2 comprised what is now Maple Grove and Assyria, while dis trict No. 3 comprised the southern half of the present ter ritory of Johnstown. On the 9th of September, 1838, dis tricts 1 and 3 were rearranged. Survey-township No. 1, range 8 (now Johnstown), was then divided into three school districts, as follows : The southwestern quarter of the township was district No. 1 ; the southeastern quarter was district No. 2 ; while the northwestern quarter was No. 3. The northeastern quarter was left unorganized. THE AA'ESLEYAN METHODIST CHURCH. In the mean time two ministers of the Wesleyan Metho dist Church began a series of meetings, and, although they did not organize a class, these meetings were really the beginning of the Methodist Church of Johnstown. This society was organized soon after, and has continued to meet to the present time. There is a diversity of opinion as to who the minister was who first organized the class. In the fall of 1864 Rev. William Rice was assigned to this charge. He soon commenced a series of meetings, which were very successful. The church was completed during his ministry. It was dedicated on the 18th of June, 1867, the pastor being assisted by Dr. Hatfield. It cost $4000. It is probable that until this time there had been no pub lic schools in the township, although there had been two terms of a private school taught by Miss Sarah Curtis. One term was taught by her in the house of W. P. Bristol, in the northern part of the township, for which she received $1.50 per week. Her other term was taught in the house of Seth Hull, who with his wife had gone to Hastings to board the men who were building a mill at that place. It is not definitely known which of these terms was the first. THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. In 1865 Rev. H. H. Van Auken commenced to hold meetings in the school-house of district No. 4. The or ganizing of the society of the First Congregational Church of Johnstown was the result of his labors. Rev. Jones had held meetings in the same place, but without definite result. On March 6, 1865, the first annual meeting of the society was held. The church building on section 12 was built in 1866. Tbe first school building completed in Johnstown stood on the southwest quarter of section 28, and was built in 1840. A school building in the north part of the township had been commenced, but had not been completed. Walter Woodard taught the first school in the new building. MILLS. The first and only sawmill in Johnstown run by water was commenced where the road crosses the outlet of Culver or Saw-mill Lake, by Andrew Corey. Mr. Corey soon sold a half-share to Simeon Diedrich, but Mr. Diedrich could not stand the ague, so he sold to Mr. Bristol, by whom the mill was completed. A steam saw-mill was afterwards built on section 34. Frederick Ackley also built one on section 4 in 1850. The school board next divided the district in the northern part of the township. The new one consisted of sections 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and was designated as district No. 4. It was in the Bristol neighborhood, and the school-house which had been commenced was then completed. It served until the present fine building was erected, a few years since. In 1843 the number of districts in the four townships which then composed Johnstown was eight, but schools were kept in only six of them. The number of scholars is not given. The money apportioned among the districts amounted to $33. The first applicants for certificates to teach are re corded May 6, 1843, their names being Cordelia Robinson and Caroline Robinson. Both were successful. On the 9th of December, of the same year, Sally Maria Woodward received a certificate. STORES. The building used as a store in the west part of the town was built in 1876 by H. F. Bellenger. The post-office at this place was established in 1880. The store in the east part of the town was started by L. N. Mosier in 1879. CIVIL LIST. SUPERVISORS. After Baltimore was set off from Johnstown there were five school districts and 118 scholars enrolled in the latter township. The amount of interest on the school fund was $46.24. 1838, S. V. R.

Soon after his arrival, in 1838, Elder Emery Cherry be gan to hold religious meetings in various parts of the town ship. When Elder York arrived the two denominations to which they respectively belonged (Baptist and Free-Will Baptist) held services together. They usually met at the school-house in the York neighborhood. It is believed TREASURERS. 1839-41, Cleaveland Ellis; 1842, T. J. Humphrey; 1843-45, John Culver; 1846, C. P.

Himself and wife have been members of the Congregational Church since 1866. His advantages for education were limited, attending only the common schools, such as the country afforded in his youthful days. He has a very fine farm, under a good state of cultivation, yet this does not represent his entire property, he having quite an amount invested in the far West. He is what might be termed a mixed farmer, making a specialty of no one thing. ALBERT G. DEWEY. As an example of what a life of industry and persever ance will accomplish in forming and shaping the character, we present this subject. He was born Nov. 25, 1816, in Chautauqua Co., N. Y., is the oldest child of Eliphalet and Fannie (Morton) Dewey, who were natives of New York, and married in 1815, Mr. Dewey. being quite a prominent man, holding the office of sheriff of Chautauqua County ten years, besides other offices of trust. When Albert was six years of age his father died, leaving a widow and the two sons. After the death of her husband, the mother with her boys returned to her old home, in Madison County, where Albert remained until he was twelve, when he went to what was then Allegany County, now Livingston County, and lived with his uncle, Mr. S. Morton, remaining there until 1838. Having arrived at the acknowledged age of manhood, he came to Michigan with his uncle and family, landing in Emmet, Calhoun Co., where he made his first purchase of land, containing sixty acres, which he improved and kept four years, and then sold, and devoted his time to milling, having interested himself in that before, owning a half-interest in a grist-mill at Lowell, which was burned in January, 1849. His in surance having expired the first of the month, it was a total loss, leaving him incumbered with a debt of three thousand dollars. Though they have never been blessed with children of their own, still they have been allowed to enjoy the society of them, having adopted four orphans, \u2014 raising two girls and one boy until they started in life for themselves, adopt ing from the orphans' home in Chicago a bright, promising youth of little less than three summers, who only lived two short years. Mr. Dewey's mother, who passed her later years with him, died at his home in 1875, and when her lamp of life went out they laid her in a sunny nook, where she is quietly sleeping the sleep of the blest. A. P. AND B. W. KING. A. P. and B. W. King are brothers who trace their origin with commendable pride to a New England ancestry. They were born in Brighton, Monroe Co., N. Y. A. P. was born May 21, 1825, and B. W., Aug. 25, 1827. Of a family of seven children only two were girls, and all are living but one brother. Their father, David King, was a native of the Bay State, where he was born Oct. 3, 1786. Their mother, Catharine Booth, was born in Stafford, Conn., June 16, 1794, but married Mr. King in 1812 in Scipio, Cayuga Co., N. Y. He was a carpenter and joiner; worked at his trade in New York until the spring of 1841, when he with his family moved to Michigan, landing in Lyons, Ionia Co., still following his chosen avocation until 1845, when he was killed by a falling limb. Mrs. King re mained on the home until her death, teaching her children by her example habits of industry, economy, sociability, and honesty. Her precepts were well observed, she never having cause to complain, as they all filled the qualifications taught and became prosperous and respected. The subjects of this sketch remained at home, assisting their older brothers to clear up their new home, until they were of age, and in consideration for said work received a deed of eighty acres of wild land in Ionia County. In the spring of 1846 A. P. hired out to Mr. Jason Cowles, in Johnstown, Barry Co., for one year, and with this bought 80 acres more in Ionia County, his brother, B. W., still remaining at home im proving their first purchase. After A. P.'s time Avas out in Barry County, he returned to Ionia County, and built a house on his farm, remaining about one year, making other improvements. June 1, 1848, he married Miss Mary York, daughter of Henry and Polly York, who were both natives of Saratoga, N. Y., where she was born July 7, 1826. Her father was a farmer, and came to Michigan when she was To recover this he conceived the idea of going to the far famed gold-mines of California, and the same spring, receiv ing help from his uncle, he started, taking the overland route in March, arriving there in September, agreeing to give his uncle one-half of what he made in two years to repay him for his kindness in starting him. In October he was taken sick, and in December, fearing he would be no better, he sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where he re mained until February, when he returned to San Francisco dead broke, but with earth's richest blessing, health. He then went to mining, which he followed diligently three years. At the expiration of his second year, having never for gotten his promise to his uncle, he sent him one thou sand dollars, being oue-half of what he had earned by the sweat of his brow. He then returned to Michigan, aud in 1854 was married to Mrs. Mandana Wallace, of Gull Prairie, Kalamazoo Co. Her parents were natives of New York, where she was born, but came to Michigan when she was but twelve years old. After marriage they moved to Kent County, where he owned land near his brother, remaining only a short time, when they both sold out, moving on the farm where he now lives, which consisted of one hundred and sixty acres, twenty improved. To Mr. and Mrs. Dewey was born one son, who died in infancy, but Mr. Dewey passed through his severest trial in September, 1855, being bereft of his wife, thus leavin\"* a vacancy in his home and a void in his heart which time alone can heal. In March, 1858, in Battle Creek, he married Emeline Cookson, who was born in Livingston Co., N. Y., Nov. 19, 1820. Her father was a native of Maine, her mother of Ncav York, she being one of a family of fiA*e"], [671, "Resi den ce of T. B.

After marriage, instead of returning to their home in Ionia, Mr. King bought the farm where he now lives of his Avife's father, consisting of one hundred and twenty-eight acres on sections 28 and 29, Johnstown township, running in debt for it. In about one year the younger brother sold out his interest in Ionia and joined his brother, he marrying Miss Sallie York, a sister of his brother's wife. They have always lived as one family, thus proving an exception to the old adage, \" No house is large enough for two families.\" In 1850 they disposed of their land in Ionia.

In about two years he pur chased eighty acres joining his farm. The farm now con tains one hundred and forty-nine acres, one hundred and twenty in a fine state of cultivation. Mr. Fisk, though a blacksmith by trade, is also a practical farmer, takes great interest in the improvement of stock, and, in company with his youngest son, W. H. Fisk, is the owner of a fine flock of thoroughbred registered American Merino sheep, having lately made a purchase of sixteen head from L. I. Stickner, F. and L. E. Moore's flock in Vermont. He is also inter ested in the culture of bees. Mr. and Mrs. Fisk are the parents of five children, of whom two boys and one girl are living. S. S. Fisk, the oldest, is married, and owns a farm joining his father's, on the bank of Fine Lake. The next son, W. H. Fisk, remains at home and carries on the farm under the supervision of his father. The daughter, Mira, now Mrs. Brinnistool, also lives at home. J. E. Fisk is in politics a Republican, though never an office seeker. His advantages sor school were very limited ; in fact, com mencing to learn his trade when he was so small he had to stand on a stool to bloAV the bellows. Mr. and Mrs. Fisk have both been members of the Baptist Church for the past twenty years. Though they have met with severe losses, losing at one time by fire three thousand dollars, they rank to-day among the leading farmers of the county. They might be termed mixed farmers, making a specialty of blooded cattle and horses. They have at present forty head of short-horns as fine as can be found, and sixteen head of fine blooded horses. To the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. A. P. King were given two children, \u2014 Frances H., born May 16, 1851, now Mrs. Doty, and living in same town, and Henry N., born Nov. 23, 1853, still remaining at home. In politics both are Democrats, but not office-seekers, though often solicited. B. W. has been president of the Agricultural Society, and was nominated for the office of sheriff, but, his party being in the minority, he was defeated. Mr. A. P.

Among the earliest settlers the name of Hinchman stands prominent as that of an honest, upright man, whose ances try trace themselves back to New Jersey, where this sub ject was born in Vernon township, Suffolk Co., March 4, 1803. He is a son of John and Elizabeth (Blane) Hinch man, who were represented by a family of seven children. They were farmers, and lived and died there, \u2014 the father when our subject was about ten years of age, his mother in 1828. T. B. left home when quite young to make his mark. The reader can judge for himself of his success. Worked by the month until he was thirty years of age, when he secured a partner to assist him in traveling the rugged path of toil by marrying Miss Phebe McCain, daughter of Thomas and Amelia McCain, who were both natives of New York, where Phebe was born April 1, 1810, being the only daughter in a family of seven children. They, too, tilled the soil, and both died in New York, the father in 1828, the mother struggling against the vicissi tudes of life as only a mother can until 1863, when she, too, departed to that land from which no traveler returns. After marriage they remained in New York, working her mother's farm until 1836, when they came to Michigan, landing in Battle Creek, buying a house and lot ; they remained there some five years, earning their support mostly by days' work. In 1842 they bought and moved on to the farm where the widow now lives. His first purchase consisted of one hun dred and sixty acres in the state of nature, to which he afterwards added, until, at his death, in January, li-l'.l, his farm contained three hundred and fi\\*e acres, besides owning other land iu the toAvnship. To Mr. and Mrs. Hinchman were giA'en eight children, \u2014 John T., born May 4, 1S35 ; J. E. FISK. This man, among many others, is in the truest sense of the word a self-made man, one who, Avith industry and perseverance, has made life a success. He was born in Litchfield, N. Y., March 24, 1815 ; is the oldest of a family of seven. His father was a native of Vermont. His mother, of Pennsylvania, was of Dutch descent. Mr. Fisk, Sr., was a blacksmith ; worked at his trade in New York until 1847, when he moved to Michigan, where he died, March 10, 1876, at the advanced age of ninety-seven, havinc; buried his wife in 1864. J. E. Fisk learned his trade of his father, and remained at home until he was twenty, Avhen he started for himself, working in his father's old shop. On reaching his majority he married, in Steu ben County, Miss Samantha Gregory, who was born in the same county, Oct. 12, 1815. Her father was a native of New York, her mother of Connecticut. After marriage they remained in New York, he still working at his trade, until 1839, Avhen they came to Michigan, staying one year on Goquack Prairie, Calhoun Co., Avhen they went to Emmet, same county, where they remained some three years, he still working at his chosen avocation.

Beech, maple, ash, oak, and black walnut are the prevailing woods, while tamarack is the usual product of the swamps. No pine is found in Maple Grove. The township of Maple Grove lies on the eastern line of Barry County, being bounded north by Castleton, south by Assyria, west by Baltimore, east by the township of Kalamo, in the county of Eaton. The village of Nashville embraces about 600 acres of Maple Grove within its corporate limits, and affords to the people of the township a very convenient point for the shipment of their produce. Fruit is grown in abundance, the apple-trees being espe cially prolific. Very few farms are without an orchard of choice grafted fruit. Peaches are also extensively grown, the soil being very congenial to them. Cherry-trees like wise yield an ample harvest, and have proved a source of considerable revenue to the grower. Maple Grove, which is designated on the United States survey as township 2 north, of range 7 west, was, as early as 1835, the resort of Eastern land-lookers and speculators, and two years later was chosen as the home of an actual settler. Its progress was not rapid, and for many years the voters numbered but half a score. It Avas at this time under the jurisdiction of Johnstown (which then embraced the four townships of Johnstown, Assyria, Maple Grove, and Baltimore), and did not enjoy an independent organization until 1846. It was christened by the wife of one of the early pioneers. Several names were suggested before its present significant cognomen was adopted. EARLY PURCHASES OP LAND.

A strong clay soil prevails in much of the western portion, though a considerable area of swampy land is also to be seen iu this locality. Wet land is also observable elsewhere in the township, but a good drainage system has rendered the most of it productive. In the centre and on the eastern border much good land is found, which is admirably adapted to the growth of grain. The last census, that of 1873, gives the area of wheat harvested as 1573 acres, and that of corn as 1112 acres, which produced 27,339 bushels of the former and 40,442 bushels of the latter grain. Of other grains 26,803 bushels were gleaned, while 1254 tons of hay were cut. This yield has been greatly augmented by the improved condition of the township since that date. Eighty-two thousand three hundred and thirty-four pounds of maple-sugar were also made, which figures attest the richness of its maple-groves. The surface of the township varies greatly. Many ab rupt declivities are apparent in the centre and west, while level stretches of land are found in the south and also in the Avest. From the elevated points commanding views are * By E. O.

The settlement of the territory of Maple Grove began in May, 1837, when Eli Lapham, accompanied by his son Leander, and his daughter Sophronia, made a weary pil grimage with an ox-team, from Wayne Co., Mich., a dis tance of one hundred and twenty-five miles, to the woods of township No. 2, Mrs. Lapham and five younger children being left behiud. There was at this early day not a road in the township in question. On arriving in what is now Assyria, the trav elers halted and accepted the cheer offered by the family 58 of Cleaveland Ellis, while Mr. Lapham proceeded to cut his way to the quarter of section 35 which he had previously purchased from John Mott, of Jackson County. Mr. Lapham immediately constructed a rude shanty of logs, into which, although it was still uncompleted, the family moved the following day. The work of clearing was at once begun, and 5 acres of wheat was sowed the same year. In the July following, Mr. Lapham returned to Wayne County and brought back his wife and five children, with another load of household goods, also drawn by oxen.* Wolves were numerous, and the night was made hideous with their howls. Mrs. Lapham found it difficult to over- come her terror of these animals, and at night protected the entrance to the cabin with a salt-barrel placed in front of the blanket which served as a door. \" Massasaugas\" were also abundant, and added much to the anxiety of the mother. The children were always warned to carry sticks when out of doors, with which to keep off these venomous serpents. The little log cabin erected in May, when the bark would peel, was roofed and floored with bark. The bark on the floor showed a constant tendency to curl up, and it was therefore turned over daily to keep it flat. With the household goods brought in July were some pieces of oil- cloth. In dry weather these did duty as a carpet, but on rainy days they were taken up and spread over the beds to protect them from the water, which poured through the leaky roof. Mr. Lapham's death occurred in Calhoun County, in 1865. He was during his lifetime an exemplary believer in the Quaker faith, and much of his time was devoted to exposi- tions of its peaceful teachings. His venerable companion died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Abram S. Quick. His son, Leander Lapham, resides on section 21, in Maple Grove, where he has been engaged in both commercial and agricultural pursuits. Abel Hallock came from Wayne County with Mr. Lap- ham, and remained in township 1 (now Assyria) until a shanty was erected on the farm on section 26 now occu- pied by J. C. Dillon. The old home in Wayne County, however, had superior attractions for Mr. Hallock, and he returned thither in 1850 after selling his land to John Baldwin. Still later he removed to Ypsilanti, Mich., and subsequently to Howard, Montcalm Co., where his death occurred. William Sutton, a former resident of Battle Creek, en tered 160 acres in 1836 on sections 22 and 23, to which he removed in 1838, erected a shanty, and did some clear ing. He was then a bachelor, but during the year of his arrival he wedded Miss Sophronia Lapham, the daughter of his old Wayne County neighbor. This marriage, which occurred at the house of the bride's father, was the earliest * He likewise brought a mare, which was subsequently the occasion of much trouble. About two years after reaching Barry County slit was stolen by Indians, but two years later was recovered by Mr. Lap ham. Several Indians then presented themselves, fully armed, at Mr. Lapham's house, and, with many threatening gestures, demanded the animal back. Not being successful, however, they resorted to their former expedient, and stole her again."], [678, "niSTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 458 labors. Among other experiences Mr. Quick relates an encounter with a bear, which very seriously alarmed his excellent wife, and enabled him for a brief time to cultivate a very close intimacy with the animal. A well-directed shot had dislocated the jaws of the beast, and allowed his victim to escape with only an enthusiastic hugging. A detailed biography of Mr. Quick is given at the close of the town ship history. in the township, and Mrs. Sutton (while Miss Lapham) was the first white woman Avho passed a night in the terri tory of Maple Grove. A daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sutton, born in 1839, was the first child born in the township. In 1852, Mr. Sutton sold his farm to Adam Wolf, and after wards moved with his family to Calhoun County, where they now reside. Richard McOmber, the fourth pioneer in order of ar rival, migrated from Wayne County, N. Y., in 1838, and located upon 160 acres on section 22. He had come with wagon and team to Buffalo, whence he had crossed the lake to Toledo, and from there had again traveled by wagon to the locality just mentioned. With Mr. McOmber came four sons, \u2014 Philo, Darwin, Pliny, and Otis, \u2014 and one daughter, \u2014 Amanda (now Mrs. Aaron Durfee, of Balti more), \u2014 all of whom during the first year remained under the parental roof. Darwin McOmber subsequently removed to Baltimore township, while Otis has become a resident of Louisiara, and Pliny carries on the home-farm. E. G. Mapes removed from Salem, Mich., to the town ship in 1839 (as near as can be ascertained), and located upon 160 acres on section 36. Mr. Mapes served as the first clerk of Maple Grove township, and was frequently elected to other local offices. He at length died on the farm he had cleared up. A pioneer from St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., arrived in 1841 in the person of Peter Downs, who purchased 160 acres, in 1836, upon section 36, but did not remove on to it until five years later. He subsequently sold it, and purchased on section 15. Mr. Downs' death occurred in the town ship, at the residence of his son-in-law, in 1871. On Mr. McOmber's arrival he occupied the shanty erected by Wm. Sutton during the temporary absence of that gen tleman. During the winter a house was erected, and the following spring 4 acres were sowed with grain and culti vated with hoes, no plows nor horses being available among the stumps and trees. Indians were numerous, and often slept on the floors of the cabin when belated on their hunt ing expeditions. They invariably dragged the game they had shot into the house to protect it from wolves, and always offered a slice of venison or bear-meat to their hostess for supper. The earliest disciple of the healing art in Maple Grove was Dr. Archelaus Harwood, who located himself on 160 acres of attractive land on section 35 in 1840. The doctor belonged to the Thomsonian school, and exercised his pro fessional skill over an extended territory. He inspired very great confidence in the minds of his patients, among whom he dwelt until his removal to Battle Creek, many years later. Joseph Badcock came to the township in 1841, and located upon 92 acres on section 5. He was an energetic farmer and public-spirited citizen, holding several responsi ble public positions. He subsequently removed to Ingham County. Richard McOmber died in 1858, at the house of his son, in Baltimore. John Dean followed soon after, and located himself upon 80 acres on section 26. Mr. Dean did much to advance the interests of the township, and the earliest religious ser vices were mostly held at his house, when Eli Lapham usually presided ; also officiating at his own house in the same capacity. Mr. Dean subsequently moved away from Maple Grove, his farm being now occupied by D. Jackson. Adjoining the farm of Mr. Badcock was that of Aaron Burgess, who located upon it the same year. He still sur vives at a venerable old age, being yet a resident of the same tract. J. F. Fuller was an early resident of Orleans Co., N. Y., whence he removed to Jackson Co., Mich., and in 1842 purchased 160 acres of unimproved land in the township. Upon this he erected a shanty, and then removed his family to their new place of residence. Abel Hallock and James Owry were his nearest neighbors. He cleared 10 acres the first year, but soon after leased his farm and removed to section 26 to superintend the running of the saw-mill early built on that section. Subsequently he resumed his resi dence on his farm, but in 1871 he removed to Nashville, his present home. His son noAV occupies the old farm on \u2022section 25. Abram S. Quick left the attractive scenes of Niagara Co., N. Y., for the hardships of a settler's life in Michigan in 1839. On his arrival he bought 160 acres on section 34, in the township under consideration. Mr. Quick, like his neighbor, Mr. Sutton, came to the township a single man, but soon improved his opportunity and became the husband of Rachel R. Lapham, another daughter of the first settler. They were married according to the Quaker form, and the wedding-tour was limited to a walk to the house of John Dean for the purpose of attending a Quaker service. This was the second wedding in the township, both the first and second having occurred at the house of the Quaker preacher, Eli Lapham. Mr. Quick, in connection with Daniel Baldwin, erected for John Mott the earliest saw-mill in the township, on section 26, in which they had a half-interest. Later it was Avholly OAvned by Mr. Mott, and managed for him by Mr. Quick. The latter erected upon his land the first framed house in the township, which was several years afterwards consumed by fire. Ten acres were cleared by him soon after his arrival, and 40 acres were made ready for cultivation before he had a yoke of oxen to assist in his Henry Mallory, a former resident of Calhoun County, settled in the township in 1843, taking up his residence on section 26 for the purpose of conducting the saw-mill al ready mentioned. He subsequently made his home on sec tion 21, but finally removed to Nashville, where he now resides. Rufus Brooks made his advent in the toAvnship in February, 1843, and, though not among the earliest ar rivals, he found the country still extremely wild.

Y., and later from Calhoun Co., Mich. He purchased 20 acres on his arrival, to which he added 40 soon after. His advent occurred in March, 1843, and the house of J. F. Fuller was opened to him until his own log shanty Avas completed. Mr. Buck was a soldier of the war of 1812, and drew a pension for his services. His death occurred in 1877. who made his home on section 4 ; Adam Wolf, an Ohio pioneer of 1852, who purchased William Sutton's farm, on sections 22 and 23 ; John AVilkinson, another emigrant from Maine, who bought a quarter of section 34 in 1852 ; J. C. Dillon, who came from Knox Co., Ohio, in 1853, and located on section 26 ; James McKelvey, of Akron, Ohio, who became a resident of section 4 in 1852 ; John Stewart, another emigrant from the Buckeye State, who located on section 10 in 1855; A. J. Culp, from Akron, Ohio, who located on section 16 the same year; and Levi Elliott, who made his home on section 22 in 1854. Among still later settlers may be mentioned H. O. Bowen, who resides on section 25 ; H. Dewey, on section 1 6 ; George D. Moore, on section 17 ; William 0. Freeman, on section 7 ; Edward Moody, on section 21 ; D. Jackson, on section 26; Gilbert Buck, on section 19; Benjamin Miller, on section 35; William Kilburn, on section 19 ; C. W. Taylor, on section 23 ; and George Dean and George Mason, on section 16. Valentine 0. Buck came from the State of New York two years later, and was for a while employed by Cleaveland Ellis, of Assyria. He found an eligible location upon 160 acres on section 19, which he cultivated and made pro ductive. Mr. Buck was elected justice of the peace during the first year of the township's existence. He subsequently disposed of his property and returned to the Empire State. D. G. Hamilton came from Ohio in 1846. He chose a location on section 24, where he had purchased 80 acres of Amos Dillon. He found Peter Dillon already located on the same section, where he had secured 140 acres, one-half mile east. There his family found a welcome until a house was constructed. For seven years the portion of Maple Grove immediately north of Mr. Hamilton remained uninhabited. After this date a new impulse Avas given to the development of the township by the arrival of settlers from Ohio and the East, which promoted its rapid improve ment. But ten voters exercised the franchise when Mr. Hamilton came. The nearest and earliest school-house, generally known as the \" Quail-trap,\" was half a mile south of him. Mr. Hamilton, in 1871, removed to a tract of 80 acres on section 13, which is his present home. TAX-PATERS OF 184C.

He purchased 40 acres on section 20, which was totally unim proved. He removed, however, several years later to a more eligible locality, on section 31, where he still resides. His brother, Charles S., came the same year, having for merly been a resident of Eaton County, where he had located in 1841. He at first superintended the running of the saw-mill erected by John Mott, on section 26, and afterwards purchased 80 acres on section 14, where he built a log house and remained many years. In 1872 he moved to section 15, where he secured 80 acres, on which he still lives. EARLY HIGHWAYS. The earliest recorded highway in the township was sur veyed by Edward Sutton in March, 1840, and is described as follows : \"Commencing at the southwest corner of section 34, township 2 north, of range 7 west, running north on the section-line between sections 33 and 34, 10 chains and 40 links: thence north 24i degrees, east 11 chains and S links; thence north 151 degrees, west 6 chains and 16 links; thence north 141 degrees, east 10 chains and 10 links; thence north 5 degrees, west 10 chains and 48 links; thence north 26J degrees, west 6 chains and 68 links; thenco north 61 degrees, west 15 chains and 7S links; thence north 191 degrees, west 1 chain and 45 links to said section-line; thence north on the line 10 chains to the section corners of sections 27, 28, 33, and 34 ; thence north on the line to the corners of sections 27 and 2S, 21 and 22 ; thence north on the line between sections 21 and 22, 22 chains; thence north 47 dc\u00b0rees, west 2 chains and 20 links ; thence north 6 chains and 50 links- thence north 261 degrees, east 4 chains ; thence north ou said lino 6 chains and 37 links to tho quarter-post between sections 21 and 22; thence north on said line 40 chains to section corners of sections 21 and 22 and 15 and 16; thenco north on said line to tho quarter-post between sections 15 and 16; thence north on said line 4 chains and 84 links; thence north 31 degrees, west 25 chains and 40 links; thenco north 14J degrees, west 138 chains; thence north 44V decrees, west 59 chains and 70 links to the northwest corner of sec tion 4, township 2 north, of range 7 west.\" In 1848 came William Jarrard, a former resident of Ohio. Eighty acres on section 15, which was quite un cleared, afforded him an opportunity to exercise his industry, and it is still his home. Valentine Ostroth arrived from Crawford Co., Ohio, in 1849, and occupied a tract of 137 acres on section 4, which he fouud entirely uncleared. Earlier in the same year came George Delbahuer, whose house afforded a home to the settlers that immediately followed him. He was accompanied by his son, George Delbahuer, Jr., who has now 145 acres there. P. M. Hyde, also from Ohio, located, in 1850, on section 21, his land embracing the tract noAV occupied by the hamlet of Maple Grove. Of the settlers after 1 850 we can make but a cursory men tion. Among those of the next few years were Reuben Norton, who came from Maine in 1851, and located on sec tion 22 ; George Marshall, previously of Seneca Co., Ohio,"], [682, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 460 nation was organized, meetings having been previously held in school-houses. Another road, surveyed the same month and year, began at the northwest corner of section 27 and ran to the north east corner of the same section. The above roads were surveyed under the direction of William P. Bristol and Cleaveland Ellis, highway commissioners for the township of Johnstown, which then included the township of Maple Grove within its limits. The earliest pastor remained but a year, and was followed by Rev. T. Brigham, who was succeeded in 1874 by Rev. H. H. Maynard, and he in 1876 by Rev. B. F. Hunger ford. Rev. George Kilpatrick came in 1878 as pastor in charge, and the present one, Rev. D. H. Shelly, was called in 1879. He conducts services at this church on alternate Sabbaths. A spacious brick edifice is now being erected on section 16 for the use of the society. The present trustees are Horace Dean, George Dean, and W. H. Whit ney. SCHOOLS. Educational facilities were first enjoyed by the few resi dents of the township in 1840. Misses Emma and Maria Mott, daughters of the prominent land-owner, John Mott, had made Maple Grove their residence, where a house had been erected for their convenience by Mr. Mott, on section 26, the spot being now occupied by a Mr. Eastman. Miss Emma determined soon after to open a school, and was promised the patronage of the few settlers Avho lived near and had small children. The school opened with six scholars, and did not greatly increase in numbers during its brief existence. THE GERMAN EVANGELICAL CHURCH. This body is now erecting a church edifice of brick on section 4, in which services are to be conducted in both the English and German languages. Rev. Mr. Miller, of Ionia, is the present pastor, who expounds the faith on each alter nate Sabbath. THE METHODISTS. A society of Methodists once existed in the township and had a considerable degree of success. A building on sec tion 15, formerly a school-house, was remodeled and used as a house of worship. The organization was, however, dissolved, and the building has recently been demolished. The Methodists of the township generally worship at Nash ville. The first school-house was built on section 25, and was known as the \" Quail-trap,\" from the fact that some enter prising lads sound it a convenient rendezvous in their expe ditions in search of these birds. This building, Avhich was in district No. 1 , was removed, and a new and more spacious edifice, on section 24, substituted. The township is now divided into six whole and three fractional districts, with the following board of directors : William G. Brooks, A. P. Jarrard, Frank Fuller, C. R. Palmer, John Hinkley, M. H. Palmer, John Day, Y. J. Cassell, Henry Troyer. Three hundred and eighty-four children receive instruction, of whom 21 are non-residents. In the course of a year 4 male and 14 female teachers are employed, who receive in salaries the sum of $1253.70. Nine framed school buildings have been erected, most of them being of com fortable but unpretentious proportions. The total resources of the township for educational purposes have reached the sum of $2080.86. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. The act of the State Legislature erecting the township of Maple Grove was approved March 25, 1846, and reads as follows : \" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Slate of Michigan, That township number two north, of range seven west, in the county of Barry, be and the same is hereby set off and organized into a separate township by the name of Maple Grove, and the first township-meeting therein shall be held at the house of Henry Deans, in said township.\" The first township-meeting was held, in accordance with the above act, on the 25th of March, 1846, Peter Downs being chosen moderator and Archelaus Harwood, Rufus Brooks, V. O. Buck, and Elisha G. Mapes inspectors of election. Archelaus Harwood acted as clerk. The folloAving officers were declared elected for the year 1846 : Supervisor, Peter Downs; Township Clerk, Elisha G. Mapes; Treas urer, Abraham S. Quick ; Assessors, Peter Downs, E. G. Mapes, Joseph Badcock ; Highway Commissioners, El dridge Austin, Eli Lapham, V. O. Buck ; Justices of the Peace, Joseph Badcock, Eldridge Austin, V. 0. Buck, Peter Downs ; School Inspectors, Archelaus Harwood, William Sutton ; Constables, Charles Downs, William Sutton, Henry Smith, Henry Mott. MAPLE GROVE POST-OFFICE. The principal consequence of this little hamlet is derived from the fact that the mail is distributed here. A store was built here by John Clark in 1868, for the purpose of conducting a business adapted to the demands of the neigh boring country. It was sold at the expiration of two years to Gilbert Lapham. He disposed of the business to his father, Leander Lapham, who erected a convenient build ing in 1875, to which he removed the stock. He is, how ever, at the present time closing out the enterprise with a vieAV to retiring, though doubtless some enterprising mer chant will succeed him. There are also a blacksmith-shop owned by Stephen Savage, and a wagon-shop, the proprietor of which is T. T. Dewey. The postmaster is Johnson McKelvey. The remaining township officers to the present year are as follows : SUPERVISORS. 1847, Henry Mallory; 1848, Archelaus Harwood; 1849-50, Henry Mallory; 1851, Archelaus Harwood; 1852, Henry Mallory ; 1854, Leander Lapham ; 1854, Adam AVolf; 1855, Leander Lapham; 1856, Townsend Coats; 1857-59, Leander Lapham; 1860, A.

Y., at the time of his birth, which occurred in that place on the 15th of March, 1825. When Pliny was about eight years of age the family removed to Marion, Wayne Co., N. Y., where he attended the district school during the winter terms. In 1836 the advantages offered by the new State of Michigan began to attract great attention among the farmers of the Eastern States, and a very large and constantly increasing emigration was the result. Among those who became infected with this almost universal desire to remove West for the purpose of bet terin\"* their fortunes on the virgin lands of the Peninsular State was Mr. Richard McOmber, who came to Michigan in the summer of 1837, and purchased the northeast quar ter of section 22, in Johnstown (now Maple Grove), and 1847, James Buck, Eli Lapham ; 1S48, Daniel Baldwin, Harlow Lap- ham ; 1849, D.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Lapham passed through all the priva tions and hardships incident to the settlement of a new country and were successful, \u2014 not so much from aid and encouragement tendered them as from a firm reliance upon their own energy and capacity. While carving out a career of success for themselves, they were not unmindful of the kindly word and helping hand which was frequently a pow erful lever to the success of others. removed to it with his family in the fall of 1838. This purchase had been made from John Mott, whose daughters were living in the neighborhood, one of these \u2014 Miss Emma Mott \u2014 being teacher of the school which Pliny first attended in Michigan. He remained at home with his father, assisting in the labors of the farm, until 1848, when, in company with two sons of Dr. Harwood, he engaged in the erection of a saw mill on Cedar Creek, in section 9, of the township of Balti more (then Johnstown). He continued to operate this mill for about three years, when he returned to his father's farm, but soon after went to Palmyra, Wayne Co., N. Y., for the purpose of attending school at that place. After a year of study at Palmyra he returned home, but in the year 1852 he again went to New York State, where he attended school at Palmyra, Wayne Co., for about one year. While there he made the acquaintance of Miss Emily Sanford, who became his wife on the 2d of March, 1854. The newly-married couple came to Michigan and lived in the family of his father. On the death of the latter, Pliny McOmber came into the possession of the homestead, where he still resides. Mrs. Lapham died in October, 1877, and in January, 1878, Mr. Lapham married Miss Hannah M., daughter of Lonson Dewey, born in Almont, Lapeer Co., Oct. 5, 1840. They still reside in Maple Grove, surrounded by a pleasant circle of old friends and relatives, whose esteem and regard they possess to an eminent degree. ABRAM S. QUICK. Among the earliest and most active pioneers in Maple GroA'e township, Abram S. Quick was especially prominent, and now, after a residence of upwards of forty years upon the place of his first settlement in Barry County, enjoys well earned comfort and ease. His father, John Quick, was born in New Jersey and lived thereafter in Pennsylvania, Canada, and New York, and in 1842 took up his resi dence with his son Abram in Maple Grove, where he died, in 1851. He served through an active campaign in the war of the Revolution, and had, at his death, reached the ad vanced age of ninety-one. Abram S. Quick was born in Pennsylvania, March 9, 1808, the sixth child in a family of eight, and, until he reached his majority, lived at home with his parents, working chiefly as a farm-hand. This occupation he continued here and there until 1838, when he set out for the far West, and at Adrian, Mich., ob tained employment with the Michigan Southern Railroad Company as \" boss\" of a party of laborers at work on the line. In the fall of 1838, with Abel and Daniel Baldwin, he penetrated into Maple Grove township, Barry Co., and erected a saw-mill in section 26, upon land owned by John Mott, a Quaker, living then in Jackson County, with whom the mill was to be worked on shares. From Mott the property was known as the Quaker Mill, and that name it retains to this day. This, the pioneer saw-mill of Maple Grove, was carried on by Quick and the Baldwins in company until the spring of 1840, when Mr. Quick (hav ing, in 1839, bought a place on section 34) turned his attention to clearing and cultivating his land, and upon that place he has ever since resided. When he settled in Maple Grove there were but five other settlers in the town. He built upon his present place, in 1840, the first framed residence in Maple Grove, the building being destroyed by fire in 1868, and put out one of the first two orchards in the town. By exchanging labor with his neighbors and attending logging-bees, he managed to clear and fence forty acres of his land before he owned a yoke of oxen, and has, during his life in Michigan, chopped and logged upwards of two hundred and fifty acres. During the hard winter of 1842-43 he cut out three miles of the road to Hastings, Mr. McOmber, who was originally an old-line Whig, became an ardent Republican, and continued a firm adherent to the principles of that party from its birth, in 1856, until the organization of the Greenback party, when he trans ferred his support to the latter. LEANDER LAPHAM Among the honorable names associated with the early history of Baltimore, that of Eli Lapham stands conspic uous, not less from the purity of his character than from the fact of his having been the earliest settler within its boundaries. His birth occurred in the year 1791, and his marriage at the age of twenty-one. Having, at the expi ration of the third year after, been left a widower, he later married Miss Rachel Crandall, mother of Leander Lap ham. Their residence, for a period of years after this event, was in Erie Co., N. Y. During the year 1831, Mr. and Mrs. Lapham and six children removed to Livonia, Mich., and six years later to Maple Grove, Barry Co., Mich. Eli Lapham survived until May, 1864, when his death oc curred at Augusta, Mich. His memory is still tenderly cherished by all who were familiar with his kindly nature and his unselfish life. Leander Lapham was born in Col lins, Erie Co., N. Y., in the year 1819, and was eighteen years of age on his arrival in Maple Grove. Four years after he was married to Miss Irena Smith, born in Con necticut in 1815, who came with her parents to Michigan in 1837. Three children graced their cheerful home, \u2014 Gilbert, born Aug. 12, 1846 ; Alice M., whose birth occurred Nov. 26, 1851 ; and Melville, born April 28, 1853. Alice, the daughter, died Feb. 24, 1852. Mr. Lapham early became interested in public affairs, voted first the Whig ticket, was later an advocate of the Free- Soil platform, and is now an ardent Republican. He has represented his township on fifteen occasions as supervisor, and was in 1864 a represeutative in the State Legislature."], [687, "Residence of ABRAM S. Q U I CK , Maple Grove Tp^BarryCo.Mich."], [688, ""], [689, "MAPLE GROVE TOWNSHIP. 463 and worked otherwise early and late to save his home, which Avas mortgaged to Quaker Mott, and by him threat ened with foreclosure. In 1842 his wife made a half barrel of sugar, carrying the sap, and boiling it in small vessels, while he chopped the wood. The home was, however, by the most heroic exertions, saved from fore closure, and when Quick finally got it clear and set out to build a house, he used to tramp eleven miles to Bellevue with forty pounds of sugar on his back, and with the pro ceeds, two dollars and forty cents, buy nails to use in the con struction of his dwelling. CHARLES S. DUNHAM. Charles S. Dunham, one of Maple Grove's best known citizens, has lived in the town upwards of twenty-seven years, and in the State since 1837. He was born in Orleans Co., N. Y., Feb. 24, 1820, of good old New Eng land stock, his father having been a native of Massachu setts, although his mother was born in New York State. At the age of ten the lad Charles was called upon to mourn his father's death, and with his mother, brothers, and sis ters faced the stern necessity of battling for an existence. In 1837 the family moved to Michigan, and, still pursuing the path of dependence upon his labors, Charles engaged in whatsoever industry his hands could find to do, his chief fields of toil being in Jackson and Kalamazoo Counties, and his pursuits those of farming and painting, as occasion served. In 1841, he and his brother Casper purchased some land upon section 30, in Eaton County, and to that place the family moved that year, Dec. 25, 1844. Mr. Dunham married Catharine, daughter to Peter and Pamelia Downs, of Maple Grove township, Barry Co., and upon the Dunham farm, in Eaton County, the worthy couple lived until April 25, 1853, when they moved to Barry County, where Mr. Dunham had bought new land, and in Maple Grove they have ever since resided. Mr. Quick has, during his life in Maple Grove, been prominently identified with the interests of the town- ship, and has often been called upon to render services in local offices of public trust. He has been county superintendent of the poor two terms, treasurer seven terms, justice of the peace two years, and for a number of years conspicuously concerned with grange affairs. Rachel R., his wife, was born in the town of Collins, Erie Co., N. Y., July 20, 1823, being fourth in a family of eight children born to Mr. and Mrs. Eli Lapham. Her parents were natives of Vermont, her father having been born in 1788, and her mother in 1800. Eli Lapham moved, with his family, from Erie Co., N. Y., to Wayne Co., Mich., in 1830, and in 1837 pushed on to Maple Grove township, in Barry County, where, upon section 35, with a son and daughter and his son-in-law, Abel Hallock, he made the pioneer settlement in the township. He was a Quaker minister, preached the first sermon in the town, and every Sabbath during his pioneer experience held public religious services, and preached to his family, to neighbors, and Indians, as they gathered at his house or the houses of others in response to his invitation. After an extended stay in Maple Grove he removed to Battle Creek, and died in Calhoun County in 1864, having up to the time of his death continued with more or less regularity his work as a minister in Maple Grove and other localities. His widow died in Maple Grove in 1877, at the residence of Mr. Quick, after having been an invalid eight years. Mrs. Quick has herself participated in hardy pioneer work in Michigan. She was married to Mr. Quick, in Maple Grove ; and, from the time she became a pioneer's wife, took her full share of a pioneer's burdens. As an instance it may be noted that, during the hard winter of 1842-43, while her husband was at work cutting out roads, she cut her own firewood and drew it from the woods, and that spring boiled a considerable quantity of sugar. She has all her life been a member of the Quaker Church, and, during her father's time, enjoyed the privilege of frequent worship according to that faith. Mr. and Mrs. Quick have four living children, viz. : George, born in 1842, and now living* in Battle Creek; Irena Sophronia, born in 1845, and now Mrs. Elbridge Potter, of Maple Grove; Frank M., born in 1850, and now a farmer in Calhoun County ; Frederick J., born in 1853, likewise a farmer, Mr. Dunham has always concerned himself in a spirited way with the ad\\Tancement of the interest of his adopted town, has frequently been called upon to fill various offices of local trust, and has in short been a man of mark and influence in the community. He has long been a member of the orders of Odd-Fellowship and Freemasonry, and is now connected with Nashville Lodge, No. 255, F. and A. M., and Hastings Chapter, No. 68, R. A. M. Mr. Dun ham takes a good deal of pride in the recollection that for thirty-nine years he has not missed a season of sugaring. He proposes to make the record an even forty years and rest content. Mrs. Charles S. Dunham, as already recorded, was the daughter of Peter and Pamelia (Styles) Downs. Her father was born in Vermont, Dec. 11, 1795, and her mother in Massachusetts, Aug. 2, 1791. They were mar ried in New York, July 21, 1817, and shortly afterwards settled in St. Lawrence County, where Catharine (now Mrs. Dunham), their fourth child, was born Dec. 20, 1824. In 1837, Mr. and Mrs. Downs settled in Calhoun Co., Mich., and in January, 1841, became settlers upon section 36, in Maple Grove township, in Barry County. Later they re moved to section 15, and upon the place now owned and occupied by Charles S. Dunham died,\u2014 Mr. Downs, Oct. 4, 1871, and Mrs. Downs, June 5, 1873. Mr. and Mrs. Dunham's children, three in number, are all living, and are named Peter 0., born Aug. 3, 1846; Esther, born June 29, 1848; and Matthew H., born Aug. 3, 1861. Living with them are their two adopted chil dren, Evey L., adopted February, 1863, and Charles E., adopted February, 18S0. Of Mrs. Dunham's family two brothers are now living, and of Mr: Dunham's one brother and two sisters. and in Maple Grove."], [690, "ORANGEVILLE and abided with the Browns while making ready their own habitations. Patton and one Joseph Brown, of Gull Prairie, raised a saw-mill on section 28 in 1837, but did not set it in motion until 1838. This pioneer mill was carried on for some time by Patton and Brown, and was naturally a valuable convenience to the incoming settlers. The water-power has not been suffered to waste itself in much idleness since that time, and still turns a saw-mill wheel, the business being now in the hands of Jefferson Bagley. Survey-township 2 north in range 10 west, known as Orangeville, lies on the western border of Barry County ; having Yankee Springs on the north, Prairieville on the south, Hope on the east, and the Allegan county-line on the west. The township contains a number of small ponds or lakes, among which Fish Lake, near the centre, is con spicuously attractive. Gun Lake touches the northwest corner, and there covers about 1000 acres. That locality is much resorted to by large parties of pleasure-seekers in the summer seasons, and from Kalamazoo especially the visitors gather in great force. In 1837, when Henry Brown came from Connecticut to make a settlement in Orangeville, in response to the per suasions of his brother George, he found in the Brown neighborhood a smart little community of pioneers. There were George Brown and Calvin his father, Duty Benson, Isaac Messer, a family named Adams (who soon sold out to William Dwellie, of Prairieville), John Patton, and Joshua Pease. Of the settlers above mentioned as among the pioneer vanguard of Orangeville, George Brown, Calvin Brown, Duty Benson, and John Patton are dead. Henry Brown still lives on section 32, in Orangeville, where he located in 1837. George Brown's widow lives on the same section, Joshua Pease lives in Hope township, and Isaac Messer in Carlton. Following close upon the earliest comers named came Elam Nichols and Silas Nichols, to section 32 ; Aaron Ellis, to section 29 ; J. D. Kelly, to section 31 ; William Sykes, to section 20 ; and Hiram Chase, to section 29. Dr. Fordyce Rhodes, Orangeville's pioneer physician, came to the town in 1840, and occupied the Messer place, on section 32. Elam Nichols, who settled on section 32 in 1838, was a carpenter and joiner, and built not only the first school-house the town had, but also the first framed barn. He lived in the town but a year or so, and then moved to Gun Plain. Silas Nichols had a family of twelve children, but did not not seem to con sider that complement a very big one, for, being upon one occasion asked by preacher Shaw whether he had much of a family, replied, \"Oh, not much of a one; thirteen or fourteen children, I believe,\" as if one child more or less made but little difference, or perhaps as if the children were multiplying so rapidly he couldn't keep track of them. The surface of the country is undulating and hilly, and the soil is sandy, yet agriculturally the region ranks well. There is but one village, called Orangeville, where there is a post-office. Although three separate railway projects through the town have been agitated, no locomotive has yet presented itself for welcome. Such an event is, however, not at all improbable. THE PIONEERS' ADVANCE. The first route through from Gull Prairie to the present township of Orangeville was \" blazed\"' with a hatchet by George Brown, who in the fall of 1835 marched afoot OA'er the ground, looking for a good location, while his son, Wil liam, followed him on horseback. Having reached what is now called the Brown neighborhood, he concluded to make a settlement there, and, retracing his steps eastward, took up some land on section 32. With his wife and his father, Cal vin Brown, he came on the next summer from Connecticut to begin active preparations in the Avork of making a home in the Michigan wilderness. Leaving Mrs. Brown at Blashfield's, in Prairieville, \u2014 five miles south of their des tination, \u2014 the two Browns pushed on, and in July, 1830, began upon section 32 their pioneer work in the present township of Orangeville. George Brown had engaged John Patton and Joshua J. Pease to clear some of his land, and found them on the ground, they having come to the town ship in April, 1836. They were the first actual residents of the township. After remaining at Blashfield's during three weary weeks Mrs. Brown grew restless from inactivity, and, eager to join her husband as a pioneer, sent word to him to that effect, and very soon afterward appeared before him. She found upon her arrival that a shanty had been put up on the Brown place, and that in it, besides her husband and fathei, were living John Patton and Joshua J. Pease with their families. Patton and Pease were brothers-in-law, and had come in together partly to clear land for Brown and partly to improve some land of their own on section 28 THE BROAVN NEIGHBORHOOD, as the place of Orangeville's first settlement was called, and is called to this day, gathered residents quickly after George Brown and his father delivered the first axe-strokes upon Orangeville's sorest giants. The settlers were all moderately near neighbors, and were necessarily fraternal and sociable. Hospitality was a marked feature in the community, and amid the toils and privations of pioneer life friendly visits and a happy interchange of social sentiments cheered and refreshed existence. A participant in the events of that * By David Schwartz. 464"], [691, "ORANGEVILLE TOWNSHIP. 465 time refers with glowing animation to the many delightful social occasions incidental to his pioneer experience, and honestly believes that for good old-fashioned enjoyment and hearty hospitality that period was far in advance of the present day, and that, all things taken into considera tion, there was more solid comfort than can be found now in any community. South. John and James O'Connor, two brothers, were the next to make a settlement after Townsend. They came to section 3 in September, 1838, and moA*ed from the town after a residence therein of six years. E. O'Connor, a third brother, came to section 3 in 1839 and still lives there. In December, 1838, James Stewart came from Canada to section 11, and occupied land located by his father-in law in 1836. At the same time Donald McCallum also came from Canada and settled upon the same section. Mc- Callum moved to Hope in 1851, and there died. Stewart still lives upon his old farm. In the northern portion of Orangeville the owners of lands held back their property in most cases for an advance in price, and for that reason that quarter was at first slow in being populated. Among the earliest in following Stewart and McCallum were John Gillespie and Adam Elliott, to section 3 ; James McDer mott, to section 12; and Isaac Young, to sections 10 and 11, which he bought of Donald McCallum. Fever and ague was, however, a great terror, and caused at first much distress. By many the presence of the dis ease was chargeable to the fact that, the settlers' stock of meat being usually exhausted by May, they lived largely on cucumbers and milk, and fever and ague rapidly followed this diet. The universal ague remedy was Dr. Osgood's cholagogue, and in every household it was as common as were the most urgent of life's necessaries. Dr. Osgood lived in Norwich, Conn., and made a vast fortune from his cholagogue, towards which Michigan contributed no small share. Os good visited Michigan but once, and then stopped at Yankee Lewis' for dinner, and in dwelling upon the excellence of that dinner as being the best meal he ever ate he never grew weary. Settlers thereabout could get to no grist-mill short of Otsego or Gull Prairie, and to make the journey to either place two days, and often more, were fully occupied. Fight ing against feA'er and ague was a common matter, but, fight as they would, the people suffered sorely, and, indeed, there was more unhappiness from that cause than from all others combined. Dr. Upjohn, of Gull Prairie, was tho only available physician, and his welcome presence even could not always be counted on in times of sickness, for his circuit was a large one, and, tax his energies as he might, he could not always meet his engagements. The first birth in the settlement was that of Albertus, son to George and Mary Ann Brown, who was born July 16, 1837. The first girl child was a daughter to Isaac Messer, born also in 1837, and now Mrs. Martha Morrill, of Hastings. The first death was that of Mrs. Henry Brown, who died in July, 1837, and was buried on Mr. Brown's farm. The cemetery in the Brown settlement was not laid out until some time afterward, the one in Prairieville being used in common by both towns. South of Stewart the early settlers were John and George Bugbee, Otis Bugbee, Peter Castle, Elder C. Blake, a preacher, and Calvin Preston. Farther south, on the Grand River road, S. C. Woodman, still living on section 23, came to that place in January, 1846, where John Rogers had lived a while and cleared about an acre. Among the settlers iu his neighborhood soon after he came in were the Bugbees, the Castles, Samuel Youngs, William Johncock, Joshua Hart, Ansel Haven, the Osborns, etc. riONEERS IN THE NORTH. As early as 1837, or perhaps 1836, one McKnight made a small clearing on section 9, put up a log cabin, and, be tween trading with Indians and keeping a house of enter tainment for such land-lookers as happened to pass that way, managed to eke out a precarious subsistence. Among the land-seekers who were entertained at McKnight's house in 183S was David Townsend, who bargained with McKnight for the 40 acres the latter occupieH, and also left with him $100, with which McKnight was to buy more land for him. Townsend went back to New York, and, in 1839, came out with his family. When he reached the McKnight place, expecting to find that worthy at hand with an account of his stewardship in the \u00a7100 affair, he fouud an empty cabin, and directly learned that McKnight, see ing before him a more inviting financial scheme than either keeping tavern or trading with Indians, had slipped away with the $100. Neither he nor the money was ever heard of more. Fishing was fine sport in that vicinity, and yielded wel come returns too, for food of any kind was not over-plen tiful among the pioneers. Mr. Woodman recalls a fishing excursion in which he and seven others participated, and relates that, after an all-night campaign, they got home with 400 pounds of pickerel and bass, many of which weighed 25 pounds each. He and his son were great deer hunters, and counted it as no uncommon occurrence when they brought down four deer a day. Hunting and trapping were followed by the settlers not only as a sport, but as a necessity. Money was exceedingly hard to get, and, as furs and deer-hides always commanded cash, they were eagerly sought whenever opportunity offered. Joseph Coffin, an Indian trader, was living on the town line, in section 3, when Townsend moved in, and carried on a brisk traffio with the Indians, especially in the sale of whisky to them. Upon that whisky the redskins used to get most villainously drunk, and then their howls carried great dismay and terror to the souls of such women as resided in the neighborhood, but, farther than that, it is not recorded that they inflicted any damage. Coffin's wife died in 1840, aud shortly after that he moA*ed to the far South of Woodman, on the Grand River road, Peter Falk and his son William settled on section 26 in 1844, their coming to Michigan dating from 1837, when they located in Barry township. William Falk was a cabinet maker, and his services in that capacity were in almost constant demand in the neighborhood. He still lives on section 26. His wife is a daughter of Richard Collier, who settled on the Grand River road in 1842. Thereabout, 59"], [692, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 466 him to work all night in the preparation of goods to be transported by the stages the next morning. among the early comers, were also Seth Lewis, Seymour Adams, Augustus Williams, J. H. Earl, A. D. Storms (who located upon section 35 in 1841), Elbridge Smith, Aaron Orr, Charles Matthews, and a Mr. Cass, a pensioner of the war of 1812. OTHER ROADS. On the 15th of July, 1843, a road was laid out, com mencing in the centre of the highway north of the Rogers House, running thence north and east to the northwest corner of section 2. Before that date the Yankee Springs and Pine Lake road had been laid out, and March 29, 1844, a road was laid out beginning at a stake in the Grand River road, running thence south to the east line of section 10, thence to a stake\u00b0in the highway north of the Rogers House. March 25, 1845, the survey of a road was made from the quarter post on the east side of section 25, thence north and west to \" McCallum's road.\" May 10, 1848, it was agreed that of the road between the two towns Orangeville should take the part from the Grand River road west to the centre of section 33, and Prairieville from the centre of section 33 to the southwest corner of section 32. A road from John Patton's to Prairieville was laid June 12, 1843, and May 10, 1847, one running from the Grand River road at the south line of section 23, northwest and north to the Grand River road near the line between sections 14 and 15. May 10, 1847, the town-line road from the quarter-post on the south side of section 35 east to the town-line was laid, and Dec. 9, 1847, a road was laid between the towns of Yankee Springs and Orangeville, running two and a half miles due east from the quarter-post on the south line of section 34, \u2014 Yankee Springs to work one and a half miles, and Orangeville the remainder. The earliest settler in the neighborhood of the present village of Orangeville was Isaac Fish, who located in 1837 in Oakland County, and in 1844 in Orangeville, upon section 17. The father of his wife was Abner Liverraore, who settled in Oakland County in 1833. The region in which Mr. Fish made his Orangeville home was in 1S44 a wilderness. On the south his nearest neighbor was Wil liam Sykes, on section 20, and on the north David Town send, two and a half miles distant. In Mr. Fish's vicinity and west of the village, the settlers came in rapidly about 1848. Among the earliest were Josephus Snook, to section 20; Parmenio Wolcott, to section 17 ; John Valentine, to section 17 (a place occupied in 1864 by Hiram Harper, a settler in Calhoun County in 1832) ; Sylvanus Clark, Leon ard Johnson, Liseomb Brigham, Joel Johnson, William England, W. W. Wait, Ezra Barker, and S. M. Nichols. Watson Wait, one of those named, was given at times to utterin\"- original expressions, and among others is remembered to have remarked, upon returning from church Avhere Elder Owen, an exhorter, had presided, \" Oh, nobody preached. Elder Owen, he just read a short chapter from the Bible and then exaggerated.\" Stillwell, another character, is remem bered for his anti-abolition speech, in which he charged the Black Republicans with running 150,000,000 of slaves from the South into Canada ; Pettingill for his famous reply, in which he declared that such a number of people couldn't stand up in Canada ; and Valentino for his rejoin der to the effect that \" the Upper Providence and Lower Providence of Canada were bigger than the whole State of Michigan.\" SCHOOLS. The first school known to the history of Orangeville was taught by Mrs. Isaac Messer, in 1837, in her home on section 32. She had 8 or 10 scholars and taught about tAvo months. After that, in the spring of 1838, a framed district school-house Avas built by Elam Nichols, a carpenter and joiner living in the township. The contract for build ing the house was taken by Henry Brown, who hauled the lumber for it from Gun Plain and Silver Creek. The building, which stood on George Brown's farm, cost $400 completed, and now does duty as one of the out-houses on Henry Brown's place. Although the school-house was not built until 1838, the district, including all of township 2, was organized as district No. 12 in Prairieville, July 4, 1837. THE GRAND RAPIDS ROAD. The old stage-road extending from Battle Creek to Grand Rapids, via Yankee Springs, passed through the eastern portion of Orangeville and much enlivened that section, for the volume of travel was something quite remarkable. On that thoroughfare in Orangeville there was, however, but one tavern, and that not a very important one. Charles Peck was the landlord of the inn, which was a log structure, and stood on section 35, upon the place now occupied by J. H. Earl. Peck opened his house about 1838, and it was then the only house in the township on that road. Of course this highway was a great convenience to the pioneers, for it gave them ready means of communication with the outer world, and, as stages and other vehicles passed over it frequently each day, there was always a chance to send to market or secure the performance of any similar commis sion. This business of \" sending to town\" by the stages for such articles as might be needed was carried forward liberally, and at various points along the line the driver would take up orders from people who had in some cases come miles to intercept the stage. Merchants at Battle Creek used to drive a flourishing trade in the execution of these orders by stage, and the experience of one clerk is recalled to the effect that it was no uncommon thing for The first school-teacher in that house was Harriet Hoyt, and after her the early teachers were Calvin White, Jr., Miss S. M. Woodard, Miss Mansfield, and Hannah Benson. On the 4th of April, 1838, district No. 12 was changed to No. 3, and there were then attached to it sections 4, 5, and 6, in township 1. Oct. 18, 1843, the district was changed to No. 1. March 10, 1845, district No. 7, in Prairieville, was organized to include the north half of the northwest quarter of section 1, the whole of section 2, the south half and the northeast quarter of section 3, the east half of the southeast quarter of section 4, the east half of section 9, the whole of sections 10 and 11, the west half of the north west quarter of section 12, the whole of section 14, and the east half of the northwest quarter of section 15, in town 2.

Nov. 5, 1853, district No. 5 was dissolved and attached to No. 2. At the same meeting No. 2 was changed to No. 1, No. 3 to No. 2, and No. 4 to No. 3. May 8, 1854, the districts in the township were numbered and divided as follows: No. 1 included sections 1, 2, 3, 4, the east halves of the northeast and southeast quarters of section 9, and the whole of sections 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. No. 2 included sections 23, 24, 25, 26, the east half of section 27, tho east half of section 22, the northeast quarter of section 34, and the north half of sec tion 36. In No. 3 were sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and the northeast quarter, the east half, and the north west half of section 29. In fractional district No. 3 were sections 35, the south half of 36, and the southeast quar ter of section 34. In fractional district No. 7 were the west half and the west half of the east half of section 31, and the southeast quarter of section 30.

From 184S to 1880 the persons chosen annually to serve as supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace, Avere the following : ORANGEVILLE MILLS POST-OFFICE. The post-office at the village, which was called from the outset Orangeville Mills, because there was already an Orangeville post-office in the State, was established about 1853. Hiram Tillotson was the first postmaster, followed by Eli Nichols in 1855 ; H. C. Turner in 1861 ; Eli Nichols (second term) in 1868 ; W. H. Cressy in 1868 ; and after Cressy, Mrs. S. H. Thiers, the present incumbent. At first the mail-route that supplied the office extended from Kalamazoo to Yankee Springs, and mail was received once a week from each point. The office is now on the route between Plainwell and Middleville, and has a mail twice a week. Until 1853 the residents in the township had to go to either Prairieville or Yankee Springs for their mail. SUPERVISORS. 1S48-49, George Brown; 1S50, II. Brown; 1851, E. G.

Church services were held nearly all the time from 1843 to 1875, once in two weeks, by ministers from Grand Rapids, but in the latter year they were permanently discontinued, the church membership having been seriously weakened by deaths and removals. Dr. H. C. Turner has been practicing in the village without interruption since 1855. He then came from Illi nois to visit his sister, Mrs. J. C. Snook, in Orangeville, and, being pleased with the place, determined to become a resident. A Dr. Johnson practiced in the town from 1854 to 1855, Dr. Horace B. Herrick from 1858 to 1863, and in 1870, Dr. Turner's son Jerome Avas associated with his father in practice. The foregoing brief resume includes the complete history of the medical profession in the village of Orangeville. Earlier than any of the foregoing, how ever, was Dr. Fordyce Rhodes, who settled in the Brown neighborhood, on section 32, in 1840, and practiced his profession until his departure, in 1842. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF ORANGEVILLE. Dec. 4, 1852, a meeting was held at the school-house near Henry Brown's \" to consider the prospects of the Baptist denomination in this vicinity.\" Elder Samuel Lamb presided, and it was resolved to invite a council to meet December 29th. On that day representatives from the churches of Yorkville, Otsego, Castleton, and Hope met in council and elected G. W. Johnson moderator, and C. W. Calkins clerk. The names of those presented for church fellowship Avere Archibald S. Allen and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Sylvenus Clark, J. H. Calkins and wife, J. N. Hathorn and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Osborn, James and Mary Campbell, Nancy Betts, Lucy Rude, Martha Williams, Mrs. Lent, and Mrs. Isaac Fish. The church Avas named the Pine Lake Baptist Church ; Elder Samuel Lamb was chosen pastor, and Sylvenus Clark and James H. Calkins deacons. Of the members above mentioned Mrs. Fish was the first one baptized into the church. FATALITIES. The first interments at the village cemetery were those of two young men named Truman Clark and George Sweet, who lost their lives in 1858 while crossing Gun Lake on the ice, which, proving weaker than they expected, let them down to death. About 1860 one Merrill hung himself in his barn while laboring under an attack of men tal despondency ; Henry Castle was killed by a runaway team in 1875, and in 1878 Stephen Wicks, living on sec tion 29, hung himself to a tree. In 1868, David Witherell, a school-teacher living in Prairieville, went into Blue Lake for a bath, and, getting beyond his depth, was drowned. After Elder Lamb ended his service James Campbell, a licentiate, preached a while, and then came Revs. F. Don aldson, J. Harris, T. Z. It. Jones, Elder Spooner, and (after a vacancy in the pulpit of a few years) Elders Tripp, Car roll, and Fay. EARLY RELIGIOUS EFFORTS. \"Father\" Daubney, a local Methodist Episcopal preacher of Gull Prairie, was one of the most energetic of pioneer ministers, and from one end of Barry County to the other he was vigilant in the work of seeking new settlements, and introducing therein the public worship of God. As he was in many other towns, so was he also in Orangeville, the first to offer the settlers the privilege of \" a sermon in the sanctuary.\" His visit resulted immediately from the efforts of Aaron Ellis, a settler on section 29, who had in the East long been leader of a Methodist Episcopal class. Father Daubney preached at the school-house in the Brown neighborhood in 1840, and, in 1841, when Rev. Mr. Bush came upon the Hastings Circuit, he organized a class in Orangeville. It was under the leadership of Aaron Ellis, and included the families of the Peases, Bensons, Pattons, etc. Rev. Mr. Worthington, who succeeded Mr. Bush on the circuit, lived in Orangeville, and kept the member ship of the class up to a good number during his ministra tions. Aster a while, however, there arose a period of religious inactivity, and, although the class met with more or less regularity till 1870, its existence was not a flourish ing one. Since 1870 it has had no meetings. In 1860 the place of worship was changed to the vil lao-e of Orangeville, and the name of the organization to the Orangeville Baptist Church. In the year named the erection of a church edifice was begun, but progressed slowly in the face of financial difficulties. During its construction Elder Jones was the pastor, and when he re ceived $70 as the result of a donation party he gave the entire sum to aid in the building of the church. Although be<*un in 1860, the edifice was not fully completed until five years later. With the close of Elder Fay's labors in 1875 the church ceased its active functions as an organization, by reason of the decline in membership, and since that time only occa sional and irregular services have been held in the church building. A flourishing Sunday-school of forty or more scholars, in charge of Mrs. Sarah Wing, holds regular Sabbath sessions in it, and is generously supported. THE ORANGEVILLE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CLASS was organized June 2, 1858, as a point in the Prairieville Circuit, then in charge of Rev. S. A. Osborn. The class remained in that circuit until 1876, when it was transferred to the Martin Circuit. The organizing members of the class were Aaron L. Ellis, Leader ; Ph\u0153be Ellis, Cecelia Ellis, Edward Pratt and wife, Emeline Sweet. Up to the year' 1879 preaching was enjoyed pretty regularly, but after that the numbers of the class were so diminished that meetings were discontinued, aud thus far have DOt bee resumed. About 1843 a Presbyterian Church was organized by Rev. Mr. Blaine, in the house of Donald McCallum, with eight members, \u2014 John Stewart and wife, Alexander Stew art and wife, Donald McCallum and wife, James Stewart and wife. The church was called the Yankee Springs Presbyterian Church, although located in Orangeville, the reason therefor being that the people in the northern por tion of Orangeville, being socially and otherwise allied with Yankee Springs, adopted the name of Yankee Springs for"], [696, "470 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. ORANGEVILLE LODGE, No. 181, F. AND A. M., was organized Nov. 4, 1865, in the hall of the village tavern, and Jan. 11, 1866, a charter was issued. The first officers chosen were Eli Nichols, W. M. ; W. T. Dodge, S. W. ; A. S. Pierson, J. W. ; I. Willison, Treas. ; M. H. Wing, Sec. ; W. E. Bramble, S. D. ; J. S. Terry, J. D. ; B. D. Wing, Tyler. From 1865 to 1879 Eli Nichols served as W. M. each year, except in 1869, when W. T. Dodge occupied the office. The officers in 1880 were Eugene D. Youngs, W. M. ; J. W. Briggs, S. W. ; Arch ibald Murdock, J. W. ; George H. Ford, Treas. ; J. A. Turner, Sec. ; Eli Nichols, S. D. ; Thomas B. Ellsworth, J. D. ; C. H. Thurston, Tyler. Orangeville, which then included, however, only that por tion of the village now east of the business quarter. In 1856, John G. Nichols platted an addition, in which the western half of the village lies. The first trader at the village of Orangeville was James Campbell, who came hither about 1853 and opened a small store in one of the rooms of his residence. He closed his business in 1855, upon the arrival of George Clark, who carried on trade until 1857. In the fall of 1854, Eli Nichols entered the arena as an Orangeville merchant, and aster an experience of seven years sold out to C. C. Brown, whose place was taken in 1863 by George Sherwood and B. D. Wing. Eli Nichols resumed business in 1865, and since then has been the leading merchant in the village. Besides his store, there is also the establishment of M. P. Arbour. The lodge has now a membership of 45, and has contin- Aied to enjoy since its institution a healthful prosperity. The fine hall now occupied and owned by the lodge was built in 1870. There is, moreover, upwards of $150 in the treasury, the organization is clear of debt, and this, too, aster having freely and frequently contributed towards the support of needy members of the order, and especially towards the relief of yellow-fever sufferers in the South. Such a record is an exceptional one for a country lodge, and it is naturally a subject of local pride. The first carpenter to come to the village was Edward Terry, and closely following him, in 1853, came Stephen Nichols, also a carpenter, Avho is still a resident in the vil lage. George Beattie, the village blacksmith, came hither in 1854, and upon the spot he then set up his forge he has labored steadily to this day. A village tavern was built and opened in 1855 by Winchester T. Dodge, who was the landlord thereof for some years thereafter. It was the 4th of July, 1855, that was fixed upon as an appropriate day for celebrating in a formal way the opening of Dodge's tavern, and, several of the most spirited citizens of the town taking hold of the matter, it was determined to have a \" bang-up blow-out.\" To that end they went over to Hastings on the 3d of July to borrow a cannon known to belong to certain citizens of that town. The cannon was at that time, however, found to be in the possession of landlord Emory at Middleville. Armed with an order for its delivery, the Orangeville people went over there, but, the cannon being intended by Emory to take part in Middleville's own Independence Day demonstration, he declined most emphatically to give it up. ORANGEVILLE GRANGE, No. 424, was organized May 4, 1874, with 40 members. Henry Hewitt was chosen Master, and John Cameron, Overseer. Following Mr. Hewitt the succession of Masters has been E. C. Phetteplace, L. A. Nichols, and C. F. Woodman. Although the membership is now but 35, the grange is a prosperous organization. Meetings are held once each fort night in the grange hall at the village, built in 1878. The present official list is C. F. Woodman, M. ; R. C. Nor ton, Sec. ; Henry Hewitt, O. ; L. A. Nichols, L. ; Lavern Thompson, Treas. ; George Clark, Steward ; Edwin Bright, Assistant Steward ; C. A. Snook, Chaplain ; John Valen tine, G. K. ; Mary Clark, Stewardess. Repulsed, but not beaten, the Orangeville party drew off, and sent post-haste for reinforcements to their township. These arriving some time aster midnight, a hurried and mysterious move was made upon Emory's, but Emory, on the alert, met them with a bold front. They heeded not his warnings or threats even of sharp violence, and pro ceeded to push him briskly aside, while they laid hold of the cannon. Despite, too, the appearance upon the scene of Mrs. Emory, and her skillful flank movement, backed by a broomstick attack that was meant to work destructive damage, the attacking forces got safely away with their prize, and by daylight landed it in Orangeville in ample time for a glorious hurrah, made perhaps additionally glorious by the remarkable triumph at Middleville. Emory subsequently sought to avenge himself by causing the arrest of the invaders, but they turned the tables by prosecuting him for selling liquor in opposition to law, and in the end he was glad to compromise the matter by withdrawing his complaint. ORANGEVILLE VILLAGE. In the fall of 1850, E. G. Salisbury and his brother-in law, one Barney, bought of Parmenio Wolcott a mill -site and water-power on section 17, and began the erection of a saw-mill, which they completed in the summer of 1851. They carried on the saw-mill in company until 1853, when Barney sold his interest to E. G. McGown, after which the firm, until 1856, was Salisbury & McGown. Mean while the erection of a grist-mill was begun late in 1855, and completed late in the ensuing year. At that time the entire business passed under the control of McGown, who retained it until his death, in 1861. The mill-race which now conveys the motive-power to the mills was dug by Salisbury & McGown, and may be mentioned as an expen sive undertaking. It is about one hundred rods in length, and is supplied by Fish Lake, a very handsome sheet of water. Salisbury & McGown made a plat on their land purchase, near the mill, in 1854, of a village, and called it"], [697, ""], [698, "THE GlLKEY HOMESTEAD'.' Farm Property of Mrs. L.W . WOOD HAMS, Prairieville, PrairievilleTp, Barry Co.,Mich."], [699, "> PRAIRIEVILLE Prairieville is described on the United States survey as township 1 north, range 10 west. Until the year 1841 it was a part of Barry township. In that year Barry was divided, and the western half, comprising townships 1 and 2, range 10, received the name of Spaulding. That name was changed in 1843 to Prairieville. In 1847 Prairieville township was divided, the northern half receiving the name of Orangeville. To prevent confusion, the name Prairie ville Avill be applied in this sketch only to the territory of township 1 north, in range 10 west. from twelve to fifteen feet wide and from fifty to sixty feet long.^ The paths were from ten to fifteen inches deep. They differed very much in various localities, except that they were all laid out due north and south. In some places, especially north of Pine Lake, on the farm settled by Eli Waite, they were covered with a growth of heavy timber.f EARLY SETTLEMENT. Upon one of these belts of prairie Amasa S. Parker, a native of Connecticut, settled in the spring of 1831, having reached Richland, Kalamazoo Co., the year previous. He built him a log house, it is said, without any assistance whatever. In June, 1831, he entered his land, which was the Avest half of the southwest quarter of section 35, and soon after began to build a barn, which he completed during the summer. He was the first settler in Prairieville town ship, and also the first in Barry County. NATURAL FEATURES The surface is diversified. A range of hills extending from the southwest to the east and north renders the central and western portions broken and hilly. A continuation of Gull or Garden Prairie occupied a part of the southern region at the time of settlement, terminating in the hills around Crooked Lake, and the more abrupt ridges border ing on Gull and Long Lakes. The level tracts in the east consisted mainly of small circular belts of prairie and oak openings. The only peculiar formation in the township is a bed of siliceous rock in the north part of Long Lake. Under the microscope it appears to be composod of the shells of minute living animals, \u2014 probably diatoms. In the fall of 1833, Orville Barnes sold his farm in Rich land and settled on section 35, just east of Mr. Parker. The next year, 1834, Mr. Parker was married to Miss Celestia C. Barnes, Avhose father built the Yorkville Mills. Late in the fall of 1834 a party of surveyors came to the house of Mr. Parker and desired to have some provisions taken to the Thornapple River. Mr. Parker accordingly fastened boards to an axle, and with a load, consisting of corn-meal and salt pork, drawn by a yoke of oxen, proceeded to follow an Indian trail through the wilderness. It was probably the first team driven to the Thornapple through Prairieville and the adjoining townships. The township forms part of the divide between the Kala mazoo and Thornapple Rivers. The streams, therefore, are small and unimportant. There are many beautiful lakes, Pine, Gull, and Crooked being the largest. Gull Lake in dents the southeastern border. The Avater-level of many of them is gradually changing, the water becoming more shal low from year to year. The most remarkable example is that of Crooked Lake. It is estimated that its depth has decreased at least seven feet since the first settlement of the township. Thus several of the more shallow arms of the lake, covering some hundreds of acres, have been con verted into marshy tracts of land. They cannot long con tinue in this state. Every year the plow cuts off a few furrows more, and the next generation, at least, will be able to sow and reap where their ancestors passed the time with boat and fishing-tackle. The party reached the place of destination without acci dent, having camped one night on the Avay iu the locality afterwards named Yankee Springs. The next day Mr. Parker set out alone to return. The snow had fallen to a considerable depth, rendering it almost impossible to follow the trail. The snow continued to fall at intervals during the day. Towards evening he lost his way, but fortunately struck the trail near the place where they had camped the night previous. There were still a few live coals, and with them he finally succeeded in light ing a fire. The wolves gathered, and through the whole night filled the woods with their dismal howlings. Mr. Parker was compelled to remain on guard and exercise the closest attention to prevent their attacking his cattle, which were chained to a tree. He reached home the next day nearly exhausted. Although the hills are in many places stony, they are, with few exceptions, very productive, being especially adapted to Avheat. The fertility of the openings and prairie-belts is unsurpassed. I i CURIOUS REMAINS. In the fall of 1834, C. W. Spaulding, a native of Ver mont, who had reached Climax Prairie several years pre vious, came to Prairieville and located on section 23. He built a house, and in the spring of 1835 brought his family. In many of these localities the first settlers found mounds and garden-beds, supposed by some to have beeu cultivated by some very ancient race. The mounds were evidently burial-places. The cultivated tracts were laid out in beds f See Chapter II. of the general history. * By G. A. McAlpine. 471"], [700, "472 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. About the same time Linus Ellison settled on section 24. He, however, sold soon after and went to what is now Barry township. David Hamburg, a bachelor, came to the township before 1840, and purchased the farm now owned by Jacob Bron stetter. He boarded at Thomas Storms', on the west side of Crooked Lake, and used to cross that lake to work his farm. One evening in winter while crossing on the ice to Mr. Storms' he broke through and was drowned. As he did not return, his friends went to seek him, and saw his hat upon the ice, where he doubtless had thrown it. He had struggled earnestly against his fate, for the ice was broken a considerable distance around the place where he fell through. His body was recovered the next day. In 1835, Asahel C. and Hiram Tillotson located on sec tion 23, between Mr. Otis and Mr. Spaulding, both being then unmarried. Ambrose Mills selected a home on the east line of section 24. Nicholas and William Campbell with their families and an unmarried brother located on section 25, south of Mr. Otis. Norman Deming, a bache lor, settled on section 10 ; he was subsequently married to Catherine Doolittle. Isaac Otis, from Homer, Cortland Co., N. Y., emigrated with his wife and four children to this township in 1835, and purchased the farm of Linus Ellison, on the southeast quarter of section 24, where he resided until his death. Mr. Otis was the first supervisor of Barry township when it included the whole county, and held other responsible local offices. Erastus Cressy, a native of Roe, Franklin Co., Mass., emigrated to Michigan, with his wife, three sons, and three daughters, in 1842. He arrived ,at Gull Prairie on the 17th of October of .that year, and the next day moved into what is now Prairieville, halting on section 28, where he lived about a year. He purchased the east half of section 29, and during the summer of 1843 built a plank house upon it, and also plowed 12 acres of land. The prairie was about three miles south from him, and the land where he located was known as oak-openings. In the winter of 1842 and 1843, Mr. Cressy sold the northwest quarter of the northwest quarter of section 29 to Lorin Bingham for a horse, saddle, and bridle. The settlement of Prairieville had thus far been confined chiefly to the prairie and the more thinly wooded districts. The succeeding year (1836) several entries were made in the western and northern parts. Youngs Gilkey, then un married, purchased a part of section 28, and built a house. Eli Waite was the first settler in the northwestern part of the township. He reached section 6 in the early spring of 1836, having previously traveled over the township on horse hack. About six weeks after her arriA*al Mrs. Waite died, this being the first death in the township. She was buried on the east end of the farm, and Mr. Waite was laid beside her many years later. The next settler was William Shelp. William Marshall came from Ontario Co., N. Y., in 1839, and settled where he now lives. He rowed a boat across Crooked Lake, and helped break the first land on the farm now owned by Jacob Bronstetter. This place was then owned by David Hamburg, who was afterwards drowned in Crooked Lake. Mr. Bronstetter came to the township in 1854. Wells Byington and wife, a newly-married couple from New York, reached Prairieville in the spring of 1837. They occupied the house built by Youngs Gilkey. As an illustration of the small troubles which, as well as the great ones, so frequently annoyed the pioneer, we may mention that one morning, finding he had no fire and having no means of lighting one, Mr. Byington was obliged to take a shovel and go two miles and a half to the house of C. W. Spaulding for a few coals of fire. Mr. Byington subse quently moved to Barry township, where he still lives. Albert Warner, with his mother, brother, and sisters, came to Prairieville from Sandy Creek, N. Y., and located where he now lives, in 1845. The farm was first settled by Elisha Weed. INDIANS. In the winter of 1836-37 the Rev. Leonard Slater brought a band of Indians, numbering 300, from Grand Rapids to Prairieville. They were located on the northern part of section 35 and the adjoining parts of sections 26 and 27. Mr. Slater erected a church for them in 1840, which was also used as a school-room. It was on the north part of section 35. Mr. Slater taught there a while, and later his daughter Emily. Previous to this time a log house was used. It stood on the knoll opposite the site of William Shean's house. The Indians remained in Prairieville until 1852, when they were removed. During their stay many died. They were buried in the field, now an orchard, at the termination of the road running east from Cressy's Corners, and in the fields on either side of that road, near the end. They were also buried near In dian Lake. Their chief, Noonday, who is said to have led the Indians who accompanied tbe British at the attack on Buffalo, N. Y., in December, 1813, and to have set fire to that village, died in Prairieville. A stone was raised to mark his grave, but relic-seekers have long since carried away the last fragment. Aster the removal of the Indians the church was moved to Kalamazoo. The bell was trans ferred to the school-house at the village of Prairieville. Hiram Lewis came from New York to Yankee Springs in 1837, where his brother William was keeping a hotel. He purchased a farm in that township and remained there a year or two. He sold his farm in 1840, however, and purchased, in the spring of 1841, 80 acres on the southeast quarter of section 2, where the village of Prairieville now stands, and subsequently purchased the north half of that section. The same year he was elected the first supervisor of the township of Spaulding. During that season he built a hotel on the spot where the present one stands. It was burned a few years later, and rebuilt. He filled many offices in the township during his residence there, but about 1867 he remoA'ed to Kalamazoo County, where he died. John Bowne emigrated from Homer, Cortland Co., N. Y., in the spring of 1836, to Prairieville, and lived during the summer on the farm of Asahel Tillotson. In the fall of 1837 he purchased land in the present township of Barry, but subsequently traded farms with Hiram Tillotson, in Prairieville. In 1850 he was a member of the State Senate. His son, Andrew Bowne, is a well-knoAvn banker in the city of Hastings."], [701, "PRAIRIEVILLE TOWNSHIP. 473 ROADS. 1843. The records do not show who were the original members of the class. The meeting-house was built in 1871, while the Rev. J. White was pastor. The society at present is under the care of Rev. S. W. Calkins. Down to 1837 no roads were located. There were several Indian trails crossing the township in different directions. One running east and west struck the Kalamazoo River in the vicinity of Otsego; two o'thers crossed the township north and south ; one of these passed along the AVest side of Crooked Lake, leading to the Thornapple River ; the other ran north from Cressy's Corners, passing between Pine and Shelp Lakes. These trails were serviceable in the summer, but in the winter, when the ground Avas covered with snow, it was difficult (for white men at least) to follow them. This was remedied by \" blazing\" the trees at intervals on cither side. The trees along the trail last described were blazed by George Brown about the year 1835. The Methodist society at South Pine Lake was first or ganized in 1858, under Elder Gage. Until 1869 the so ciety met in the district school-house. At that time a church edifice was built, at an expense of about $3000. It was dedicated by Dr. George B. Josslyn, of Albion College. The Sabbath-schools of the whole township are combined in a union association. It is a regular and permanent so ciety, having been organized in 1801, and having continued in active operation ever since. LODGE No. 297, I. O. 0. F. The year 1837 was an eventful one for Prairieville town ship. Everywhere improvements were pushed forward. The first school-house in the township was built. Roads were located in every direction. The axe, the precursor of civilization, was constantly at work, log cabins were arising here and there through the forest, and around them the clearings were rapidly extending their area. The settle ment of the townships to the north had already commenced, and the trails leading northward had become the usual lines of travel. This society was organized May 6, 1876, with the follow ing-named persons as charter members : P. G., J. Boynton, M. J. Goss, S. E. Bowen, W. W. Bugbee, T. B. Diamond, W. E. Bowen, Frank S. Bowen. MILLS The first saw-mill in the township was built by George H. Thomas, at the head of Gull Lake, in 1850. It was destroyed by fire in 1856. The road from Gull Prairie to the Thornapple River was the first in Barry County. At the second town-meeting held in the county a committee of five was appointed to assist the commissioners in locating this road, and if they should locate it across Crooked Lake, $500 was voted for bridging the same. This road was established across Crooked Lake on the 18th of April, 1837, but was subse quently vacated, and the road from the base-line through section 35, along the west side of Crooked Lake, was estab lished the next winter. In 1867, Mr. Thomas built the first and only grist-mill ever erected in the township. THE TILLAGE OF PRAIRIEVILLE. The village of Prairieville, situated in the northern part of the township, has a population of about 200. The first store was built by a Mr. Keeler. He was followed by Ben jamin & Searles. There are at present two general stores, owned respectively by Brown &Goss and George M. Evers. The hotel originally built by Hiram Lewis occupied the same site as the one now standing. The next road is described as beginning at a \" black-oak tree at the head of the Beaver Dam, so called\" (which was situated on section 7, in the present township of Barry), leading southwest, as at present, until it reached the south west corner of section 12, in Prairieville, and running thence south between Barry and Prairieville until it met the Cook road, which was established the same day. The Cook road extended from the base-line, in the vicinity of Jones' Mill, situated on the outlet of Long Lake, northeast around Gull Lake, and thence east through sections 31 and 32, in Barry township. This road has never been much changed. Mr. L. H. Shcdd, the present proprietor, came to Prairie ville from New York in 1868. There are several smaller business places, a post-office, two blacksmith- and wagon shops, two harness-shops, a planing-mill now building, etc. PHYSICIANS. The physicians who first located in the township were Drs. Alverson and Sheldon. The former built the house now owned by Dr. J. W. Sackett, and carried on a store. They both departed about 1850. Dr. Parkhurst succeeded them, and remained till 1853. Dr. J. W. Sackett studied medicine in Massachusetts and practiced in Pembroke, Genesee Co., N. Y. In October, 1853, he came West, and, after looking over the country, decided to settle at Prairie ville. Accordingly, on the 4th of June, 1854, he located with his wife at that village, where he has been in constant practice from that time. The nearest physician upon his arrival and for several years after was at Gull Prairie, ten miles distant. Dr. Sackett is the only permanent physician in the township. The Pine Lake road began on the western line of section 6. It extended north and east into Orangeville, and was intended, no doubt, to give the settlers in that township communication with Otsego. The next road began at the corner on the west line of sections 18 and 19, running east, with many crooks and angles, until it finally reached the Town-Line road, between Barry and Prairieville. The Brown road, running northward from Cressy's Corners, between Pine and Shelp Lakes, and the Town-Line road, between Orangeville and Prairieville, were established about the same time. They were all located in 1837 or the early part of 1838. SCHOOLS. The first division of the old township of Barry (then comprising the whole county) into school districts will be found in the history of that township. In this division Prairieville, or rather township 1, range 10, was set off as CHURCHES. The Methodist Church at the village of Prairieville was organized by Rev. R. Daubney, a local preacher, in 1842 or 60"], [702, "474 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. district 13, and in this district the first school-house was built, on section 24. Miss Theoda Spaulding, afterwards Mrs. Knappen, taught the first school in the county, in an unfurnished room in her father's house. She is still living, in Richland, Kalamazoo Co. Democracy was in possession of every office in the town ship. In 1854 the result was a division of the offices. In 1855 the Republican party was organized, and in the spring of that year the entire Republican ticket, with C. W. Spaulding at the head, was elected. In the Presidential election of 1856, John C. Fremont, the Republican candi date, received a plurality in Prairieville over Buchanan, Democratic, and Fillmore, American. The predominance of the Republican party in that township continued un interrupted until 1877. The missionary school was started in 1838 or 1839, be ing taught by Rev. Leonard Slater, and subsequently by his daughter Emily. On the 7th of November, 1843, sections 1, 2, and 3 of Prairieville were united with 34, 35, and 36 of Orangeville, and formed district No. 3. In 1845, upon the petition of Robert King, school district No. 4 was formed from sections 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, and 20. The school-house was built in 1846. Miss Martha Warner was the first teacher in that district. At the same meeting, in compliance with the pe tition of Erastus Cressy, the immediate neighborhood of Cressy's Corners was set off as a school district. The house was built in 1846. Miss Lydia Benson had previously taught a private school in the house of Erastus Cressy. The next term was taught by her sister, Miss Chloe E. Benson, afterwards Mrs. Albert Warner. Then the Greenback party, led locally by George H. Thomas, entered the field. Mr. Thomas had been a pop ular leader in the Republican ranks since 1857, having twice been elected to the Senate and once to the Legislature of the State. The Greenback ticket was elected in 1877 and 1878, but in 1879 the Republican party succeeded by from one to three majority. In 1880 the Republican ma jority varied from twelve to twenty. The following is the list of officers of the township from its organization, in 1841, to 1880: SUPERVISORS. The school-house in the village of Prairieville was built in 1845. It was subsequently destroyed by fire, when the one now standing was erected. The bell is the one used by Leonard Slater on the Indian reservation. 1842-44, C. AV. Spaulding; 1845, John J.

They received, however, $4 to $6 per month, the difference being made up by fees from scholars. Accordingly, in 1842, the township voted $15, and in 1845 $20, for the benefit of those children whose parents were unable to pay for their tuition. 1879, AVashington Cooper; 1880, Amos C. Towne.

The districts have been subdivided and rearranged from time to time. In 1879 there were 10 school districts, whole and fractional, while the number of scholars is not far from 300. TREASURERS.

In the spring of 1838 Barry County was divided into four townships. Prairieville was set off as a part of Barry township. Party-lines had not yet been strongly drawn. In local matters the best men, without much regard to politics, were usually elected. In regard to national politics the Democratic party was generally in the ascendency until 1854. Local offices were gradually drawn into the political vortex, and in 1853 the"], [703, "PRAIRIEVILLE TOWNSHIP. 475 Reynolds; 1S66, C. H. Swartout ; 1867, John Q. Cressy ; 186S, AV. D.

Among the successful farmers and early settlers of Barry County the name of Francis Holden will long be remem bered. He was a man of more than ordinary sagacity and perception and of remarkable energy and determination, and had he received a liberal education would have made an enviable reputation in any calling. He was born in Ver mont, June 9, 1812 ; his father was a farmer and emigrated to Cortland County, N. Y., in an early day, but little is known of his history further than that he was an indus trious, hard-working man, but lacked that faculty of accu mulating property which was a marked feature iu the char acter of his son. Francis was thrown upon his own re sources at an early age, and for several years was employed in some capacity on the Erie Canal. In the autumn of 1836 he came to Michigan. A brother-in-law had pre ceded him, and had settled near Albion, Calhoun Co., with whom Mr. Holden spent the winter. The following spring he went to Richland, Kalamazoo Co., and hired to Foster Gilkey, one of the pioneers of that town ; with him he re mained several years ; his wages were carefully husbanded, and his first investment was in eighty acres of government land in the town of Prairieville, Barry Co. This was in 1837, and from that time until his death, in 1877, a period of forty years, his career was remarkable from the fact that upon his arrival in Calhoun County he had but three dol- DIRECTORS OF THE POOR. 1842, Eli R.

He dealt in farm property extensively, and at one time was one of the largest real-estate owners in the county. He seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of values, and his judgment in business matters was almost infallible. In 1841 he mar ried Miss Kairaiaziek, daughter of Frederick Davis, one of the early settlers of Kalamazoo Co. Mrs. Holden pos sesses many of the distinguishing characteristics of her hus band, and his success is, perhaps, attributable in a large measure to her thrift and industry. She was born in Livonia, Livingston Co., N. Y., Jan. 8, 1822. She is the mother of five children, three of whom are living : John, the only son, resides upon the old farm ; Ann, now Mrs. Doty, lives in Nebraska ; Mary is the wife of Mr. Nor- ton, of Hastings. The life of Mr. Holden is one worthy of emulation in many respects, and his history shows the result of a life of economy and industry. In political mat ters Mr. Holden manifested a lively interest. He Avas a staunch Republican, and did much to advance the interests of that party. He was a man of marked social qualities ; he loved a good joke, and enjoyed the society of his family and friends. His early life was one of toil and privation, and his early associations were such as invariably depress, although they probably developed many strong points in his character that might otherwise have remained dormant ; but starting in life as he did, with only a good constitution and a strong pair of hands as his capital, he is worthy of a conspicuous position among the self-made men of the county. MRS. ALBERT AVARNER. ALBEKT AVARNER. ALBERT WARNER. Among the early settlers of Prairieville township we find the name of Albert Warner, who, with his mother, brother, and three sisters, came from Oswego Co., N. Y., in the month of October, 1845, and located on sections 7 and 18. Albert was born in Sandy Creek township, Oswego Co., Sept. 26, 1820. His father was an early settler in that town, where he had bought forty acres of land and had cleared and improved it, and the writer of this believes there never was worse land to clear. On the home-farm the boyhood days of Albert were passed, going two miles to school through the winter months, with the snow at times four feet deep. When he was fifteen years old his father and brother went away from home to work at the carpenter's trade, leaving him in charge of the farm. Two years later the death of the father left the brothers to care for the family. This was faithfully done, Burton working out by the month, while Albert managed the farm. In the sprin\" of 1845 the fiirm was sold, and Albert soon aster took a trip through the States of Michigan, Illinois, and Wis consin, looking for a home. A^er hearing his report the family decided to settle in Barry County. Burton came with his family by public conveyance ; the rest of the family by team. The new farm consisted of one hundred and two acres, nearly all new, with only a log house, and that of the most primitive style. The roof was covered with slabs, boards, and shakes, Avith one door and no win dows, the only light they had coming down the old fashioned stick chimney, Avhich served the double purpose of chimney and skylight. In this house both families, consisting of seven persons, lived a year. It was finally improved, and served as a comfortable home for many years, until in 1859 it was replaced with the large and commo dious house now occupied by Albert and his family, and which was then the finest in the town. In the spring of 1847 the brothers divided their land, Albert taking the fifty-six acres on section 18 as his share, and which Avas all the land he owned sor several years. Mr. Warner has never speculated, but has given his en tire attention to farming, and has prospered beyond his ex pectation. The farm of fifty-six acres has been enlarged"], [705, "PRAIRIEVILLE TOWNSHIP. 477 to one of three hundred acres, with other tracts making two hundred and twenty acres more, also a farm in Kansas of three hundred and twenty acres, all the result of in dustry, economy, and good management. In politics Mr. Warner was in early life a Democrat, but joined the Repub lican party at its organization, and has since been an ardent supporter of its principles, though he has never desired or sought political advancement. In church matters he has for years been very active, and has done much to advance the cause of religion in his county, having helped build several churches, \u2014 the South Pine Lake Methodist Epis copal church especially, towards which he and his family subscribed nearly one-third of its original cost. He has been one of its trustees from the time it was organized until the present time, and a class-leader since he was ad mitted to full membership, save a year when absent. He has also been connected for many years with the Sabbath schools of his town, serving most of the time as superin tendent, and being one of the original organizers of the Prairieville Sabbath-school Association. In October, 1879, Mr. Warner and his wife asked for letters and withdrew from the Methodist Episcopal Church, and in March fol- lowing joined the Wesleyans in organizing a church in Gun Plain township, Allegan Co., of which society he is a steward and class-leader. He is strongly opposed to all secret societies, and is a strong anti-Mason. On the 2d day of May, 1848, Mr. Warner was married to Miss Chloe Benson, who was born June 30, 1825, in Ellisburg, Jef ferson Co., N. Y., from whence her father and mother, \" Duty\" and Phebe Benson, emigrated to Michigan in 1835, settling in Jackson County, and moving to what is now Orangeville in 1836, where they were among the first settlers. Mrs. Warner taught some of the first schools in Barry County, which occupation she pursued eight years, some of the time receiving one dollar per week for her ser vices, and perfectly satisfied with that sum. As pioneers in many good works Mr. and Mrs. Warner stand second to none, and now in the even-time of life they can look back upon many deeds well done, and a record without a stain or blemish. There have been born to them five chil dren, viz. : J. L., born Nov. 1, 1849 ; Leroy B., Aug. 14, 1852 ; Lura, Nov. 14, 1854 (died March 29, 1855) ; Lester, Feb. 22, 1858 ; and Frankie, May 23, 1863 (died Aug. 8, 1864). JOHN J.

After buying his land he drove a team between Franklin and Pittsburg, Pa., hauling flour to Pittsburg, a distance of one hundred and fifteeu miles, and returning loaded with dry goods. This occupation he pursued five years, then went on to his farm and commenced to clear and improve it. To his farm he added from time to time, until he owned tAvo hundred and forty acres of well improved land, part of which he still owns. He married In the month of March, 1818, John Perkins, then a lad nineteen years old, bought fifty acres of land in the then almost unbroken wilderness of Franklin town.-hip, Portage Co., Ohio. This was but one year after the cele brated leap of Brady, the Indian-fighter, who, in escaping from the Indians, jumped across the Cuyahoga River, a distance of twenty-seven feet. Mr. Perkins was poor in purse, but rich in strength of purpose, industry, and euer*;y. He was born in Woodstock, Windsor Co , Vt.,"], [706, "478 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Polly Ruggles, who died Oct. 16, 1863. There were born to them eight children, of whom John J. Perkins was the fourth. He was born in Franklin township Dec. 14, 1827, and grew to manhood on the farm of his father. Like the farmers' boys of that day he was early taught to work, re ceiving only such education as could be obtained by a few months' attendance at the district school during the winter months and a three months' term at the Kent Academy. Nov. 13, 1840, Mr. Perkins was joined in marriage to Miss Maria L. Mars, daughter of Rev. Adolphus Mars and Harriet (Keyes) Mars. She was born July 10, 1825, and died April 11, 1878. After his marriage his father gave him an acre of land, on which he built a house and barn, and where he resided until 1857, working his father's farm, and by that means getting a start in life. He then traded his place for eighty acres of land on section 3, in Prairieville, paying a difference of two hundred dollars. The land was entirely new, but has been cleared and im proved by Mr. Perkins. The farm now comprises one hundred and six acres of land, well improved, with good buildings, fences, etc., the result of hard work and rigid economy. In politics Mr. Perkins has always been a rad ical Republican, as has his father. Since his residence in the township he has most of the time held some one of the town offices. For seventeen years he has been highway commissioner, three terms supervisor, three years township treasurer, and many times a delegate to the county conven tions, filling the offices with credit to himself and those who elected him. For many years he has been a member of the order of Odd-Fellows, and has held every office in the lodge of Avhich he is a member. There were born to Mr. and Mrs. Perkins three children, viz. : Ellen, Jan. 24, 1848, died March 19, 1864 ; Alice, March 17, 1849 (married to Wm. H. Scudder, who is now register of deeds of Barry County, and resides at Hastings) ; and Zylpha 0., Dec. 5, 1850, married to Chas. H. Ruggles, who served in the Union army nearly five years ; came home quartermaster of the 13th Michigan Infantry; now residing near Prairie ville. 10, 1805. When nineteen years old, his health having failed, he went to Boston, hoping that the sea air might be beneficial. He remained in Boston eight years, and en- tirely recovered his health. During that time he worked at whatever he could get to do, part of the time being a night-Avatchman. In 1832, Mr. Gilkey started for Mich- igan with a horse and cutter, making the trip with that conveyance. Prior to his arrival his brother Foster had settled on Gull Prairie, Kalamazoo Co., where Young joined him, and they at once entered into partnership, remaining so until the death of Young, which occurred Jan. 13, 1868. The brothers became owners of large tracts of land in Kala- mazoo, Allegan, and Barry Counties, and became widely known as enterprising, successful business men. In 1845, Mr. Gilkey went on to a farm in Gun Plain township, where he remained three years, then went into Prairieville, Barry Co., where the brothers owned thirteen hundred acres of wild land. This became, under his management and in- dustry, a large and well-improATed farm, with large and commodious buildings, a sketch of which appears on another page. As a farmer Mr. Gilkey was progressive; in all business matters honorable and just; and was consid- ered to be among the most successful agriculturists of the county. He acquired a large fortune, the inevitable result of a long life of industry, frugality, and honorable dealing. In politics Mr. Gilkey was a Republican, in religion a Bap- tist, of which church he was for many years a member, and for the support of which he was a liberal subscriber. Mrs. Lydia W. Gilkey (now Woodhams) was born in Bos- ton, Mass., Jan. 11, 1820, and was married to Mr. Gilkey, Dec. 17, 1845. Her parents, Deacon Curtis Brigham and wife, emigrated to Richland, Kalamazoo Co., in December, 1833, from Avhence he moved into Gun Plain township, where he was among the first settlers. He was a licensed preacher in the Baptist Church before leaving Massachu setts, and soon opened meetings in his new home. In May, 1835, he organized the first Sabbath-school in Allegan County, having in March previous organized a meeting in the log school-house, where he delivered the first sermon preached in Gun Plain township. Mr. Brigham and Father Daubney for many years took charge of the funerals far and near. WILLIAM YOUNG GILKEY. There have been born to Mr. and Mrs. Gilkey the follow ing children: Curtis O., Sept. 3, 1847 ; William E., June 5, 1850; Martha J., Feb. 28, 1852; Willard E., March 24, 1854 ; Mary O., April 5, 1856 ; and John W., Feb. 1, 1859. Of the early settlers of Prairieville there were none who did more towards clearing up, improving, and advancing its agricultural interests than the pioneer named above. He was born in Chester township, Windsor Co., Vt., June"], [707, "479 RUTLAND Rutland comprises survey-township 3 north, range 9 west, and is bounded on the north by Irving, on the south by Hope, on the east by Hastings, and on the west by Yankee Springs. It is traversed on the northeast by the Thornapple River and the Grand Rapids division of the Michigan Central Railroad, and, as an example of the tortuous course pursued by the river in the township, it may be observed that within a distance of a trifle more than a mile the railway crosses the stream five times. Rut land voted Dec. 16, 1865, to raise $5000 in aid of the proposed Chicago and Michigan Grand Trunk Railroad, to run from Ridgway, on the Grand Trunk Railroad, by way of Lansing, to the village of St. Joseph, and so on to the Indiana State line, but the project failed. took place in Cooley's house, and in the newly laid out grave-yard at Hastings he was the first person to be buried. Shortly after that occurrence Cooley so seriously injured himself in lifting heavy timber that, before the Hastings cemetery had received another occupant, he was laid therein beside De Groat, with whom he had bravely penetrated the Western wilds, and with whom he put aside the burdens of a pioneer existence before that existence had fairly begun. Meanwhile, Estes Rich, who had entered land on section 9 as early as March, 1836, came into the township and made a commencement. After Cooley's death his widow continued to reside on the place, and in 1838 married Mr. Rich. Their first child \u2014 Loren, now living in Wisconsin \u2014 was born in 1839, and was, beyond a doubt, the first white child born in the town. Mrs. Rich died in 1845, and was buried on the Rich farm upon the land subsequently platted for a cemetery, and still in use. When the burial ground Avas laid out, it was found that 3Irs. Rich's grave would necessarily occupy a place in one of the walks, and there it was allowed to remain. He who wishes, therefore, to find the earliest grave in the cemetery need only to look in the southeast corner for one that lies in the footpath. Rutland has neither village, post-office, church-building, nor business enterprise of any kind (save agriculture) within its limits. Potter & Newton carried on a cheese factory in the township in 1879, but in the fall of that year it was consumed by fire. The loss was the remoA'al of a widely appreciated benefit, but there is at present a strong probability that the factory will be re-established. Inci dental to agriculture, there is considerable business among the farmers in the Avay of bee-keeping. The largest num ber of swarms is in the collection of Huron Healy, who has thirty, and who has kept bees in Rutland since his arrival in the town, in 1857. There are several farmers who average twenty swarms, and many who have a smaller num ber, so that, altogether, bee-keeping in Rutland is some thing of an industrial feature. Rich sold his place, some time aster the death of his wife, to one Toppen, and went northward on a prospecting tour. Toppen was, however, unable to meet his pledged payments, and the land therefore reverted to Rich, who returned to Rutland, took possession, and remained until 1871, when he moved to Kansas, his present home. The first house built in Rutland was Cooley's, the second was Rich's, and the third Maj. Mott's. The latter settled in 1838 upon land lying in both Rutland and Yankee Springs, his dwelling being, however, in the former town ship upon section 18, close to the line. Mott was coa spicuous as a singing-master, but as a pioneer did not make an enduring mark, since he stopped only two years, and then returned to Battle Creek, whence he had come. THE PIONEER ARMY. Rutland's advance-guard of pioneers was led by Lorenzo Cooley and one De Groat, who, happening to meet in Hast- ings in the summer of 1836, while looking for a land location in Michigan, agreed to settle in the township now called Rutland, provided they could secure places to suit them. De Groat went out into the township to pick out a couple of farms, and soon returned, reporting that he had selected for himself 160 acres on section 14, aud for Cooley 80 acres on section 1, northeast of the river, bordering the eastern shore of Long Lake. When Cooley came to look at his purchase he was not suited, and induced De Groat to let him have in exchange one of the 80-acre lots on sec- tion 14. Thereupon Cooley and De Groat rolled up a shanty on the former's land, and De Groat, lodging with Cooley's family temporarily, began the task of girdling a few acres of his own land preparatory to putting in a crop. While engaged in the work he fell sick, aud died within a few weeks after beginning his pioneer life. His death The oldest settler now resident in Rutland came into the township for a permanent location next after Maj. Mott. His name is Ira Shipman, and the land he now occupies, on section 20, he entered in 1836 and settled in 1838. Migrating from New York State in 1836, he lo cated, at the land-office in Kalamazoo, 160 acres of land in township No. 3, on section 20. He walked from Kala mazoo to his purchase, looked the place over, and con cluded that as there was nobody in the township he would defer his settlement. He accordingly returned to Marshall, where he remained until the next spring. Setting out again for his land to learn whether the country had begun to settle, he found Lorenzo Cooley on section 14, in Rutland, and a Mr. Henyon, on Bull's place, in Irving, near the Rut- * By David Sohwartz."], [708, "480 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. land line. He was not ambitious enough to begin the pioneer business with only one settler in the township, and that one not even a neighbor, so he once more retraced his steps to Marshall, determined to wait there another twelve month before making the third venture. fair to suppose that the squaw and pappoose must have been so very buckatah that Marsac concluded he had rather steal than see them starve. WOLF-MUSIC. About Shipman's ears as he lay beneath his bark shelter the wolves used to make night hideous with their howls. To drive the creatures off he aimed to keep a blazing fire all night long, but sometimes the fire went out, and then the wolves, emboldened, would gather in as if to make a raid upon the sleeping pioneer. At such times the woodman would awake with a sudden start, and, blazing away with his rifle, Avould put the cowardly pack to flight. Often he has stood, he says, at the door of his shanty and shot down deer, which were not only plentiful, but so tame that they scarcely appeared to mind the presence of human Back again in 1838 he came, and then, finding Estes Rich on section 9 and Maj. Mott on the west town-line, he concluded to stay and bear them company. For the next six weeks his habitation was a shelter of elm -bark just commodious enough to let him crawl under it when night came on. At the close of each Saturday he used to go over to Calvin G. Hill's house, in Yankee Springs, and remain until Monday morning, when, packing up provisions suffi cient to last during the week, he would set out for his farm, and there until the ensuing Saturday night would chop away alone, for he had at that time no familj, and, as to hard pioneer work, he became noted as a very extraordi nary character, preferring to labor unaided, although sorely taxed in his energies at times. beings. In 1840, Mr. Shipman went back to New York on a visit, leaving his place in charge of Peter Cale, a Canadian. He stayed in New York until 1842, and, having married, brought his wife to Michigan. Reaching his place in Rut land, he found that Cale had sold off all the movables and sloped for Canada. Shipman made a fresh start, went to housekeeping, and on that spot has continued to live to this day. Aster living six weeks under the insufficient shelter of elm-bark Shipman put up a rough shanty, and for two years, or thereabout, continued his accustomed mode of ex istence, during which he accomplished wonders in the busi ness of land-clearing. MARSAC AND THE POTATOES. Two days before Shipman came to Rutland with his wife, in 1842, his brother-in-law, Chauncey H. Brewer, moved in and took possession of the place previously settled by Maj. Mott, and sold by him to George B. Manchester, then a farm-hand in the township, and now a resident of Thorn apple. Brewer moved to Indiana, after a somewhat ex tended stay in Rutland, and now lives in Nebraska. One Monday morning Shipman, coming as usual from Hill's to begin his week's work, was somewhat surprised to observe upon approaching his shanty that through the chimney hole in the roof there came a volley of flying potatoes, and, divining at once that there must be a thiev ing Indian at the bottom of the business, he hid behind a tree and awaited developments. Presently the discharge of potatoes ceased, and following them through the aper ture appeared the form of one Marsac, an Indian, who, springing to the grouud and peering anxiously about as if to be assured the owner of the shanty was not about, made ready to gather his plunder preparatory to bearing it away. At this juncture Shipman from his concealed position dis charged his rifle, for the purpose, however, of simply frightening the red-skin, and that the project was eminently successful may be unhesitatingly accepted as the truth. While Marsac still trembled and grew pale with the sudden terror that had come upon him, Shipman came to view and with angry threats demanded to know how he dared come there on a thieving expedition. Marsac begged pit eously for mercy, saying that his squaw and pappoose were buckatah (hungry), and, not having anything for them to eat, he grew desperate and resolved to steal from Shipman's shanty. He found, he said, the door fastened, and so crawled down the chimney-hole. BULL'S PRAIRIE. A. E. Bull located land in Irving and Rutland as early as 1836, and began work upon it in 1837 ; but as he lived, or put up a cabin, on the Irving portion of the land, he seems to have been considered a pioneer in that town ship rather than Rutland. All of his land (and he had sev eral hundred acres) except 40 acres was, however, in Rutland, and it is reasonably clear that he was a Rutland pioneer, although he himself did not do much pioneer work in person. He engaged people to work on his place, \u2014 Mr. John Henyon among the first, \u2014 and, having mercantile ventures at Schoolcraft, Diamond Lake, and White Pigeon, moved here and there as occasion demanded. He gave, however, close personal attention to the progress of his affairs in Rutland and Irving, and, being moreover busily engaged as a surveyor in laying out roads in each town, he was at his Irving house a good deal of the time. It was not, however, until his marriage, in 1846, that he settled permanently upon his farm. He lived on the 40 acres in Irving until 1858, when he erected a commodious mansion on the Rutland portion of his estate, where his widow still resides. In 1805 he paid a visit to his early Eastern home in Massachusetts, and while there sickened and died. \" That excuse makes no difference,\" replied Shipman ; \"you mustn't come here to steal, and I ought really to shoot you, but I'll let you off this time, promising that if I ever catch you at it again, I'll make an end of you.\" Compelling the Indian to pick up the potatoes and carry them into the shanty, he renewed his admonishment and warned him to clear out, whereupon Marsac, glad to get off so easily, took to his heels. It was rare, indeed, that Indians were thieves in that vicinity, and in this case it is On the bank of the river near Bull's place in Rutland, Indians used to gather in considerable force and remain some time, \u2014 long enough at least to give their encampments"], [709, ""], [710, "Photos, by C.

Up to the time of his removal to Barry County, Mr. Bull was closely identified with the development of Schoolcraft and vicinity ; his edu cation in civil engineering and surveying made his services of great value to the people. His reading had been ex tensive, and his library, consisting of more books than those in the possession of any of his neighbors, was a source of disseminating much knowledge among the early settlers. Mr. Bull was one of the pioneers of the town of Rutland, where he purchased a large tract of land, and where he was extensively engaged in agricultural operations up to the time of his death, which occurred in March, 1865, at Great Barrington, Mass. He is spoken of by those who knew him best as a man of superior business capacity, public-spirited in the extreme, and one whose sympathy in behalf of the unfortunate and destitute was always readily enlisted. Hon. H. G. Wells, of Kalamazoo, who knew him intimately, says, \" He was a valuable citizen and a most useful pioneer.\" In 1846 he was married to Miss Lydia A. Shaw, of Volina, Cass Co., Mich. Mrs. Bull was born in Fairfield Co., Conn., Oct. 24, 1826, and came to Michigan with her father's family in 1830. In 1866 Mrs. Bull was again married, to Albert E. Bull, a nephew of her first husband. He was a man of great benevolence and a prominent member of the Congregational Church. The subject of this biography, by all that can be learned from his associates in life, was a man of more than ordinary ability ; he was emphatically a man of affairs, in dustrious, sagacious, enterprising, and public-spirited. He was born in Sheffield, Berkshire Co., Mass., March 4, 1808. His father, William Bull, was of English descent, a Quaker in his religious views, and a man of wealth and prominence. He was educated for a physician, but the profession was not a congenial one, and he became a farmer. Albert E. re ceived a collegiate education and studied law, but chose the profession of a civil engineer, and shortly after he attained his majority he went to Florida, where he was employed by the government in the survey of government lands. In 1832 he eame to Michigan and located at \" Insley's Cor ners,\" on Prairie Ronde, Kalamazoo Co. Here he was engaged in mercantile pursuits in company with a Mr. Kellogg. In the latter part of that year he dissolved partnership with Mr. Kellogg and removed his stock of goods to what is now Schoolcraft, then known as the \" Island,\" and prosecuted a successful business in merchan dising for many years. Sept. 7, 1832, he purchased and received a deed of conveyance from Col. Lyman D. Daniels for forty acres of land, being the south half of the west half of the southeast quarter of section 18, in township 4 south, of range 11 west, in Kalamazoo County. This land he surveyed and platted as \" Bull's addition\" to the village of Schoolcraft.

They are now no more to be seen, even by faint indication. The plow has leveled the mounds and turned up many a bone once a member of a savage frame. Indian relics, such as stone arrow-heads, tomahawks, and various implements, have been unearthed from time to time and carried away by relic-hunters. In that house he still lives, and a substantial home it is to this day. When he first came to Rutland, Mr. Mead set off a corner of his house as a workshop, and as he was the only me chanic in the township he was soon in liberal demand among the settlers. Since his location in the township, in 1844, he has done a good deal work at his old trade, and in that time has made upwards of 30 complete farm-wagous for his neighbors. Among the foremost pioneers in Rutland was David Rork, a New Yorker, who made his appearance in 1843. He moved from New York to Wisconsin in 1841, and aster an unsatisfactory two-years' experience in that country concluded to turn his face eastward, and, as he had a sister in Michigan, \u2014 Mrs. Estes Rich, of Rutland, \u2014 called there en route to pay her a visit. While in Rutland he was per suaded by Rich to locate there, and, being rather pleased with the country, he did locate there, buying 80 acres of Rich on section 10. He put up a log cabin, and, with his fam ily, moved into it March 29, 1844. That house was the fifth one built in the township, and stood about opposite the present residence of A. D. Rork. David Rork died of typhoid fever in 1854, \u2014 a year in which that disease car ried off quite a number of people in the neighborhood. NORTH OF THE RIVER. When Mead came into the town, there were on the north side of the river Edwin and Asa Rice, two brothers, who on that side of the stream were the pioneer settlers in Rutland. Edwin Riee lived on section 2, but in 1851 he sold his place to Marble Bates, then just come in, and moved to Illi nois, in which State both he and his brother Asa now live. Edwin M. and A. H. Bates, sons of Marble, came West also in 1851, but did not settle there until somewhat later. The pioneers in that portion of the township then included Benajah Dowd, Isaac Crowell, Lyman Newton (living now on section 22), Samuel McMurray, J. W. Stebbins, John K. Lothridge, James Lothridge, Manning -Dowd, and R. Smith, the latter's farm being now occupied by B. Kurtz. Settlements in that vicinity were caused quite early by the completion of the stage-road between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids, which passed through the northeastern corner of Rutland, and over which there was considerable lively traffic. In June, 1843, Finch Mead, of Dutchess Co., N. Y., came to Rutland alone to look at 100 acres of land on sec- tion 15 that he had bought of one Bennett Chambers, a Dutchess County school-teacher and Western land speculator. Mead had paid $500 for the land upon Chambers' repre- sentations, and finding, upon inspection, that the invest- ment was a good one, made all haste back to New York, and in June, 1844, returned with his family, in which were 11 children. While resting during his journey at Hastings, Mead was lucky enough to encounter a man f^pru Yankee Springs with a load of pine lumber. He bought it on the spot, took it with him to Rutland, and put up a shanty without delay. Clearing land was an un- familiar occupation to Mr. Mead. He and his married son Charles, who came West with him, had been wagon-makers in New York, and when they began to pioneer in Rutland they found themselves somewhat at loss to know how to get on according to the most approved frontier methods. For example, instead of disposing of their timber as fast as they felled it, they deferred the work of cutting up until they had leveled a score or so of trees. David Rork, hap- pening over one day while Mead and his sons were chop- ping, laughed at them as he explained how they created a good deal of unnecessary labor for themselves by a failure to understand how to do the work properly. He offered a few wise suggestions, and they found, by adopting them, that they had learned something which helped them on very much. Charles Mead didn't fancy a pioneer's life, and aster giving it a fair trial went to Hastings, where be opened a wagon-shop, and followed that business until his death, in 1866. W. W. Ralph lived, in 1844, on section 13, and Lewis Ensign on section 11, both, however, south of tbe river. On section 11 also lived Henry Standish, who moved after wards to Hastings. Lewis Ensign lives now in Detroit, where he follows the trade of a printer. Mr. Mead remembers that in 1844 it was no uncommon thing to see deer iu his door-yard, and to see them fre quently, too, feeding among the cattle, quite as unconcerned as the cattle themselves. Indians roaming in squads of a score or more often diversified the landscape, and on the river their canoes were familiar sights. By river they chose most frequently to travel on their trading-journeys to Hastings, and many is the time that the stream bore them and their craft in throngs as they pushed on to market. Benajah Dowd, a New Yorker, who settled on section 12, in 1850, after a year's residence in Hastings, died there in 1851. His son Solon made a settlement in Hope town ship in 1850, and from there moved to Rutland, where he now lives, on section 26. J. R. Robinson, a settler likewise in Hope in 1851 with his father, became a resident of Rut land in 1866, upon the place he now occupies, first im proved by Henry Pickle. One Dow was a moderately early settler on the Hastings road, and put up a log house upon David Rork's place, in which he made shoes. He remained, however, but a short time, and after his departure his house came into renewed service, as a school-house. S. C. Prin dle, who located on section 4 in 184S, had come with his father to Michigan in 1836. In 1S64 he removed to Hastings, and for sixteen consecutive years filled the office of probate judge. In the spring of 1845, Finch Mead made a move to sec tion 10, where he now lives, and put up a log house. For the shingles he used on it he went into Allegan Couuty, and made a two days' journey of it. For the window sash he had to go to Grand Rapids, and altogether he experienced no little trouble in the construction of a home, George Williams was a settler in 1854 upon section 11, 01"], [714, "482 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Avhere he now lives. Then it was wild land, and upon it Mr. Williams cut the first stick. Among his neighbors were Isaac Cowell, Marble Bates, Elva Cross, Manning Dowd, Lyman Newton, James Olner, Martin Smith, Isaac Hendershott, and others. In June, 1854, James McNutt came from Irving, where he had been living since 1S45, and made a location on section 9, whence he remoA'ed in 1872 to his present home, on section 17. In the neighbor hood of section 17, and in the northwestern corner of the toAvnship, there was scarcely any attempt at settlement be fore 1854 or 1855. Maj. Mott, and aster him Chauncey H. Brewer, were the earliest in that quarter. About 1854 there came, as the next reinforcements, Alexander Corning and his two sons, Alexander and Benjamin, and his son-in law, one Leavenworth. They occupied six 80-acre lots on section 8, which the elder Corning had entered ; but their stay was brief. Before leaving they leased the land to Simon Wilcox and Jabez Campbell, who occupied it until Huron Healy came into possession, in 1857, and at once made a settlement. took up on a soldier's warrant 160 acres in Rutland town ship, upon section 26. From Kalamazoo he came out to Rutland in December, 1852, and, as related, lodged at Durham's. In the Durham shanty, containing but one room, the two families, comprising nine persons, lived after a fashion for the space of the six weeks which it took Crosby and his sons to build their own shanty. When Crosby got fairly located he found himself a mile or so from his nearest neighbors, Peck and Durham, while south, east, and west of him to the town-lines there was not a solitary settler. Upon his place Mr. Crosby lived until May, 1879, when he was buried upon a spot on his farm Avhich, directly after his arrival, twenty-seven years before, he had chosen as the ground in which he desired to be laid away to rest. Upon the old farm still lives C. R. Crosby, who came with his father in 1852, and who has there had his home ever since. Previous to Crosby's location a hay-road had been cut out by David Rork, from his place to a marsh south of Crosby's, for the purpose of obtaining the hay, which grew luxuriantly upon the marsh, and which was, moreover, of excellent quality. This hay-road was a decided convenience to the new settlers, and, as such, was duly appreciated. Huron Healy moved with his father, Samuel, from New York in 1836 to Washtenaw County, where he lived until his settlement in Rutland. Straight south the nearest neighbor he had was Ira Shipman. West there were Chauncey H. Brewer, Thomas Slater, and Moses Campbell, while on the north was R. H. Wilcox on section 5 (Avhere he had been since 1855), Lafayette Douglas, Roswell Holden, and Ijah Marshall. The next to settle in the neighborhood was Henry Pickle, an ex-soldier of the war of 1812, who took up, on a soldier's warrant, the land now occupied by J. R. Robinson, in sec tion 26. Mr. Pickle now lives in the township of Yankee Springs, and, although upwards of ninety years of age, is quite hearty and active. Of the settlers herein named, Durham, Peck, and Pickle were ex-soldiers, Peck of the Mexican war and the other two of the war of 1812. Dur ham died in Rutland in 1860. Other later settlers in North Rutland were George Brown in the northwest, and on the Hastings road William Perry and William S., his father, William S. Chidester, whose father, Gardner Chidester, settled in Ionia County in 1839, David Eycleshimer, F. Campbell, and Peter Howard. A RUSH FOR LAND. The years 1854 and 1855 Avitnessed an important ac cession to the settlements in the Crosby district, and for a time the new recruits were quite a multitude. Indeed, the new-comers were so many, and so besieged the ones al ready on the ground for flour, potatoes, and other necessary commodities, that the prices of those articles rose, under the spirited demand, to a high figure, while it Avas with difficulty that lumber could be obtained fast enough to meet the needs of those desirous of building framed houses. A reason for this animated condition of affairs may be easily found in the fact that there was considerable government land in that neighborhood, and that it was to be had at $1.25 the acre. For some reason, land speculators who had greedily absorbed the northern portion of the township had not cared to in vest in the south, and so for some time the lands lay uncalled for until emigrants carried the facts, when, as has been told, there came a rapid demand for places. Farms then bought at government price are to-day easily worth more than twenty times that price,\u2014 that is to say, 160 acres bought then for $200 would sell to-day for $5000. SOUTH HALF OF THE TOWNSHIP. In the southern half of the township, the only settlement made previous to 1850 was that by Ira Shipman, on sec tion 20. Somehow the desire for lands in the south was not very ardent, and in that district, even aster the northern portion was fairly populated, there was still unbroken wilderness. The earliest to penetrate into the eastern portion of the south half of Rutland were Joshua Peck and Reuben Dunham, who, in 1850, made settlements upon adjoining places in section 23. Peck lived there until 1873, when, in a fit of mental aberration, he commit ted suicide. He was sound lying dead in his house, the upper portion of his head blown off and a discharged shot gun close by, showing that, aster lying down, he had placed the muzzle against his head, discharged the weapon with his foot, and straightway passed into eternity. Reuben Durham lived with his wife and child in a framed shanty 14 by 20, upon 80 acres of land acquired under a .soldier's warrant by right of his services in the war of 1812. In 1852, Durham's cabin received within its hospitable walls the family of George W. Crosby, con sisting of six persons. Crosby, who had married a sister of Mrs. Durham, had moA*ed from New York to Illinois, intending to settle there, but, not liking the country, con cluded to settle in Michigan, and, stopping at Kalamazoo, West of Crosby, near Cooley Lake, A. D. Rork, William Munger, M. S. Cooley, John R. Cooley, Harmon Munger, and James Van Wagnen were among the first comers in 1854 and 1855. Of these the only one still living there is James Van Wagnen, on section 26, where he settled in 1855. In 1856, C. H. Stone, of Ohio, made a settlement"], [715, "RUTLAND TOWNSHIP. 483 on section 27, in the heart of a wilderness of heavy timber, and reared the home which has sheltered him from that day to this. On the north was C. H. Bowen ; west of him, Isaac Powell and Horace Hull, who had been there a year ; and still farther west, at Pine Lake, were John 0. Riley, Philander and Ferrell Otis, and Walter and Joseph Barrett, all of whom had just moved in. Walter Barrett's place is now occupied by C. A. Newland, whose father was an early settler in Kalamazoo County, and lives now in Eaton County. At Mr. Newland's house lives his wise's mother, the widow of J. K. Bingham, who came to Michigan as a pioneer in 1827, since which time Mrs. Bingham has lived in the State, herself a Michigan pioneer of fifty-three years' standing. it generally there was a strong protest against the measure, and many declared that so ugly a name should not be ap plied to so fine a neighborhood. This spirit of opposition aroused within the promoters of the project a strong determination to make the name stick in spite of everything. They took especial pains to sound the fame of Podunk far and wide, called the attention of casual visitors to the fact that they were in Podunk, erected sign boards in various portions of the township certifying that it was so many miles to Podunk (as the case might be), and eventually caused the name to be inscribed ou the town map ; so stamping and hammering, as it were, the name of Podunk upon the face of passing events that Podunk the neighborhood remains, and will, doubtless, remain for all time, to all of which the neighborhood has long since be come resigned as to the inevitable. Upon section 21, Isaac Diamond, a settler in Lenawee County in 1840, made a location in 1854. In 1870 he died at the house of his son, Isaac L., on section 16. Isaac L. joined his father in Rutland in 1855, and divided his time between his father's house and that of his brother-in law, E. T. Hun, near by, until 1862, when he moved to his present home, on section 16. Until 1854 section 16 was a sorest without a human inhabitant. The first settler to locate upon it was Elijah Rogers, who in the year men tioned made a clearing there, and directly after that Daniel Oak es settled near him, followed in turn by his brother Christopher Oakes. Rogers died in 1866, Daniel Oakes in 1857, and Christopher Oakes in 1856. PIONEER HIGHWAYS. One of the first roads laid out in the township was one from Hastings along the south bank of the river to be yond Estes Rich's place, and so on across. Glass Creek by Maj. Mott's to the Grand Rapids and Battle Creek road through Yankee Springs. The present Yankee Springs road from Hastings through Rutland was at first a mere path, and, although it was a much more direct route to Yan kee Springs than the one used, it was considered too rough a road to be easily utilized, and was but little followed save now and then by some venturesome being who preferred a shortcut lo a longer and smoother thoroughfare. The high way now known as the Yankee Springs road was surveyed by George B. Manchester, September 20, 21, and 22, 1847, and commenced sixty rods Avcst of the quarter-post on the south line of section 11, whence it was run west and south four miles and two hundred and one rods to intersect a road formerly run from Yankee Springs to Ira Shipman's. Sept. 22, 1847, Manchester surveyed a road commencing forty -five rods east of the quarter-post on the south line of section 10, and thence running east and north to the road running from Rich's to Hastings. Dec. 25, 1847, a road was laid from the corners of sections 4, 5, 8, and 9 west ward, to intersect \"the old road.\" Jan. 11, 1848, a road was laid from the west town-line, at the corners of sections 7 and 18 east and south, to intersect the road running from Hastings to Yankee Springs via Shipman's. No less than eleven highways were constructed in Rutland in 1848. Among other settlers in the southern half of Rutland may be mentioned B. R. Blanchard (who claims to be the first person who made a permanent white settlement in the township of Baltimore), Henry II. Wood, and H. N. Mon roe, who moved with his father, H. G. Monroe, to Paw Paw, in Van Buren County, in 1838, where they lived until 1846. The elder Monroe moved then to Calhoun County, where he now lives. H. N. Monroe came to Rutland in 1865, and occupied a place first settled by Elmer Johnson, and afterwards by Charles Tillotson. There were also A. B. Smith (an early settler in Orangeville), Philip W. Bur gess, Edward Gorham, C. W. Biggs, J. W. Tanner (a set tler in Washtenaw County in 1844), Thomas Kelley, John Dawson, G. W. Loehr, Norman Johnson, Daniel Dean, and George Williams (whose father settled in Irving upon the Ingraham place in 1848). PODUNK. There is a place on the Rutland map called Podunk, although the visitor to that locality expecting to find a village there would probably pass through the place quite unconscious of the fact that Podunk was before and round about him. The locality was named, it appears, by J. S. Van Wagnen, twenty or more years ago, when, at a casual meeting of some of the residents of the vicinity, the sug gestion was started that the settlement ought to be called Cooleyville, since the Cooleys were among the first to come in there. Other names were suggested, when Van Wagnen abruptly exclaimed, \" Pshaw ! call it Podunk, and be done with it,\" Podunk being the name of a cross-roads village in Ohio, where Van Wagnen had lived, to whom it seemed that the name would fit excellently well on the present occasion. LTpon a suddeu impulse the name was adopted by those present, but when an attempt was made to introduce On the 10th of May, 1847, Commissioners Ira Shipman, Edwin Rice, and David Rork divided the township into three road districts, as follows : District No. 1 to contain sections 1,2, 3, and 12, all that part of the east half of sec tion 10 north of the river, and all those portions of sections 11 and 13 north of the river. District No. 2 to contain section 4, the east half of section 5, the east half of section 8, all of section 9, the west half of section 10, that part of the east half of section 10 south of the river, the part of section 11 south of the river, all of section 13 south of the river, and all of sections 14, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25, 20, 27, 34, 35, and 30. District No. 3 to contain the west half of section 5, all of sections 6 and 7, the west half of section 8, and all of sections 16, 17, IS, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33."], [716, "484 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. The time of the formation of subsequent road districts, as the town grew apace, is given as follows : No. 4 in March, 1848; Nos. 5, 6, and 7 in 1853; Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in 1854; and Nos. 13 and 14 in 1862. In the spring of 1880 the number of road districts in the town had risen to 30. and contained sections 22, 27, 28, 33, and 34. No. 8 was organized Feb. 4, 1867, and included section 18, the west three-fourths of section 17, and the northwestern quarter of section 20. No. 9 was organized Feb. 27, 1869. The first annual report recorded appears under date of 1854, and sets forth that during that year the number of scholars in attendance upon the town-schools was 84 in three districts, having, respectively, 33, 29, and 22. The amount of public money received that year was $36.45. The report of the highway commissioners for the year 1847 recited the labor assessment to be forty-two and a quarter days in district No. 1, of which twenty-eight and a half days were paid ; one hundred and a quarter days in No. 2, of which thirty-three and a half days Avere paid ; and eighty-seven days in No. 3, of which fifteen and a half days were paid. The report further specified that \"jobs were let to the amount specified before, to wit : No. 1 for $104.25, No. 2 for $135.75, No. 3 for $162.50. Included in the above is \u00a740 for old jobs in district No. 3, also $24 to procure a new scraper for each district, leaving $62 as the amount of unfinished jobs. The above gives a sum- The school inspectors' records show that school-teachers' certificates were granted, from June 7, 1848, to April 14, 1860, inclusive, to the folloAving persons: June 1, 1848, Clarissa A.

In the winter of 1844 there Avas a school on Bull's Prairie, in Irving, where Chloe Benson taught, and to that school the children of Rutland's settlers were sent. In the summer of 1845, Maria Lacey taught school in a log shanty built on section 9 by James Lothridge, who had bought a piece of land of Estes Rich and put up a cabin, but, finding himself unable to pay the purchase-money, had moved away.

Sept. 11, 1847, School Inspectors John W. Stebbins and W. W. Ralph met at the house of W. W. Ralph, and organized school district No. 2, to which was apportioned the entire northwestern quarter of the town, consisting of sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, and 18. July 15, 1848, school district No. 1 was organized, and included the northeastern quarter of the town, or sections 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. The apparent organization of No. 2 before No. 1 was established seems somewhat strange, but such are the facts as gleaned from the school inspectors' records. The school directors for 1879 were B. Kurtz,' C. II. Rogers, P. W. Burgess, C. R. Crosby, W. H. Otis, G. L. Bronson, J. W. McCrary, George W. Wing, and E. E. Gorham. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. Township 3, range 9, was, on the 22d of March, 1839, made a portion of Yankee Springs township. On the 16th of March, 1847, it was given an independent organization as Rutland ; the name being bestowed at the suggestion of Winslow W. Ralph, who came from Rutland, Vt., to Michigan, and became an early settler in the township men tioned. The first meeting was held at the house of David Rork, April 5, 1847. J. W. Stebbins was chosen chair man, W. W. Ralph clerk, and John K. Lothridge and Estes Rich inspectors of election. The voters on that oc casion numbered 17, as follows: David Rork, John W. Stebbins, Samuel McMurray, Winslow W. Ralph, Abel Rice, George B. Manchester, Chauncey H. Brewer, Ira Shipman, Edwin Rice, John K. Lothridge,- Asa Rice, On the 18th of February, 1850, No. 1 was divided, and all south of the river was set off as district No. 3. Oct. 4, 1854, districts 4 and 5 Avere organized. No. 4 was composed of sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 35, and 36. No. 5 included 19, 20, 29, 30, 31, and 32. No. 0, organized Sept. 19, 1855, contained sections 16 and 17, the south half of section 18, the north half of 19, and the whole of sections 20 and 21.

The pathmastcrs were George B. Manchester, in district No. 1 ; David Rork, in No. 2 ; John K. Loth rige, in No. 3 ; Orrin L. Ingraham, in No. 4. It was re solved to dispense with assessors, to forego also a tax on dogs, and to raise but $100 for current expenses that year. The poll-list in April, 1850, contained the following names: S. A.

The first post-office in Rutland was established at C. H. Brewer's, on Glass Creek, in 1858, and called Glass Creek Post-Office. Mr. Brewer was the first postmaster, and upon his removal from town the office was transferred to Moses Campbell. Aster enduring a year longer it was discontinued. The stage-route from Kalamazoo to Grand Rapids passed Ira Shipman's, and in 1862 a post-office was established at his house, and called Rutland Centre. Within less than a week afterwards the stage-route was changed and the post office abolished. Mr. Shipman enjoyed the distinction of being postmaster long enough to handle about a half-dozen letters. Since the days of Glass Creek and Rutland Centre, Rutland has had no post-office within its limits. CLERKS. 1848, J. K. Lothridge; 1849, A. F. Corning; 1850, S. C. Prindle; 1S51, L. II.

The early settlers in Rutland found conveniences for re ligious worship close at hand in Hastings, and for that reason there was no attempt to provide services nearer home previous to 1850, and then the experiment proved a failure, since the general opinion appeared to be that there was no especial occasion for forming a religious organiza tion while the village churches were so easily reached. From that day to this, mainly for the same reason, church organizations in Rutland have been few and far between, while as to church buildings the township has never had one, and has now but two religious societies, both Methodist. The pioneer religious organization was a Methodist Epis copal class formed in the school-house, on section 1 1 , in 1 852, with 12 members, and attached to the Irving Circuit as the North Rutland class. The members were Wm. Rork, S. C. Prindle and wife, Lorin Rich, Finch Mead and wife, Daniel Wilcox and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Geo. W. Crosby and their two sons. Finch Mead was chosen class-leader, and for the space of five years the class continued to have services with more or less regularity. In 1857 meetings were discontinued; and, although periodical efforts looking to a revival have been made since, the results have been only transitory in their character.

The Rutland Methodist Episcopal class was organized in 1864 in the school-house on section 16. with Mr. and Mrs. Ira Nye, Mrs. Freyer, and Mrs. I. L. Diamond as members, Ira Nye being class-leader. In 1866 the class was transferred to the log school-house on section 17, and was reorganized, with 25 members, as follows : Hiram Nich ols, class-leader ; Susan Nichols, R. B. Blanchard and wife, Sarah Diamond, Lorin Rich, Sherman and Ellen Rich, Horace and Harriet Cowell, Isaac L. and Lydia Diamond, Ira and Emma Shipman, Sylvester and Ravila Dean, Daniel and Mary Wilcox, Marilla Munger, Daniel E. and Maria Nichols, Emma Martin, E. R. French, Anna M. French, Finch Mead. This Avas formed in the Chidester school-house, Feb. 20, 1880. The officers chosen on that occasion were Mrs. A. H. Bates, President; Mrs. H. N. Monroe, Vice-President; Mrs. David Eycleshimer, Secretary ; and Mrs. Wm. Perry, Treasurer. Rutland encourages also, through the efforts of Red Ribbon clubs, the good work of temperance, and with results to this time of an especially gratifying character. RUTLAND GRANGE, No. 145. This body was formed in December, 1S73, in the log school-house on section 17, with 30 charter members. The officers then chosen were William Dudley, M. ; Asahel Lu ther, O. ; Martin Blanchard, L. ; William R. Blanchard, Steward ; A. S. Dean, Chaplain; Thomas Kelly, Sec. ; U. I. Baldwin, Treas. After Mr. Dudley, Asahel Luther served as Master in 1875, 1876. 1877, and 1878. Harry Healy, who was chosen Master in December, 1878, was re-elected in De cember, 1879. Meetings were held in members' houses until the summer of 1875, when a hall was built near the school house, on section 17. In 1878 it was moved due west, just over the line, into Yankee Springs township. The membership is now about 50. The officers are Harry Healy, M. ; A. G. Culver, O. ; Chauncey Noyes, L. ; John Whittemore, Chaplain ; Asahel Luther, Sec. ; Huron Healy, Treas. ; Elkanah Morford, Steward ; E. P. Whit more, Assistant Steward; James Matthews, G. ; Mrs. Huron Healy, Ceres ; Mrs. Harry Healy, Pomona ; Mrs. James Matthews, Flora; Mrs. E. P. Whitmore, Stewardess. Reg ular sessions are held on the second and fourth Saturday of each month. The class was at first attached to the Hastings Circuit, but in November, 1869, was transferred to the Irving Cir cuit, where it still remains. Succeeding Mr. Nichols, J. M. Whittemore was chosen class-leader Oct. 2, 1870, and yet fills the office. Rev. A. P. Moors, the preacher in charge, was folloAved in 1869 by N. D. Marsh, and after him Revs. H. H. Parker, E. Hayes, M. Browning, O. B. Whitmore, and J. J. McAllister have been the preachers. The membership is now 33, and that of the Union Sunday school, held at the same place, from 50 to 60. Mrs. J. M. Whittemore is the superintendent, and has as assistants four teachers. There have been in times past various religious organiza tions in the township, especially a Methodist Episcopal class and Free-Will Baptist Church at Podunk, and a close-com munion Baptist Church north of there, but they have all passed out of existence. There is, however, still at Po dunk a flourishing Union Sunday-school, whereof C. H. HOENAPPLE; Thornapple township, so named from Thornapple River, which received its designation from the bountiful growth of thornapple-trces upon its banks, is designated on the United States survey as township 4 north, in range 10 west. It occupies the northwestern corner of Barry County. Kent County lies on the north, Allegan County on the west, the township of Yankee Springs on the south, and that of Irving on the east. Central Railroad. Middleville, the only village in Thorn apple, is a thriving place, and one of the two railway stations in the township. THORNAPPLE'S PIONEERS. The earliest white settler in Thornapple, and the founder of the village of Middleville, Avas Calvin G. Hill, widely known in his lifetime as \" 'Squire\" Hill. He was a native of New York, and in the fall of 1834 purchased from tho government 400 acres lying on both sides of Thornapple River, within the present limits of the village of Middle ville. He began at once to make improvements on section 27, where he put up a log cabin on the hill, directly oppo site the place now occupied by Leonard's hotel. Mr. Hill found an attractive country of oak-openings and a good strong Avater-power on the river, which doubtless helped to The surface of the country is undulating, and in many places hilly. The township was originally covered by oak openings, except in the northwest, Avhere heavy timber prevailed. It is agriculturally rich, and contains not only numerous fine farms, but many elegant rural homes. The Thornapple River floAVS from south to north, and along its course passes the Grand Rapids branch of the Michigan * By David Schwartz."], [719, "JOHN CARVETH, R. B. MESSER. AMOS HANLON. S. B.

In 1835, Mr. Hill, having made a clearing and prepared a comfortable habitation, brought out his family and became a permanent resident. death, in 1863, was prominently concerned in township affairs. Philip Leonard, now living in Middleville, was a brother of Henry, and at the solicitation of the latter came out to Thornapple in the fall of 1836. He worked in Mr. Hill's saw-mill a year or so, then went north, and, aster a few months' absence, settled in Yankee Springs township, whence he removed to Middleville in 1865. Mr. Leonard tells the story of his going to mill for his brother in the early days, and how he drove thirty-six miles to Kalamazoo, only to be told, when he got there, that he couldn't have his grist ground under two days, at least, by reason of the numerous applications ahead of him. Determined not to wait so long, young Philip went on to Comstock's, four miles east, sound the miller abed, aroused him, persuaded him to grind the grist that night, and by daybreak turned his team toAvards home. Mr. Leonard recalls, likewise, how he used to go to Kent (now Grand Rapids) aster pro visions, and how he was once obliged to pay $40 in gold for a barrel of pork. Elias Hill, his brother, also came at this time with his family, and located upon section 28, now esteemed one of the most fruitful in the county. Elias Hill had two grown sons, of whom Hugh M. settled near by, while Collins lived with his father several years. Calvin G. Hill's two grown sons were Alpheus M. and Al bert C. The latter made a settlement on section 27, but sold the place to Ashbel Beach, who came in 1836. Albert then turned his attention to the business of breaking land for others, and achieved much local fame as a land-breaker. He constructed an enormous plow, before which he drove six or more pairs of cattle, and went about the country doing excellent service. Alpheus M., the second son of Calvin G. Hill, became identified Avith the milling business at Middleville, and was a prominent man until his death in the military service during the war for the Union. 'Squire Hill was well known, not only by the settlers in his own neighborhood, but to the county at large. He was the first county surveyor, and his services were in demand all over the county. As a surveyor he was doubtless ener getic, but he used to return some very curious and A'ague bills of survey ; as, for example, he would describe the boundaries of a certain tract of land as \" running north to a certain plowage, east to a certain wood-pile,\" forgetting apparently that both plowage and wood-pile were landmarks of an exceedingly uncertain character. Mr. Hill was widely respected, and lived upon the spot of his early settlement until his death, in 1867. Ashbel Beach, to whom Albert C. Hill sold his place in 1836, was a hardy pioneer, and was locally celebrated as the man who plastered his house with potato plaster be cause he happened to take an eccentric notion that he would have no other kind. It turned out, however, that the material was excellent and still serves its original pur pose faithfully. In the fall of 1835 Henry Leonard entered the new set tlement with his family and located upon a farm on section 22, which he had bought of Calvin G. Hill, and upon which his son Orrin Leonard now lives. With Henry Leonard came his stepson, Charles Paull, a carpenter, who was then a young bachelor. Mr. Paull was the pioneer carpenter in the settlement, and from the date of his first appearance there until the present time he has followed the same trade in the same neighborhood with but little in terruption. James Moreau, a Frenchman, established a trading-post on Scales' Prairie as early as 1835 or before, and traded with the Indians to some extent. He tried also to accommodate travelers, but his house could hardly be termed a tavern. Henry Leonard, farther north, was likewise frequently called upon to lodge wayfarers, and at one time his house was regarded as a place of popular resort sor travelers. Moreau left his place on the prairie early in 1837, and moved to Grand Rapids, where he kept a hotel for some years. Robert Scales, a young man who had been at work for Moreau on the prairie, and from whom the locality took its name, remained on Moreau's place, and was counted among the settlers until he removed to Kalamazoo, where he died. Although there was excellent water-power near at hand, on Thornapple River, Mr. Hill concluded, doubtless, that the construction of a dam at that point Avould be too great an undertaking, and so, when he determined to build a saw mill, he went over to Duncan Lake, in the northwest, and erected a mill upon a creek in that locality. The timbers of the structure were hewn logs. One Ebenezer Duncan, who had made a settlement hard by, was the first white resident of that locality, and he took part in the building of the mill, as did also Henry Leonard. Both these gentlemen were subsequently concerned with the management of the enterprise. This mill was erected in the fall of 1836, and was, of course, the pioneer mill of Thornapple. It was used, however, but a few years, when it became dilapidated and worthless. One James Anderson, at one time a clerk in a govern ment land-office, located some land on section 15 in a bend of the river, and in company with a Capt. Edward Macy laid out there in 1837 a village, which they called Thorn apple. They published a large number of highly-colored maps, and evidently expected Thornapple to be a remark able town. Such it might have become, perhaps, had not Anderson been compelled to fly to New Orleans on account of some unfortunate business entanglements which threat ened him with criminal prosecution. As it was, the pro posed village of Thornapple never had any existence except on the aforesaid maps. The first emigrants into Duncan's neighborhood directly aster his settlement were Newton and Bainbridge Gage, and there was also one Freeman, who was interested with Calvin G. Hill in the mill, at the outset. Mr. Duncan afterwards settled upon section 28, but eventually removed to Oregon, his present home. In the year 1S39, Huston Cisler moved into the town ship from Irving, where he had worked two years for A. E. Bull. Mr. Cisicr made a settlement on section 33, in Henry Leonard was a man of mark in the community; was one of the first coroners of the county ; and until his"], [722, "488 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. courage settlements by holding the property out of the market. Aster 1858, however, the population began to multiply rapidly, and that locality is now well peopled, con taining, moreover, many valuable farms. Thornapple, and remained a resident of the township until his death, in 1867. He found on section 21 William H. Brown, who afterwards went to Kent County and founded Brownville, and on section 28 Robert Scales, of whom mention has already been made. In 1840 came George and Joseph, two sons of Huston Cisler, who were then young men, and who, after working for some time as farm hands, became farmers themselves, and have ever since re sided in the township, George being now on section 27, and Joseph on section 33. In that neighborhood, also, David Mattison, John Cook, George Stokoe, and Thomas Cranson were among the early settlers, and there they still reside. Upon section 3, B. F. Hungerford made a location in 1848, when there were in that vicinity only Michael Wood and E. H. Searles (whose son, G. W., now lives in Middle ville). Soon afterwards came H. W. Burch, still resident of section 3. Proceeding westward, near Duncan Lake the chronicler finds that the Kilmers were the early settlers after Ebenezer Duncan and the Gages. John Kilmer was on section 7, and near there was his brother William. That neighborhood was by common consent known for some time as Kilmertown. Dilman Bechtel bought John Kilmer's place in 1859. William Kilmer's son George re sides now on section 7. Richard Benjamin, an early set tler, married one of William Kilmer's daughters. Shortly after 1840, J. B. Freeman, living now on sec tion 12, came from Flint and made his home at Middleville, and there also, at an early period, George W. Cline took up his residence. In 1844, Robert Harper penetrated the forest and located upon section 20, where he now lives. The road passing north and south through his farm was then chopped out, but not a highway of much travel. East, his nearest neighbor was C. V. Patrick ; south, Elias Hill ; but neither west nor north had he a neighbor in the township, except Ebenezer Duncan, Newton Gage, and Bainbridge Gage, over at Duncan Lake. Samuel Davis came with Harper, and still lives on section 20, Avhere he then located. Soon after that Rawson White made a set tlement upon section 15, and found on section 14 Asa G. and Leonard Stimson, who had been there some little time. The Colbys and John Brink were early settlers near there. Bainbridge Gage's place is now occupied by Valentine Adam, who came soon after Bechtel, and upon the place of first settlement in that vicinity, made by Ebenezer Duncan, Mrs. William Woolgar now resides. John Latimer, a pioneer in Allegan County, lives on section 18, and there, too, lives the widow of Henry Col vin, one of Michigan's early settlers, who died in 1879. 0. T. Whitcomb, on section 8, located in Eaton County in 1838. G. M. Mitchell, on section 21, made his home in Middleville iu 1853, having then been in the State ten years. George Cook, who came to Michigan in 1847, made a permanent settlement in Thornapple in 1857. F. W. Collins, on section 28, has resided in Michigan since 1835, when he became a resident of Washtenaw County. E. D. Sprague, now living in Middleville, came to the township in 1850, and lived a while on section 35 with his father, John, who had come in 1848, and who died in 1858. His son settled, in 1850, in Yankee Springs, and in 1856 removed to his present home. J. R. Russell came to Middleville in 1853, when the village was yet hardly perceptible, and located on the west side of the river, where he now lives. Among the early settlers may be named also the De Golias, the Prindles, George C. Lewis, and William Coman, and among the later ones Joseph T. Crumback, J. C. Bray, Charles Spreen, J. B. Pumfrey, Samuel Carlisle, and J. C. Smith. East of the village Charles McQueen and John A. Rob ertson made settlements in 1846. They had worked to gether as farm-hands in New York State, and together came to Michigan in search of new homes. McQueen lo cated on section 24, and Robertson on section 25, where they still live. While they were preparing their own places for habitation, they boarded with Ebenezer Rathbun, who had been living on section 25 since 1S43, and who subsequently lost his life in the military service. West of McQueen a settlement Avas made by Thomas Riggs, now living on section 26, and in that neighborhood early settlements were also made by Jefferson Lee, Archi bald McQueen, and Duncan Campbell, the latter of whom came from Prairieville, where his father was a pioneer. In 1851, when Franklin Bliss settled on section 24, where Leonard Wilcox, now of Irving, had made a clear ing of 2 acres, he had no neighbor on the north except an Indian called \" Chippewa,\" who owned 40 acres on section 1 and lived in a log cabin. At that time a well-traveled stage-road crossed Bliss' farm, \u2014 the one which ran be tween Grand Rapids and Hastings. Farther north Solo mon Clark settled on section 12 in 1854, and beyond that C. I. Klock located in 1858, on section 2. Mr. Klock now lives on section 2, with John Moxon, who came with him into the township. Klock's neighbors on the south were Cornelius Walrath and his sons ; on the north, John Klock and Henry Smith ; on the west, the Forbes family ; and on the east, John Moe and a Mr. Badgrow. That same spring, Simeon Lawrence settled on section 11. At that day the northeastern portion of the township was a new country, for until then the land-owners had chosen to dis- THE GRAND RAPIDS ROAD. The stage-route from Battle Creek through Yankee Springs, and so on to Grand Rapids, passed through Mid dleville ; and on the road near there James Moreau kept a house of entertainment on Scales' Prairie, as did Henry Leonard on section 22. A great deal of travel, exclusive of the stages, passed over that road, and Moreau's, as well as Leonard's, was often so full of travelers that a bed on the floor was esteemed a luxury by late comers. Roadside inns in those days were popular affairs, and, however hum ble, were so liberally patronized that their landlords were among the favored ones of the land. INDIAN VILLAGES. There was an Indian village on Scales' Prairie and one on section 35, where, even after 1840, members of the"], [723, "Residence of J. C. BRAY, ThornappleTr. Barry Co., M ich."], [724, "I"], [725, "THORNAPPLE TOWNSHIP. 489 Chippewa, Ottawas, and Pottawatlamie tribes used to gather yearly to the number of from fifty to a hundred families, and make their tented homes for months at a time. Indian dances or pow-pows were common, and were sure to attract the curious and interested attention of the white settlers, between whom and the savages the relations were pleasant and harmonious. Dr. Parkhurst relates that the redskins used to have periodical jollifications upon the ground uoav occupied by the Johnson House, and that the exhibitions were exceedingly entertaining to civilized ob servers. Once he was called to the spot to prescribe for a sick squaw who had been given OA'er to die, and, as he hap pened to cure her, he was afterwards held in such esteem by the members of her tribe that, even after their removal to the far north, they sent to him for advice and medicine when any of their number fell sick.

Thornapple township was organized under a legislative act approved March 6, 1838, and then included the north west quarter of the county, now occupied by the townships of Thornapple, Yankee Springs, Rutland, and Irving. Yankee Springs was set off in March, 1839, and Irving in April, 1839 (the latter then including Rutland). The first annual meeting in Thornapple Avas held at the house of B. S. Dibble, April 2, 1838 ; Calvin G. Hill and Henry Leonard were inspectors of election, and Aarad Freeman and Cyrus E. Turner clerks. The officials elected on that occasion were: Supervisor, Calvin G. Hill; Clerk, Henry Leonard; Assessors, Benjamin Cummings, Estes Rich, and John Miles; Commissioners of Highways, Calvin G. Hill, William Lewis, and Chester Field; Jus tices of the Peace, Hiram Lewis, Aaron Freeman, and Lorenzo Cooley ; Overseers of the Poor, Henry Leonard and Benjamin Cummings ; Inspector of Primary Schools, C. G. Hill, John Miles, and Estes Rich ; Collector, William H. Whitney ; Constables, Ashbel Beach, Robert Scales, B. S. Dibble, and William H. Whitney ; Highway Overseers, Calvin Lewis, iu district No. 1 ; Robert Scales, in district No. 2 ; Lorenzo Cooley, in district No. 3. At the election held in 1840 there were cast but 13 votes ; in 1845 the number had increased to 31 ; in 1847 to 60 ; and in 1853 to 98. In 1858 there was a material advance to 196, and in 1868 to 341. In 1843 the jurors drawn were as solloAvs : Grand jurors, A. C. Hill, William B. Gage, William H. BroAvn, Chester Field, Elias Hill, Charles Paull; petit jurors, William P. Scofield, John Page, C. V. Patrick, Robert Scales, Adolphus Harwood, George C. Freeman. Slay 3, 1845, the jurors drawn were Adolphus Harwood, C. V. Patrick, J. D. Wilcox, Ashbel Beach, S. H. Beach, A. M. Hill, William H. Brown, Charles Williams. SCHOOLS. There is no record showing the number of votes cast at the first election, but at the second one, in April, 1839, the voters were 16. The names of these even cannot now be told, since the early poll-lists, together with other town records, were destroyed by fire. The supervisors, clerks, treasurers, and justices of the peace from lS39to 1879 were: The first meeting of the school inspectors was held April 12, 1838. Calvin G. Hill was chosen chairman, and the township divided into five school districts, the present town ship of Thornapple constituting district No. 1. This was subdivided the next year into four districts, but these were soon after again united as one.

In May, 1843, Jane Hill and Amanda Harwood were appointed teachers. In November, 1843, George B. Man chester and A. C. Hill received appointments, and in that year $40 were raised for a township library. May 4, 1844, Jane Hill was appointed to teach in district No. 2, and Nov. 2, 1844, Samuel C. Sprague became a teacher in the same district. Mary A. Bugbee was appointed to teach MIDDLEVILLE MERCHANTS. I. N. Keeler, still a resident of Middleville, but retired from active trade since 1860, was the pioneer merchant of the village. He came hither from Prairieville in 1850, bringing a stock of goods which he put into a room of A. C. Bruen's house, which stood where Parkhurst & Free man's drug-store now is. John Slocum, the village shoe maker, did, previous to Keeler's advent, pretend to do a little trading with the Indians, but his business was of an exceedingly limited capacity, and scarcely gave him the right to call himself a trader. Indians were also liberal customers with Keeler ; supplying that pioneer merchant with the major portion of his business for some time. in June, 1845, and Joshua C. Goodrich in October, 1845. District No. 3 was organized Nov. 29, 1845, and the first meeting in the district was held Jan. 17, 1840, at the house of Robert Scales. In 1846, Caroline Leonard and \\V. B. Goodrich were appointed teachers. District No. 4 was organized in September, 1849 ; No. 5, in 1853; No. 6, in 1857; and No. 7, in 1868. The condition of the seven township schools, as set forth in the official report for 1879, appears in the following abstract : Number of districts 7 \" children of school age 573 Average attendance 458 Value of property $21,100 Teacher's wages $2,058 When Mr. Keeler became a member of the village com munity he found there a grist-mill, carried on by A. C. Bruen, who had built it in 1849. It occupied the site upon which French's mill now stands. Alpheus Hill was carrying on the saw-mill (across the way from the grist mill) which had been built by Denison Bugbee in 1840. B. F. Hungerford Avas the proprietor of the blacksmith's shop (and had been since 1848) which was opened in 1,843 by Hiram Dennison, the pioneer smith of the village. New ton Gage, a shingle-maker, was there, as were William W. Paull and his brother Charles, carpenters. Calvin G. Hill was living on the west side of the river, as were his two sons, Albert and Alpheus. The school directors for 1879 were John Moe, P. C. Freeman, J. S. Johnson, J. C. Slyter, James Carlisle, C. Rosenberger, and A. A. Thompson. VILLAGE OF MIDDLEVILLE. EARLY EVENTS. Calvin G. Hill was the early proprietor of the site upon which Middleville village was first laid out, and probably surveyed it a few years previous to 1850, although the village was not formally recorded until April 12, 1859, when, the record says, Calvin G. Hill, A. C. Bruen, and W. W. Paull were the village proprietors. Since then ad ditions have been made as follows : Keeler's addition, April 27, 1869 ; Johnson's addition, June 14, 1869 ; Braddock's addition, Jan. 21, 1870 ; Shupe's addition, April 23, 1870. Previous to 1843 the place \u2014 what there was of it \u2014 was commonly known as Thornapple, but when the Middleville post-office was removed thither in the year mentioned, the village assumed the name it now bears. The first bridge over the river at that point was built in 1843, the con tractor being W. W. Paull, who came to the town in 1841. Up to 1850 the growth of the village was painfully slow, and for even some years after that gave no very brilliant Mr. Keeler sold goods from Bruen's house a few months, when, having completed a store building across the way, he moved into his new quarters. Until 1860 he was actively engaged in business in Middleville as a merchant, but since that time has lived the easier life of a capitalist. Mr. Keeler monopolized the trade of the town until 185f\", when Theodore D. Nelson entered the field. That gentle man, however, retired at the close of the year. Among the merchants who came in after that were a Mr. Eaton, John Bruen, Parkhurst & Sprague, M. & H. Wright, De Riemer & Jordan, and many others, whose order of coming cannot be recalled. M. & H. Wright erected the first brick store or block, now called the Wright Block. De Riemer & Jordan began business in 1854 in the old store of T. D. Nelson, who had been bought out by Ralph & Jordan, this latter firm being succeeded by De Riemer & Jor dan. T. A. De Riemer, a member of the latter firm, still does business in Middleville. His residence in Michigan dates from 1835, when, with his father, he came to Eaton County. Middleville to-day enjoys a fine country trade and boasts upwards of a dozen excellent stores. I. N. Keeler & Son aud Geo. Luther & Son are leading dry-goods mer chants; J. B. Kessler, E. M. Shufelt, R. W. Young, and promise. In 1846, Denison Bugbee built a saw-mill on the east side of the river, and in 1850 disposed of it to Alpheus M. Hill, who materially enlarged it. In 1849 there Avas a strongly expressed desire for a grist-mill, and, A. C. Bruen offering to build one if he were given some assistance, the residents thereabout turned out and gave such aid that Mr. Bruen finished the structure at a comparatively small ex pense. The building of two mills on the east side of the river led the Avay to the location of other business enter prises on that side the stream, a store being opened in 1850 by I. N. Keeler, and a hotel in 1852 by Ralph"], [727, "Residence of I. N. KEELER, Middleville, Barry Co., Mich."], [728, ""], [729, "THORNAPPLE TOWNSHIP. 491 C. D.

MIDDLEA'ILLE UNION SCHOOL. The first school-house built in the township stood in what is now Middleville, upon the west side of the river, and just north of where Leonard's hotel stands. The structure was of logs, and Charles Paull, the carpenter, \" finished it off\" in as high a style of art as circumstances permitted. Sarah Paull was the first teacher, and Mr. Coman the second. Rev. Mr. Wilcox, a Disciple minister, taught the school, and preached also to a church organization which met in the school-house, and which was the pioneer religious society of the township. About 1840 a frame school-house replaced the log building. Near the same time one of C. G. Hill's daughters opened a select school in a framed building which her father had erected, but carried it on only a short time. The village school was kept on the west side of the river until 1854, when a brick house was put up on the lot now occupied by the Union school, the lot being donated by Calvin G. Hill, and thereupon the school on the west side was abandoned. In 1871 the present sine Union school building was erected at a cost of $15,000. It contains four departments, \u2014 primary, intermediate, grammar, and high school, \u2014 in which the attendance of pupils in March, 1880, was 288. The principal is Charles W. Piekell. HOTELS. The first village tavern was a framed house, built in 1852 by Chas. V. Patrick, a farmer, upon the site of the Johnson house. Ralph Bugbee rented the house and was the first landlord ; but he remained the Boniface only a short time, when Patrick himself took possession. After him W. W. Ralph and John F. Emory were the landlords. The house on the Avest side of the river, known as Leon ard's hotel, was built by Calvin G. Hill, about 1840, for a store, but was never devoted to that purpose. It held a school at first, was then used as a residence, and finally being pur chased by C. V. Patrick, was by him converted into a hotel. He kept it a while, and sold it to C. P. Dow, from whom it passed into the possession of Philip Leonard. MIDDLEA'ILLE POST-OFFICE. In the spring of 1839, B. S. Dibble, then living on section 2, in Yankee Springs township, was called upon by Lucius Lyon, Congressman, of Kent County, then on his way to Washington, who incidentally remarked that Mr. Dibble ought to have a post-office at his house by reason of his distinction as a pioneer. Upon Dibble's agreeing to take the postmastership, \u2014 although there was an office at Yankee Springs, five miles distant, \u2014 Lyon wanted to call the office Dibbleville, but Dibble wouldn't have it, as he didn't like the name, although it was his family-name. Somebody suggested that an Indian village near there on the river was called \" Middle Village,\" by reason of being midway between Kalamazoo and Kent, and so the name of Middleville was adopted for the proposed post-office. Dibble received his appointment as postmaster July 3, 1839, and kept the office at his house until 1842, when he resigned to take a contract for carrying the mail between Kalamazoo and Kent. Middleville post-office was on that route, and received a mail twice a week each way, Orson Withey being mail-carrier when it was established. THE BAR OF MIDDLEVILLE. Middleville's first lawyer, B. H. Fuller, came to the vil lage in 1850, and practiced from that time to 1860, when he left town for an absence of four years. He returned in 1804, and resumed practice, but died in 1865. Meanwhile, Harvey Wright opened a law office in 1861, and remained until 1808, when he changed his habitation to Hastings. Asa Leonard began to practice in the village in 1801, but not long afterwards entered the army, and was killed in action. W. L. Cobb, who became a Middleville lawyer in 1865, is still one, having in the interim been a justice of the peace twelve years, and Circuit Court commissioner six years. George C. Worth practiced from 1867 to 1869 ; John Carveth from 1S69 to the present time; A. II. Ellis from 1871 to 1878; and Aaron Clark (now in Grand Rapids) from 1874 to 1879. P. W. Niskern, now practicing in Hastings, was a lawyer in Middleville from 1871 to 1877, as well as a newspaper publisher. M. F. Jordan and A. P. Cady, still in village practice, began in 1879. After Mr. Dibble resigned the office, it passed to John W. Bradley, who continued, however, to keep it at Dibble's house until 1843, when a change of location was effected to the site of the village of Middleville, where Calvin G. Hill was living. The place thereabout was commonly known as Thornapple, but upon the transfer of the post office to that locality it became knoAvn as Middleville, and that name it has ever since retained. Upon the transfer, Calvin G. Hill was appointed postmaster. Following him the incumbents of the office have been A. C. Bruen, W. W. Ralph, John F. Emory, Abraham A. Mead, Milton Mead, and M. F. Dowling. During the three mouths ending Dec. 31, 1879, the Middleville office made sales of stamps, envelopes, etc., to the amount of $415.95, aud MIDDLEVILLE PHYSICIANS. Previous to 1848 the country around Middleville de pended for medical attendance upon Hastings, and chiefly upon Dr. Upjohn. There was in the northern portion of Thornapple township one James Bell, who called himself an herb-doctor, and who used indeed to be called frequently to prescribe for the sick, but until Dr. S. S. Parkhurst came to the village, in 1S48, the neighborhood boasted no resi dent regular medical practitioner. Dr. Parkhurst was, however, but a student when he became a resident in Mid dleville and simultaneously undertook to teach the village school, with the understanding, hoAve\\'er, that if his medi cal practice required it he would give up the school.

In August, 1879, James Gibbs, marshal of the village of Middleville, while conveying one James Jansen (or Johnson) and his brother to the. lock-up on some trifling charge, was fatally stabbed by James Jansen, who at once fled. Gibbs died within twelve hours, and a search for Jansen discovered him in Chicago (whence he had Avritten a letter to Middleville and thus disclosed his whereabouts). He was captured within a week after the murder, and, being tried in February, 1880, was promptly convicted of murder in the second degree, and sentenced to the State prison for fifteen years. 1878.\u2014 President, E.

INCORPORATION AND OFFICERS. The first public religious services in Thornapple town ship were held according to the faith of those known as Disciples or Campbellites. Calvin G. Hill and Henry Leonard were members of that denomination, and soon after their settlement in Thornapple took measures to afford the infant community the privilege of public wor ship. An old church-record relates that \" The congrega tion of Disciples as associated at Thornapple first had its existence in the families of Calvin G. Hill and Henry Leonard, who; in the fall of the year 1835, emigrated to this place from the county of Monroe, N. Y., and who were the first families settled in the surveyed township for agricultural purposes, who agreed immediately after their settlement to meet together on Lord's day at each other's houses to keep the ordinances, and for social worship and edification. Appointed Calvin G. Hill as moderator and to officiate in the administration of the ordinances, which practice has continued. The Disciples, having multiplied, deem it necessary in the order of events now to perfect a more complete organization. Do this 12th day of Febru ary, 1843, appoint C. G.

On the same day (Feb. 12, 1843) Luther Goodrich was elected to the office of bishop, or overseer, of the congre gation, and A. C. Hill to the office of clerk. The village school-house was used for worship until 1863, when Charles Paull's hall was occupied. In 1866 this was vacated for Swift's hall, which served until the completion of the present church edifice, in the spring of 1871. There was at first some litigation over the church property, which was productive of discouragement and loss of membership for two or three years. These difficulties were at length happily settled, and the period of prosperity which then began has continued to the present time. From 1846 to 1880 the accessions to the church have ag gregated 170. The membership now numbers 64. A list of the persons who became members of the church during 1843 is here given as follows: Betsey Beach, Lucy Paull, Ruth L. Freeman, Laura Ann Goodrich, Ellen E. Hill, Martha J. Hill, Francis Hill, Delia Hill, Harriet Hill, Caroline Leonard, Sabina Patrick, William H. Brown, Lemuel Paull, George C. Freeman, Susanna Freeman, Ann Naylor, Sr., Ann Naylor, Jr., Sallie Hill, Luther Goodrich, Calvin G. Hill, Henry Leonard, Charles Paull, William W. Paull, Jeremiah Freeman, Ashbel Beach, Albert C. Hill, Emeline Irons, Rhoda Goodrich, Charlotte Hill, Betsey Leonard, Eliza Paull, Sarah Naylor, Clarissa Brown, Elmira Hill, Calvin Hill. The first pastor, Rev. Mr. Hoyt, preached from 1846 to 1852 ; Rev. 0. F. Waldo from 1852 to 1854 ; Rev. D. B. Campbell from 1854 to 1856 ; and Rev. Mr. Wheelock in 1857. During Mr. Wheelock's pastorate, Rev. T. Jones assisted in a protracted meeting at which 19 persons were added to the membership. Feb. 1, 1858, Rev. J. W. Kidder began his labors, and continued them until Nov. 22, 1868. Early in 1869 Rev. Mr. Raymond became the pastor, and was succeeded in March, 1872, by Rev. D. B. Campbell. Rev. J. J. Bunnell preached from July, 1874, to November, 1875, and Rev. Benjamin Moore from that time until June, 1878. In October, of the latter year, Rev. W. S. Bugbee, the present pastor, began his term of service. On the 18th of June, 1843, Luther Goodrich and C. G. Hill were made overseers of the congregation, and Charles Paull deacon, and from the record it would appear that on that day the church organization was completed. In January, 1845, W. W. Paull was appointed clerk in the place of A. C. Hill, who had removed from the township, and iu Septem ber, 1845, J. C. Goodrich was chosen bishop of the con gregation. Meetings were held in a log school-house near Squire Hill's house, and under its overseers the church flour ished four or five years. Afterwards there came one Wilcox, who combined with the business of preaching that of teach ing school. He was a person of a convivial turn of mind, and strongly inclined to freedom in religious belief. He was doubtless a man of honest convictions and possessed many excellent traits of character, but somehow he caused dissensions in the church, and himself fell into disfavor. The upshot of it was that the church was dissolved in 1847 and has never been re-established. The church trustees are George Luther, Charles Pitman, and Richard Watkins ; the deacons, AVilliam C. Pratt, A. F. Gillett, and Richard Watkins, Mr. Pratt having been one of the deacons since 1854. Charles Pitman is super intendent of the Sabbath-school, which has an average at tendance of 75. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH. On the 23d of April, 1853, a few Baptists met in the old \" Prairie\" school-house on Scales' Prairie, and organized the First Baptist Church of Thornapple. The members numbered nine, as follows : A. Harwood, J. J. Mattison, J. Sprague, Rev. F. Donaldson, Mary Harper, Emily Matti son, Marian Harwood, Theresa Pratt, and Lufannie Don aldson. An attempt had previously been made to organize a church in that vicinity, but the enterprise Avas short-lived. THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. On the 5th of April, 1846, a meeting was held at the house of A. A. Mead, in Yankee Springs, for the purpose of organizing a Congregational Church. Rev. Z. T. Hoyt was chosen moderator, T. W. Webber and G. B. Man chester deacons, and A. A. Mead stated clerk ; where upon it was resolved \" that the persons present organize themselves into the First Congregational Church of Yellow Springs.\" The organizing members were eleven in number, and included T. W. Webber and Maria, his wife, C. H. Brewer and Amelia, his wife, G. B. Manchester, Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Mead, Nathan Barlow and Sarah, his wife, and Mrs. Mary C. Lewis. December 6th the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was administered for the first time, Rev. Z. T. Hoyt officiating, on which occasion Jane Stokoe and Mrs. Indiana F. Corning were united by letter. Upon the day of the organization Rev. Mr. Donaldson was called to be the pastor, and J. J. Mattison was elected deacon. Of the nine organizing members above named, those now living are Mrs. William H. Brown, of Alaska (formerly Mrs. Donaldson), Mary Harper (yet a member of the church), and Theresa Pratt. July 3d the Lord's Supper was commemorated for the first time, and August 14th the ordinance of baptism was administered to John Griffith. June 21, 1854, the church united with the Kalamazoo Association, and, in April, 1855, the organization indicated its adhesion to the cause of total abstinence by expelling a member for violating the temperance pledge. In December, 1853, the church joined the Grand River Congregational Association. In December, 1854, the place of worship was removed from Yankee Springs to the village of Middleville, and the church name changed to that of the First Congregational Church of Middleville, worship being held in the village school-house. Sept. 21, 1856, it was voted to leave the Grand River Association and join the Kalamazoo Presbytery, and April 5, 1863, it was re- On the 12th of April, 1856, a church society was or ganized, Nelson Coman, Robert Harper, and William Paull being chosen trustees. Rev. Mr. Donaldson was the pastor till his death, in May, 1857, and was followed by Rev. B. H. Sheppard, who terminated his labors in September,"], [734, "494 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 1859. In August, 1860, Rev. D. Osborn became the pastor, and in August of that year the Prairie school-house was exchanged as a place of worship for the Methodist Episcopal church at Middleville, the agreement being to pay $30 per month for its use at such times as the Meth odists could spare it. Rev. Mr. Osborn retired in Febru ary, 1863, and was followed by Rev. 0. W. Wade. In September, 1863, the church withdrew from the Kalamazoo Association to join the Grand RiATer Association. In September, 1865, Mr. Wade closed his labors, and Rev. Mr. Osborn was resettled in April, 1866. In August of that year the name of the church was changed to that of the First Baptist Church of Middleville. The circuit then embraced the classes of Caledonia, Middleville, Thornapple, West Thornapple, Leighton, and Yankee Springs. In 1859 a church edifice was erected, the school-house having been used till that time. The church now owns a par sonage also, and has a flourishing membership of about 70. The trustees are T. D. Buck, Amos Hanlon, P. W. Niskern, G. H. Johnson, J. R. Russell, Joseph Barrell, and A. H. Stanford. The class-leader is A. H.* Stanford. George Ickes is the superintendent of the Sunday-school, which has eight teachers and an average attendance of 50. SOCIETIES. In 1867 the fine church edifice now in use was com pleted, being dedicated in January, 186S. The building cost about $4000, which was promptly subscribed before work was begun. Previous to April 12, 1868, the church was represented as to its Sunday-school interest in a Union school, but on the date named a Baptist Sabbath-school was organized. In the fall of that year the church joined the Thornapple River Association, which disbanded, however, almost immediately, whereupon this society united with the Grand Rapids Association, in which it still remains. MIDDLEVILLE LODGE, No. 231, F. AND A. M. This lodge was chartered Jan. 10, 1868, when Henry Cogshall was appointed M. ; H. I. Whitney, S. W. ; and M. F. Dowling, J. W. The organizing members of the lodge were Henry Cogshall, H. I. Whitney, Harvey Wright, Henry Colvin, George Brink, L. W. Payne, Samuel Little field, and William Wolgar. From 1868 to 1880 the Mas ters have been Henry Cogshall, Horace I. Whitney, Harvey Wright, S. C. Rich, A. H. Ellis, G. W. Mattison, and Wil liam H. Severance.

Aaron Bradley organized a Methodist Episcopal class in the village school house, and of that class memory now recalls C. W. Bassett and wife, J. R. Russell, William Fenton and wife, and Stephen Walrath and wife as members. J. R. Russell was the first class-leader, and Mr. Bradley, who organized the class, supplied the preaching two years, preaching also at Caledonia. The list of the church's ministers since Mr. Bradley 's time includes Rev. Messrs. Stafford, Gee, Jenkins, Wakefield, Van Wyck, Marble, Master, Hulen, Wigle, and I. B. Tallman, the latter being the present pastor. MIDDLEVILLE LODGE, No. 34, DAUGHTERS OF RE- BEKAH. This lodge was organized April 19, 1879, with 12 mem bers.

Russell, Treas. accounted among the most industrious and esteemed mem bers of the community in which they lived. At the age of about fifty the father, Charles Harper, determined to make an effort towards bettering his prospects, and with his family set sail, in 1829, for Canada. His family consisted of himself, wife, and ten children, and of these latter was R. Harper, who, from the age of eleven, had managed to eke out his own livelihood. His first year's labor on his own behalf yielded him but one pound, and upon his arrival in Canada \u2014 Quebec being the place chosen by the elder Harper as a location \u2014 the lad obtained employment with a farmer at seven dollars a month. Thus he labored a year or more, and then, learning that the \" States\" offered better inducements, proceeded thither with an elder brother and resumed his farming experience upon a place near Ogdensburg, in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. There he tarried two years, and in 1834 took service as a laborer with Silas Ball, of Rochester, N. Y., for whom he worked at first for eight dollars a month, and so faithfully did he attend to his duties and increase his value that he remained with Mr. Ball nine years, and was receiving at the close of his term the then excellent pay of one dollar a day. Having saved a snug sum, he bought forty acres near Rochester, and after materially improving the property exchanged it for one hundred and sixty acres in Thornapple town ship, Barry Co., upon which he has ever since made his home. In 1837 he married Mary Colby (born in Heniker, Cheshire Co., N. H., in 1809, and successively a resident, with her parents, of Schoharie County and Rochester, N. Y.), and in the spring of 1844 they moved westward to take possession of their Michigan wilderness, upon which not a single axe-stroke had been deliA'ered. In the midst of the dense forest they set up their rude log cabin, labored heroically and energetically in the work of winning a com fortable homo, slowly but surely progressing in the task as the years moved on, and in their declining years enjoy the well-earned satisfaction of knowing that for the toils of early life they are now reaping the reward of happy ease. The Harper farm is one of the best in the county, and the Harper residence \u2014 of which a view may be seen in this work \u2014 an ornament to the town. MIDDLEVILLE REFORM CLUB. This temperance organization was called into existence in January, 1877, and commenced its career amid much popular enthusiasm. Fully one hundred and fifty people signed the pledge at the first meeting of the club, and the good work thus auspiciously begun has continued since then to thrive under the same ministrations. The club has noAV an active membership of 40, and has regular Wednesday evening assemblies at Red Ribbon Hall. WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION. The Women's Christian Temperance Union was organized in January, 1877, and received at once a large number of members, who have labored energetically for the cause of temperance and accomplished much good. Mrs. Mary Pinney is the President, Mrs. Charles Pitman, Sec, and Mrs. James Fenton, Treas. PARMELEE STATION. North of Middleville is Parmelee Station, on the Michi gan Central Railroad, so named in honor of E. K. Parme lee, who, after pioneering in Lenawee and Hillsdale Coun ties from 1836 to 1860, came in the latter year to Thorn apple, and located on section 10. In August, 1874, the railway company established Parmelee Station, Mr. Parmelee donating land for that and other railway purposes, and the neighborhood residents paying for the erection of a depot building. Mr. Parmelee was appointed station agent, and in 1878 was made postmaster, upon the creation of Parme lee post-office. He still holds both those offices. Sherk & Cline's elevator at the station gives farmers a convenient grain-market, and there is moreover a brisk ship ment at Parmelee of railway-ties. Seven thousand ties were received during February, 1880, and the estimate then was that the receipts of ties between January and September would aggregate fully 50,000. Frederick Alexander carries on a store, B. F. Hungerford has a blacksmith-shop ; there is also a saw-mill and turning-lathe, while a \" bending\" factory is about to be established, so that Parmelee is posi tively looking up. Two religious organizations \u2014 a Metho dist Episcopal class, of which H. W. Burch is leader, and a United Brethren class, of which Mrs. George Cline is leader \u2014 worship at a neighboring school-house on alternate Sundays, and enjoy encouraging support. Mr. and Mrs. Harper have been active members of the Baptist Church of Middleville since that church was organ ized, and during that extended period they have ever been regarded as exemplary exponents of that faith, contributing, moreover, with generous liberality to the support of the organization, and especially towards the erection of a house of worship. Four children have been born to them, but of these four only one has been spared. Eliza A., who was born Feb. 11, 1838, died Jan. 17, 1860; Laura J., born June 25, 1S43, died Oct. 1, 1846; George A., born Feb. 22, 1849, died March 27, 1877 ; Charles E., born Sept. 16, 1853, still lives to cheer the evening of his parents' lives, and even as he prizes and appreciates the privilege of staying and comforting them, so they, rejoicing in the possession of a son's deA'otion, are calmly grateful to Heaven and content to descend the hill of life by easy and pleasant paths. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. R. HARPER. Among the resident farmers of Thornapple township none occupy a higher place than R. Harper.

R. B. MESSER. R. B. Messer, now a leading merchant in Middleville, was born in Carlton, Barry Co., Aug. 28, 1844. His parents, Isaac and Hannah (Benson), were natives respec tively of New Hampshire and New York, and were mar ried in Jackson Co., Mich., in 1836. They settled directly afterwards iu Orangeville, Barry Co., and in 1839 became residents of Carlton, where they made their home upon eighty acres on section 20, and experienced in common Avith all early 'comers the vicissitudes, hardships, and trials of pioneers. William Colby was born in Roxbury, N. Y., Dec. 18, 1822, and was one of twelve children vouchsafed as bless ings to the union of his parents. When William was a lad of but seven his father removed to Western New York, in Monroe County, and in the town of Grace, William remained until reaching his sixteenth year, when for fifty dollars he purchased his \" time\" of his father, and agreed to pay the purchase-money out of the first funds he should earn. Ambitious to grow up with a new country, he set out for Michigan, and in Washtenaw County entered upon a life of earnest action, working upon a farm in the sum mer at ten dollars and a half a month, and in a cooper's shop in Salem in the winter season. In that locality he remained thus employed until the summer of 1841, having meanwhile canceled his father's claim of fifty dollars out of his first year's earnings, when he passed on to Mason, in Cass County, Mich., and there, taking service with a cooper, continued with him until his marriage, March 4, 1843, to Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Williams. The young couple settled in Mason, and for the next year Mr. Colby divided his time between coopering, farming, and trafficking in real estate. In the autumn of 1844 they moved to North field, in Washtenaw County, where Mr. Colby pursued his accustomed avocations until June, 1847, when he changed his residence to Marshall, and, purchasing an eighty-acre farm of John Weller, lived upon it until the following November, when, again moving, they made their home in Bristol, Ind., until the fall of 1852, Mr. Colby having continued to that time to labor at his trade. Then they took possession of a purchase in Thornapple township of eighty acres of wild land, and engaged iu earnest in the work of pioneering. Their pioneers' log cabin, a sketch of which is embodied in this work, was a primitive and homely affair, but a source of much comfort after all. They cleared their land with rapid strokes and energetic will, and, living upon it until the spring of 1861, sold it sor two thousand dollars, and with the proceeds purchased a fine farm containing sixty-five acres of improved land two miles eastward. To that purchase they made additions until 1865, when the farm comprised no less than three hundred and forty acres. In 1865, Mr. Colby began his prepara tions for the erection of a new brick residence, aud in 1870 completed the beautiful home he noAV occupies, illustrated, as will be seen, in an accompanying sketch. R. B. Messer remained upon his father's farm until he reached the age of eighteen, when, desirous of viewing more of the world in which he lived, he set out upon a tour to California, and journeyed via the Isthmus of Pan ama. He tarried upon the Pacific Slope four years, passing his time chiefly in farming in Marine and Sonoma Counties, Cal., and when he returned eastward passed again vid Cen tral America. Domiciled once more in Michigan, he at tended Parsons' College, at Sturgis, and in the winter of 1868, purchasing five hundred acres of land in Mason County, moved upon the place in 1869. A year spent thereon was quite sufficient to satisfy him, and at the end thereof he returned to Carlton and bought one hundred and eighty acres of the old Messer homestead. There he resumed the life of an agriculturist, and in May, 1871, married Mary A., daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James L. Sisson, who at the age of nine removed Avith her parents from Huron Co., Ohio, to Irving, Barry Co. Her father is now a resident of Hastings. In 1876, by reason of his wife's failing health, Mr. Messer concluded to give up the arduous duties of the husbandman, and, removing to Middleville with his family, engaged in the business of selling agricultural implements. This trade he has steadily pursued since 1876, and with constantly expanding success. Mr. and Mrs. Messer have but one child, Gracie E., born March 21, 1873. I. N. KEELER. To I. N. Keeler belongs the distinction of having been the pioneer merchant in Middleville, and the further dis tinction of having been closely and vigorously associated with the general progress of that village since its foundation. He was born in Saratoga Co., N. Y., Sept. 17, 1822, his father, Isaac, being of American birth, and his mother, Clarissa (Althouse), of German nativity, and was fourth in a family of six children. Young Isaac lost his father at the age of nine, and soon thereafter he went to live with Nathaniel Mead, of Saratoga County, and with him re moved to Ontario Co., N. Y., where he gained a livelihood until sixteen years of age as a farm-hand. After that, for five years, he lived in Saratoga County, and by laboring during the summers and attending school in the winters he laid the foundation of a substantial practical education that served him to excellent purpose in after-years. After at taining his majority he continued to reside in Saratoga County until the fall of 1849, industriously pursuing the Elizabeth (Williams) Colby is the daughter of Peter Williams, a Virginian, a veteran of the war of 1812, and an early resident in Shenandoah County, where he followed the business of gunmaking, dealt also in cattle and horses, and owned moreover a farm of six hundred acres. Strongly anti-slavery in his principles, he declined to remain in Vir ginia beyond 1837, when, with his family of eleven chil dren, he migrated to Yorktown, Elkhart Co., Ind., where William Colby met and married Mr. Williams' daughter Elizabeth. The children born to Mr. and Mrs. Colby number four, as follows: Amanda Jane, born Dec. 6, 1843; Rebecca Ann, born Sept. 15, 1846; D. W., born Aug. 11, 1850; Albert Franklin, born Aug. 11, 1861."], [739, "F. W. CO LLI NS F. W. COLLINS F. W. Collins comes of Revolutionary stock, and was born in Wayne Co., N. Y., Feb. 16, 1826. His father, Moores F. Collins, was a native of Windsor, Vt., and in early childhood removed with his parents to Wayne Co., N. Y. Life upon his father's farm was the familiar feature of his early manhood, but, more fortunate than many of his fellows, he received the bene fits of an excellent education, and among his classmates was one who became afterwards Governor De Witt Clinton. In aster-years Collins received from Governor Clinton a commission as colonel in the State militia, and was with Gen. Winfield Scott at the battle of Lundy's Lane. At the time of his death in Ann Arbor, in 1878, at the age of eighty-four, he was sup posed to be the last of the valiant band that fought under Scott in that memorable engagement. Incidental to his experience as colonel of the militia, it is related that at a general muster he had a controversy with his adjutant, and, as an outcome, it was arranged to settle the difference by a duel. One of Col lins' seconds was his uncle, who, seeking to avert bloodshed and give a harmonious ending to the proposed tragedy, contrived to have the dueling ground fixed upon a hill-top. The princi pals were placed back to back, with pistols in hands, and in structions to march ten paces forward, wheel and fire. Marching forward the required distance, they wheeled, and lo ! the hill-top intervened between them, and to each the circumstance pre sented itself in such a ridiculous light that they forswore their enmity upon the spot, made up their quarrel, and were firm friends ever after. Col. Collins migrated in 1835 from New York to Wash tenaw Co., Mich., and there F. W. Collins passed the years until he reached his majority, dividing his time meanwhile between attending school, working upon his father's farm, and teaching the village school. At the age of twenty-one he located a piece of school land in Pulaski township, Jackson Co., and two years later married Mary McDowell, of Washtenaw County, to which place her parents had come in 1824, among the first of the pioneers in that county. In 1854 Mr. Collins changed his resi dence to Allegan County, where, in the town of Leighton, he occupied a farm until 1868, when he settled upon a one hun dred and twenty acre tract in Thornapple township, and to that has since added two hundred and twenty acres, so that he has now an extensive and handsomely appointed farm. Republi canism is his political faith, and on numerous occasions he has been called upon to serve his fellow-citizens in an official capa city. He sat in the State Legislature during the session of 1873, and again in 1874, during the extra session called for a revision of the State Constitution. As supervisor he has served an ag gregate of seventeen years in the counties in which he has re sided. He has reared a family of four children, \u2014 two boys and two girls, \u2014 and, surrounded by the comforts of an elegant home, pursues the even tenor of his life-long industrious experience."], [740, ""], [741, "THORNAPPLE TOWNSHIP. 497 occupations of farmer and carpenter. Then he determined to venture into broader fields, and, casting about for a prom- ising location, fixed upon the State of Michigan. He tar- ried for a while in Prairieville, where his brother was in trade as a merchant, and in the spring of 1850 pushed over to the then infant village of Middleville, in Barry County, and there opened the first store known in Middleville his- tory. His first stock of goods, purchased on a capital of three hundred dollars, was brought from New York to Galesburg, via lake and railroad, and thence transported by wagons to Middleville, a distance of thirty-three miles, through a new country and over bad roads or at times no roads at all. Mr. Keeler, keeping pace in his enterprise with the growth of the village, continued to be its leadin\"* merchant until 1858, when he retired from active trade participation to an eighty-acre farm, just north of the village, which he enlarged to three hundred and eighty acres, of which he sold one hundred and five acres, includin\"* his buildings, and rebuilt at his present location, at the head of Grand Rapids Street. He continued after his retirement, and continues to this day, to retain business interests in the village. He purchased a part proprietorship in Wright's block, upon the erection thereof, and later he bought the entire property. Since 1858 he has trafficked extensively in real estate, and pursued, in short, business enterprises of various kinds with such success that he occupies at this time a prominent place among the wealthy capitalists of the county. From the position of an humble trader, in 1850, with barely capital enough to give him a start in the forest hamlet, he has risen by the sheer force of energy and perse- vering industry to independent wealth, and to each of his sons, as he has come of age, he has been easily enabled to give abundant worldly goods to insure a prosperous business career. In June, 1851, Mr. Keeler married Harriet E. Ellsworth, born in Windsor, Vt., Jan. 19, 1832, orphaned at the age of six months, adopted by Augustus Pease, and residing successively in Ohio and Michigan. She began when quite young to teach school, and as a teacher in Michi- gan filled that useful field until her marriage. Of their six children four still live. Isaac H., born June 22, 1S56, is now in company with his father doing, to all appearances, a successful retail dry goods and general merchandise busi- ness, which is entirely in his charge ; William E , Aug. 28, 1859 ; Miner S., Oct. 18, 1862 ; and George L., April 8, 1865. Edwin A., born Sept. 26, 1853, died March 24, 1877 ; a daughter, born April 10, 1858, died in infancy. Mr. Keeler has Avon a worthy name as an honorable mer- chant aud upright citizen, not only in his adopted home, but throughout Barry County. Integrity and honesty have been the watchwords of his business career and the stepping stones to his success. He has labored faithfully to gather the fruits of earnest toil and manly action, and in the even ing of life enjoys to the full a well-won reward. Canada, July 1, 1842, of Irish and American parentage, his father, Dennis B., having emigrated from Ireland to Quebec, Canada, in 1825. His mother, a native of Ver- mont, went to Canada in 1800, and is now eighty-three years old. The elder Hanlon came of an aristocratic Irish family, and, being a young man of. excellent education, became, upon his arrival in Canada, a school-teacher, \u2014 a pursuit that he followed several years. He was intended by his parents for the Catholic ministry, but he preferred Protestantism, and during his life in Canada occupied several places of important public trust under the govern- ment up to his death, in 1865. Upon the cessation of his common-school studies young Amos took up the study of medicine and pursued it in Canada until prepared to grad- uate. He determined, however, to become ultimately a practicing physician in the \" States,\" and to that end en- tered the Ann Arbor University as a member of the class of 1867-68. Graduating, he returned to Canada, and for a year studied, while he also practiced. In 1869 he located as a physician in Bay Co., Mich., and in October of that year, discovering a more inviting field, passed over to Mid dleville, where he has been a practitioner continuously since 1869. Dr. Hanlon conceives it to be important for a physi cian to continue in diligent study even while in practice, and that principle he has practically maintained and still maintains. During the winter of 1875-76 he attended a course of study at the Hahnemann Medical College and Cook County Hospital of Illinois, and received a doctor's degree. He received also an honorary degree from the Chicago Hom\u0153opathic College, and these valuable college and hospital experiences he proposes to follow, after a two years' interval, with a winter at Bellevue Hospital, in New York. In recognition of his skillful proficiency he has been tendered a chair in one of the medical colleges of Canada, but this honor he was forced to decline, because he preferred to remain where he had made his professional reputation, and where his large practice made it his duty to remain. Mrs. Mary A. Hanlon was born in Michigan in 1850, and married Dr. Hanlon in July, 1878. Her father, Oliver A. Lewis, a native of Massachusetts, and her mother, Eliza, born in Connecticut, became Michigan pioneers in 1835, in the town of Dryden, Lapeer Co., where Mr. Lewis still lives. J. C. BRAY. The parents of J. C. Bray were John and Joanna (Sweazy) Bray, natives of Sussex Co., N. J., and about the year 1820 settlers in Dumfries, Brant Co., Canada. In that place J. C. Bray was born, May 26, 1832, and there made his home until he reached his twenty-second year, when, receiving from his father one thousand dollars as his portion, he decided to become a Michigan pioneer, and, purchasing in the spring of 1855 a partially improved eighty-acre lot on section 28, in Thornapple township, Barry Co., made a permanent settlement thereon. His first habitation was a 12 by 16 board shanty, with but one window and one door, and in this primitive structure he DR. AMOS HANLON. Among the well-known and skillful physicians of Barry County, Dr. Amos Hanlon, of Middleville, occupies a de servedly prominent place. He was born at Niagara Falls, 63"], [742, "498 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 28, 1821), who had not moved westward with the family, joined his father at Mr. Bull's place in 1837. In Irving he stopped until 1844, and labored here and there as a farm hand. In 1844 he purchased with his savings a forty acre tract of wild land upon section 28, in Thornapple town ship, and in 1845 took up a permanent residence upon it. In common with all pioneers, he encountered all the hard ships and privations incident to life in the West at that opened \"bachelor's hall.\" During the first twelve months of his occupancy he cleared and broke considerable land, when, receiving a good offer for the property, he sold it, remaining, however, long enough to take off the ciops which had been reserved. Subsequently he visited Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Missouri in search of a new location, but returned eventually to Michigan and settled in Johnstown township, Barry Co., upon one hundred and sixty acres in section 17. At the close of a two years' residence in Johnstown he disposed of his place and bought an eighty-acre farm in section 28, Thornapple township, about fifty acres being partially improved He set at once about the work of improving the place. He replaced the dwelling with a substantial and imposing edifice, put out additional orchards, added by and by one hundred and twenty acres more to his first purchase, and continued to steadily improve the appointments of his possession, until he owns to-day one of the best farms in Thornapple, a sketch of which, as well as his residence, will be found in this book. April 27, 1867, Mr. Bray married Mrs. Har riet E. Johnson, widow of Amos H. Johnson, M.D. Mrs. Bray (whose maiden name was Harriet E. Leek) was born in Catlin township, Schuyler Co., N. Y., July 19, 1834. Mr. Bray has long been actively connected with the Barry County Agricultural Society, and, as its president and superintendent during several terms, con tributed largely towards the society's present flourishing condition. Mr. Bray is in politics a Republican, but he is in no sense a politician. The cares of his business de mand his whole attention, and he prefers to the empty honors of a political life the consciousness that he is re spected by his fellow-citizens as one who joins with them in prosperously maintaining the substantial interests of the community in which he lives. He is, moreover, a staunch advocate of temperance principles, and in their behalf he is always foremost in lending the influence of his voice and example. GEORGE CISLER. day ; but a strong constitution and ardent ambition gave him strength to sustain his labors and to acquire eventually a handsomely-improved farm of two hundred and eighty acres. Recently he has disposed of some of his land, and has now one hundred and twenty acres, containing substantial and commodious farm -buildings, fine orchards, etc. In 1852 Mr. Cisler married Helen M. Stephens, by whom he bad four children, of whom but one (Frank A.) is living. Mrs. Cisler died in 1861, and in 1865 Mr. Cisler married for his second wife Elizabeth A. Warfield, widow of Wil liam Warfield, who lost his life in the military service of the United States. Of the last union have been born two children, Martha G., Sept. 5, 1868, and George T., Jan. 25, 1877. Mrs. Elizabeth Cisler died May 6, 1880. Mr. Cisler has ever stood in the foremost rank among the industrious and prosperous farmers of Thornapple town ship, and amid the busy cares of existence he has found neither time nor inclination to seek political distinction. He is content to fill with credit the place in the social sphere to which events have assigned him, and wisely be lieves that in such a field, well cultivated, one may win more honors and greater esteem than in the broadest area ever embraced in a political career. GEORGE CISLER. About the year 1780, George Cisler, a native and resi dent of Germany, conceived a desire to emigrate to Amer ica, but so poor was he that to furnish sufficient money to pay his passage was for him an impossible task. In this emergency he offered to mortgage himself to a ship captain for the price of his passage, and upon such terms was car ried over sea to the New World. In the State of Penn sylvania he made his first habitation, and there, by labor ing for the owners of the vessel that had brought him over, soon discharged their claim upon him. His after-life he spent in Pennsylvania, and at his death left a family of six children, of whom the youngest (Huston) married, upon reaching manhood, Miss Rachel Scott, of English parent age, and reared in his turn a family of six children, includ ing, like his father's, four boys and two girls. Huston Cisler, with a portion of his family, removed in 1830 to Washte naw Co., Mich., and after spending six years there as a pioneer migrated to Irving township, in Barry County, where he took charge of the farm of Albert E. Bull. George Cisler, one of his sons (born in Lycoming Co., Pa., Oct. JOHN CARVETH The parents of John Carveth, of whom this article will treat, were Edward and Emeline (Brant) Carveth.

He obtained his education upon his father's farm and at school. At the age of twelve he removed with his father to Monroe Co., Mich., and four years after that his father died, aged fifty nine. Between the ages of sixteen and twenty John passed his time in educational pursuits, as school-pupil, and later as school-teacher. In 1866 he entered the mercantile busi ness in Lowell, Mich., and, abandoning it at the end of a year, commenced the study of the law at Middleville. In 1868 he was admitted to the bar, and since then he has been steadily engaged in a successful law practice. Mr. Carveth is esteemed one of the most prominent and capable attorneys in Barry County, and during his comparatively brief legal career has accumulated through his professional labors a handsome competence. His profession is his pride, and, although he has enjoyed political distinction, he pre fers to abide within the sphere of his professional callings and win all his honors there. at the age of twenty-one began to build his fortunes by hiring himself by the month for farm labor. He was still pursuing the even tenor of a farmer-hand when, in 1861, the first gun in the Southern Rebellion sounded from Fort Sumter. Prompt to the call for three months' men he enlisted, April 23d of that year, iu Company A, Third Michigan Infantry. Before the regiment was ready to leave for the seat of war, notification was received from the Governor that men were desired for three years, and upon that announcement nearly every man in the Third re-enlisted for that term of service. The regiment pro ceeded to Washington, reaching there June 16th, Smith being then a corporal of the color-guard of the command. The first engagement participated in by the Third took place at Blackburn's Ford, July 18, 1861, and on the 21st there was the second conflict at the same place. Then followed the affairs of Mason's Cross-Roads, Munson's Hill, Yorktown, Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, and Chicka hominy. At the latter engagement, Avhich was fought May 31, 1862, Smith received a musket-ball through tho neck and right shoulder, a second in the right lung, where it still reposes, and a third through the left hip, while no less than thirteen balls passed through his coat. Into that memorable action the Third Michigan was led by Gen. Phil. Kearney, and bore itself in a gallant and glorious manner. Among the wounded conveyed from the field was Smith, who, along with other similar victims of the conflict, was at White House Landing put aboard a vessel and shipped to Fortress Monroe. Just before the fortress was reached, Smith learned that those of the wounded considered able to stand the journey were to be taken to hospital at New York City, while the residue were to be left at Fortress Monroe. He, being considered badly hurt, was set aside for the latter place, but he was more anxious to go to New York, and by the judicious expenditure of five dollars induced some soldiers to transfer his cot to the party intended for that point. So he reached the metrop olis, and after a brief stay in the hospital at that point was conveyed by his friends to Michigan, where he remained until the following August. On the 19th of that month he reported again for duty, and found his regiment with the Army of the Potomac, under Gen. Pope. Directly thereafter the command was concerned in the advance from Warrenton Junction, and was in a continuous skirmish with the enemy until the advance reached Groveton, or field of the second Bull Run fight, where a two days' eno-aizement ensued, and this on the third day was followed Do * by the fight at Chantilly, where Gen. Kearney met his death. Later the regiment fought under Burnside at Fredericksburg, Dec. 13, 1862, and for gallant services on that field Smith was commissioned second lieutenant, and assigned to the command of Company D. Of his father's children there are three living. William, the eldest, died at the age of thirty-eight, leaving a widow and two children, who have been provided for since Wil liam's death by his brother John. The latter was the second of his father's children. Hamilton, the third, resides upon his brother John's farm, one and a half miles from Middle ville. Margaret, the fourth, is the wife of George Hart, of Keene, Ionia Co. Mr. John Carveth's family consists of his wife and three year-old daughter. Mrs. Carveth is the daughter of Aaron and Mercy Clark, the latter now a resident of Grand Rapids. Mr. Carveth's mother, aged seventy-four, is living at Mr. Carveth's home, in Middleville. S. B. SMITH. Torrey Smith was born in Crittenden Co., Vt., in the year 1800, and in the Green Mountain State and Western New York passed thirty-six years of his life amid the dis turbing and trying events which beset the pioneers of those localities in the earlier days. Marrying Jane Redden, a native of County Cavan, Ireland, he determined to become a Michigan pioneer, and in 1836 settled in Ada, Kent Co., where he purchased ninety acres of wild land, and where he continued to live until his death, in 1871, aged seventy one, his wife having died there about two years before. At the first election held after the organization of the Whig party he cast the only vote polled in his township by that party, but lived long enough to see them win con spicuous triumphs after all. Of his nine children six are now living, viz., Charles (present residence unknown) ; Alvira, widow of the late Judge Tracy, of Grand Rapids ; Henry, hotel proprietor at Ada, Mich., and owner of the Smith homestead ; George, a farmer of Ravenna, Muskegon Co., Mich. ; Eliza, now Mrs. Charles Skellenger, of Ada, Kent Co. ; and S. B. Smith, the subject of this sketch, a prominent merchant in Middleville, Barry Co., Mich. The Third Michigan encamped at Falmouth during the winter of 1862-63 with Buruside's command, and took part in several skirmishes, but none of these were fruitful save in loss of men. Lieut. Smith was with his regiment under Hooker at Chancellorsville, took part in the action of the previous night, in which Stonewall Jackson was killed, and at Chancellorsville, on the 30th of May, 1863, had his left leg carried away by a twelve-pound shot.

Upon his return to Michigan he be came the editor of the Lowell Journal, and after an edi torial life of a year entered upon the business of lumber dealing and milling at LoAvell, which he discontinued in August, 1872, to engage in the September following in the hardware trade at Middleville. In 1877 he added to that business that of dealing in agricultural implements, in which he carries on now one of the most flourishing and extended of all similar branches of trade in Barry County. leg was amputated upon the field of battle, and in due time he was transferred to hospital at Alexandria. When recovered sufficiently to undertake the journey he obtained a sixty days' leave, and visited his Michigan home for a season of recuperation. While at home he received noti fication of his transfer to the Veteran Reserve Corps. He was assigned to duty at the Judiciary Square Hospital, Washington, D. C., and commissioned captain by President Lincoln (the commission being now in his possession). He remained on duty in Washington until August, 1865, and was then transferred to Fairfax Co., Va., where he took charge of the interests of the freedmen over a district covering that portion of Virginia lying between the Rap pahannock and Potomac east of the Blue Ridge, Alexandria excepted, with headquarters at Leesburg, Loudon Co.

The town ship occupies high ground, and of its 23,040 acres but 046 are occupied by \" waste-lands,\" most of these being covered by \"a portion of Jordan Lake, which penetrates the township on section 4. The surface of the country is generally level, and from almost any point one may obtain for miles around a charming view of one of the handsomest agricultural districts in the State. near. They came to the town as early as 1846, and now form a community not only strong in numbers, but import ant in wealth. PIONEER HISTORY. THE THREE BACHELORS. The township of Woodland was opened to the advance of the army of civilization in the autumn of 1837, by Charles Galloway, Jonathan Haight, and Samuel S. Haight. The latter has passed from the stage of life, but the first two still live in the township, of which they have been hon ored citizens since they first struck their axes into the trunks of Woodland's forest monarchs, forty-three years ago. Agriculturally, Woodland stands at the head of all the townships in Barry. The soil is remarkably productive and varied in character. For fruit, wheat, and vegetables it is especially noted, and that the pursuit of farming is a prof itable occupation goes without saying. Indeed, handsome and substantial farm-houses and wide-reaching farms are in Woodland the rule rather than the exception. Its people are prosperous, and need but a railway through the town ship to make them doubly so. These three were young bachelors when in 1836 they met in Livingston Co., Mich., each eager to participate in the great work of pioneering in the West. Pending the arrangement of some plan to further this interest, Samuel Haight and Galloway pushed on to Ionia County, where they secured employment with a carpenter, and in April, 1837, being joined there by Jonathan Haight, they agreed to start with the latter on a land-looking tour. Isaac Knapp, who had been through Barry County, suggested to them that township 4 north, in range 7 west, then an unbroken forest, offered fine inducements to the pioneer, and into that town the three bachelors penetrated in company. Timbered land was what they sought, and timbered land for sooth they found in township 4 so much to their taste that they promptly made locations therein, \u2014 Jonathan Haight on the southwest quarter, Samuel Haight on the west half of the northeast quarter, and Galloway on the west half of the southeast quarter, all on section 15. It was in May, 1837, that they made this visit, and all hands returned at once to Portland, Ionia Co. There Samuel Haight and Gallo- Woodland is also famous for containing within its borders more church buildings by far than can be boasted by any other township in the county.

To stay them on their journey they carried a bag of provisions and a bushel of potatoes. cow-bells off in the northeast, they knew that one of the three would have to set out at daylight the next morning to bring the bovines back from the Grand River, whithe'r they were sure to stray. The one selected to make the chase would be off at break of day on a twenty-two-mile jaunt to the river at Portland, and there overhauling the cows would drive them home at a lively pace. Such an incident was a common occurrence, and upon one occasion, when Samuel Haight made the trip, he was gone twenty four hours ; living during that time on milk which he got from the cows, and using his hat sor both milking-pail and drinking-cup. Knapp and Haight camped on section 17 long enough to chop an acre or so, throwing the parings of the potatoes, upon which they subsisted during their stay, upon the ground and covering them with leaves. Knapp and Haight then returned to the haunts of civilization, but in pursuance of previous agreement the two Haights and Gal loway met at Scott's, in Clinton County, in October of that year, equipped with a supply of provisions, and otherwise prepared to venture into township 4 for a permanent settle ment. They journeyed via the river in a canoe to Port land, capsized their craft, and lost some of their supplies, but reached Portland alive. At Portland they hired a Mr. Kilburn to carry their goods across the country with an ox-team, and for the entire journey of twenty-two miles through the woods Samuel Haight marched ahead with compass and tomahawk \"blazing\" a route, while Jonathan Haight and Galloway followed with axes cutting out a road for Kilburn's conveyance. After a two days' trip they reached their destination, Oct. 14, 1837, and that night slept under a bark shanty, which Samuel Haight had put up on his piece of land during the summer, in anticipation of the move in the fall. Mush and milk was a favorite diet, and in the preparation of this, as well as of most of the dishes they consumed, Galloway was the master-mind, or cook, and a skillful cook he was, too, so report saith. One hot July day, as usual, he was boiling a pot of mush in the roomy fireplace, when, his attention being drawn to \"something white\" that ap peared to be falling from the chimney into the mush, he called out to Jonathan Haight: \"Jonathan, what's that drop ping into the mush? Looks like ashes, don't it?\" Jon athan took a hasty glance and said : \" Yes, of course, that's ashes ;\" and then, appalled by a sudden thought, went out upon the roof and inspected a saddle of venison he had a few days before hung in the chimney to be smoked. Just as he had expected, the venison had succumbed to the heat by breeding skippers, and under the influence of the ascend ing fire the skippers had loosed their hold upon the venison to drop into the pot of mush below. The \"something white\" which Galloway thought was ashes was something else of not quite so inviting a character. Jonathan concluded that to reveal the truth would be to condemn the mush to destruction, and, as mush was mush those days, ob tained after much tribulation and prized accordingly, he held his peace, and with his two friends dined heartily upon the mush, milk, and skippers. He told them the story, however, after dinner, and, although they took it sorely to heart that they had been so put upon, philosophy gave them resignation to the belief that it would have been a sin to waste the mush anyway. The shanty had, for the sake of room and convenience, been built over a depression in the ground, and into this inviting place the four tired travelers crept to sleep the sweet sleep of the just, only, however, to be rudely awak ened during the night to the conviction that a heavy rain storm had deluged their bed-chamber and converted their bed into a lake. The rest of tbe night they spent in a vain search for dry spots in their habitation. Early the next morning they began the construction of a better domicile, and by nightfall they had a decently comfortable log house. In that log cabin the three bachelors lived in delight ful harmony three years, and then, one of their number, Samuel Haight, marrying, \" bachelors' hall\" became a thing of the past. Aster the bachelors got their cabin up in good shape, it occurred to Jonathan Haight to go over to Knapp's chopping and see what the potato parings had yielded. That tbe parings had done exceedingly well was manifest in the sight of a fine-looking potato-patch, aud \" from this patch,\" says Jonathan Haight, \" we dug and carried to our cabin eighty bushels of excellent potatoes.\" After housing their potatoes and killing a few deer the bachelors set about the work of clearing land, and for three months worked so steadily and bravely that at the close of that time they had chopped 30 acres. Galloway's pioneer bread, made of salt, flour, and water, had a most extraordinary faculty for growing as hard as a stone aster being baked a little while, and when, one day, an Indian stole a half-loaf from the cabin during the ab sence of the bachelors, it was voted that no pursuit would be made of him, since any attempt on his part to eat the bread would recoil upon him with disastrous effect, and thus, poetically, his sin would be also his punishment. Jonathan Haight was laid up for a time with an axe wound, but, getting impatient at confinement, ventured out one day, although quite lame, to get a deer. He encount ered a fine buck and shot him, but when he sought to lay hold of him his buckship proved to be full of life, and ran away until he fell apparently exhausted in a \"cat-hole.\" Jonathan sought once more to drag him by the heels, when the animal showed fight. The hunter fled, aud the deer gave such hot chase that the crippled young man had hard work to escape from him. The buck, however, soon weak ened from loss of blood, and .ere long fell and gave up the ghost. In January, 1838, they returned together to Livingston County for a fresh supply of provisions, and, coming again to their bachelors' hall, in March, brought with them a pair of oxen and two cows. Aprbpos of these two cows, the bachelors found them a source of much vexation as well as comfort. The creatures wandered about, of course, at will, and at first had a bad habit of wandering back towards the country whence they had been brought. When upon re tiring at night the bachelors would hear the jingling of the"], [748, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 502 infant child and John Potts, journeyed together from Liv ingston County to Woodland, where the former had land on section 4, and the latter some on section 3. Their trip, at best a weary one through trackless woods, became on Christ mas day too dreary for expression when in a blinding snow storm they came to a halt several miles from the cabin of the Haights and Galloway, whither they were bound. They had cut their road from Portland, and for the most of the time had subsisted upon the milk of their cow, but on Christmas day they found themselves in a wooded maze out of which they could not well hew a thoroughfare. So they slept in the snow that night, or tried to sleep (for hunger and cold fought against comforting rest), and in the morning, leaving their oxen chained to a tree, set out afoot to find bachelor's hall, which they reached after a miserable tramp, and were heartily welcomed. Among the many recollections recalled by Mr. Galloway of life at bachelors' hall, is one that the bachelors used, on the warm summer days, to split rails stripped to the skin, for the work was so hard and the weather so hot that the knowledge of the fact that there was no one within miles of the locality readily suggested the comforting idea of getting along without such annoyances as clothes. Mr. Galloway recalls further that the first furrow made in Wood land was made by him on Samuel Haight's place, and, still further, the fact that when the bachelors went to Ionia to mill they cut out a road every step of the way, and, still further, that when one of a pair of steers broke his neck, the owners sent word to the settlers that beef was to be given away, and that the settlers came from far and near for the promised luxury, and carried it away with rejoicing and thankful hearts. Jordan Lake, near which Mr. Jordan lived, was a favorite resort for Indians, who gathered thereabout in great num bers to hunt and fish. During the spring and summer of 1842 they slew a great many deer, and left the carcasses to fester in the sun, from which troublesome odors arose in the land and much loud complaint went up upon all sides from white settlers. As before mentioned, the bachelors lived together until Samuel Haight married. The date of that incident was April 12, 1841, and Charlotte Brown, of Danby, Eaton Co., was the bride. She made her bridal-tour from Danby to her Woodland home upon an Indian pony, with no trappings upon him except a folded blanket in place of a saddle and a bark halter. Bachelors' hall received the newly-married pair, and there they made their home. Gal loway married, in 1843, one of Daniel Hager's daughters, and they, for their wedding-tour, walked through the woods from the home of the bride's father to the bridegroom's cabin, where their first meal was eaten from a table made of a barrel and a board. A AVAR-CLOUD. At this time a party of settlers, including John Potts, Isaac Hoyt, Orlien Jordan, J. A. Jordan, Jonathan Haight, Joseph Hager, William Hager, and H. H. Smoke, gathered upon the bank of Jordan Lake, where there was a party of Indians, one of whom was engaged in repairing a canoe. Potts had a hatchet in his hand, and when J. A. Jordan dared him to throw it at the Indian canoe-mender, to see how much he could scare him, Potts threw it at once, \u2014 glad to show his dislike for the savages, \u2014 and although he didn't hit the Indian he did hit the canoe, and badly damaged it. At this the Indians rose up to a man, and with angrily-flashing eyes grasped their weapons as if to take speedy vengeance for the offense. THE HAGERS. The next settlers in Woodland were the Hagers, who located upon section 36, in the spring of 1838. Daniel Hager came from Pennsylvania in the fall of 1837, to Eaton County, with a family often children, of whom seven were boys. Of the latter, William, Joseph, and Daniel, Jr., made settlements of their own upon section 36, in Wood land, in March, 1838. In their neighborhood fever and ague caused much tribulation and trouble. For three months the Hagers and everybody about them were so gen erally afflicted with the sickness that there were not enough well people to look after the sick ones, and when little Huldah Hager died, in October, 1838, there were but four people among all the Hager families well enough to assist at her burial. Into the southeast corner of the town directly after the Hagers came the Cooper brothers, \u2014 Allyn B. and J. H., \u2014 who located upon section 35, and at a little later date came also J. M. Cole, D. C. Sheldon, and J. Corsett. Potts and his brother pioneers became considerably alarmed, and prudently but slowly retired, fearing all the while that the savages would attack them, but bravely determined nevertheless to make a good fight should the issue come in that shape. The Indians did not, however, press the matter to a conflict, but they made many demon strations of anger, in Avhich it must be admitted they were fully justified. The incident served, nevertheless, to fan the fires of opposition to the red man already lighted by the public feeling about the deer carcasses, and as a result a council of citizens from Carlton, Woodland, Odessa, and Sunfield decided that the Indians must go. A com pany of twenty- five armed men being formed, with Moses Durkee in command, a march was made for the lake, where the Indians were met, and warned that their presence in the vicinity could no longer be tolerated. To this order they ventured to object, \u2014 at first mildly and then emphatically, \u2014 but Durkee and his men were resolved to make them go or fight, and when the savages were con vinced of this they went away, although very reluctantly. They came back aster that, but as they were not disturbed again it is presumed they took better care of their slain deer. THE JORDAN NEIGHBORHOOD. In the fall of 1838 the neighborhood south of Jordan Lake received its first settlers in Phineas Coe and family, who after tarrying two weeks with the three bachelors went over to their land, upon section 9. The Coes were, how ever, ill suited to Michigan pioneer life, and after strug gling two years or more gave up their arduous task. He eventually moved to California, and died there ; while she, a well-educated woman, went to New York City, and in aster-years became an attorney-at-law. In December, 1838, John A.

In April, 1837, he, Henry Lee, and Daniel Moors walked from Utica, in Macomb County, to Woodland to see the land, traveling one hundred and forty-four miles, mostly over the Indian trail between Pontiac and Grand Rapids, and going some times thirty-five miles \" between houses.\" door or window, and the fear of Mrs. Holmes that wolves would be sure to get at them through the blanketed open ings he remembers with a laugh. When he went to mill he carried an axe just as sure as he carried a grist, for every body on a journey in those days had to cut his own road. Two of Mr. Holmes' children went out one afternoon to look up the family cows, and, not returning by nightfall, there was an alarm, and the neighbors speedily gathered with horns and lanterns to hunt for the lost ones. An eager but protracted search discovered the little ones asleep upon a bed of leaves. They said they went \" around and round,\" and when they sound they were lost resolved to say their prayers, go to sleep, and in the morning try to find their way home. Their first night on Jordan's place was spent in camp under a tree which held three bear-cubs. They kept a watch-fire all night to keep off the old bear, and slew the cubs in the morning. Mr. Jordan returned at once with his compan ions to Utica, and did not come to Woodland for a perma nent settlement until 1841, when he found already on the ground John A. Jordan on section 4, H. H. Smoke, David Hyatt, and John Potts on section 3, and Phineas Coe on section 9. Settlements in that portion of the town were at first slowly made, but in moderately rapid succes sion came Reuben Haight in 1842, George N. Meyers, Z. B. Meyers, Samuel Meyers, John Meyers, John Otto, L. W. Otto, David Hough, and Parsons Hall. An Indian chief called Sobba called on Mr. Holmes and said he wanted to trade a pony for a yoke of steers. Upon being asked where his pony was, he replied, \" Oh, off in the woods somewhere.\" \" But I can't trade that way,\" said Mr. Holmes. \" I must see your pony.\" \" Well,\" replied Sobba, \"the pony is in the woods: you give me the steers and hunt the pony ; you'll find him.\" Sobba thought it hard that he couldn't make a bargain as he pro posed. Upon another occasion Sobba called at Holmes' house, and, there happening to be a female visitor, he said, \" Mr. Holmes, these your two squaws ?\" \" Oh, no,\" said Holmes ; \" one is all I can take care of.\" \" Dm I\" grunted the chief. \" I thought you had two, and I wanted to trade my squaw for one of them.\" THE HOLMES NEIGHBORHOOD. Levi Holmes walked from Detroit, in 1842, to Woodland to look at some land he had bought on section 29, and walked east again as far as Jackson. In 1843 he brought his family to his Michigan wilderness and settled them temporarily in a shanty on Jesse Townseud's farm, in sec tion 30, where Mr. Townsend had begun to pioneer in July, 1838. In that shanty, Mr. Holmes humorously remarks, it didn't rain very much more than it did out of doors, \" except in places.\" Richard Youngs and his son Samuel were on section 30. Section 29 was an unbroken wilder ness, and on section 20 was Chas. Palmerton, whose brother Jerome was on section 17. Upon section 17, too, Lawrence Shriner had been living since 1839. John McArthur, a settler in Ann Arbor in 1834, had made a start on section 20 in January, 1843, and near him on the same section was Sylvester McDerby. Into the Holmes neighborhood, soon aster 1843, came, among other settlers, George Demond, Samuel Durkee, J. N. Curtiss, and James Swin ; and north of there, at a later date, S. V. Anway, Ira Stowell, G. W. Rising, and J. G. Flowers. Four years before Mr. Holmes, or in 1839, Alonzo Barnum and Orrin Wellman settled on section 34 and Edward Bump on section 27. Asa Wheeler was a settler, in 1840, upon section 27, and in the same year, on section 26, Miner Mallett became his neighbor. Isaac Barnum came to section 27 in 1842, and in that year Ebenezer Sawdy located on section 15, his nearest neighbor then being Nehemiah Lovewell, on section 22. When Ira Ingersen settled upon section 22, in 1845, he found there, besides LoA'ewell, also Melvin Barnum. Some years aster, George Cramer settled in section 27, upon land occupied by George Davenport in 1855. Lawrence Shriner, mentioned above, was an eccentric old fellow. He had been a canal-boatman and was rough and tough, but good-natured. He used to say that he knew sap was got from trees by squeezing them with log-chains, but he couldn't make sugar, because he didn't know how to stop the sap when it got started. He would loan his ox-team when called upon, but never unless the borrower would solemnly pledge himself to whip the off-ox merci lessly. He would often start for mill through the woods at sundown, and was in short always doing something odd, and constantly surprising his neighbors with some queer freak. THE GERMAN COMMUNITY What is known as the \" German community\" in Wood land was founded, in 1846, by Michael Rowlader, who came to the township in September of that year, and made, with his family, a settlement upon section 14, where at the same time John H. Dillenbeck and Thaddeus Houghton also located. Mr. Rowlader and the married sons who came with him brought families whose numbers aggregated 17. Their first night in Woodland was spent at the house of Alonzo Barnum, who himself had a family of seven, and in Barnum's log cabin, boasting but one apartment, the 24 people slept that night, and closer quarters no pioneers were perhaps ever called upon to occupy. Holmes was sorely discouraged soon after he settled. The rain poured into his shanty and made life therein a misery, work was hard, provisions were scarce, and, to cap the climax, he wounded himself so severely while putting up his log house that he was forced to take to his bed. \" Had I had money enough to go,\" says he, \" I would have gone back to New York and stayed there, but money wasn't to be had, and I could do nothing but stay and make the best of it.\" He moved his family into his log house before it had either There was no other settlement by Germans until 1852, when Jacob Felta made his home upon section 23, Chris-"], [752, "504 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

Admitting the truth of the statements as to the Hager child, she was not only the first-born of white children in Woodland, but was also the first to die therein, and the first to be buried in the township. There are extant no public records of the births and deaths of that time, and, as the parents of both of the children have passed away, the surest evidence upon the disputed points is not available. The best living witness is Mrs. Charles Galloway, who declares that Huldah Hager was the first. As she was a sister of Joseph Hager, and was a young lady at the time, she Avould naturally recollect the facts, and there is every reason for considering her statement correct. tian Berkley upon section 14, and Conrad Hanes upon sec tion 15, the three families having come to the toAvnship in company. Shortly after that the Germans came in rapidly. Among those coming earliest were the families of Michael Reiser and his son Jacob, J. F. Smith, Mr. Neidhammer, Jacob Funk, A. Baetinger, John Cramer, Gottfried Bisler, J. G. Swartz, George Hitt, M. Schwitzer, J. Buling, the Schaibleys, Bayhas, Schulers, Wagners, Bitzas, Eckhardts, Rhineharts, Broadbecks, Fenders, Entzes, and Metzgers. THE \"CANADA\" SETTLEMENT. The northwest corner of Woodland, known as Canada, by reason of many of the settlers being Canadians, was first occupied in 1844 by James Matthews and his sons, who came hither from Kalamazoo County, chopped 40 acres on section 0, and lived there in a log cabin about a year, when all returned to Kalamazoo. There the elder Matthews died, and the sons, not caring to continue in the pioneer business, sold the land to George Myers, who came out in 1849, and made the first permanent settlement in \" Canada.\" Fol lowing him the settlers in the neighborhood were Welling ton Curtis, Albert Main, John M. Curtis, P. Cunningham, David Smith, Allen Lipscomb, and Henry Bower. The first funeral sermon heard in Woodland was preached in 1841, by Rev. Mr. Worthington, preacher in charge on the Hastings Methodist Episcopal Circuit, at the house of Miner Mallett, on the occasion of the death of the wife of J. W. Buckle, of Hastings. The text of that sermon is remembered to have been taken from Job xvi. 22. Mrs. Buckle was visiting her sister, Mrs. Mallett, at the time of her death, and was buried on Mr. Mallett's farm. She was doubtless the first adult person to die in the town. THE KILPATRICKS. The Kilpatrick neighborhood, on section 24, was first settled in 1847, when John Kilpatrick, his Aviso, and nine children came to the township to occupy land bought by John Kilpatrick, Jr., in 1844. When John, Jr., first went to the place he found himself two days making the trip from Joseph Shore's place, on section 35, to the Kilpatrick place, on section 24, with an ox-team, his roads having to be cut and his bridges having to be built as he went along. John, Jr., built upon section 24, in 1854, a hewn log saw mill, the pioneer one in Woodland. It seemed a late day for a pioneer saw-mill, but water-power was not plentiful there, and, as saw-mills were near at hand in neighboring townships, the Woodland settlers were not so anxious for one as were early settlers in other townships. Joel St. John now carries on a mill on the site of the one built by Kilpatrick. The first marriage was that of Rhoda Wellman. of Wood land, to Oliver Racey, of Castleton. The happy event took place in the house of the bride's father, in the year 1841. The second marriage was that of Joanna Welhnan to Ed ward Bump. The first public burying-ground laid out in the township was given a place upon J. A. Jordan's farm, in section 4, where it still serves its original purpose. The first burial therein was that of Martha Ann, daughter of John Potts, Sept. 19, 1846. The first grown person buried there is believed to have been Moses Wadleigh, who, in 1848, was killed by the fall of a tree. Similarly, the first person (Ira Ingersen) buried in the second cemetery laid out in the township, on section 27, was killed while riding to mill upon a load of saw-logs, which were overturned and crushed him. The date of the casualty was Jan. 27, 1853. THE GLORIOUS FOURTH. The first Fourth of July celebration in Woodland was held at Asa Wheeler's house in 1844. on which occasion about 200 people, from five towns, enjoyed themselves with a picnic, listened to an oration delivered by I. A. Holbrook, of Hastings, fired occasional patriotic salutes with a mounted musket-barrel, aud had a glorious time generally. The second celebration was held in 1845, at Jordan Lake, on section 4, when lawyer Jennings, of Hastings, was the orator, he and his wife having ridden out on horseback to the merrymaking. In 1865, Samuel Perkins was killed by a fallino* tree, and in 1876, Edwin Maples, while logging, met with an accidental death. In 1869 a party of pleasure-seekers, in cluding Alonzo and Estella Otto, Miss Melissa Simmons, and a Miss Spalding,\u2014 the latter of Kalamazoo, \u2014 were boat ing on Jordan Lake. While their merriment was at its height Miss Spalding fell from her place into the water, and, although she was promptly rescued, the confusion incident upon the restoration was so great that no sooner had she been landed safely in the boat than the little craft cap sized, and of the six persons therein, the four already named were drowned. In June, 1852, Edward Lovewell went out upon Jordan Lake to fish, and in an unlucky moment fell from his canoe, and was drowned. THE FIRST BIRTH, MARRIAGE, Etc. As to the first birth in town there appear to be conflict ing opinions. Generally, it is understood that the distinc tion of \" first-born in Woodland\" belongs to Jesse Jordan, now living on section 28. The date of his birth was Sept. 29, 1839, and the place his father's farm, on section 4. On the other hand, it is stoutly maintained by many, and with good reason, that the first child born in the town Avas EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. The pioneer school of Woodland was a subscription school, taught in 1841 by Hattie Bidwell, of Battle Creek, at Mr. Wellman's house, in the Wheeler district.

She taught the school three montlts, and had among her pupils, besides her own children, those of the Malletts, Wheelers, and Wellmans. much all over the county. The third Woodland doctor was John W. Gaucher, whose period of service was from 1359 to 1865. The first physician to locate at the village was Dr. A. S. Brandt, who came hither in 1862 and lest in 1864. R. B. Rawson came in 1864 and remained until 1374. Iu 1865 Dr. Henry Smith became one of the village physicians, and continued to be one until 1873. Dr. David Kilpatrick now practices in the village, where he has been a physician since 1866, and there, too, Dr. H. C. Carpenter has been in practice since 1871. As to other physicians, apart from the foregoing, Dr. Driscoll was in the village from 1868 to 1871 ; Charles Russell, from 1876 to 1879 ; Henry Tremain, from 1874 to 18J7 ; Dr. Turner, about six months in 1876 ; and Dr. Johnson six months in 1879. School district No. 1 was formed May 9, 1842, and included sections 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, and the west half of section 35. No. 2 was organized June 8, 1842, aud contained sections 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11. Fractional district No. 2 was organized Sept. 2, 1845, and included portions of Carlton, Castleton, and Hastings, with section 31 and the west half of section 32 in Woodland. May 28, 1842, fractional district No. 1 was formed, to embrace portions of Sunfield, Vermontville, and Woodland. Fractional district No. 3, formed Oct. 26, 1844, included portions of Castle ton and Woodland. District No. 3 was organized in 1845, and that winter Matilda Ingersen taught the first school there, receiving for her services the sum of seventy-five cents a week. In the Wheeler district, the teacher next following Hattie Bidwell was Electa Lee, of Ionia County. ORGANIZATION AND OFFICERS. Under an act of the Legislature approved Feb. 16, 1842 , town 4 north, in range 7 west, was set off from Hastings township and called Woodland, the name being bestowed as appropriate to a town densely covered with heavy timber.

The pioneer resident physician of Woodland was Dr. Jackson Wicks, who lived on section 15 and practiced medicine in the township from 1850 to his death, in 1861. Dr. Joseph Adolphus lived for a while north of the present village, and practiced from 1852 to 1855.

In 1849 the Woodland post office was established, and the appointment of postmaster given to Nehemiah Lovewell. Ebenezer Sawdy was the earliest mail-carrier, and at first brought the mail from Odessa afoot once a week in his vest-pocket or a handker chief, as happened to be most convenient. There was, how ever, some protest against that method of transporting the United States mail, and at the end of six months a mail pouch was provided. The succession of postmasters after Mr. Lovewell was A. B. Cooper, 1854; Lawrence Hilbert, 1861; Asa Pike, 1863; Milo T. Wheeler, 1865; Milo Barnum, 1868; Lawrence Hilbert, 1870; Ward Shriner, 1870 ; J.G. Meyers, 1873; S. S. Haight, 1874 ; David Kil patrick, 1875. Mail is received from Hastings three times a week. THE VOTERS OF 1843. At a special election in April, 1843, for associate judge of the Circuit Court, the votes cast in Woodland numbered fifteen, as follows : S. Haight, Jonathan Haight, C. Pal merton, D. Hyatt, S. S. Haight, R. Youngs, H. H. Smoke, A. Wheeler, P. Hall, Nehemiah Lovewell, J. A. Jordan, O. Wellman, J. Potts, E. Bump, E. Bennett. THE VOTERS OF 1844. At the annual election in 1844 the voters were 40 in number, as follows: Isaac Barnum, Melvin C. Barnum, D. Hyatt, P. Hall, J. Hyatt, O. Jordan, J. Haight, J. McArthur, J. Palmerton, E. Sawdy, C.

Coates Grove Post-office, on the south town-line, at which George Coates is postmaster, was established in 1879. Blair Post-office, in the southeast, was established about 1858. J. M. Cole served as postmaster several years, when the office was moved into Castleton. Returning to Wood land, it was given in charge of Mahlon Cooper, and in 1878 was discontinued. RELIGIOUS HISTORY. Probably the first public religious worship in Woodland was held at the house of Alonzo Barnum, in 1839 or 1840, when, in the presence of a few neighbors, Mr. Barnum con ducted the services, which included a prayer and a brief ser mon. Elder Hess, of Portland, visited Woodland about then, and held meetings at settlers' houses occasionally. Alonzo Barnum was an exceedingly diligent and zealous man in religious affairs, and labored earnestly from the period of his arrival in the settlement for the advancement of the cause of public piety. In the winter of 1839 he heard of the presence, in Mrs. John Potts, on section 4, of a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and went over to see her, promptly organizing a prayer-meeting in her house, the first ever held in the township. THE VOTERS OF 1845. The voters at the annual election in 1845 were 44, all told. They were James A. Galloway, Richard Hyatt, H. H. Smoke, David Hyatt, George Dennen, Samuel S. Durkee, Miner Mallett, Orvill Wheeler, John McArthur, Richard Youngs, John A. Jordan, Isaac Hoyt, H. L. Wheeler, A. B. Cooper, Asa Wheeler, Warren Wickham, S. McMurray, E.

The members were five in number, and the house of worship was Alonzo Barnum's residence. Since then re ligion has flourished apace in Woodland, and boasts to-day in the township twice as many temples as it can find in any other town in the county. THE JURORS IN 1845, '46, AND '47. In 1845 the grand jurors chosen were Charles Gallo way, S. S. Haight, A. B. Cooper, M. T. Wheeler, Charles Palmerton, and H. H. Smoke. The petit jurors were Clinton Sheldon, M. C. Barnum, John McArthur, O. Jor dan, J. M. Cole, and Daniel Hager. As before remarked, Alonzo Barnum was a man of re markable religious zeal.

Elder Bates preached about three years to April 1, 1879, since which time the church has been without a pastor. \"Sunday, June 14, 1841, town of Hastings, Barry Co., Michigan State. \u2014 Glory to God for his goodness and mercy to me and my little family ! Though my pen has long been silent through a multitude of cares and perplexities, yet my Lord has been with me. In the year 1839, in the month of November, I moved to Michigan, Barry Co., town ship of Hastings. But few inhabitants and all woods, no society, and no meetings of any kind held in the township twelve miles square. In consequence of this I lost much ground. I left the bosom of a good society in which I lived ten years. I now felt the loss of brethren. In the summer of 1840 I proposed to my neighbors to come together, and I would read a sermon of AVesley's to them, and we would spend an hour in worshiping the Lord who made us. The people seemed very willing, and on the Sabbath we met for the first time. The church is attached to the Lansing Quarterly Meet ing, and has a membership of 13. The trustees are J. R.

At the request of Rev. H. T. Fero there was a meeting at the house of Ira Ingersen, May 13, 1846, to discuss the project of organizing a Baptist Church in Woodland. At a subsequent meeting, July 11, 1846, Elders H. T. Fero and Samuel Lamb being present, the organization was effected with the following members: H. H. Smoke, Thirza Jane Smoke, Isaac Barnum, Roxey Barnum, Amos Wheeler, Wealthy Wheeler, Heman Dodge, Sarah Ingersen, Henry Barnum, Nancy Palmerton, E. P. Barnum, Almira Wheeler, John Barnum. In the church council were representatives from the churches of Ionia, Lyons, Kalamazoo, and Rock saud. Heman Dodge Avas chosen clerk, and Isaac Barnum deacon. AVOODLAND METHODIST EPISCOPAL ENGLISH CHURCH. The Woodland Methodist Episcopal class now worship ing at Woodland Centre was organized in the Galloway school-house in 1847 by the preacher in charge of the Hastings Circuit. The organizing members were John H. Dillenbeck and wife, Charles Galloway and wife, Pattie Rogers, and Mrs. J. W. T. Orr, Charles Galloway being chosen class-leader. In 1860 the class removed its place of worship to the school-house at the centre, and there a house of worship was erected in 1871, and dedicated in August of that year. The class is attached to Woodland Circuit, in charge of Rev. J. F. Orwick, who preaches at the centre once in two weeks. The membership is 42. The class-leader is William P. Hawley; the assistant class leader, John H. Dillenbeck. The trustees are J. W. Stinehcomb, C. A. Hough, George W. Smith, and William P. Hawley. The Sunday-school, in charge of Burt. S. Hawley and eight teachers, has an average attendance of 90 scholars. Among the early pastors were Elders Lamb, Tompkins, Pillsbury, Munger, and Gould, among the later ones Elders Bassett, Wheelock, Monroe, and Burgess, the latter being now the pastor in charge. J. P. Holbrook is now the deacon, and B. F. Densmore the clerk. The church mem bership is 34. Services are held in the Free-Will Baptist church once a fortnight. The two Baptist Churches have a Union Sunday-school, which has regular Sunday sessions, winter and summer. S. S. Iugersen is the superintendent. The average attend ance is 53, and the number of teachers employed eight. AVOODLAND METHODIST EPISCOPAL (GERMAN) CHCRCH. A German Methodist Episcopal class was formed about 1855, in the Galloway school-house, and included the fam ilies of Jacob Felta, George Hitt, Conrad Hanes, and Gott fried Risler, Risler being chosen class-leader. Rev. Jacob Krebil, the first pastor, preached two years, and, following him, supplies were furnished from Grand Rapids once in two weeks for some years. The church struggled feebly for a long period and gathered strength slowly. Meetings were held in the Galloway school-house until 1871, when the Methodist Episcopal (English) church at the centre was occupied. In 1870 the German Society built a hand some church edifice at the centre, and enjoys now a season of considerable prosperity. FREE-AVILL BAPTIST CHURCH. On the 12th of March, 1807, a meeting was held at the house of David Eastman, for the purpose of organizing the Free-Will Baptist Society of Woodland, when James Tyler, Jeremiah Filley, and William Root were elected trustees. Previous to that date, on Feb. 9, 1867, in the Gordon school-house, Elders Santee and Tupper had organized the church, under authorization from the Grand River Quarterly Meeting, assisted by Elder G. W. Moffit, who had sor a week or more been holding a series of meetings. On that occasion those received into church fellowship were James Tyler, William Root, Ann Root, Lucien Nichols, Caroline Eastman, Deborah Roosa, and Delia Roosa. William Root was chosen clerk.

In 1871 this class was joined by a class organized some years previous in Michael Rowlader's house by Rev. Mr. Kennard. AVESLEYAN METHODIST CHURCH. A Wesleyan Methodist class was organized in the Cheney school-house, Carlton, in 1858, by Elder Tapley, with 15 or 20 members, and after a time a portion of the class was transferred to the Canada sehool-house. In 1874, Elder Clark held a revival meeting at that point, and since then services have been held regularly once in two weeks. The class is on the Woodland Circuit, in charge of Elder Tap ley, has a membership of 10, and is under the leadership of Samuel Campbell. Worship is now held in the school house, but measures are afoot for the speedy erection near there of a church building. In the \" Canada\" settlement is the Third United Breth ren or \"Tamarack\" church, which was built in 1878, and in which now worships the United Brethren class formed by Elder A. Miller in 1860, in the \" Canada\" school-house. The organizing members were H. B. Lipscomb, leader ; David Smith, steAvard ; Annie Lipscomb, Balsar King, Jacob G. King, exhorter ; Hugh Dodd, Miles Lipscomb, Angeline Lipscomb, Margaret Dodd, Polly A. Haskins, Anna Curtiss, Ferington Todd, Mary J. Mclnarie, Nancy Mclnarie, William Sears, and Fanny Sears. Since 1860 there has been preaching once in two weeks. Rev. Wil liam N. Briedenstein is the preacher in charge, Randy Lipscomb is the class-leader, Jacob Bear, Calvin Demary, .and Ezra Pierce the trustees, Norton Rainssord the class steward, and Dennis Haskill the Sunday-school superin tendent. The church is exceedingly prosperous, and has a membership of 80. GERMAN BAPTIST CHURCH. The German Baptists, now worshiping in a church on the south town-line and in the Galloway school-house, were organized into a church at Enos Crowell's house by elders Isaac Miller and George Long, and at organization num bered about 30 members. Enos Crowell, I. N. Miller, and Saml. Smith were chosen deacons, and Elder Isaac Miller the pastor. Elder Miller has continued in the pas torate from the first, and preaches now once a month in each place, \u2014 the school-house and the church. Enos Crow ell and Henry Smith are now the deacons, and Alexander Price and David Flora \" speakers in the first degree.\" The church membership is 45. GERMAN LUTHERAN CHURCH. About the year 1856 the German Lutherans in Wood land began to hold religious meetings in the Galloway school-house, and aster that at the houses of Michael Reiser and others. The worshipers included the Reiser, Baetinger, Berkley, Mauch, Metzger, Richart, Schmidt, Swartz, Smith, and Neidhammer families. Rev. Mr. Folz, of Lansing, the first minister, preached once in six weeks for a year, and then Rev. Adam Berkly, of Lansing, entered upon a pastorate which lasted upwards of ten years, during which he preached once a month. Upon Mr. Berkly's departure the members of the church built a parsonage and engaged Rev. Mr. Duhring as their first stationed pastor, who preached for them each Sunday. His successors have UNITED BRETHREN CHURCHES. The first church edifice erected in Woodland was built by the members of the Meyers United Brethren class, on section 3, about 1852. The class was organized June 30, 1850, with 6 members, as follows : George N. Meyers, class leader ; Ziba B. Meyers, class-steward ; Mary Meyers, Eliza beth Meyers, John Meyers, and Catherine Meyers. July 31, 1852, the class had a membership of 22, and was a point in the Barry mission, in charge of William Ken nard, missionary. The class has now a membership of 40, and is attached to Barry Circuit, on Avhich the preacher in charge is Rev. William N. Briedenstein, who preaches at the Meyers church once in two weeks. Jacob King is superintendent of the Sunday-school, which has 48 schol ars and five teachers. The class-leader is Silas Meyers, and the trustees are Emanuel Cramer, Silas Meyers, and Philip Davis. been Revs. Klein and Charles Adams, the latter of whom has been in charge since 1872. A church was built on section 10 in 1802. The Sunday-school in charge of Jacob Reiser has an average attendance of 40 scholars. The first trustees of the church were M. Baetinger, C. Bayha, and J. G. Swartz. The present trustees are Adam Baetinger, Jacob Funk, and George Mauch. The elders are Jacob Reiser and Jacob Mall. EA'ANGELICAL (GERMAN) CHURCH. The Kilpatrick United Brethren class was organized in the Kilpatrick neighborhood about 1856, and was at first chiefly composed of members of the Kilpatrick families, George Kilpatrick being the class-leader. The class was on a circuit that reached from Charlotte, in Eaton County, to Cascade, in Kent County, and was able to have preaching only once a month. Meetings were held in the Kilpatrick school-house until 1871, when the present house of worship was built. The class is now on the Castleton Circuit, in charge of Rev. Isaac Maurer, and meets for yvorshjp once a fortnight. Tbe class-leader is A. G. Kil- About 1860, Rev. Mr. Geiger was delegated by the Indiana Conference to organize an evangelical church in Woodland, and he formed accordingly two classes, \u2014 one at the Meyers church, and one at the red sehool-house. Among the families represented by the organizing mem bers were those of the Millers, Wagners, Schulers, Bayhas, Rowladers, Eckardts, Entz, Smiths, Schaibleys, and Feltas'. In 1861 the erection of a church edifice upon section 12 was begun, but the work was not finished until 1866, about which time both classes were consolidated. The membership is now about 40. Rev.

There is at the centre of the township a smart little vil lage, Avhich has been growing of late as if its vigor were just beginning to make itself felt, and which, with a railway through, would rapidly become a business point of no trifling importance. The citizens have recognized this fact, and more than one effort has been made to have a railway line through the township, but, beyond the surveys of two or three proposed routes, nothing has yet been accom plished. Just now there is some talk of a railway between Grand Rapids and Lansing, via Woodland, but how it will eventuate remains to be seen. SECRET SOCIETIES. AVOODLAND LODGE, No. 304, F. AND A. M., was organized Aug. 29, 1871, and chartered Jan. 11, 1872. The first officers chosen were John P. Phillips, W. M. ; Wm. H. Lee, S. W. ; S. S. Ingersen, J. W. ; Lawrence Hilbert, Treas. ; D. B. Coville, Sec. ; Samuel Stowell, S. D. ; C. A. Hough, J. D. John P. Phillips was Worshipful Master continuously until June, 1875, when Wm. P. Haw ley was chosen, and he was in turn followed by John P. Phillips, the present Master. The lodge has now a mem bership of 62, and is a flourishing organization. The first location near the present village site was made in 1847 by John McArthur, who then moved to the place on section 21 he now occupies. The centre of the town ship was then a wilderness, which was first intruded upon by Nicholas Snyder, who, about 1849, set up a blacksmith shop, which he carried on until 1854, and then sold to Melchior Baetinger, who still occupies the site and still devotes it to its original use. In 1853, Stephen Haight, a carpenter and joiner, located upon the present site of the village, and there has since continued to live. Presently along came one Jacob Strauss, a Hebrew peddler, with a pack on his back, who, concluding that the centre invited the attention of a resident trader, rented a log house pre viously occupied by Snyder, the blacksmith, as a residence, \u2014 diagonally opposite the shop, \u2014 stocked it with a handful of goods, and launched out as the pioneer merchant of Woodland Centre. Strauss' advent occurred in 1853, and shortly after his coming he engaged Stephen Haight to build for him a framed residence, \u2014 the first framed house erected in that locality. The present officers are J. P. Phillips, W. M. ; W. II. Lee, S.W.; S. S. Ingersen, J. W. ; Lawrence Hilbert, Treas. ; C. A. Hough, Sec. ; J. Schaibley, S. D. ; George W. Smith, J. D. ; C. H. Snyder, Tyler. AVOODLAND CHAPTER, ORDER OF THE EASTERN STAR, was organized Feb. 19, 1880. Mrs. Ellen Carpenter is the Matron ; W. H. Lee, Patron ; and Mrs. Frank Stowell, Assistant Matron. The membership is 23. WOODLAND LODGE, No. 289, I. 0. 0. F., was instituted Feb. 5, 1877, with the following members: O. P. Abbott, N. G. ; George Barden, V. G. ; Henry Stinchcomb, P. S. ; John Stevens, Treas. ; Michael Rupe, Warden ; John Valentine, I. G. Strauss did not find the volume of trade to his liking, and at the end of a year or so departed with his goods. Booth & Chapin, of Lowell, followed him as traders, and to them succeeded Lederer & Cookingham, but neither firm discovered inducements sufficiently strong to call sor a long stay, and thus the early commercial history of Woodland Centre partook of a changeable character. In 1859, when the field of trade lay unoccupied, a Mr. Richardson, of Hastings, engaged Ira Stowell and Stephen Haight to build him a framed store in Woodland Centre, on the present \" post-office corner.\" This store Richardson filled with a decent stock of goods, but he failed to make a success of his venture, and gave it up at the end of a year. Solomon Goodyear, of Hastings, rented the building of Richardson, and brought out two loads of goods, but was discouraged at the prospect of gain in so thin a neighborhood, and without unloading his wagons ordered them back to Hastings. He straightway sold his lease to Lawrence Hilbert, who, in 1860, reopened the place, and, unlike his predecessors, stuck to the business, and made a success of it ; having continued in trade at the centre to this day, and having ever since his adA'ent been the leading merchant of the town. Since the organization of the lodge the office of Noble Grand has been filled by 0. P. Abbott, G. D. Barden, Wesley Meyers, D. B. Cooper, Joshua Glenn, Andrew Carpenter, and C. S. Palmerton. The present membership is 43. The officers are C. S. Palmerton, N. G. ; James Black, V. G. ; Eugene Davenport, Sec. ; F. P. Palmerton, P. Sec. ; Douglas B. Cooper, Treas. AVOODLAND LODGE, No. 817, I. 0. G. T., was chartered Jan. 6, 1875. The charter was issued to H. C. Carpenter, W. C. T. ; Mrs. H. C. Carpenter, W. V. T. ; J. W. Stinchcomb, W. C. ; C. A. Hough, W.

After 1800 the village began to exhibit some improve ment. Henry Bauer followed Hilbert with a second store, which he kept in a 10 by 15 shanty, and carried on about three months. Barnum & Eastman came in and made a bid for trade, but at the end of a year their establishment was consumed by fire, and they closed their experience at"], [764, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 510 LEVI HOLMES. the centre. In 1866 the hamlet had got along so far that Jonathan Haight, Lawrence Hilbert, and John McArthur, owners of property thereabout, platted a village there. In 1874 they made an addition. As remarked at an earlier stage, Woodland Centre is now a place of some pretensions. Its business interests are represented by two general stores, a hardware-store, drug-store, shoe-store, two millinery-stores, grocery-store, etc. In manufactures it has a grist-mill, saw-mill, oar-factory, cheese-factory, and wagon-shops. Isaac, the father of Levi Holmes, was a native of New York, and by trade a harness-maker ; married a Miss Losee, had by her eight children, Levi, the subject of our sketch, being the seventh, and born in 1811. At an early age Levi was hired out by his father as a common farm-laborer, and remained in that condition until he was about twenty-one years old. Then he began life for himself, continuing in the same employment, working for Mr. Philo Reed, a farmer in Dutchess Co., N. Y. By economy and industry he was, in 1843, enabled to buy of his employer one hundred and sixty acres of wild land in Michigan, where he now resides. He came during the same year to improve his purchase, first building a log hut. In 1858 he built the residence he now occupies, which is one of the best in the township. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES. JOHN KILPATRICK. John Kilpatrick, a view of whose home appears upon another page of this Avork, was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, May 12, 1820, and the eldest in a family of eleven children. He lived at home until June 8, 1842, when he set sail for that land of promise of which so many longing hearts in the Old World dream, \u2014 America. After a month's tossing on the broad Atlantic, he found himself in New York City, literally a stranger in a strange land. Leaving the city be hind him, he found himself in Monroe County, where he went to work on a farm by the year, afterwards buying a quarter-section of wild land in Michigan from the man he worked for, and in the summer of 1847 sent for his father, who sold what little property he possessed in Scotland and brought his family to Rochester, N. Y., where John met them, and together they came to Michigan. They built a house on his land and lived together about one year, when his father, John (Senior) built a house on land he had bought, and where he resided until his death, Avhieh oc curred March 14, 1869, when he was seventy-one years of age. His wife, Janet, survived him until Oct. 22, 1878, aged eighty-one. In 1844 he was elected supervisor, serving one year, then one year as town clerk, and as justice of the peace for six teen years. Has also been highway commissioner, and for several years school director. In 1835, at Amenia, Dutchess Co., he married Miss Lois Toug, of New Milford, Conn. They have reared eight children, all living to-day. Mr. Holmes is known as a zealous churchman ; has been a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church all his life in Woodland, and during that time has acted as local preacher some five years. Has been class-leader during his entire church experience. In 1874 the church known as the Holmes church was erected. This church has been freely endowed by Mr. Holmes ; in fact, he is its chief supporter, and to his efforts and money the church is chiefly indebted tor its existence. Mr. Holmes' life has been eminently upright and pure, temperate in all things, using neither liquors nor tobacco, and devoting his spare time, energies, abilities, and means towards the advancement and betterment of many of bis neighbors and fellow-citizens. John, the subject of our sketch, was married Feb. 29, 1852, to Eunice Wilson, a native of New York. To this marriage were born John Bruce, Sept. 1, 1853, died May 18, 1856, and Mary E., born Sept. 9, 1857, who died Feb. 7, 1858. The wife and mother soon followed, departing this life Dec. 7, 1858. GEORGE M. DAVENPORT Solomon Courtright, the great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was of English origin and a resident of New Jersey all his life, and a soldier in the Revolutionary army. Nov. 2, 1859, Mr. Kilpatrick married Miss Margaret Hagar, whose people were very early settlers in this State. Two children were born to them, \u2014 Mary A., born Aug. 6, 1860, died Sept. 10,, 1861 ; aud Andrew O, born Nov. 21, 1862. Again Mr. Kilpatrick was afflicted by the loss of his wife, which occurred Nov. 30, 1863. Martin Davenport was his grandfather on his father's side, of German descent, and also a resident of New Jersey. His grandmother was Catharine Courtright. His father, Alanson Davenport, born in New Jersey in 1807, was by occupation a farmer. His mother was Eliza (Meddaugh) Davenport, and born in 1806. July 16, 1865, he was for the third time married, this wife, Mrs. Mary Shaffer, having lost her husband in the army. They are the parents of the following children, \u2014 Samuel, born May 17, 1868, died Aug. 8, 1870 ; David A., born Aug. 14, 1870, died Sept. 8, 1871 ; Jesse, born Jan. 2, 1873 ; Viola, born May 26, 1875 ; and John Hays, born Jan. 17, 1877. We have thus briefly sketched the genealogy of Mr. Davenport as giving evidence in itself of the sterling quali ties which our subject in nature possesses. Geor\u00ab*e M. was the eldest in his father's family of eight children, and born in Caroline, Tompkins Co., N. Y., March 3, 1828. He, to use a common expression, worked out a good part of his time until twenty-one years of age, giving his wages to his father. Then he began to learn the carpenter and joiner's trade; came to Michigan, June 10, 1855, locating In polities Mr. Kilpatrick is a Republican ; started as a Free-Soiler ; has held several town offices.

He had previously married in Ohio, where she then resided, Miss Hester Sutton. They have had one child, Eugene Davenport, born to them. A view of the old log hut where he was born may be seen in the sketch of Mr. Davenport's resi dence, which appears upon another page. Eugene now resides at home ; was educated at the agricultural college at Lansing, where he pursued his studies for four years and graduated. He has purchased a half-interest in his father's property, and together they propose to put into practice the principles of business and scientific knowledge he has acquired. Their farm is under a high state of cultivation, while the house is said to be one of the best, if not the best, in the township, and was built by Mr. G. M. Daven port himself. The family is an unusually harmonious one, working together in all things. None of them arc mem bers of any church, but have a wide reputation for lib erality, aud as citizens and neighbors are kind and obliging. Mr. Davenport is one of those men who will overcome any and all obstacles to meet his obligations ; and by this and his business qualifications has established a reputation of un doubted credit, which has assisted greatly in his material prosperity. emplary conduct, being of good habits, honorable in his dealings with his fellow-man, and conscientious in all things. STEPHEN S. INGERSON. Stephen S. Ingerson can trace his lineage from the Bid wells, of England, his grandfather, George Bidwell, being a native of Connecticut, and a Revolutionary soldier. In 1784 moved his family and household goods to Starksboro', Vt., being the first settler in that township. Here Sarah Bidwell was born, Jan. 4, 1795, and on the 10th of October, 1813, married Ira Ingerson, also a native of Ver mont. This union was productive of nine children, of whom our subject was the youngest, and born in Hunting ton, Vt., July 3, 1835. Here he lived until five years of age, when they removed to Monkton, Vt. Then, in 1845, came with his parents to his present home, where his father purchased one hundred and sixty acres of wild land and began the clearing necessary to the planting of crops, etc. From the age of six to sixteen, Stephen spent about one half of his time in the district school ; his father, being determined to educate his children, used to work at shoe making until after midnight in order to keep them in school and pay their bills. In consequence, all his children received a liberal education, although he three times lost his property through the dishonesty of others. He was accidentally killed while on his way to a saw-mill, some three miles distant, with a load of logs, the ox-team which he was driving turning out of the road for water to drink, overturning the sleigh with him. After this sad event, which happened when Stephen was seventeen years old, he remained with and supported his mother until Dee. 7, 1850, when he married Miss Frances E. Lee, of Wood land, although a native of Ulysses, Tompkins Co., N. Y. They have had sour children, three of whom are living. JOSEPH W. STINCHCOMB. Joseph W. Stinchcomb is a son of James and Priscilla Stinchcomb, and a native of Perry Co., Ohio, where he was born July 2, 1828. When he was two years of age his father removed to Bloom township, Seneca Co., same State. Here his boyhood and youth were passed, receiving not only a liberal academic education, but also a practical education in the labor of the farm and at the carpenter's and joiner's trade, which latter business he followed winters, working at farming summers, with the exception of ten terms of school teaching, until the fall of 1800, when he removed to Michi gan, and settled in the township of Sunfield, Eaton Co., on a new piece of land, upon which he cleared some seventy acres, then removed to Woodland township, where he has since resided. In the fall of 1858 he married Mary Ellen Winters, of Crawford Co., Ohio, a daughter of Eli Win ters of the same place. They are the parents of five chil dren, four of whom are still living. Mr. Ingerson is not an actual member of any church, although contributing liberally towards their support, and being superintendent of the Union Sabbath-school of the Free-Will Baptist Church for the last three years, and sor ten years has been an active attendant and supporter of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In politics he is a Republican ; was elected township clerk when twenty-one years old ; held that office four years; then for several terms was township treasurer, afterwards town clerk, again was deputy postmaster two years, and commis sioner of highways two years, which office he still holds. Has been administrator of several estates, and held the position of guardian of minors since he was twenty-three years old ; for three years has been president of the Town ship Insurance Company. Mr. Stinchcomb says when he first came to his present home it was a wilderness, but he has made it blossom like the rose, his farm being in a high state of cultivation, with excellent improvements and a residence universally ad mired by all beholders. Mr. Stinchcomb has been a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church for over thirty years, and during that time has held many of the various church offices. He has also held many political offices ; was a Whig until the organiza tion of the Republican party, with which he has since been identified ; has held the office of school inspector, of high way commissioner, justice of the peace, and was elected as the Republican candidate, by a popular majority over all opposition, representative of the first district of Barry County in 1876. -In all positions of public trust as well as in his private life and business Mr. Stinchcomb has won an enviable reputation for integrity, ability, industry, and ex- He began the battle of life at the age of seventeen, with his interest in the farm, then said to be worth one hun dred dollars, and fourteen dollars in personal property, and by industry, thrift, and good habits, alone and unaided, ex cept by his good wife, secured a fine property and home ; says he has never turned a person from his doors who applied in the name of charity for bread or hospitality, and has supplied their needs without asking a question, simply because he felt it his imperative duty."], [768, "512 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

The ancestors of this gentleman are well known in Scotland as an ancient and warlike family, and the lineage is trace able back to the struggles of the Covenanters. The doctor himself is a native of Ayrshire, Scotland, where he was born April 7, 1837, and was the ninth in a family of eleven children. In 1847, when ten years of age, he, in company with his father, came to America ; settled first in Hastings, Mich. After a stay of one winter, came to Woodland, and located on the farm known as the Kilpat rick farm, which he assisted in clearing. From 1856 to 1858 David attended school in Vermontville, the latter year removing to Kalamazoo, where he attended the Kalamazoo College classical course until the spring of 1864, with the exception of six months' service in the Second Michigan Infantry, Company K, during the year 1861, being one of four brothers in the war against the Rebellion. He then en tered the Michigan University, at Ann Arbor; remained six months, when his health failed. Then he went to Roches ter University, and was graduated July 12, 1865, as A.B. in the classical course, continuing his studies in the medical department of the Michigan University, at Ann Arbor, until the spring of 1866, and began the practice of medicine in Woodland in summer of the same year. In 1874 took another course of lecture-drill in hospital clinics, and was graduated at the Detroit Medical College on the 3d of March, 1875. His character and standing in the community are best evinced by the respect and esteem in which he is held, not only as a citizen, but as a professional man. WASHINGTON ROWLADER Washington Rowlader was the youngest son and seventh child in the family of Michael R. and Margaret (Velta) Rowlader, his birth occurring in Herkimer Co., N. Y., Dec. 8, 1830. He remained at home, attending school some eight or ten terms, until after his father had moved to Woodland township, which occurred in 1848. Upon reaching the age of twenty he commenced to support him self, as he was not needed at home. With nothing but his clothes, which he says were not worth six dollars, he reso lutely began the struggle of life, and with determination to not only obtain the living which the world is supposed to owe every one, but something more and better. Re turning to Steuben Co., N. Y., he labored six months for seventy-two dollars, then, in company with his brother, came again to Woodland, and, buying a Mexican land-war rant, secured the tract of land upon which he now resides, and which by perseverance and industry he has made into one of the finest farms and homes in Woodland township. Mr. Rowlader relates that upon first taking up his land he tried to borrow money enough of his uncle, who had plenty, to purchase an axe, but he refused, saying he was fearful he would never be repaid. Dr. Kilpatrick married, March 7, 1872, Miss Minnie McArthur, a native of Woodland township, born in 1850, and a daughter of John McArthur, one of the early settlers, who came as early as 1842. They are the parents of two children, both daughters. In 1855 he married Miss Parmelia Myers, of Odessa, Ionia Co., Mich. They were the parents of three children, of whom two are living. Mr. Rowlader was afflicted by the loss of his wife, who died July 23, 1865. He was again married March 14, 1866, this time to Miss Kate Miller, also of Ionia County, daughter of Gotleib and Christina B. Miller, who emigrated to this country from Germany in 1836.

At the age of one year moved with his parents to Geneva, N. Y. At the age of three he returned to Brunswick, Ohio, where they resided until Henry was fifteen years old, and then removed to Ionia Co., Mich. Henry, having had the advantages of a good district-school education, taught school winters, working on the farm summers. This continued until 1864, when he commenced the study of medicine, graduating in Cleveland in 1868. After his return from college he did not, as most young professionals do, go West, but settled down at home, build ing up a good practice in the town of Sebewa, Ionia Co. In the spring of 1872 he moved to Woodland, where he now lives, doing a large and increasing business. In prac tice, a hom\u0153opathist. ALANSON P. HOLLY although not a pioneer in the township of Woodland, was one of its most enterprising men and citizens, being truly what is called a self-made man. He was born in the town ship of Whitehall, Washington Co., N. Y., June 7, 1817. His father, Birdsill Holly, was a carpenter by trade, and Alanson, early giving evidence of a natural taste for me chanics, was apprenticed at the machinist trade and soon became one of the best, and worked as foreman in the shop of Abel Downs for twenty years. He then went to Lock port, N. Y., and worked for his brother \u2014 who was the in ventor of the Holly water-works \u2014 in the Holly Manufac turing Company's shops. Sept. 15, 1864, he married Miss Ellen S. Cooper, a native of New York, born Aug. 30, 1843. Her father, Israel Cooper, was one of the first settlers in Woodland, coming to this township about 1S35, afterwards returning to New York, and subsequently to Michigan; this was in 1852; they there remained until their death. Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter are the parents of four children, \u2014 viz. : Claude B., born Aug. 10, 1865 ; George H., born May 9, 1867; Lottie E., born Nov. 12, 1871 ; Mary A., born Dec. 11, 1873, \u2014 all of whom are living. In August, 1S66, Alanson, together with his family, moved to Woodland, where he bought a tract of land, But for eight years traveled for the Holly Manufacturing Com- 65"], [772, "514 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN.

Mr. Holly's wife, whom he married Oct. 13, 1840, was a Miss Harriet Stowell, a native of Bainbridge, Chenango Co., N. Y., and the second in a family of ten children. To this union were born five children, \u2014 Ira A., born March 27, 1843; Susan J., born Feb. 22, 1845; William Perry, YANKEE SPRINGS.* The township contains two post-offices, but neither village nor church edifice. Schools are abundant, farming is a profitable pursuit, and the people form an industrious and well-to-do community. This township, lying on the western border of the county, is composed of survey-township 3, in range 10, and is bounded on the north by Thornapple township, south by Orangeville, east by Rutland, and west by the Allegan county-line. The surface of the town on the west is occu pied by numerous small lakes or ponds, while in the south west corner Gun Lake, lying in four townships, covers upwards of 2000 acres. This lake is a somewhat noted resort for anglers, picnic-parties, and other pleasure-seekers, and on its western shore, in Smith's grove, the Spiritualists of Barry and adjoining counties gather each summer in considerable numbers for camp-meeting exercises, which last generally about a week, and attract crowds of curious people. \"YANKEE BILL,\" THE PIONEER. The spot in Yankee Springs township now pointed out as the place where once stood the famous roadside inn of \" Yan kee Bill Lewis\" was the location of the first white settle ment in Yankee Springs. The settlement was made early in the year 1836, by Calvin Lewis, a New Yorker, who had bought land on section 35. The great Indian trail between Kalamazoo and Kent passed that way, and, as consider able travel moved over the route, it occurred to Lewis that a tavern at that point would supply a serious need and bring him in some money. So, with the assistance of his brother-in-law, one Tryon, he put up, near some cool springs, a house of tamarack and oak logs. This was in the spring of 1836, and before he got his log tavern finished along came William Lewis, his brother, who on his way to In diana had turned aside to visit Calvin. So pleased was William with the country, and especially with the opening, at that particular point, for an energetic pioneer and tavern keeper, that he bargained successfully with Calvin for the purchase of the property, promptly relinquished his Indiana project, and set himself at once to the completion of the business that Calvin had begun. The waters of the lake are clear, and in many places deep. Whitefish and other choice specimens of the finny tribe abound, and, as the waters are free to all who care to cast the seductive fly, the fishing season always brings troops of anglers. The Wayland Fishing Club and the Hastings Fishing Club have boat-houses on the lake in Yankee Springs, and partake there each year of much refreshing sport. There has latterly been talk regarding a project looking to the drainpge of Gun Lake and adjacent ponds into the Thornapple River, but whether the enterprise is likely to culminate in success very soon is somewhat uncertain. Cer tain it is that the reclamation of the country covered by these lakes will provide a vast acreage of valuable pasture or meadow-lands. William Lewis called his log tavern the \" Mansion House,\" and hung a sign bearing that name on a tree near his door. Some travelers, however, had in 1835 cut the name of \"Yankee Springs\" on a tree standing there,\"(- and the locality soon became generally known by that name. The hotel also was called the \" Yankee Springs House\" instead of the \" Mansion House,\" becoming celebrated throughout the State by the former name. A singular feature in the topography of the township is the fact that on the west the streams flow southward, while on the east they run towards the north. On the west the township was originally pretty well occupied by swampy pine-lands, which are, however, now well cleared and drained. The rest of the township was an oak forest, and in many places a very attractive region. At this time Yankee Springs is a township of fairly good agricultural resources, and it is, moreover, replete with scenic beauty. Looking towards the west, one may discern from the eastern elevations a wide and varied natural expanse, dotted with forest, lake, and plain, and presenting a most pleasing and picturesque prospect. In 1837 a stage-route was established between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids, or Kent, and, as it followed the old Indian trail, Lewis' tavern was of course a point on the route, and a famous one, too, as shall presently appear. In its course through Yankee Springs township, the road passed over a country of light oak-openings, which gave a * By David Schwartz. f See pago 33 of the general history."], [773, "YANKEE SPRINGS TOWNSHIP. 515 natural and easy highway. The course was essentially that now pursued by the route between Yankee Springs and Middleville, and varied only as the increasing travel cut up the path and caused new parallel roads to be made by the stages, for it must be borne in mind that these vehicles could pass through the open woods almost anywhere, and pick out such road as best suited. teeth out of his head into the sand, and, although all hands joined subsequently in a determined search for the missing molars, they were never found, and, according to popular belief, they are to this day in the sand where they fell. Lewis was at his best, however, when the stage-horn announced from the top of the neighboring hill the near ap proach of the welcome stage. Four stage-coaches loaded down and drawn by four horses passed daily sor a time over the road each way, and it may be believed that Lewis' tavern, the only stage-house upon a stretch of nearly twenty miles of road either way, was like an oasis in the desert. Landlord Lewis was in his most gracious and graceful mood when the stage rolled up to his door, and he did the honors in approved style. By and by travel over this road grew extremely active, and in the same degree Lewis' tavern gained importance, and by degrees, to accommodate increasing business, he expanded its proportions by adding new structures, until there were of the tavern-stand, six buildings, each a story in height, and all, save one, constructed of logs. Jumbled together in a confused mass, these six edifices presented neither an imposing nor a graceful appearance, but they were the hurried creations of backwoods life, and were built when there was no time to waste over architectural He made a good deal of money at the tavern-stand and owned considerable land, but always frankly confessed that he couldn't save money as his brothers did. He was, however, a man of some influence, and went for one term to the State Legislature. symmetry or beauty. Travelers that way, struck by the odd collection of log cabins, and struck more by the delight ful entertainment found there, used to mention, in their letters to Eastern newspapers, their pleasant experiences at the \" little huts at Yankee Springs.\" It was a standing joke of the time that Lewis' tavern was a six-story building, but that the six stories were all on the ground. About 1850 there was an attempt towards the construc tion of a plank-road from Augusta to Grand Kapids, viil Yankee Springs, and in anticipation of the renewal of traffic Lewis not only made preparations to replace his log huts with a fine tavern-building, but at his own expense built two miles of the proposed road. The whole project failed, hoAvever, and the new tavern never came into exist ence. Travel over the old road continued, however, to be considerable until the completion, in 1855, of a plank-road from Kalamazoo to Grand Rapids through Allegan County caused a diversion of traffic to that route, and then the glory as well as the usefulness of the Yankee Springs House departed. Lewis leased the stand to Solomon Burch and retired to a farm, Avhere he died in 1860. His widow still survives, and resides in Kent County. Aster Burch's time Winchester Dodge kept the place, and after that young Calvin Lewis, but the tavern was not of much consequence after the stage-route was changed, and all traces of it have long since disappeared. When Lewis became a popular landlord, and his tavern grew in fame, he came also to be known far and wide as Yankee Bill or Yankee Lewis, and by one or the other of these names he was spoken of until the day of his death. He was known all along the road, and the hospitable aud enter taining character of his tavern was such that travelers would make urgent efforts to reach Yankee Bill's so they could pass the night there, while stage-coach passengers, bowling along towards the old tavern, felt renewed cheer fulness and satisfaction at the thought of the good things sure to be awaiting them there. So brisk was business at the Yankee Springs House that it was a common thing for 100 people to tarry there of a night, while on one occasion no less than 60 teams were stabled there between sunset and sunrise. Landlord Lewis was a skillful caterer, noted for the inviting and wholesome fare of his table, and was, moreover, so attentive to busi ness that he rarely failed to receive in person every traveler who tarried with him. He cultivated a vegetable garden hard by his tavern, and, having a gardener expert at his trade, took an inordinate pride in making that department a great success, since upon it he depended greatly in pro viding his guests with toothsome delicacies and palatable luxuries. This garden he delighted in, and never tired of displaying its attractive features to passing wayfarers. Mr. Tryon, already spoken of as having assisted Calvin Lewis in making a settlement, returned eastward soon after William Lewis came West. Calvin Lewis, after selling out to William, bought a farm hard by and became a pioneer in earnest. During the latter portion of his life he kept a tavern on his place, on section 27. Hiram Lewis, also a brother of William, settled in Yankee Springs in 1837, but afterwards moved to Prairieville, and died in 1879 in Kalamazoo. OTHER PIONEER TAVERNS. Lewis was a jovial, good-natured landlord, given to con viviality, and sociable to an extraordinary degree. He had a coterie of chums, who paid him frequent visits, and with them he often engaged in such entertaining sport as foot-racing and similar pastimes. One Saturday evening, a half-dozen or more of his cronies being at the tavern for a Sunday visit, Lewis arranged a foot-race, and down the hill the entire party ran in great spirits. Who won, who lost, what the stakes were, or what time the racers made, tra dition fails to disclose, but it does tell how one of the contestants so exercised himself that he shook three false On the same Battle Creek and Grand Rapids stage-road were two other taverns in Yankee Springs, locally famous as roadside inns, and kept respectively by Benjamin S. Dib ble and Philip Leonard. Mr. Dibble was the third settler in the township, Calvin and William Lewis having (as has been seen) been the first two. His first visit was in May, 1836, on a land-looking tour. He immediately purchased 320 acres on section 2, and returned to New York for his family, and in October, 1836, he became a settler in Yankee Springs. Until the following February the home in which he and his family set up their domestic altar was a rude"], [774, "516 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Those hardships, however, did not realize in every re spect the settler's apprehensions. Ready communication with the outside world by tbe stage-road gave to the pio neers in Yankee Springs advantages which those in other quarters sorely missed, and placed them within reach of the comforts of life, provided they were possessed of the financial means to obtain them, \u2014 means which, be it ob served, were not always at hand in the daily routine of frontier existence. As in many other localities, there were frequent troublesome incursions by wolves and bears upon the small stock of the settlers, while animated experiences with wolves on the part of the settlers themselves broke, if they did not embellish, the somewhat prosaic monotony of pioneer pursuits. Calvin Hill recalls how, in the year 1840, he went one night, across lots through the snow, to visit his father, and how, upon returning, he was chased by a pack of wolves. Grievous was his dismay and srreat was his haste as he fled towards home before his fero cious pursuers, but fortune savored him in giving him but a short distance to cover before reaching his house, else he might not have been spared to tell the story. As it was, he reached his door-yard just as the leader of the hungry horde was close upon him. With a loud cry Hill leaped the fence ; at that instant his wife appeared at the door way with a light, and the wolves, suddenly appalled by the cry and the light, stopped short, when in a trice their intended victim was safe within the walls of his cabin. shanty, with neither floor, door, window, nor chimney. For the latter a hole in the roof answered, although, when the rains of heaven made their way through it to the family beneath, it must have answered but poorly. A blanket served as a door, and thus comfortless, but sustained by the hope of something better, the family endured existence until February, when they moved into a newly-erected log house Mr. Dibble was appointed postmaster at the newly-estab lished office of Middleville in 1839. In 1842 he took a contract for carrying the mail between Kalamazoo and Kent, and after that was mail-contractor and tavern-keeper for twenty years. The tavern he opened shortly after he settled, and called it the Silver Creek House. It was about five miles north of Yankee Bill's tavern, and was freely patron ized. In 1840 Dibble sold the stand to Philip Leonard, who removed the old sign and announced to the traveling public by a new one that the house was the \" Middleville Cottage, by P. Leonard.\" It was known, too, as the Half- Way House, sor it was at first thought to stand just mid-way between Battle Creek and Grand Rapids, whereas subsequent surveys disclosed the \" half-way\" point to be about two miles south of the tavern. Shortly after selling out to Leonard, Mr. Dibble moved about a mile southward, on the same road, and became the landlord of a second tavern, which he named \" The Washington\" and dedicated to the cause of temperance. When he raised his sign he had quite a company at hand to celebrate the event. Of the speeches made on that occasion the one best remembered was made by Mr. George B. Manchester, who said, \" We raise here to-day this coldwater sign: may it hang tri umphantly in the heavens until it brings down all the hot water signs in the land \" On the west the early settlements were near Barlow Lake, and were made by Nathan Barlow, John Miles, Nelson Coman, and C. W. Bassett, in 1837. Mr. Barlow, who located on section 7, built the first saw-mill in the township. He was a man of mark, was one of the associ ate judges chosen upon the organization of the county, and was a resident of Yankee Springs until his death, in 1855. In parting with the history of the stage-road and the roadside inns, passing reference may be made to Bill Van De Walker and John Crampton, two famous stage-drivers on the line. Van De Walker was considered a great \" whip,\" and was popular all along the route as a jovial character, and one withal who would put his passengers through on time, or \u2014 to use his expression \u2014 \" bust a trace.\" Among other things, Crampton was more especially distinguished as the possessor of a very much extended horn, which some reck less chronicler has described as \" nine feet long,\" but which was in reality a very important instrument, with which he delighted to awaken the musical echoes and to flourish in all the pride of professional dignity. C. W. Bassett, now living on section 4, bought his present farm in 1836, and, in the fall of 1837, brought his family to the place. His cabin bad an opening, but no door, and a blanket was the best available substitute to be found for that article. He went to mill to Battle Creek (where all the early settlers had to go for a similar purpose) shortly aster coming in, and was, of course, compelled to leave his wife and child behind to endure as best they could the distress of their lonely situation. Mr. Bassett was gone nearly a week, and when he returned he sound the family without provisions and long anxiously awaiting relief, but more especially glad at his coming back because of the ter rible frights they had endured through the howling of the wolves. These, Mrs. Bassett declared, had kept her com pany early and late, and had made the week's existence a continued terror, as she was in constant fear lest they should dash upon her through the unprotected doorway of the cabin and fall murderously upon herself and little one. SETTLERS AND ANECDOTES. The settlement of the township was carried forward in the autumn of 1836 by Luther Hill, who then located on sec tion 12, and, following him, by his son, Calvin Hill, who, in the same fall, made a settlement on section 11, he havino* lived for a year previous in Prairieville. Calvin Hill (still living on section 11) remembers that when he came to the town first the country struck him as one of the prettiest he had ever seen. The oak-timber was light and open, while the ground was profusely decked with wild-flowers^ and, although there was a prospect of tough pioneer work and perhaps of privations, nature seemed to offer a beautiful consolation for anticipated hardships. Mr. Bassett tells a story which shows the misfortunes that attended the poor pioneer in need of a doctor. Urged on by a rebellious tooth, he started afoot for Prairieville to get relief from a German physician living there. When he arrived there, however, it was to learn that the doctor had been engaged in the business of passing counterfeit"], [775, "YANKEE SPRINGS TOWNSHIP. 517 money, and had fled the country to avoid arrest. Pushing on to Gun Marsh to find another physician, he reached there only to be told that the doctor had gone to Pine Creek to mill. Desperate and determined, Bassett con tinued on to Gun Plain, but, alas ! the practitioner there had gone to Kalamazoo. Nerving himself for a final effort, he set out for Otsego to find Dr. Coats, but en route thither he met the Gun Marsh doctor coming back from mill. He rode home with him, and then, as if in mockery of the victim's suffering experience, the man of medicine broke the tooth upon his first attempt to extract it. Springs pioneers of 1840. Among the later comers, J. J. Mattison settled in 1847, James Youngs in 1848, and William Pratt in 1851. In the year 1839 there came from New York John Stewart, who made a settlement on section 34, and lived there until about 1864, when he remoA'ed from the town, and died in 1873, in Mississippi. Edwin Naylor, with his family, had come in shortly before Stewart, and made a home on section 34. The Naylor farm was occupied in 1851 by James Campbell, who kept store near Lewis' tavern. Edwin Naylor, after being joined by his father, William Naylor, remained in town a few years, and then moved to Port Huron. James Norris was a settler in the winter of 1838 upon section 26. He came from Washtenaw County, where he had been living four years, and had with him, besides his own family, a hired man named Watts, who himself became subsequently a resident on section 25. Darby Doyle settled on section 35, in the spring of 1839, and soon thereafter came James Watson to the same neigh borhood, where he bought some land of Hiram Lewis. Following close upon Watson the neAV-comers included Moses Doyle, Alexander Stewart, John Duffee, and a Mr. Hardee, and later still George H. Ford, Daniel Brown, Samuel Potter, and William Ellsworth. Bassett would have no more of such butchering, and he waded home through the snow, having been gone two days, traveled forty-five miles, and come back with a worse tooth than he had when he started. \" I went to Middle ville,\" he says, \"had the tooth cut out with a jack-knife and dug out with a shoemaker's awl, and so got rid of it at last.\" Nelson Coman, now living on section 4, tarried with Bassett a while, and in 1838 married and settled upon the farm he now occupies. He was one of the early school teachers in the county, and, having a school at Middleville one winter, used to make the trip over there, a distance of eight miles, in the morning and back again in the evening to do his \" chores,\" the snow being sometimes four feet deep. In 1839 he threshed out some wheat upon the frozen ground, took it over to Judge Barlow's, cleaned it in the judge's fanning-mill, and carried it to Battle Creek to mill. When he got the flour home he had been just a Aveek at the job. For letters he and others resident in the neigh borhood had to go to \" Yankee Lewis',\" a round trip of ten miles, and also enjoyed the privilege of paying a postage of twenty-five cents per letter. The first birth in Yankee Springs Avas that of James T., a son of Benjamin S. Dibble. He was born March 27, 1837, and now lives in Thornapple township. The first marriage Avas that of William Whitney, a shoemaker, living near the Lewis tavern, to a Miss Rogers, in 1810, Hiram Lewis performing the marriage ceremony. The first death was that of a man named Thomas, who worked for land lord Lewis. Thomas was out on Deep Lake on a fishing excursion, and by some mischance fell into the water and Avas drowned. His body Avas recovered, and buried in the graveyard south of the tavern, where William Lewis had given the town a piece of land for burial purposes. Thomas was the first person to be buried therein, and Mrs. William Coffin, of Orangeville, the second. Mr. Coman was out quite late one night in search of his cows, and, in the darkness losing his way, he concluded to camp out for the night, but, not fancying a bed on the ground while the wolves were howling about him, he took lod\"*ment in a tree, and iu this lofty perch passed what must have been a wearisome time until daylight. Nathan Barlow, who settled near Barlow Lake, in 1837, built there, with his son Nathan, in 1840, the fir=t saw mill. He disposed of it to Timothy Miles, who trans ferred it to 0. C. Bates, and he to E. H. Bowen. The latter took possession of the property in 1864, aud in 1871 built also a grist-mill, whence the locality has been known from that day as Bowen's Mills. William Lewis owned a saw-mill, on section 9, about 1850, having bought it when he purposed building a new tavern. Later, Silas Headley built a small grist-mill there. John Miles and James Hoskinson had just preceded Bassett into the settlement, but the latter was not aware of their presence, or the presence indeed of any neighbors in that direction, until one day when he and his wife went over to Coman marsh after hay. While there Mrs. Bassett suddenly cried, \" Oh, I hear a cow-bell, and I know we've got neighbors.\" Similarly, Miles didn't know that Bassett or anybody else was in the vicinity until, seeing wagon tracks in the marsh, he knew he had new neighbors. William Lewis put up about 1840, near his tavern-stand, a store building, which was, however, first used for a school. A store was opened in it a few years later by Seth Lewis, and aster him it was kept by James Campbell, who was its last proprietor. In that vicinity also Shastoe and William Lowry, two brothers, settled in 1838, but their stay was limited to a few years. T. P. Johnson, one of the hardiest and heartiest of pioneers, bought land on section 12, in March, 1836, but did not occupy it as a settler until 1841. Meanwhile he worked at Squire Calvin Hill's, in Thornapple, and took an active part iu the pioneer work of that region. Although still a land-owner in Yankee Springs, his home is in Mid dleville. A. Stokoe, on section 5, was a settler in 1840, William and James Thome made locations on section 10 in 1839, and in the northeast Charles Kellogg, John W. Brad ley, and A. H. Bradley, his brother, were among the Yankee MAILS AND POST-OFFICES. About 1837 a post-office was established in Yankee Springs, and, as Yankee Bill Lewis was appointed postmaster, of course the post-office was at the tavern. In those early days it was the rule for mail-carriers to allow each post master seven minutes and a half to pick from the mail-bag"], [776, "518 HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. Acres. the letters intended for his office, and, as that business was done by going over the entire contents of the mail-bag, the time limit forced postmasters to use the utmost diligence. Yankee Bill, with an eye to dispatch, would dump the con tents of the mail-bag upon the bar-room floor, and then he and the members of his household would fall to and pick out the Yankee Springs letters. Sorting the mail in that fashion was doubtless an interesting performance, but a post-office agent happening along that way one day, and ob serving it, ordered a stop put to that method of procedure, \u2014 that is, he did so as soon as he had recovered from his amazement. During Mr. Lewis' term the name of the post-office Avas changed to Gates, just as the township name was, but restored almost immediately to the old one. Lewis was the postmaster until his death, and was succeeded in order by John Crump, Stephen Potter, and Albert Springer, the latter, Avho is now the incumbent, having been appointed in the autumn of 1878.

Dibble appointed postmaster. J. W. Bradley was appointed in 1842, and in 1843 the office was removed to the village of Middleville. Yankee Springs has never had a church edifice within its limits, nor yet many religious organizations. Of the latter there are to-day perhaps two or three. There was preach ing as early as 1837 at Lewis' tavern-stand, and afterward in the building used as a school-house, where Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist preachers held forth, as they hap pened to travel that way. A Methodist class was formed at that point quite earl}*, but its subsequent progress was far from vigorous. It is now somewhat disorganized, and, although efforts haA*e been made to resume worship, there have been but few meetings during the past year. Rev. Daniel E. Stocking, now living near there, took charge of the circuit iu 1867, and at that time preached at no less than nine different points. About 1850 there was in the southwest portion of Yankee Springs, and in the northern part of Orangeville, a community of Catholics, who bought Lewis McCloud's residence and converted it into a house of wor ship. They obtained the occasional services of priests from Grand Rapids, and for several years had regular services. They laid out a cemetery near by, and prospered as a church until the removal from the neighborhood of a major portion of its members caused its dissolution. The church edifice and cemetery, both in Yankee Springs township, are yet observed as landmarks, although long since out of service. The first preaching in the western portion of the town was by Rev. Mr. Daubney, at the residence of C. W. Bassett, in 1839. A Methodist Episcopal class was organ ized at J. W. Bradley 's house by Rev. Mr. Worthington in 1842, but its life was not extended. Gun Lake post-office, in the western part of the town ship, was established about 1850. The first postmaster was Nathan Barlow, and the second John Miles, who was like wise the mail-carrier, bringing the mail from Wayland to Gun Lake on horseback. At times his daughter Fanny (now Mrs. Chappell) relieved her father as mail-carrier, and report says that Miss Fanny, being fond of reading, would so devote herself to the contemplation of her book while riding along on old Dobbin that the mail-bag would, un known to her, slip from the horse on the way ; the fair rider being so interested in her story that not until her arrival at her destination would she discover the loss of the mail. This is said to have happened more than once, but, as luck would have it, the mail-bag was always recovered. John A. Miles succeeded John Miles as postmaster, and in 1865 E. H. Bowen was appointed. In 1871 he caused the name of the office to be changed to Bowen's Mills. Mr. Bowen retired in 1877, and was followed by C. H. Armstrong, the present incumbent. ROAD DISTRICTS.

The official school report for 1879 presented the follow ing statistics : The first school in the township was taught, in 1840, by Mary, daughter of Nathan Barlow, in a framed building put up by Yankee Lewis near the tavern for a residence, but used first as a school-house, and subsequently as a store: being later remodeled as a barn, and still used as such. A log school-house was built in that district the next summer, in which the early teachers were Eliza Hoskinson, a Mr. Dixon, and Rachel Bowne.

Some time in 1868 Milton Beach and Leonard Stock dale, two farmers of Yankee Springs, had some trouble concerning the breaking of a piece of land, which Beach had agreed to look aster, but neglected. Arraigned by Stockdale for his default, Beach, a very violent man, grew furiously angry, and assaulted Stockdale with an ox whip. Tbe latter, happening to have an open penknife in his hand at that juncture, closed with his assailant, and in the ensuing struggle Beach was stabbed. He was carried home and, despite skillful surgical attention, died within a week. Stockdale was tried on the charge of murder, but acquitted on the plea of self-defense. The year 1877 furnished another local tragedy in the suicide of Mrs. Charles Turner, who lived on section 23. The cause of her desperate taking off was not clearly de fined, but was generally charged to mental depression."], [778, "HISTORY OF ALLEGAN AND BARRY COUNTIES, MICHIGAN. 520 Estes Rich ; Collector, B.

A legislative act approved March 22, 1839, detached townships 3 north, in ranges 9 and 10 west, from Thorn apple, and called them Yankee Springs. An act approved March 16, 1847, set off township 3, in range 9, and called it Rutland. The name of Yankee Springs was not palatable to all the residents therein, and as the result of the efforts of Calvin Hill and others, in 1848, the Legislature substi tuted Gates for Yankee Springs, Gates being the town in New York State whence the Hills came. William Lewis, who had given the township its first name, refused to see it crowded out by Gates, and by determined exertions suc ceeded, during the session of 1848-49, in having the old appellation restored, since when it has been undisturbed.

James Norris was born in 1799, near Montpelier Vt. and until he was nineteen years of age passed his life upon a farm, save for a period during the war of 1812, when he"], [779, "YANKEE SPRINGS TOWNSHIP. 521 was employed as a mail-carrier in the military service. Reaching his twentieth year, he determined to become the architect of his own fortune, and so he penetrated into the then wilderness of Genesee Co., N. Y., where he lived until the spring of 1834, and where he married Miss Cla- he set about the erection of a log cabin upon his place, and the following spring moved into it. He died in Yankee Springs, Nov. 19, 1875, and at the time of his death owned, in addition to his original purchase, eighty acres on section 27. He was during his residence in Yankee Springs a respected and honored citizen, and at his death was generally lamented. Henry D. Norris, his son, was born in New York, Aug. 30, 1832, and was but six years of age when his father came to Yankee Springs. Reared from his youth to be a farmer, he chose to follow in his father's footsteps, and, marrying Sarah J., daughter of Ed ward and Angelina Ford (who removed to Michigan from Saratoga County in 1850), he settled himself in life as an agriculturist. Inheriting the old homestead of one hun dred and three acres on section 26, he has developed and expanded his enterprise as a farmer to such good purpose that to that one hundred and three acres he has added upwards of three hundred. He has, furthermore, put into execution liberal and progressive theories in the manage ment of his farm, as for example the introduction of wind power and machinery for the cutting of feed, grinding grain, etc., upon his place. Still following new and untried fields, he has undertaken an experiment in peach-culture, and, believing that peaches can be profitably grown in Yankee Springs, has set out an orchard of two hundred and fifty trees. Should the venture prove a success, he will turn his attention and devote his land wholly to that branch of agriculture. Mr. Norris is a quiet, unassuming gentleman, endowed, however, with much energy of char acter and a shrewd foresight in matters of business. In politics his faith lies with the Republican party, but in the pool of politics he does not care to dabble, since the more engrossing affairs of business are exclusively the study of his life. His family consists of his wife and two children, \u2014 Minnie, aged five, and John, aged one. HENRY D. NORRIS. rinda Kinner. In 1834 he moved to Ypsilanti, Mich., and rented a farm of his brother. There he lived until Decem ber, 1838, when he moved with his family to Yankee Springs toAvnship, in Barry County, where, on section 26, he had located in 1835, through Mr. Angell, of Marshall, one hundred and three acres. Mr. Norris reached Yankee Springs on Christmas Eve, in 1838, and occupied a por tion of the house of Hiram Lewis. Without loss of time 66"], [780, ""], [781, ""], [782, ""], [783, ""], [784, ""]]
