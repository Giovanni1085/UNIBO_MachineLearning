It is hoped the British Public will bestow on the following Pages the same unprecedented patronage as attended the Publication of Holbein's Dance of Death, a work alike formed of Wood Engravings, issued sometime ago by the Publisher ofthe present Volume. The incessant industry, the perseverance and the care required in the production of such a Book, probable none but Artists, Printers, and Literary-men can know. As a Freeman and Citizen of London, attached to its interests \u2014 alike by Birth and Education \u2014 our Publisher was anxious to commemorate its growing splendour and increasing1 magnificence in a Cabinet Volume, at once ornamental and useful. The Engravings have Letter-Press Explanations: there are also descriptions of the Exhibitions, and other Places of Resort, that our Country Cousins, when they corne to see the \" London Lions,\" will have only to put this Volume in their pockets, and by its direction, will be led from place to place, requiring no other guide. To residents in Town it will afford an historical detail of the recent and intended Improvements in the Metropolis, issued at a moderate Price : besides being a Volume of exquisite Specimens of Wood Engravings, by our first rate Artists ; and showing the perfection to which that art is brought in the present day.

Of those optical exhibitions ofthe higher class, which have had their combi nations made by men of science, and which have been perfected by the aid J B"], [18, "2 WALKER'S EIDOURANION. of painting and mechanics, the Eidouranion of Walker, and the improved lecture of Bartley, well deserve to rank the foremost. The Vertical Orrery, or Eidouranion of Adam Walker, is not merely in unison with the artist-like exhibitions we have already described, but in iu early days formed so novel, and, really, so interesting, so dignified an amuse ment, that we cannot hesitate to place it amongst the most respectable efforts, to extend the beneficial uses of the stage. Mr. Bartley's more recent effial is creditable to the parties undertaking it, (we believe the proprietorship of the Uranologia to be in Mr. Arnold, of the Lyceum Theatre,) and confers much honour on the ability and good taste of Mr. Bartley, who is himself the lecturer. First, ofthe EIDOURANION : We believe this singularly beautiful machine to have originated with Ben jamin Martin, a celebrated mathematical instrument maker of the last cen tury : whether he proceeded to the actual organization of the machine, we are not informed, but we are well assured that the self-taught James Ferguson did construct a model, but which was never so far completed as to become practically useful ; but, whether Benjamin Martin first suggested, or James Walker, (who was Adam Ferguson's immediate predecessor, as a familiar lecturer on Natural Philosophy,) did, or not, first actually make a vertical arrangement of the old Orrery, with transparent or luminous planets, it is itiost certain, that to Adam Walker we are altogether indebted for its prac tical completion. After discussing the priority of the first conception, as matter of curiosity, we are, therefore, bound to think and speak of Mr. Walker as its inventor, and the Eidouranion has descended to the young lovers of Astronomy of ihe fourth generation, since its first appearance, with its eupho nous appellation, deservedly linked with the respected name of its first owner. To \" Walker's Eidouranion\" how many thousands are indebted for their early clear notions of astronomy ? We are ourselves of that number ; but while we remember the scenes of our instruction with natural and becoming respect, we unhesitatingly (and, perhaps, our early associations prompt us to do so) complain, that half a century of general advancement in every art which ornaments society, finds the exhibition ofthe Eidouranion so little assisted by auxiliaries, which would, unquestionably, render it doubly de lightful, a thousand times more useful. After the Eidouranion, we recollect no attempt to render the exhibition of astronomical scenery popularly at- tractive, till about the year 1800, when the figures of the constellations and the telescopic views of the planets were first painted on glass, for ex- hibition, as phantasma in the magic lantern. This originated, as welt in the idea as the practical execution, with Mr. Charles Blunt, an optician and artist ; and it has since been successfully introduced in most of our public schools and establishments. The relation in which the editor of this work stands with respect to the ingenious inventor of these paintings, will hardly allow him to advert to the rude imitations of his paintings, which have, in too many instances, seemed intended rather to caricature than to illus trate astronomy. In the few instances in which the rage for cheap imitation has allowed the subject to be treated by an observer as well as an artist, the success of the exhibition has been most complete. The lecture of Mr. Bartley is the first public exhibition (at least, in the metropolis,) of these paintings, in furtherance of the discourse ; and as far as they are in that solitary instance allowed to go, they very satisfactorily point out to an astronomer, accom plished for the task, the ready means of producing an astronomical lecture of richness, extent, and variety, worthy ofthe subject."], [19, "WALKER'S EIDOURANION. 3 The age is proudly distinguished by a general cultivation of science, and a love of literature and useful knowledge, which spreads over the whole in- telligent community. Of all the devices which active ingenuity has proposed for the dissemination of knowledge, public lectures, of popular character in their language and embellishment, may properly be determined (he most effective, as well as the most pleasant ; and if we for a few moments rightly \u25a0consider the importance of astronomical knowledge, we shall surely not hesi- tate to pronounce that Astronomical Lectures of the character we are describing, deserve to stand foremost in the ranks. Astronomy, univer- sally acknowledged the most sublime and interesting of those sciences which admit of popular illustration, is doubly valuable for its powerful influence and effect in the general improvement ofthe human mind. Of an astronomical lecture, and of the lecturer himself, we can conceive, perhaps, more than might be readily executed : but, admitting this, we must insist, that an actual advancement might be made, which, in its effect, would leave immeasurably distant all existing arrangements. The limits of the present work do not allow us, in this, necessarily, a small division of it, to go into the detail of such an attempt : we should propose a more extensive view of the science, a wider general view, and yet more detail of information ; more mechanical arrangement ; of less expensive character, perhaps, than those of present use, but certainly of more beauty, as well as efficacy. The public have long accustomed themselves to con- sider ingenious and elaborate arrangements of machinery, if accompanied with the correct recital of the rudiments of the science, and a due display of distances and magnitudes, to form the ne plus ultra of astronomical lectur- ing : this is absurd ; the science of astronomy is, perhaps, more than any other which can be named of the whole circle, the very science of which a popular display may most successfully be aided by the ornamental arts. Music, painting, sculpture, may be called in as auxiliaries, with powerful effect, and manifest benefit ; a tasteful introduction of poetry may be deemed almost essential to success; and we would undertake that Urania need not disdain the co-operation of Terpsichore herself. If it were possible to effect in one person a combination ofthe accomplish- ments required to form a popular lecturer or astronomer, we should not be content with an intimate acquaintance with the science; we would have a quick versatility of general talent ; next, insist that he were an artist, of taste to conceive, and of power to embody his conceptions ; of literary ability to condense and arrange, in the most lucid manner, his own discourse ; in music, at least, of a refined taste and ear, if not practically a master. He should possess a thorough acquaintance with, and dexterous facility in ap- plying, the laws of perspective in unbounded extent, and the precision of that beautiful art, with a complete and ready management of scenic em bellishment, having a clear knowledge of its capabilities, and great expert- ness in its practice ; in short, an accomplished scene painter. In mecha- nical contrivances and arrangements, not merely equal to the general orga nization of a plan, but of Teady quickness, and fertile of expedient in the detail ; possessing the eye and judgment of the engineer, the hand of the ready workman. He should have the invaluable habitual coolness and self possession of the accomplished actor ; his oratorical delivery should be ner vous, elegant, chaste ; his voice of considerable volume, sonorous and musi cal; his appearance and manners denoting the gentleman and the scholar. With these qualifications, either blended in one person, ov, by a happy sub-"], [20, "4 ASTRONOMICAL LECTURES. division of labour, produced in a judicious allotment, by more than one, we should probably witness, in a popular astronomical lecture, the richest intellectual treat the stage can afford us. After this, we may be expected to speak of the qualifications of our two principal lecturers. Did the style of either of the-e gentlemen demand from a journalist any thing but unqualified commendation, our task might be an ungracious one. We have, however, but to describe in few words the dif ference in the style of delivery of the rival lecturers, and the peculiarities of each as to the mechanism they adopt, and the embellishments they respec tively bestow on their exhibitions. Of Mr. Walker, we will say, that the original transparent Orrery of his venerable father's construction, possesses a charm, an air of times gone by, which, by powerful association, rivets the attention ; it has suffered nothing by time, but has the advantage of much additional embellishment, an art in which ils style of early days could not have been adopted. In that di rection, however, there is still much room for further exertion. Mr. Dean Walker, the present lecturer on the Eidouranion, is the second Walker in succession since the invention of his father. Mr. William Walker, the elder son, who for twenty years together read the only astronomical lecture we had, was the first ; and, shortly after his decease, about seven years since, this heir-loom descended to its present proprietor. Mr. Walker is distin guished from his father and his deceased brother, in his public lectures, by a moi.e polished and easy delivery, a graceful familiarity, which secures the attention of the young and the unlearned, and an elegance of diction and general manner, which greatly heightens the effect of his discourse to every class. It is with no invidious or unworthy feeling, that we say of Mr. Walker and the Eidouranion, as compared with other exhibitions of similar character, that we feel his lecture and his apparatus to be indeed the original, and experience an involuntary satisfaction, that the present arrangements of neither differ in their material points from those determined by the inventor more than half a century ago. . Mr. Bartley is entitled to our respectable consideration on different grounds. His exhibition is a theatrical adventure, of great merit and curiosity; credit able alike to those who have undertaken, and those who embody it. Mr. Bartley delivers his lecture with great solemnity and proper feeling, has evidently a sound perception ofthe subject, and the importance of his task, and delivers himself of it like a sensible man, feelingly alive to the dig nity of his subject. Parents will duly appreciate Mr. Bartley's exertions, in conveying to the minds of their children the lofty and magnificent ideas that Astronomy sup plies. \u2014 Beauty, Order, and Sublimity in the Heavens, appear to their ex panding intellect, in all their delightful prospects ; and the feelings, that will certainly influence their entre'e into life, will be characterized by a marked reverence for that Divinity which breathes within us, And points out an after state to man. Adults, as well as children, will derive, from this exhibition, an increased perception of the power, dignity, and ubiquity, of that Be'ing whom we ought to serve."], [21, "5 THE SELF-MOVING ORRERY, AND THE ASTRONOMICAL EXHIBITIONS OF MODERN TIMES, Which add to their Mechanical Arrangements the Illustrations of Music, and Scenic Decorations. Illustration No. 2. The Busby Orrery, unquestionably the most beautiful contrivance of modern times for the popular exhibition of Astronomical Phenomena, ranks high, as we'll for its mechanical merit, as its singular beauty of action : it -is pro perly termed a self-acting machine, and, to the eye of taste is equally Sing in its conception, its organization, and its effect. The .self-acting Hydraulic Orrery seems, indeed, to lay open a new field for the display ot ttj\"-^, it seems, engaged, some time back, in a series of experiments, to determine the resistances opposed to floating bodies pa stg though fluid ; and his method of performing these will, we presume, he intlrestin? to our scientific readers, both as it led to the invention of the mach n we are about to describe, and as it exhibits the rationale of us con- \"'T'circular reservoir of water was provided, having a small perpendicular shaft erected Tn the centre, and the vessel which formed the particular sub-"], [22, "6 SELF-MOVING ORRERY. ject of experiment was placed upon the water, near the circumference, but connected with the centre, by an arbor extending to the shaft, and supported by a float. The vessel was pierced in the bottom, and the shorter extremity of a siphon being soldered into the opening, the longer leg hung over the circumference of the reservoir. This leg, unlike ihat of the ordinary siphon, was closed at the bottom, but a small aperture being made, the water spouted through it, in a direction at right angles to the arbor, and the vessel imme. diately began to move with accelerated velocity in an opposite course: in a second or two it arrived at a maximum, and the future progress exhibited that delightful, equable, gliding motion, which seems to afford the only tiue similitude to the sdent grandeur ofthe celestial movements. Tlie principle upon which this experiment was made, is that of the well known philosophical machine called \"Barker's Mill;\" but the grand im provement consisted in combining that principle with a siphon, supported by a floating body ; by which means, a peifectly uniform head of water (and, consequently, of action) was preserved, and the mechanical friction almost annihilated. Having completed his temporary experiments, the author next endea voured to apply this beautiful combination to some other purpose of general usefulness ; and: it immediately occurred to him, that an Orrery might be so constructed upon hydraulic principles, as, by their instrumentality, to afford a more perfect and accurate representation of the harmonious move ment of the heavenly bodies, than had yet been effected. Orreries are now too generally known to be otherwise than famibar to every well-informed person : these instruments, however, have hitherto been constructed by a complication of wheel-work, which, although extremely in genious, are nevertheless almost unequal to the imitation of those equable, silent, and undeviating movements, which characterize the grandest works of the Creator. The Hydraulic Orrery, on the contrary, possesses all the advantages of the former machines, together with the distinguishing cha racteristic of self-action, and a perfect imitation ofthe motions, as well as the positions, of the planetary bodies. It will be recollected that, to constitute an orrery, it is not necessary that the machine should include all the pla nets ; a machine, which represents the motions of the sun, the earth, and the moon, is still an orrery ; and to these bodies, with Jupiter and his satellites, Mr. Busby first applied his hydraulic principles. It appears, however, he has recently arranged and organized a plan for a more exten sive Hydraulic Orrery, in which the most remote planets and their satellites are included. In the centre of his exhibition room was placed a circular reservoir, five feet diameter. The Sun, represented by a ball of nine inches diameter, sustained upon a slender shaft, about two feet above the surface of the water, and borne by a small circular floating vessel in the middle of the reservoir; this vessel carried a syphon, which discharged a minute lateral stream into a separate, floating rim, or concentric circular vessel, which surrounds it. The re-action of this discharge causes the vessel bearing the Sun to revolve upon an axis erected in the centre of a bar, extended dia metrically across the inner circle of the rim, or surrounding vessel. The water thus received into the room flows along a tube beneath the surface of a reservoir, and enters a floating cylindrical chamber at the other ex tremity. In the centre of this chamber a tube is erected, through which a forked rod passes, and bears the Earth, represented by a ball of three"], [23, "7 SELF-MOVING ORRfiRY. inches diameter, at an appropriate elevation, and having its axis duly in- clined to the ecliptic. A separate floating rim surrounds the cylindric chamber, bearing the shaft which carries the Moon, on one side, and a re- acting syphon on the other, the discharge from which impels it round the shaft which beari the Earth. This floating rim also acts, by contact, upon a small wheel, attached to a slender rod, communicating by an universal joint with the axis of the Earth, and thus causes that body to revolve ; while the action of a vertical wheel, with a radiating axis rolling round a horizontal circle fixed to the rod sustaining the Earth, gives motion to a small crank, which imparts an ascending and descending motion to the Moon, and pro- duces the obliqi.ity of its orbit; and a calculated disparity between the dia- meters of the vertical wheel, and the circle upon which it rolls, causes these ascending and descending motions to take place in a less period than one revolution of the Moon, and thus gives the due changes ofthe nodes. The shaft which bears the Earth is continued beneath the surface of the water, and a flat plate, of six inches diameter, is connected with a plate of equal diameter at the circumference, by three parallel and oblique rods extending to it at the bottom of the centre of the reservoir, thus preserving the parallelism of the Earth's axis, on a principle analogous to that of a pa rallel ruler, at the same time the lateral motion of the central vessel, bearing the Sun, is prevented by a spur, which embraces the circumference of the plate beneath. But, as the water which is discharged by the two siphons already de scribed, would soon fill the receptacles, the operation of a third siphon is introduced, which carries away the superfluous water, and, by its lateral discharge on the outside the general reservoir, gives the annual motion of the Earth and Moon about the Sun. We have thus attempted to describe the construction of this beautiful machine, but mere description does but imperfectly convey an idea of its effect in action. Our plate correctly represents its appearance on an enlarged scale, and (on a design of our own) under circumstances which, in actual construction, would render it of delightful interest; but its evolutions must be seen to be understood, its novelty and beauty of action felt and appreciated. In another part of the room, an ingenious apparatus represented the planet Jupiter and his satellites. In this the planet is centrally supported on a circular floating vessel, and the satellites are borne by concentric float ing vessels at their due distances, respectively, from the primary. The primary receives its motion by the action of a stream of rarefied air, which proceeds from the flame of a small lamp, and, acting against an inclined shade, or sail, is thrown out in an horizontal direction. Thus the circular vessel bearing Jupiter, is made to revolve ; the motion of this vessel imparts a gyratory motion to the whole body of water, by/ transmission from the several concentric vessels; and the vessels bearing the satellites are, con sequently, made to revolve by the action of the water itself, with velocities regularly diminishing as their distances from the primary increase. The Hydraulic Orrery, its inventor has justly observed, may be erected on the most extensive scale, on a natural or artificial basin in the open air, or would form an interesting appendage to a conservatory or aquarium; but, as there exists no practical obstruction to the erection of these beautiiul orreries on the great scale, we venture to recommend them as suitable or naments for all public places in which a suitable piece of water occupies a commanding site. And we are decidedly of opinion, that an arrangement"], [24, "8 rvland's orrery. of this self-acting machinery, in any such situation, would do more to pro mote a love of science and general astronomical information, than any thing that has been yet effected with that intention. RYLAND'S LIVING ORRERY. The singular beauty and attractive simplicity of the Busby Orrery, and the unlimited scale on which it may be practically employed, is approached (it is certainly not equalled) by a contrivance for a popular exhibition of the planetary system, by John Ryland, in his elementary treatise of Me chanics, in the year 1768 ; and a more extensive and more perfectly or ganized arrangement, by De Vaux, announced in his treatise on the Longi tude. \u2014 Ryland's description is simple and concise; he designates his arrange ment as \" a living orrery, made with sixteen school-boys.\" And, speaking of astronomy as a science capable of popular illustration, he says, \" It may be taught them in their play-hours with as much pleasure as they learn to play at marbles, or drive an hoop for an hour or two ; and this may be done in the following manner : \" Take sixteen blank cards ; write on one, the Sun ; a seventeenth boy of a large size must be used for the Sun in the centre, with his diameter, which is seven hundred thousand miles. On another card write Mercury, with his period, eighty-eight days, distance from the Sun thirty-two millions, diameter two thousand six hundred miles, and hourly motion, which is one hundred thousand miles. So go on to Venus, our Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Then write on your other cards the names and periods of the ten moons in our system. Having thus furnished your cards, then pro vide the orbits for' these sham planets; go into any plain field or place, where boys can play; draw a circle of two hundred feet diameter, which you may easily do with a cord and a broom-stick, ordering one boy to hold the cord in the centre, while you describe the circle with the stick at the other end of the string. When you have formed your circle, divide the semidiameter into one hundred parts ; if you choose exactness, take five of these parts from the centre, and describe a circle for Mercury's orbit; take seven parts for the orbit of Venus ; ten parts for our Earth's orbit; fifteen parts for the orbit of Mars; fifty-two parts, that is fifty-two fee , for the orbit of Jupiter. And let the outward circle of a hundred feet represent the orbit of Saturn, which is the boundary of the Newtonian system. After this draw your circles for our Moon round the Earth, for Jupiter's moons round him, and, last of all, for Saturn's five moons. There is no occasion to be scru pulously exact till the boys are well versed in these first easy notions; reduce them to accuracy by degrees. Whiston's Astronomical Principles of Religion, and Ferguson's Astronomy, will furnish ample materials for all your purposes. Now begin your play ; fix your boys in their circles, each with his card in his hand, and then put your orrery in motion, giving each boy a direction to move from west to east; Mercury to move swiftest, and the others in proportion to their distances, and each boy repeating in his turn the contents of his card, concerning, his distance, magnitude, period, and hourly motion. Half an hour spent in this play once a week will, in the com pass of a year, fix such clear and sure ideas ofthe solar system, as they can never forget to the last hour of their life; and will probably rouse sparks of genius, which will kindle into a bright and beautiful flame in the manlv nart of life. J r"], [25, "9 DE VAUX'S MILITARY ORRERY. De Vaux's arrangement is evidently built on, and in all probability sug gested by, Ryland's method. Of its ingenuity, and its excellence of prac tical effecl, we cannot doubt ; but its originality, after the proposal of our countryman Ryland, we are bound to question. De Vaux thus describes his method : \u2014 \" Let us suppose that you have a plea^re-ground in the Isle of Wight, containing a large grass-plot about 400 feet diameter, with a southern aspect towards the bay of St. Helen's, forming a declivity of 231 degrees from the centre. In this centre should be a round pavilion, having a sky-light and windows all round. This pavilion will be our observatory, and at the same time will represent the Sun in the middle of our planetary system. As this pavilion must contain company and music, &c. it must be at least 20 feet diameter ; which diameter representing that ofthe Sun, and the dis tance of the Earth from the Sun being 100 of his diameter, if we intended to place the Earth at its true distance from the Sun, relative to its diameter, then the Earth's place or orbit would be 2,000 feet from the Sun, and the diameter of the Earth in this hypothesis would be only 2-12ths inches ; and, consequently, the superior planets would be, in proportion, at a distance too considerable for our object; but if we keep that proportion two 2-12ths inches for the diameter of the Earth, and if we follow the same for all the other planets, we shall have Mercury 2-10ths of an inch, Venus 2 inches, the Earth 2-12ths inches, Mars one 2-12ths inches, Jupiter 2 feet, Saturn 1 foot 8 inches, and Georgium 10 inches. \" As to the distances of each planet from the Sun (which is the semi-dia meter of each of their orbits,) if we adopt their proportional distances, as in the last line of the above table, we shall have Mercury 4 feet, Venus 7, the Earth 10, Mars 15, Jupiter 52, Saturn 95, and Georgium 190 feet dis tance from their centre, the Sun, that is to say, from our pavilion \" Now, let us trace our planisphere, as it should be done before the build ing of the pavilion. For this purpose, take a cord, at least 190 feet long; tie a peg at each end ; fix one of these pegs at the centre point ; deduce 10 feet for the semidiameter ofthe pavilion; then, at 190 feet farther, trace with the other peg a circle, which will be the orbit of the remotest planet Georgium. Double the cord in two, and at 95 feet from the surface of the pavilion's place, you will have the orbit of Saturn to trace there. At the distance of 52 feet from the pavilion, you will trace the orbit of Jupiter; at 15 feet, that of Mars; that ofthe Earth at 10 feet; of Venus at 7; and of Mercury at 4 feet, from the outside of the pavilion. Each of these circular lines must be the middle of a gravel-walk, which will be the track of each planet. It would not occasion a great deal more trouble to turn these cir cles into ellipses ; but as these orbits, except that of Mercury, have little eccentricity, and have different nodes, which change situations every year, though very slowly, we must content ourselves in determining the ellipsis of the earth. The eccentricity of this orbit is the sixtieth part of the diameter of that orbit. As we have given to this diameter 20 feet, the sixtieth part of it is four inches. Then we shall trace the elliptic orbit of the Earth, as usual, by ellipse figure ; but in such a manner, that the north point of it shall be four inches nearer the Sun, and the other extremity of that diameter eight inches farther.

The Sun itself will be a collection of reflectors, or a focus of the most brilliant light possible, and the pavilion will be erected over it, being supported by light pillars, in order that the specta tors or observers in the pavilion may see better the effect of the whole ; which they could not, if their eyes were struck with lights. \" Each of the globular transparencies of the planets will be the head of some sort of god or goddess, such as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and his most gracious majesty, sitting in little cars; which cars will be directed from west to east, and drawn by seven soldiers or other men accus tomed to march in measure. \" I should have said that each of these transparencies will be not only of different bulk, but also of different degrees of brightness, or apparent colour, according to their distances, or their natural aspect ; and besides, on the opposite side of the Sun, a dark hemisphere must be adapted to each planet. By this means each planet can be made to have a diurnal rotation in that dark hemisphere. It will have this advantage also, that any spectator placed near the Earth, (that is to say geocentrically,) or near some other planets, will be able to see the different phases, even of the Earth, which will be very curious ; because all these effects, which require so much obser vation and study, will be produced at once, and in a short time, though proportionally as exact as can be expected of an artificial experiment. \" To put this planetary system in motion at pleasure, you have only to give your order, to make a signal, or to say, ' march ;' then the music be ginning to play a march, and each soldier making his step in measure, the planets will execute their revolution in due time relatively one to the other; that is to say, the nearest to the Sun will make as many revolutions as they do in the sky during the great revolutions of the superior ones. \" For this effect, if the musicians regulate each measure to be in two seconds in time, the soldiers will also make each of their steps in two seconds; then each soldier holding the pole of his car with the right hand, and march ing on the border of his path, the extent of his steps will be regulated by as many short sticks lying flat on the side of the gravel, but not in the way of the car, and upon which stick the soldiers will place the middle of their feet at each step : so that if the orbit of Georgium, the farthest planet, is walked over in eighty minutes, (each step ofthe soldier being only six inches,) and the orbit of the earth (which is only thirty steps of two feet, or sixty seconds in time,) in one minute, the Earth will make eighty revolutions during one of the Georgium, which is conformable to nature, and so on in proportion with all the others. \" In the space then of one hour and twenty minutes, you will be able to make a whole treatise of practical astronomy.\" Some useful appendages to the orrery are described after this, which are, however, of minor importance, and would occupy too much space tp insert.

The tottering re mains of the old structure will be at that time, and are hourly beooming, an object of still greater singularity. We purpose to devote a few of our pages to each \u2014 one, because it is rapidly approaching to that state in which it will be, of all others, the most useful architectural novelty of this building age ; the other, because in a few short years the crumbling mass, which for centu ries has trembled under the still increasing roll of commercial intercourse, will be seen but in picture, its grotesque ruin to be conceived only by the attentive perusal of what the historian and the painter shall enrol to perpe tuate the disgrace of its so-long continuance, under the gaze, as it were, and within the scope of comparison, with the happiest efforts of bridge-building of any age or country. The subjoined engraving presents the new bridge of the metropolis, as it will appear when completed to a spectator, situated over the middle of the river nearly opposite the Tower, and a height above the water of about fifty feet, or the topmast head of an ordinary merchant vessel. From that situation he will see the structure itself as we have de picted it, and with it the Southwark and Blaekfriars bridges. Of the necessity of the new bridge, to the credit of the first metropolis of Europe, as well as the better safety of the labouring community, there is"], [29, "NEW LONDON BRIDGE. 13 \u25a0unfortunately no question at the present day ; the average annual loss of thirty human beings, and twenty thousand pounds in actual property, which for thirty years has been the frightful consequence of its whirlpools and sweeping cataracts, satisfyevery resident of London. Foreigners accustomed to the metropolitan buildings of the Continent, feel our old city bridge to bend beneath their tread, and shrink from the prospect afforded by a glance through the crumbling fence which stands between them and the horrible chaos below. It is sufficient for us to say in this place, that the old bridge has stood upwards of 600 years, and has probably cost the Corporation more for repairs, than would have sufficed to employ the best talent of the country in the erection often new bridges ! The new bridge is building on the western side of the old one ; and as near to it as is practicable. Its material is Scotch granite, which ensures the important points of durability and beauty. Its arrangement consists of five elliptical arches, the central one of which is of 150 feet span between the piers : the next two are of 140 feet each ; and the two arches adjoin ing the abutments are 120 feet each. The height of the middle arch, on the under side, above the level of high-water mark, at spring-tide, is 30 feet, and, from the low-water mark, at the lowest, 48 feet. The great al titude thus given to the road-way, is an important desideratum, inasmuch as it enables vessels of 200 tons burthen to pass through its arches, by lowering topmasts. The acclivity to passengers on the road will, on the other hand, be reduced, by carrying the curve-line farther each way from the river, reaching, in all probability, at least a quarter of a mile towards Gracechurch Street, on one side, and to St. Margaret's hill, in the Borough, on the other. The scene to be imagined on the completion of this structure will surelv improve the general appearance of the metropolis from the river ; and if we may not then realize the picture which Milton drew, \u2014 \" On each side an imperial city stood, With towers and temples proudly elevate,\" we may look, at least, for an improvement, which will bring us nearer the level to neighbouring France. We are as jealous as Englishmen ought to be of all national distinction, and are as desirous of generous emulation ; but none of us, who have visited Paris, will deny that, in the architectural beauty of their metropolis, the French are probably a century and a half in advance of us. If we might be allowed by the reader to pass from plain descriptive matter of fact, a few steps, into philosophical reverie, we would observe, that, to us, there is much natural grandeur in the view of large and beautiful cities, \u2014 a beauty far surpassing the scenery of Nature in her own form. We greatly prefer the view of a large city, to the best Alpine scenery : let others admire whitening cataracts, and pyramidical mountains, hiding in the clouds their useless magnitude: we experience a more intense delight in contemplating the buildings of man, \u2014 of stones, which mind has moved, and shaped into habitations for myriads of men, \u2014 of rivers, which bridges yoke, and naviga- tion beswims. The ages which have been necessary to nurse and rear a large city into its present immensity ; the quantity of human labour which has been employed to produce this vast, convenient, tenantable arrangement ; the study, the refinement, the art, the intellect, which were required to im press so tasteful an exterior form, where the sculpture of every capital carries back the imagination to Athens and to Rome; the thousand roads and"], [30, "14 NEW LONDON BRIDGE. water-courses ; the extensive cultivation and commerce, which the habitations of so condensed and thronged a population imply ; the great events of which those cities have been the nest and the seat; the imperial authority which they exercise over distant men and distant ages, in opinions, in laws, and in institutions, \u2014 all these crowd on the mind of the contemplative man, and become immediately associated with the walls and roofs, the pinnacles and bridges, above, about, and underneath. This sort of prospect, far the most delightful which the surface of the earth can supply, is enjoyed on a grand scale from any great elevation in London, but the view is too vast to admit of any attention to beauties of de- tail : works of sculpture and architecture even form a more subordinate portion of the whole; hence that train of ideas, which carries back the ima- gination to classical antiquity, is less necessarily and less powerfully excited ; but the immeasurably wider extent of builded space, houses rising above houses, streets stretching beyond streets, palaces, theatres, temples, climbing from among the endless mass of edihees, further than the eye can trace in any direction ; and, more than all, the majestic Thames, with the ideas of world-encompassing commerce and empire which its forest of masts is adapt ed to excite, give it, on the whole, a more stimulant effect. \" Thames, the most lov'd of all the Ocean's sons, By his old sire, to his embraces runs, Hasting to pay his tribute to the sea, Like mortal life to meet eternity.

His genuine and less guilty wealth t' explore, Search not the bottom, but survey his shore ; O'er which he kindly spreads his spacious wing, And hatches plenty for th' ensuing Spring ; Nor then destroys it with too fond a stay, Like mothers which their infants overlay ; Nor with a sudden and impetuous wave, Like kings profuse, resume the wealth he gave : No unexpected inundations spoil The mower's hopes, nor mock the ploughman'? toil *, But godlike his unwearied bounty slows. .

This most extraordinary of all our metropobtan bridges stands too inti mately connected, in many points of consideration, with the erection of the new stone bridges, and the demolition of the ancient one, side by side with them, as its locality recommends. This stupendous undertaking, of which we have, by much activity, and especial permission, presented our readers with a perspective view, bids fair to surpass in its boldness and design, and extraordinary architectural effect, any of our metropolitan bridge structures. Neither our own limits, nor the quantity of detail to be obtained by possibility of an extensive building of this character, before erection, allow us to give much more ex planation of it than is distinctly conveyed by the engraving, and which will, with the mass of our friends, be, after all, assuredly, the most satisfactory. The intended situation of the bridge is immediately below the Tower of London, directly over the river to Bermondsey ; making an angle with the course of the river at that place of about twenty degrees from a right-angled direction, inclining towards the east. Hie bridge is itself of iron, with solid piers of masonry. It is on the Suspension plan, and is composed entirely of iron chains or jointed bars : the middle arch, or stretch, which it makes actually over the river, is six hundred feet in width, out of one thousand, the whole width of the river. The piers are four in number, exclusive of the two abutments ; and the entire stretch of the bridge, which is to allow the passage of vessels not requiring more than eighty-five feet in height, will ex-"], [32, "16 IRON BRIDGES. ceed three thousand feet ! It will commence at the bottom ofthe Minories, and passing over Little Tower Hill, at an elevation above the road and path ways of more than thiity feet, increasing, as it passes over St. Catharine's, to seventy feet, it will cross the river to Shad Thames, a few yards below Horselvdown stairs ; and thence making its way over the present state of that neighbourhood, literally over streets and houses, it will cross Gains ford-street, Abdy-street, Thornton-street, &c, and will terminate its course in Russell-street and Dock-street, whence a new line will be continued to the New Cut from the Neckenger. The distance between the points of suspension of each span, is six hundred feet. The height of the centre opening, or arch, above high-water, eighty five feet. The inclination of the road-way, over the bridge, is one foot in each thirty feet. The width of the carriage-way is twenty-one feet. The width of the footpath on each side is eight feet. The total length of bridge and inclined planes, three thousand four hundred feet! ! ! The adoption of iron for the purposes of bridge-building, may be con sidered as a perfect triumph of art, and it is surprising that no iron bridge crossed the Thames previous to 1814, although a magnificent specimen was erected several years since across the river Wear, at Sunderland. The Southwark Bridge, which crosses the river by three colossal strides between Queennithe and Bankside, was originally projected by Mr. John Wyatt, and designed and erected by the late John Rennie, Esq. The bridge part is composed of cast-iron, and consists of three arches, being seg ments of circles. The middle arch has a rise of only twenty-four feet, but its span is 240 feet : it is composed of eight ribs, rivefted to diagonal braces : each principal rib is six feet deep at the top of the arch, and extends gra dually to eight feet at the abutments, or parts that rest upon the stone-work. The clear opening of this arch is forty-three feet above low-water mark. The iron-work was cast by Messrs. Walker, at Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where it was put together, previous to its being shipped for London. It was built at the expense of a joint-stock company, and, including its avenues, the charges amounted to about 800,000/.; the building occupying from Sep tember,^^, to April,1819. Vauxhall Bridge is likewise of cast-iron, consisting of nine arches, of equal space, supported by stone piers. Each arch is seventy-eight feet space, and twenty-nine feet in height; breadth of the road-way, thirty-six feet; and the whole length, 809 feet. The expense of erecting this bridge was about 150,000/., and it was first opened to the public in 1814. In our admiration for these monuments of human ingenuity, we should not overlook the beneficence of that Power at whose hands mankind are blessed with such important materials for administering to the comforts and conveniences of domestic and social life. Even a moment's reflection will fill us with gratitude and extasy. An iron mine is, perhaps, one of the finest spectacles that can be imagined ; and a granite quarry is so interesting a scene, as to induce us to explore Nature, step by step, amidst her hidden world of wonders, and, by study and research, to arrive at the most im portant facts in the history of creation.

At what precise period this bridge was built, does not exactly appear ; but, according to the Saxon Annals, there was none in the year 993. Stowe tells us, from a tradition delivered to him by Linsted, the last prior of the College of St. Mary Overie, now St. Saviour's, who surrendered the house to Henry VIII., that there was, long before the Conquest, a House of Sisters founded by a maiden, named Mary, and endowed, by her, with the profits of a ferry across the Thames ; that, afterwards, it was converted, by a noble lady, named Swithen, into a college of priests ; who, in place of the ferry, built the first bridge over the Thames, of timber, and kept it in repair. That Stowe re ceived this account from the prior, there is no doubt ; but, says the Editor of the History of St. Mary Overie's Church, \" it is inconsistent to suppose that the priests would build a bridge, if they were able to do so, or that they would give up the certain profits ofthe ferry for those resulting from an ex pensive undertaking, the extent of which could not be calculated upon, owing to frequent repairs,\" &c. It is both amusing and instructive to reflect on the changes and revolutions which are effected by short-lived man, or rather by that grand march of im provement, which is the proudest characteristic of social prosperity.

Such is civilization in embryo. We have been led into these musings by the present appearance of the old London Bridge, and the associations connected with that structure; especially when we considered that it will speedily disappear, and thus live only in the pages of history, and the recollection of our contemporaries. The original foundation of this bridge it is difficult to ascertain. The first mention, however, we find of it, is in the laws of Ethelred, which fix the tolls of vessels coming to Billingsgate. The first bridge was of timber, situate somewhat more eastward than the present, and was built by order of that sovereign, in 1002 ; this falling to de cay, another timber bridge was erected in 1165; and, at length, in 1176, 22 Hemy II. , one Peter, of Colechurch, was appointed to erect a stone bridge. He continued the work during the reign of Henry II. , Richard I., and till the latter end of the second year of King John : when he died, he was interred in a tomb which he had erected for himself in the middle of a chapel, called St. Thomas, which he had constructed in the centre pier ofthe bridge. Isembert, an ingenious architect, who had then lately completed the bridge of Rochelle and Xaintes, near Bourdeaux, in France, was appointed to carry on this work, being by advice of Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury^ and others, recommended to the mayor and citizens of London, by King John, by his letters patent, dated April 18, in the third year of his reign. Isembert was ultimately employed to complete the bridge, chapels, &c, which were not finished till some time after the 15th year of King John. Stowe says, that \" The mason or builder not only erected the chapel, but endowed the same, for two priests, four clerks, &c. This chapel was dedicated to St. Thomas, of Canterbury ; and therein was preserved a fair table of the gifts and donations of different lands given to support this bridge. Some houses and buildings were, at the first, erected on this part of the bridge ; and the revenues of those houses applied towards the expenses ofthe building. The middle parts were formerly used for shows, tournaments, and public diver sions; and many years after this bridge was finished, sterlings were fixed round each of the piers. Thus it continued till the dissolution of religious houses, when the chapel of St. Thomas was turned into a dwelling-house.\" A drawbridge, protected by a strong tower, formed a portion of the edifice about this time : and on the top of the latter it was customary to place the heads and quarters of persons executed for state offences. A map of the city, in 1597, represents all these features ofthe bridge, as it existed at that time. \" Colechurch,\" says Malcolm, \"delighted in' the number of his piers, which amounted to nineteen.\" \u2014 \u25a0 Although the revenues ofthe structure were considerable, the demands for repairs were so great as to render repeated applications to the legislature necessary. In 1756, when it was in contemplation to erect a bridge at Blaekfriars, the clerk of the city works reported that he found the piles of London bridge perfect, except about an inch, which, being the sappy portion, had decayed. He conjectured, that piles were driven close together, nearly in a mass, under each pier ; and that they remained in perfect condition, or the stones above them would have been disjointed and broken. Continual accidents occurred, the necessary consequences of the contracted passage between the"], [35, "19 OLD LONDON BRIDGE. houses erected upon the bridge. Such was the liability they suffered of having their windows broken by the bargemen, when they inadvertently per- mitted candles to burn in the back rooms. Mr. Deputy James Hodges de- clared, that he \" had frequently known it happen, that coals had been thrown through the windows of the houses out of the barges going under the bridge ; and that, as he is informed, the reason is, that the candle-lights in the houses make it dangerous in the night-time to go through the lock. That people on the river have always a glimmering light, by which they can distinguish objects, unless a very thick fog. That light leaves them, just when they come to shoot the locks, as far as the shadows of the houses extends, and thereby they lose the possibility of discerning the passage between the sterlings.\" At length, the whole street becoming a losing concern, measures were taken to improve the bridge. This gentleman observed, \" that the estate is in so bad a condition that it must be taken down ; and that the City of Lon- don built ten houses, which did not bring them in 2/. per cent., and the estate must soon come to nothing.\" Two persons elected by the livery of London, as bridge-masters, received the rents and profits ; which, with those of other estates appropriated for London bridge, amounted, in 1755, to 6457/. 2s. 6|</. in favour of the bridge ; but the corporation did not conceive themselves capable of supporting the expenses ofthe intended alteration. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London appointed, in pursuance ofthe act of 29 George IL, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four commoners, to put the act in execution. Those persons found it necessary to convert two arches into one, and erected a temporary bridge* over it : the toll on which amounted to about 2000/. in eighteen months : that ordered to be collected from boats passing under the arches, was so difficult to obtain, that, though it had been estimated at 1600/., but 645/. had been received in the same length of time. Mr. Dance declared, in 1758, \" that the works then remaining to be done would require 55,000/., exclusive of 4000/., the cost ofthe temporary bridge, and necessary purchases to the amount of 14,000/.\" By an act of the 7th of George III., the sum of 30,000/. was granted to the city (as trustees of the estate appropriated to the support of London bridge,) for purchasing and redeeming the tolls thereon ; and the lease of the same; the tolls themselves, as well as those of the bridge at Blaekfriars, which were intended to have ceased at Michaelmas, 1770, being by the said act to have continuance until the city should, by and out of the same, be re- imbursed what they should advance in payment. It is asserted by our historians, that the piers of London bridge were built by the trifling labour of emptying the river ; and by turning the course of the stream to the south, in a canal cut from Rotherhithe to Battersea. This ridiculous story had its origin from that of Canute conveying his flat-bot- tomed vessels round the bridge, which he might readily accomplish by the exertions of his army, who soon dug a canal fit for the purpose ; which re- quired no coffer-dams, or extraordinary work to resist the pressure of water. Stowe and his continuators have collected many particulars of casualties attending this bridge ; but they have omitted the following extract from Lid gate's poem, descriptive of Henry the Sixth's entry into the metropolis from France, which is highly amusing. lidgate's verses. \" All of assent who so can conceive Their noble king ware glad to receive. * This temporary bridge was wholly consumed by fire, April 11, 1758."], [36, "regent's park. 20 Their clothing was of colour full covenable The noble mayor clad in red velvet ; The sheriffs, the aldermen full notable, In furred cloaks, the colour of scarlet.

Notwithstanding the improvements in 1756, many accidents happened here, and many lives are annually lost, through the want of sufficient passage for the water, on the reflux ofthe tide, which occasions a fall of nearly five feet. The piers are from twenty-five to thirty-four feet in thickness, and with the sterlings and immense quantities of stone and chalk, sunk here to protect the dilapidated foundations, they reduce the water-way to 450 feet, nearly one half of the total width of the river in this part. The length of this bridge is 915 feet, its width 45 feet; and the span of the centre arch is 72 feet. REGENT'S PARK, MARYLEBONE. Rus in ur be.

Old recollections \u2014 recollections of youth, upon which we love to dwell as we advance into the shadowed part of our life's road, are remorselessly stricken aside by this change in pleasant localities ; we almost mourn over the loss of the old trees and paths which stood as quiet mementos of the cheerful rambles of our boyish days, or, it may be, of love-hallowed walks, and looks, and tender words first ventured under the influence of the fields and the comparative retirement. Nothing makes the lover bold and the mistress tender so well as the fresh and fragrant air, the green herbage, the quiet and privacy of country spots, which, when near towns, are more exciting by the contrast. \" A few years, however, have elapsed, and we are not only reconciled to the change alluded to, but rejoice in it. A noble park is rapidly rising up, if we may use such an expression, and a vast space, close by the metropolis, not only preserved from the encroachment of mean buildings, but laid out with groves, lakes, and villas, with their separate pleasure-grounds, while through the whole place there is a winding road, which commands at every turn some fresh features of an extensive country prospect. \"This is, indeed, a desirable appendage to so vast a town as London, more especially\" as the rage for building fills every pleasant outlet with bricks, mortar, rubbish, and eternal scaffold-poles, which, whether you walk east, west, north, or south, seem to be running after you. We heard a gentleman say, the other day, that he was sure a resident of the suburbs could scarcely lie down after dinner, and take a nap, without finding, when he awoke, that a new row of buildings had started up since he closed his eyes. It is cer- tainly astonishing: one would think the builders used magic, or steam at least, and it would be curious to ask those gentlemen in what part of the neighbouring counties they intend London should end. Not content with separate streets, squares, and rows, they are actually the founders of new towns, which, in the space of a few months, become finished and inhabited. The precincts of London have more the appearance of a newly-discovered colony than the suburbs of an ancient city.* * For instance : in what, a short time back, were the Bayswater fields, there is now a popu lous district, called by the inhabitants \" Moscow;\" and at the foot of Primrose Hill we are amazed by coming upon a large complication of streets, Ste. under the name of \" Portland Town.\" The rustic and prim\u00e6val meadows of Kilbum are also filling with raw buildings and incipient roads ; to say nothing of the charming neighbourhood of St John's Wood Farm, and other spots nearer town. \" The artificial causes of the extension of the town,\" says Mr. Nash, in one of hi\u00bb Reports to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, \" are the speculations of builders, encouraged and promoted by merchants dealing in the materials of building, and attomies, with monied clients, facilitating, and, indeed, putting in motion, the whole system, by disposing of their clients' money in premature mortgages, the sale of improved ground rents, and by numerous other devices, by which their clients make an advantageous use of their money, and the attomies create to themselves a lucrative business from the agreements, assignments, leases, mortgages, bonds, and other instruments of law, which become necessary throughout such complicated and intricate transactions. It is not necessary for the present pur pose to enumerate the bad consequences and pernicious effects which arise from such an unnatural and forced enlargement of the town, further than to observe, that it is the interest of those concerned in such buildings, that they should be of as little cost as possible, preserving"], [38, "regent's park. \u25a022 \" The noble appropriation of the district of which we are now speaking is not so much a change as a restoration. It was formerly a park, and had a royal palace in it, where, we believe, Queen Elizabeth occasionally resided. It was disparked by Oliver Cromwell, who settled it on Colonel Thomas Harrison's Regiment of Dragoons for their pay ; but, at the restoration of Charles II. it passed into the hands of other possessors, from which time it has descended through different proprietors, till, al length, it has reverted to the crown, by whose public spirit a magnificent park is secured to the in habitants of London. The expense of its planting, &c. must have been enormous, but money cannot be better laid out than on purposes of this lasting benefit and national ornament. \"The plan and size of the Park is in every respect worthy of the nation. It is larger than Hyde-Park, St. James's, and tlie Green-Park together ; and the trees planted in it, about ten years ago, are already becoming um brageous. The water is very extensive. As you are rowed on it, the va riety of views you come upon is admirable : sometimes, you are in a narrow stream, closely overhung by the branches of trees ; presently, you open upon a wide sheet of water, like a lake, with swans sunning themselves on its bosom ; by and by, your boat floats near the edge of a smooth lawn, fronting one of the villas ; and then, again, you catch the perspective of a range of su perb edifices, the elevation of which is contrived lo have the effect of one palace. The Park, in fact, is to be belted with groups of these mansions, entirely excluding all sight of the streets. One of them is, indeed, finished ; and gives a satisfactory earnest of the splendid spirit in which the whole is to be accomplished. There will be nothing like it in Europe. The villas in the interior of the Park are planted out from the view of each other, so that the inhabitant of each seems, in his prospect, to be the sole lord of the sur rounding picturesque scenery. \" In the centre of the Park there is a circular plantation of immense cir cumference, and in the interior of this you are in a perfect Arcadia. The mind cannot conceive any thing more hushed, more sylvan, more entirely removed from the slightest evidence of proximity to a town. Nothing is audible there except the songs of birds and the rustling of leaves. Kensing ton Gardens, beautiful as they are, have no seclusion so perfect as this. \" We cannot recommend a better thing to such of our readers as have leisure, than a day spent in wandering amidst the union of stately objects and rural beauty which constitute the charm of Marylebone Park.\" Literary Pocket Book. an attractive exterior, which Parker's stucco, coloured bricks, and balconies, accomplish ; and a fashionable arrangement of rooms on the principal floors, embellished by the paper-hanger, and a few flimsy marble chimney-pieces, are the attractions of the interior. These are sufficient allurements to the public, and insure the sale of the houses, which is the ultimatMbject ofthe builders ; and to this finery every thing out of sight is sacrificed, or is no furtheran object of attention than that no defects in the constructive and substantial parts shall make their appear. ance while the houses are on sale; and, it is to be feared, that, for want of those essentials, which constitute the strength and permanency of houses, a very few years will exhibit cracked walls, swagged floors, bulged fronts, crooked roofs, leaky gutters, inadequate drains, and other iUs of an originally bad constitution ; and it is quite certain, without a renovation equal to rc-building, that all those houses, long, ver) long, before the expiration of the leases, will cease to exist, and the reversionary estate the proprietors look for will never be realized, as it is not till the end of the builder's term that the proprietor of the fee will be entitled to the additional ground-rents laid on by the builder. It is evidently, therefore, not the interest of the Crown that Marylebone Park should be covered with buildings of that description."], [39, "23 THE DIORAMA, regent's park. The canvas smooth, With glowing life protuberant, to the view Embodied rose.\" Thomson. For several years past, the visitors of our metropolis have been delighted with the splendid and tastefully executed Panoramic paintings of Messrs. Barker and Burford. The Diorama is, however, a mechanical improvement on these exhibitions, which consists in placing the pictures on painted sce- nery, intended to form the exhibition, within a building so constructed, that the saloon or amphitheatre, containing the spectators, may be caused to revolve at intervals, for the purpose of bringing in succession two or more distinct scenes or pictures into view, and without the necessity of the spec- tators removing from their seats. From this arrangement of the revolving saloon, the scenery or pictures themselves remain stationary, and, therefore, admit of the application of the improved method of distributing or directing the daylight upon or through them, so as to produce the effects of varying the light and shade, by means of a number of coloured transparent and moveable blinds or curtains, some of which blinds are placed behind the picture or scenery, for the purpose of intercepting and changing the colour and shade of the rays of light, which are permitted to shine or pass through certain semi-transparent parts of the said picture or scenery, and thereby effect many curious changes in the appearance of the colour, in proportion as the said coloufed blinds are moved up and down, which motion is performed in a particular order by certain lines or cords connected with suitable machinery. Others of these coloured transparent blinds or curtains are situated above and in front of the pictures or scenery, so as to be moveable by the aid of cords or lines as aforesaid, and by that means to distribute or direct the rays of light which are permitted to fall upon the face of the picture, at the same time that the rays of light, in passing through the coloured blinds, effect many sur- prising changes in the appearance of the colours of the painting or scenery, and thereby form this pleasing exhibition. It will be seen that the Diorama differs from the Panorama in this respect, that instead of a circular view of the objects represented, it exhibits the whole picture at once in perspective, and is decidedly superior in the accuracy with which the objects are depicted, and in the completeness of the illusion. This exhibition, after having long delighted and surprised the gay world at Paris, was first opened in London, Sept. 29th, 1823. The views first ex- hibited, were the Interior of Canterbury Cathedral, and a picturesque view of the VallaLof Sarnen, in Switzerland. In 1 %9t, the views were changed to those of Brest Harbour, and Chartres Cathedral, and in March, 1825, Holyrood Chapel was substituted for Brest Harbour ; \u2014 all which scenes are represented in the accompanying Engrav ings."], [40, "\u25a024 BREST HARBOUR. Illustration JVo- 6. The view of this animated and beautiful scene is taken from a spot, called the Rose battery, from its position on a rock, so termed from its great re semblance to that flower. The Rose battery is at the entrance, and on the right ofthe harbour. The gate, on the left of the picture, with reference to our transcript, is the entrance to a battery which commands the whole eastern side of the roads, and which, with some other batteries of great weight, renders the mouth of the harbour as nearly inaccessible to an hostile squadron as art can effect such a provision. The large tower on the right of the painting is called the Magdalen tower, and is part of an ancient castle, which, with the additions of modern for tifications, serves to assist the general defences on the sea-side of thftharbour. The old castle extends in the picture to the second distance, an^may be considered to terminate at this projecting rectangular wharf or platform, on whiph is erected a mast of large dimensions. This is an arrangement of great power and admirable simplicity for the purposes of masting and unmast ing ships of war of the largest size. From this platform, we are informed, a line-of-battle ship may be completely masted within an hour. The general view of the town fills the third distance of the picture. The first lofty building on the right, is the telegraph of St. Louis's tower, and is in communication with Paris. Next, onwards, is seen a building of"], [41, "25 THE DIORAMA. less elevation : this is the hospital for the reception of the sick and wounded ofthe navy. Below this, and standing on tlie quay itself, is a fountain of considerable size and importance. The lofty building, next on the left, is the harbour clock. The build ing, seen above it, is occupied by the drawing academies, the public library, the offices of the naval town-major, and those of the harbour works. Further to the left of the painting, and beyond its centre, and the groupe of shipping which occupies it, is a building having a roof of semicircular construction, under which ships of the first class are continually in progress. Next beyond the building are seen the factories of the blacksmiths, lock smiths, and sailmakers' departments. The shipping ofthe groupe are,- one man of war of the first class of the line, cut down, and rigged with temporary masts; the Due (V Angouleme, a large three-decker fully rigged ; and the Duguay Trouin, a heavy 74-gun ship.

The original is one of the finest Gothic remains still extant in France. The epoch of its foundation is not accurately known. Like all the edifices and institutions of ages long gone by, its history is as sociated with stories equally marvellous and incredible. In the circumference of the double row of pillars extending all round the choir, whose elegant enclosure is seen in the picture, seven chapels, of various forms and dimensions, occupy the places which each casement or com-"], [42, "26 THE DIORAMA. partment in the fore-ground of the church seems to have been designed to supply, in the distribution ofthe building. The position of the spectator is supposed to be at the foot of one of these chapels, or on the step which affords a means of communication with two adjoining chapels, in order that he may have a view of that part of the upper church, of which the repre sentation stands before him. These two chapels are respectively called the Knight's Chapel, and the Penitentiary's Chapel. The Penitentiary's Chapel is within the space which is represented by the spot occupied by the spectators ; the entrance of the Knight's Chapel is on the lest side of the picture. The chapel of St. John the Baptist adjoins the Knight's Chapel. The communication with it is through the double row of pillars, by a small flight of stairs with an iron balustrade, the slope of which forms, with the pave ment, an angle of about twenty-five degrees. Further removed from us, we distinguish the Chapel of All Saints, closed by an iron grate, ornamented with a sediment, the style of which is of no remote antiquity. This grate, now used as an enclosure to the chapel, belonged, in former times, to the Church of St. Peter, one of the churches that were either demolished or suppressed in the course of the Revolution. In the direction of the pillar, against which is placed the standard of a brotherhood, and behind the most distant pillar, there is a small chapel, not within our view ; it is named the Chapel of St. Lazarus. The Chapel of the Scourging is on the right of the spectator, near the large pillar. Another chapel, entirely concealed from our view, and standing between the Chapel of the Scourging, and that in which several persons are seen kneeling at the foot of an image of the Virgin Mary, is called the Chapel of the Transfiguration. The enclosure of the choir, which takes up the centre of the picture, is a composition of a Gothic style. Its architecture is of exceeding richness, and its ornaments are in the best taste. The same may be said of the figures which add to its splendour. Basso-relievos are chased in the massive parts, and contained within the semi-circumference of the choir, uniformly representing subjects taken from the lives of Jesus Christ and of the Virgin Mary. The first basso-relievo perceived (the 19th ofthe collection) represents the adultress ; the second, our Saviour restoring the blind man to sight; the third, (which is the first on the right of the great pillar) the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem ; the fourth, the inhabitants of Jerusalem rushing for wards towards our Saviour, and strewing the ground with branches of the palm tree. The subject of the fifth is, our Saviour in the Garden of Olives ; the sixth represents the treachery of Judas, and Peter's violence towards Malchus. In the seventh, and last, we see Jesus Christ tied to a pillar, and scourged by his executioners. The pictorial merit of these scenes is equalled only by the exquisiteness with which art is here, as it were, quickened into active life. \u2014 In the first, smoke is observed flowing over the town, and the water appears to have the regular motion ofthe sea. \u2014 The \" Little Sailor Boy,\" leaning over the wall, is every thing but animation.

Illustration No. 8. The Ruins of Holyrood Chapel, by Moonlight, was substituted in March, 1 825, for Brest Airbour, that of Chtirtres Cathedral still remaining. This new scene, though not so attractive as the Valley of Sarnen, is, perhaps, the most completely effective of any that we have been presented with \u2014 the most judiciously arranged with a view to the capabilities of the plan on which it is constructed, and the most skilfully managed in its various details. Before referring more particularly to those details, it is proper to mention, that it does not represent the scene as it really is, or as it ever was perhaps, but merely in that aspect which seems best suited to the artist's views of \"pic turesque effect :\" \u2014 \" in order to give a more picturesque effect to the picture, the artist has represented it in its unrepaired state.\" {Description of tlie pic ture.) This new picture of Holyrood Chapel is, as we have said, the very best that has yet been offered to the public, both as to the excellent management of the lights and shadows, and as to the general unity and truth of effect. The principal point ofthe view consists, of the great window by which the chapel was lighted ; behind which, the moon rises, and through the ruined tracery of which it casts its pale light upon the internal walls and upon the tombs within the inclosure. This light is finely broken by the remains of two ruined pillars, which rise in the midst ofthe scene; and it is ingeniously contrasted,"], [44, "28 CROSS'S MENAGERIE. in the right corner ofthe inclosure, by that of a lamp which is burning on a monument, before which a female is standing, whose heavy shadow falls with great effect upon the pillar behind. The extreme left consists ofthe walls of the chapel ; while the right presents an open colonnade, through which are seen other parts ofthe building, all wrapt in the same \"dim religious light\" which beautifies the rest of the scene. Above all, is the open sky gemmed with stars. In this ingenious exhibition, the French artists have for once surpassed the English, in the effect they have produced by a particular class of works of art. But here the triumph ceases. Effect is the only conoession that can be made, since, in talent, they are surpassed by the majority of our theatrical artists; as for example, the splendid Eidophusicon, exhibited a few months since at Drury-lane, and the moving panoramic scenes by the Grieves, at Covent garden, theatres. Hence the success ofthe exhibition altogether resemble* stage effect, or making the most of certain little incidents on the stage, which give scope to the peculiar excellencies of any performer. The proprietor* do not, however, offer the views as exquisite specimens of painting, but rather as skilful adaptations of means to an end. Effect does not entirely rest with fine touches of art, but rather with bold and vigorous expression, without being able to stand the test of scrupulous examination, or, as artists would say, in accomplishing en tout ensemble, what is not effected separatim, or in detail. By this standard we must regulate the merits of the Diorama ; but the general impressions on an uncritical spectator will be found to be nearly equal to those arising from the scenes themselves ; and, hence, it be comes a most interesting illusion. The interior of the building, which has been constructed expressly for this exhibition, resembles a small theatre, the part allotted to spectators con-, sisting of a tier of boxes, raised three or four feet above the amphitheatre or pit. This is surmounted by a circular ceiling, tastefully ornamented with medallion portraits of distinguished painters and sculptors. The whole is made to revolve with the spectators, at intervals of a quarter of an hour ; hence, as one picture recedes, the other comes gradually into view. \u2014 Admis sion, boxes 3s. ; amphitheatre, 2s. ; description, gratis.

The age of curious speculation in which we live, has produced many ec centric and extraordinary undertakings, which have shone meteor-like, and as rapidly disappeared, and sunk into oblivion.

Of these few, the proprietor of the Horse Bazaar is of high celebrity ; and the undertaking bids fair to be a sound and highly profitable speculation. The premises cover upwards of two acres of ground, contain stalls for nearly four hundred horses, a capacious riding-house, extensive exercising ground, space for five hundred carriages, large harness and saddlery saloons,"], [46, "30 THE HORSE BAZAAR. waiting room, offices, coffee-rooms, and private subscription rooms, the prin cipal of which is of the following dimensions : \u2014 Length 113 feet, Width 47 feet, Height 44 feet, and is specially appropriated to the turf. The whole is enclosed within high walls. The main building, which faces the spectator in the engraving, contains, on the basement, an extensive riding-house and manege, with an auction and show-rooms. On the upper, is a subscription room of splendid dimensions, and appropriate fittings, adapted to the commodious congregation of a nu merous meeting for the purposes of general business ; an exchange for mer chants, and dealers in the articles of the establishment. On the right and left stands an extensive range of stabling, and general accommodations for, at least, four hundred horses ; in the midst, an exercise and show-ground of ample dimensions; and immediately over and about the arched way, in which the spectator in our engraving is supposed to stand, are warehouses for display, on a corresponding scale, for the supply of harness and saddlery, and of the general description of carriages.

One praiseworthy and singular peculiarity, we observe, distinguishes the undertaking, and which, scrupulously adhered to, stamps its worth and cha racter. Loans are advanced by the establishment on horses and carriages in tended for sale, on terms at once honourable and advantageous ; and the whole scale and general management may be deemed a most useful and well organized undertaking. The technicalities and peculiar advantages of this establishment may be traced in the following statement. Some hundreds of horses are always on sale by commission, the prices of which are attached to each, and amongst which always are found very capi tal and well-seasoned hunters, excellent tilbury horses, several pairs of very fine carriage horses, and a great variety of roadsters, hackneys, ponies, and ladies' horses, in high condition, and fit for immediate use. A considerable number of fresh, young, and well-seasoned hunters, road sters, &c, are constantly supplied from provincial fairs, well worth the atten tion of the public. There are always kept for inspection also between two and three hundred carriages of various descriptions, by the first makers ; consisting of landaus, landaulets, coaches, charipts, phaetons, curricles, stanhopes, dennets, cabrio lets, chaises with heads, barouches, dog carts, tilburies, pony phaetons, bntchkies, pony gigs, &c. &c.

There are coffee-rooms open for the accommodation ofthe public, in which may be had tea, coffee, sandwiches, ices, confectionery, fruit, &c. &c. all of the best quality, and at very moderate prices, which are affixed to the ar ticles. As many ladies ofthe first rank and fashion are daily in the habit of going through this establishment, Mr. Young has found it necessary to recommend their visits to be after twelve o'clock, as the stables are seldom perfectly in order before that hour. Coaches from the Royal Exchange are coming and going every ten minutes in the day, to the end of Baker-street, which is not more than three minutes walk from the Bazaar. A branch, foi the sale of harness, saddlery, and accoutrements, is esta blished at No. 3, Cornhill, and at 89, Lombard-street.

ARGYLE ROOMS, REGENT-STREET. This establishment, though of recent formation, may be considered as the most popular rendezvous of the fashionable world. A few years since it was a private residence ; when, being purchased by Colonel Greville, it was converted by that gentleman into a place of entertainment, frequented only by the upper classes of society. In 1818, it was taken down by the Royal Harmonic Institution, and rebuilt from the designs of that celebrated archi tect, Mr. Nash.

The whole is warmed and ventilated on the Derby plan, and a constant supply of warm air is introduced by a safe apparatus. From January to June, or during the season when the town is full, these rooms are the focus of gaiety and fashion.

The celebrity of Mr. West's works, the high rank, which that artist filled in the British School as the Founder and Father of Historical Painting ; as the President of the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture; and as the first British Historical Painter, who had the honour to enjoy the personal favour of a British Sovereign, and the title of Historical Painter to the King ; are circumstances, which are well known to every lover of the Fine Arts. \u2014 It is, however, to be regretted, that notwithstanding the personal esteem which West enjoyed from George III., some adverse feeling has ma nifested itself towards the extension of royal patronage. The present state of British Historical painting, and its probable decline, from the Church Ex clusion of Painting, are well worthy of attention ; and these points are ably discussed in a recently published pamphlet, the writer of which says, \" Be sides the claims which West's paintings have to a place in the British national gallery, from their approved merits, from their being productions of British genius, and from the valuable services which he rendered to the British School, we conceive that the purchase would contribute to remove a very prevalent opinion, that to study history painting is to adopt a profession which must involve the individual for life in public neglect, difficulty, and distress ; and expose his family to be left without any certain provision at his decease. \"The feet of the desertion of West's gallery, has been known to every artist, student, and amateur in London, for more than two years. So extra ordinary a result of the great national obstacle, church-exclusion, produced shame and indignation in some minds, without their well knowing whom to be angry with ; but the discouraging and alarming effect in the breasts of those who before entertained any hope of obtaining reward and distinction by historical painting, was heavy indeed. \" What could a student hope for, when, after a long life of meritorious labours and professional honours, the British King's historical painter, the President of the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture in London, the head ofthe arts in England, an artist superior to all contempo rary merit on the continent, and unequalled since the time of the Caracci, was abandoned by his country at the close of his 82nd year, and the magni ficent series of his works deserted and left to the precarious contingencies of the long-established anti-historical spirit produced by the church-exclusion of pictures? This, indeed, must be the commencement of the reign of terror in the British School ! With what feelings of grief and apprehension must nol the students have heard those words, addressed to them with the kindest feelings, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, the present President of the Royal Aca demy, in his discourse on the late delivery of the prizes : \u2014 \" It is now more than three years that we have witnessed at his own residence, an exhibition of the accumulated labours of this venerable and great master, whose re mains were honoured with a public funeral, and whose loss was felt as a na tional calamity, totally neglected and deserted.

The purchase of the late President's magnificent collection of pictures, by a Committee appointed by Government, or by Parliament, would contribute, with other measures for giving certain employment to history painters, to terminate the reign of terror in the British School. Aspiring students, if a field for emulation and constant reward were opened by the Government, would entertain a belief and reliance, that a man of genius, who devotes his life to history painting, and who obtains the highest honours of his profession by his pencil, will not be abandoned at his death; but that his interests, connected with the advancement of the arts and of the national glory, will be duly attended to by the Government, after his decease, so that his family may fairly hope for a provision in the fruits of his labours and his genius. On this broad public ground, the purchase would have a salutary effect in pre- venting the extinction of the public style of history in this country. The accumulated historical labours of West's pencil during a long period, are now exhibiting in the spacious rooms, built at a great expense, in filial affection, and respect for the public, by his sons. We speak here from our own knowledge: if Mr. Raphael and Mr. Benjamin West were possessed of an independent fortune, it would be their first pride, as English- men, lovers'of their country, and of the British School, to follow the noble example set by Sir George Beaumont, by presenting the eniire collection now in their possession to the National Gallery, for the benefit of the British stu- dents, and the advancement of the fine arts. But, as those gentlemen are not so circumstanced, their next pride would be to place them in the National Gallery, through the wisdom and liberality of his Majesty's Government and Parliament! They now make this offer in the most open manner, without any qualification or reserve whatever. After having most humbly presented a copy of these \" Observations,\" to the gracious acceptance of the King, as the paternal protector aud munificent patron ofthe British School, they will do themselves the honour to present, a copy to each member ofthe two houses of Parliament, with a ticket of invitation to view the gallery of pictures, and to judge impartially for themselves. This judgment they respectfully solicit. In these measures of due reverence to the memory of their father, they trust faithfully, and with a deep sense of unfeigned deference, to discharge a solemn duty to their country.

The recent announcement of the plan for the erection of several additional churches in the environs of the metropolis, has, perhaps, not altogether been productive of so much good taste, as might be expected from that spirit of emulation which distinguishes our architects of the present day. This dis appointment is, however, partly accounted for by the inadequacy of the funds, the undertaking, and the limited but business-like caution with which these contracts have been made. Hence, our new churches will not bear comparison with the splendid designs of Wren, nor the beautiful sym metry of Inigo Jones. They are characterized by their neatness, but they want that air of cathedral solemnity which is calculated to inspire all the grateful feelings of religious awe.

We are not advocates of a lavish display of labour in our religious temples, nor do we consider their importance to be enhanced by such means.

To say that an object is simple, is of itself no praise : we inquire, \"Is it well proportioned, beautifully orna- mented 1\" In many edifices, utility is the primary object, and this principle alone will often reconcile us to their appearance; well-judged proportions may make them pleasing, and size may give them grandeur ; but, to produce beauty, there must be a display of ornament, profuse, according to the cha- racter and intention of the building, and regulated in its distribution by an unquestionable correctness of judgment. For example, \u2014 Let us take a Gre- cian temple, the renowned Parthenon, the pride of Athens ; strip it of such portions as are absolutely and merely decorations ; for the elegant column, substitute a square pillar ; deprive the entablature of its divisions; strip the frieze of its triglyphs and sculptures ; the pediments of their alto-relievos; let plain eaves replace the moulded cornice, \u2014 and what remains ? Undoubt- edly there are still lest the form and general proportions ; and these are still so fine, that it will be a most pleasing object, \u2014 but beauty is vanished. If thus with such a master-piece, how must it fare with the productions of the present day ? Langham-Place Church is, we believe, designed and built by Mr. Nash ; and among churches ofthe florid class, it will esentially take a foremost rank, when the vapourings of affected taste and judgment shall be dissipated, and the prejudices of \u25a0contemporaries silenced. \u2014 To speak of it technically, much might be said both for and against the idea of making the spire an entire and unbroken cone. With Wren's examples of the spires of Bow Church, and that of St. Bride's, no architect of inventive faculty need be at a loss for the means of producing a bold spire of conical arrangement, which shall still be so broken in its slope surface as to make the variations graceful. The tower and spire of Bow Church cost somewhat more than 8000/. sterling, and we are not to look to our present economical church-builders for exertions disproportioned to the pecuniary means allotted them : but the examples are before them, and should be attended to. The effect of the new church from the south, and from that point of the main street at which it first comes into view, is picturesque (in the best and most artist-like sense of the term,) and eminently beautiful ; and the conical spire compasses but a subordinate portion of the whole, while the general effect of the building is at once in- teresting and successful. As national buildings are alike subject to the anathemas and criticism of all classes, much unmerited censure has been bestowed on many of our new churches, and especially on Langham-place Church. As long as pleasantry and humour are kept up in pasquinades, we consider them harmless ; but where humour is usurped by vulgarity, they merit unqualified contempt. The following lines, said to be written by one of the authors of the \" Rejected Addresses,\" appertain to the former class, and as they abound with classic humour their introduction will not be considered unappropriate. the church in LANGHAM PLACE. \" Whoever walks through London streets,\" Said Momus to the Son of Saturn, *' Agreed,\" the Thunderer cries : \"go plant Thine edifice, I care not how ill ; \" Each day new edifices meets, Take notice, Earth, I hereby grant Carte blanche of mortar, stone, and trowel.

The academical establishments of a nation may be considered as indicative of its happiness, inasmuch as the diffusion of knowledge is calculated to raise the minds of men above the complicated evils which result from vice and error. It is evident that this establishment is of very ancient date, accord ing to the charter of Richard, Bishop of London, in the time of Henry I., who granted to one Hugh, the schoolmaster, and his successor in that em ployment, the habitation of Durandus, at the corner of the turret, or bell tower, where William, dean of St. Paul's, had placed him, together with the custody of the library belonging to the church. Henry, a canon of the bishop's, succeeded Hugh, and on him the bishop conferred several rich grants. Such was the ancient school, dedicated to tlie honour of St. Paul ; on which foundation, Dean Colet erected the present flourishing seminary."], [54, "38 st. paul's school. John Colet was the eldest of ten brothers and eleven sisters, children of Sir Henry and dame Christian Colet ; but this army of a progeny yielded the field to the first-born, and in a short period our Dean was the only survivor. He was born in the year 1466, within the parish of St. Anthony's, London; and is supposed to have been educated in the school of that name. New court says, he was sent to Oxford in 1483 ; where he continued seven years, acquiring knowledge and studying logic and philosophy. After proceeding in arts, he made a tour on the continent, improving himself there in divinity. On his return to Oxford, he lectured, gratis, on all St. Paul's Epistles. This appears to have been between the years 1497 and 1499. At Oxford, Colet became acquainted with the learned German, Erasmus. This led to a most sincere friendship, never interrupted till the death of the former ; which event Erasmus lamented in pathetic terms on all occasions. In 1493, Colet obtained the prebend of Botevant, in St. Peter's church, York; 1502 produced him that of Durnesford, Sarum, and Goodeaster, in St. Martin's le Grand, London, which last he resigned 1503. In 1497 he was ordained deacon, and, the same year, priest, presented by Sir Henry Colet to the living of Thirning, in the county of Bucks ; in 1505, we find him a Doctor of Divinity, prebendary of Mora, and, soon after, Dean of St. Paul's. The worthy dean died of a consumption, the consequence of an imperfect recovery from the sweating-sickness, one of the ancient scourges of England, Sept. 16, 1519 ; and was buried near the statue of St. Wigefort, on the South side ofthe choir of St. Paul's, where he had caused a monument to be erected for himself some years before, inscribed only \" Joannes Coletus.\" The rules for the government of the school must have been the study of a considerable portion of his time. Erasmus has afforded us a minute de scription of it, which Dr. Knight translated from the Latin, as follows: \" Upon the death of his father, when, by right of inheritance, he was pos sessed of a good sum of money, lest the keeping of it should corrupt his mind, and turn it too much toward the world, he laid out a great part of it in building a new school, in the church-yard of St. Paul's ; dedicated to the child Jesus ; a magnificent fabric, to which he added two dwelling houses for the two several masters, and to them he allotted ample salaries, that they might teach a certain number of boys free, and for the sake of charity. He divided the school into four apartments : the first, viz. the porch and entrance, is for catechumens, or the children to be instructed in the principles of re ligion; where no child is to be admitted but what can read and write. The second apartment is for the lower boys ; to be taught by the second master, or usher. The third for the upper forms, under the head master. Which two parts of the school are divided by a curtain, to be drawn at pleasure. Over the master's chair is an image ofthe child Jesus, of admirable work, in the gesture of teaching ; whom all the boys, going and coming, salute with a short hymn. And there is a representation of God the Father, sa ing, \" Hear ye him,\" these words being written at my suggestion, The fourth, or last apartment, is a little chapel for divine service. The school has no cor ners or hiding places, nothing like a cell or closet. The boys have their distinct forms or benches, one above another. Every form holds sixteen ; and he that is head, or captain, of each form, has a little kind of desk, by way of pre-eminence. They are not to admit all boys of course; but to choose them in, according to their parts and capacities.\""], [55, "st. Paul's school. 39 ABSTRACT OF THE DEAN'S STATUTES. The worthy dean expresses an ardent wish, that children should be taught regularity of conduct, and a knowledge of literature. That he might perform his part, he resolved to found this school of St. Paul's for one hundred and fifty-three children, to be taught \" free in the same.\" The office of high master requiring great abilities in its possessor, he verv justly defines what are the qualifications necessary : \"A man whole in body, honest, and virtuous ;\" learned in pure Latin and Greek ; a man either single or married; a priest, \"with no benefice with cure,\" or any impediment which might prevent or divert his attention from the duties of his situation. Such a man is to be chosen by the Company of Mercers, in the school, during good conduct ; which is to be examined into on Candlemas-day, at the school. The Mercers are forbid to permit the master's absence without their licence ; and any dissension between him and the sur-master is to be referred to \" the surveyors being for that year.\" His lodgings were to con- sist of the whole story over the hall and chambers, and a \" little middle chamber in the house iocs,\" now yclept a garret, and a gallery, with \" all the cellar beneath the hall, the kitchen, and buttery\" He received his furniture ; and his wages were a mark per week, with a gown annually, of four nobles Talne. The dean permits the children admitted to be of any nation ; and men- tions, that they must previously read, write, and be capable of repeating their Catechisms. The high master is permitted to receive 153 (alluding to the number of fish taken by St. Peter) ; with tlie trifling sum of 4d., admission money, which he orders to be given to the poor scholar who swept the school. Each child finds his own candles of was, for those of tallow are expressly rejected. He directs that one scholar shall preside on every form ; and that the teach- ins commence at seven in the morning, continue till eleven ; recommence at one, and terminate for the day at five : \" with prayers in the morning, and at noon, and at evening.\" He allows neither eating or drinking in the school ; cockfighting, \" riding about of victory;\" and no holydays, or \" remedies*,\" under a penalty of 40s. from the high master, unless commanded by the king, archbishop, or bishop, at the school, in person. The scholars were to attend at St. Paul's on Childermas-day, to hear the boy-bishop's sermon ; when, at high mass, every member of the institution was to offer one penny to the said boy-bishops. Durine their processions, their boys were to repeat seven Psalms, and the Litany, in a devout manner, \" and not sing out.\" If a person, having a son at this school, was so indiscreet as to permit him to attend any oiher, expulsion, without a possibility of re-admission, ensued. The ancient school was burnt in 1666 ; it was rebuilt 1670, by the Mercer's Company, under the particular direction of Robert Ware, Esq., warden of the school. The late school was a parallelogram, extending north and south, almost \u00ab Play-davs. + The' bov -bishop was one of the choristers of a cathedral, chosen by the rest, to officiate from St. Nicholas' dav to the evening of Innocents'-day, in the habit at a bishop ; and, if he died in the interval, was buried in that habit, or represented in it, as at Salistairy."], [56, "DR.

The north wing, consisting of large and elegant apartments, occupied by the head master ; the south were those of the surmasters, or principal usher. Scholars are admitted to the age of fifteen ; but, at present, no boy is eli gible to an exhibition, if he is admitted after the age of twelve. It is, how ever, probable, that some alteration will be made in the admission of boys, as to their eligibility to exhibitions, and an earlier period than twelve will most likely be fixed. There is no prescribed time of superannuation by the Statutes : but no boy is expected to remain at the school after his nineteenth birth-day. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday of each week, the school begins at seven o'clock in the morning, except from the Monday after the 1st of November, to the Monday before the 1st of March, when it begins at eight, and continues till twelve, when it closes for the rest of the day. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the school begins at seven (except as above), and continues till eleven ; then begins again at one, and continues till four. The grand examination of the scholars takes place after Easter, and occupies two days; on the last of which, the seniors of the eighth class make their recitations, in Greek, Latin, and English, previous to their ad mission at some college, and the captain of the school leaves it at that time. The annexed elegant and commodious structure is just completed, on the site of the old one ; and, altogether, it forms one of the most interesting public buildings of our metropolis. DR. MEYRICK'S ARMOURY. Of all the visits that we have yet paid to the various collections that London contains, this has been the most agreeable, and nearly the most instructive. Whoever can obtain an introduction, will do well to present himself at the private residence of Dr. Meyrick, in Upper Cadogan-place, without delay, if he have tbe least taste for historical or military antiquities. The doctor's collection comprises a vast assemblage of defensive and offen sive weapons, of which nearly the earliest are some Roman spear-heads and an ancient British shield, which was discovered in a turbary in the north of England ; and the latest are some of the trophies of Waterloo. But the greatest antiquity of all is a Greek helmet of bronze, of the purest and most simple form, dug up near Athens. In this interesting specimen one sees, at a glance, that corrosion and decomposition have done their worst ; but one also sees how the immortal beauty of Grecian art knew to devise those ex quisite forms that triumph over the most perdurable metals : and, while the smallest fragments of its productions preserve any consistency at all, can still attest, after two or three thousand years have rolled away, the master-mind that once animated the most sublime and the most favoured race of mankind. The old Danish \"miolner,\" that weapon which our imaginations connect with all the wild and stormy legends of the Scandinavian mythology ; the battle-axe ; the \" bwyellt arve\" of the ancient Britons ; some similar remains of their Saxon rivals ; the lance-heads of the hardy and enterprising Normans, who won, at their points, almost simultaneously, two of the richest kingdoms in the north and south of Europe, England and Sicily ; and the multiplied swords, daggers, cross-bows, arrows, quarrels, bolts, pikes, glaives, morgen-"], [57, "GLASS WORKING AND MODELLING EXHIBITION. 41 steirns, &c. of our Anglo-Norman ancesters ; the anelacios, misericordes, ra piers, ofthe Spaniards and Italians; and, in short, some examples of almost all the warlike weapons of the dark ages of Gothic ignorance and valour; are deposited in Dr. Meyrick's armoury with a degree of chronological arrange ment that not only bespeaks the extraordinary accuracy of this distinguished antiquarian, but impresses the memory of every visitor in a proportionate degree with the ages, the nations, or the individuals to which the several specimens may appertain. The oldest suit of plate-armour in this collection, and most probably in England, is an Italian suit of the time of our Henry VI. There is an asto nishing number of other suits, some of which have once belonged to such men as Charles V. ; his brother, the king of the Romans ; the counts Man fredi; the dukes of Ferrara ; and the most eminent peers of France, Italy, and Britain. A suit ofthe due de Longueville, which is mounted on a gray charger, has a most superb effect. He sustains in his hand the baton of the great duke of Alva, which is covered all over with the most elaborate calcu lations, minutely executed in figures of gold and silver. The shield of Charles V. too, in which all the principal achievements of that monarch are engraved in gold, is a superb relic ; and the Italian suits of black and gold are of the most costly and beautiful description. Some interesting historical portraits serve very agreeably to mark and confirm the costume of the diffe rent ages to which they belong. Up stairs, there is an extremely rare and valuable assemblage of fire-arms, fn>m the unwieldy hand-cannon, and the wheel-locked pistol and carbine, down to the beautiful rifles and fowling pieces, upon the most elaborate constructions of Germany and Italy in the last century. There is also a small collection of the arms that are used among the South-sea tribes. The chain mail of the Mahratta cavalry ; the Roman shaped parizonium, or short sword of Thibet; the Tartar cutlass, and the Asiatic sabre ; some Albanian cutting swords and long muskets, and a very curious Genoese weapon, for the annoyance of cavalry, are among the most unique ornaments of this collection. GLASS WORKING AND MODELLING EXHIBITION.

MARTIN'S IN THE FIELDS. Illustration No. 12. Malcolm, in his Londinium Redivivum, published in 1807, says, \" How ever proper the addition ' in the fields' may have been when the parish stood detached from London, it is now utterly false and absurd : I would, there fore, recommend it should be termed, in future, St Martin's, Middlesex, or Westminster.\" However pertinent these observations might have been in 1807, it must be confessed they are peculiarly applicable to the present mo ment. Since that period, the magnificent piles of building, termed Pall Mall East, and forming one side of Cockspur-street, together with Suffolk-street and Suffolk-place, have risen in all the classic chasteness of modern archi tecture, and which, with the Italian style of the Opera-house, well bespeak the liberality with which British opulence rewards the merits of art. The above engraving represents the superb church of St. Martin's, as it will appear on the removal ofthe Royal Mews, and the completion of a mag nificent street leading to the same, to be called Waterloo-street. The first traces of the history of St. Martin's church appear to have been conveyed to posterity by a parochial dispute, which occurred in 1222. The time of the foundation of the parish is buried in oblivion ; but the living was, undoubtedly, a vicarage previous to 1363."], [59, "ST. martin's in the fields. 43 The fonds and contributions to the erection of this church were so abun dant, that the newspapers of 1724 mention the refusal of 500?. from a lady who would have given that sum towards enriching the altar-piece. The Prince of Wales, they observe, intended to give a peal of ten bells. The last stone ofthe steeple was placed in December, 1724. It is said that the church of St. Martin was in a state of dilapidation and ruin in the reign of Henry VIII., which seems to confirm the supposition that the monastery of St. Peter had erected and kept it in repair rather than the inhabitants of the parish, who suffered it to remain so till that of James I. when he rebuilt St. Martin's, to which Prince Henry and the nobility added a chancel in 1607 ; but the building and tower, according to an old print, were wretched and ruinous. The first stone ofthe new church, under ground, was laid, March 19, 1722, by (Willis,) Bishop Salisbury, Lord Almoner, on his majesty's behalf; and some time after the first stone, above ground, on the same side, and 12 feet above the other, with much ceremony, by the Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons. The church was consecrated October the 20th, that year ; when the Lords ofthe Admiralty presented to the parish a grand Standard of England, 30 feet long, and 14 broad, to be displayed on the steeple during public re joicings ; but it was blown to rags on the first day it was hoisted, August 1, 1726, the anniversary ofthe accession of George I. Soon after the completion of the steeple, an adventurous Italian, named Violante, descended from the arches, head foremost, on a rope stretched thence across St. Martin's-lane to the Royal Mews ; the princesses were pre sent, and many eminent persons. Between this period and 1737, the timbers which support the pediment of the portico shrunk so considerably, that the stucco cracked, and the whole seemed to threaten an immediate fall. In this unpleasant situation it re mained till James King, carpenter, proposed to restore the ceiling by ma chinery within the angle of the pediment, which he effected to the satisfaction of his employers. The same person erected the timber obelisk, near York buildings, and made a model of a wooden arched bridge for Westminster, which, though not used, was highly approved of for its ingenuity. The interior contains eight composite pillars, and four pilasters and enta blatures, which support beautiful ceilings over the side aisles. The enriched bands spring from brackets and cherubim ; between, are slight domes, marked with plain circles. The vault of the nave is too elaborately ornamented for description; but the decorations are, certainly, very grand, and not too much crowded, yet sufficiently profuse to satisfy the man of taste. In the waiting-room is a portrait of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, Knt. A. D. 1678 ; the gift of Alexander Geekie, senior; a very dark picture, not badly painted, but discontented, wretched features. The same Mr. Geekie gave the parish two frames, divided into four glazed compartments, eaoh of which contains representations of cruelties inflicted on the Protestants by Roman Catholics, neatly painted, and original. Sir E. Godfrey, who fell a victim to the fanaticism of his age, was a parishioner of St. Martin's ; and as this circumstance is connected with the history of the church, we have subjoined the following circumstantial narra tive of his murder, from a scarce contemporaneous pamphlet. \" On the 12th of October, being Saturday, about nine of the clock in the morning, Sir Edmondberry Godfrey went 8ut of his own house, in Green's-"], [60, "44 ST. martin's in the fields. lane, in the Strand, about his occasions, and was seen, not long after, near Marylebone, but then supposed to be going home; and was at one of the churchwardens' of the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, about some busi ness, at twelve of the clock the same day ; but so it was, that he came not to his own house that night, according to his usual custom, nor gave any notice to his servants of any business that he had to hinder his returning that night. And from that time till Thursday, the 17 th of the same month, about six o'clock at night, no tidings could be heard of him, (although all earnest and diligent inquiries and searches were made for him ;) at which time, his body was found dead in a ditch, upon the south side of Primrose-hill, near Hampstead. The occasion of his being sound was this : one Bromley, a baker, and Waters, a farrier, both of the parish of St. Giles's in the Fields, having an occasion to go to the house, commonly called the White-house,* near Primrose-hill.and going over the field where the body of Sir Edmondberry lay, saw, as they thought, a sword and belt, and a stick, and a pair of gloves, lying together, hard by the hedge side ; but they went not near to meddle with them, supposing they had belonged to some person that was gone into the ditch to ease himself. And when they came to the White-house, they told John Rawson (the man of the said house,) that they had seen a sword and belt, and a pair of gloves and stick, lie in that place : whereupon John Rawson asked them, why they did not bring them thither ? They told him they did not know but there might be somebody hard by to own them \u2022 Rawson told them again, that there had been several soldiers thereabout this week, a hedgelipg -hunting, and it may be (said he,) some of them may have left them behind them. \"After some further discourse, Rawson agreed to go with the men to the place ; and if they found the things there then, Rawson was to give them a shilling to drink, and was to take the\"things to his own house, till somebody came thither to own them ; and thereupon they went together to the place. When they came there, they found only a belt and a scabbard, and a stick, and a pair of gloves; but no sword : which, as Rawson was stooping to take up, he thought he saw something like a man in the ditch hard by; and so going to the ditch, there they saw a man lying, as they supposed, upon his belly, with a sword run through him, and the point appearing about seven or eight inches above his back ; upon this, they went immediately to the churchwarden of the parish, to give him an account of it; but he, being sick, sent them to Mr Brown's, the constable, who, presently taking with him several neighbours and housekeepers, went to the place where the body lay: which was in a dry ditch, upon the south side of Primrose-hill, about two fields distant from the White-house. The posture in which he lay was this : he had a sword run into hitn just under his left pap, which came out upon the-right side of his back, about seven or eight inches ; one of his hands being doubled under, on which he seemed to lean, the other hand lying upon the bank, his hair-chamlet coat being turned up over his head ; his hat and perri wig being among the bushes over his head, but no band nor cravat could be found about him; although, when he went from home, he had a large laced band on. \"The constable having caused the body to be removed to the White-house, and knowing it to be the body of Sir Edmondberry Godfrey, he caused his \u2022 Now called \" Chalk Farm.''"], [61, "ST. martin's in the fields. 45 pockets to be searched, and found in one of them, in one paper, six guineas, and in another paper, four broad pieces of gold, and a half-crown ; and in the other pocket, two rings, whereof one was a diamond, one guinea, and four pound in silver, and two small pieces of gold, and one ring he had upon one of his fingers; his pocket book (in which he used to take notes of ex aminations,) being\"only missing. \"On Friday the 1 8th of this instant, Mr. Cooper, the coroner of Middlesex, impanneled a jury at the White-house, to inquire about the occasion of the death of the said Sir Edmondberry Godfrey: and two surgeons (having been first sworn,) viewed the body in the presence of the coroner and the jury ; and found two wounds about it, which one of the surgeons search ed with his probe, and found one of them not above an inch deep, the probe going against one of his ribs ; but the other, being a little below the left pap, went quite through the body : his face was of a fresh colour, though in his life-time very pale, somewhat swelled, and a green circle about his neck, as if he had been strangled, his blood being settled about his neck, throat, and the upper part of his breast. The surgeons, having viewed the body, delivered their judgments, that the wounds they found about him were not the cause of his death ; but that he was suffocated before the wounds were made ; and that which may fully persuade any person of the truth thereof is, that there was not one drop of blood to be found in the place where he lay, nor the least appearance of any such thing ; though the ditch was dry, and it might have been easily seen, if there had been any. Another thing was, that the very bottom of the soles of his shoes were as clean as if he had but just come out of his own chamber ; which was an evident sign that he was carried thither. \" A third thing very remarkable is, that one of the jury affirmed, that a servant of his mother's, (who is owner of the ground where the body lay,) with a butcher and two boys, made a very strict and narrow search in all parts of that ground for a calf that was missing, upon Monday and Tuesday last ; and at that time, there lay no dead body, belt, gloves, stick, or other things there. \" Now, because several false reports have gone abroad, tending to the dis honour of this worthy deceased knight, as though he had been discontented about some moneys owing by him to the parish, and upon that account should make himself away ; the relater thinks good to testify to the world, that to his own knowledge Sir Edmondberry lent the parish above 300?. without interest, a good part of which is yet unpaid ; so palpable an untruth it is, that some wicked persons have spread abroad about him. But it is no wonder that those inhuman wretches that have taken away his life should go also about to blast his reputation. \"One thing more I cannot omit to mention, having received it from the mouth of one of the late churchwardens ofthe parish where he lived, which is, that Sir Edmondberry, not long ago, gave him an hundred pounds to bestow upon such poor people in the parish as he knew were in want ; neither was that the first time that Sir Edmondberry had employed him in works of that nature, having often made him the distributor of his charity, because he did not desire the applause of men for it. This, without all doubt, proceeded from so remarkable and so sincere a piety, that, though it may be com mended, I am afraid it will scarce be imitated.\" A singular event occurred in this church on Wednesday evening, Sept. 10, 1729, during evening prayers.

Mr. Taylor, wbo was in the desk, repeating the ser vice : one of the bullets grazed his surplice, but another, unhappily, took place in the body of Mr. Williams, farrier, of Bedfordbury, who sat in a pew near the priest, and dangerously wounded him. The congregation, gready alarmed, fled from the church ; but a sturdy carman resofutely proceeded lo secure the maniac, which he couid not effect without a severe encounter, and greatly bruising the unhappy man, particularly on tlie head. At a subse quent examination of M. Cainpagnoll, by Justice Lfourk, he was found to be the son of M. C. governor of Brest ; that he had then been about seven months in England, was previously rather disordered in his intellects, and that having been cheated of 138?. by his landlord, a Hugouot, resident near the Seven Dials, his mind became a chaos, where revenge predominating, he had not sufficient discrimination to distinguish his victim, and, consequendy, fired his pistols within a church at a clergyman whom he had never seen before. Alter his commitment to Newgate, M. Campagnoll endeavoured to hang himself with his garters in the chapel ; but, being prevented, he fastened him self within his room, and when the door was forced open, he was found eating part of a bottle, pounded into fragments, with biead. The exterior of St. Martin's is extremely superb, and the most perfect Gre cian church in England, except St. Paul's. The flight of steps to the magnificent Corinthian portico, the pillars which compose it, the entablature, and pediment, are in excellent proportion, and will have a grand effect. The steeple equals the best specimen of skill in that species of structure left by Sir Christopher Wren, and has the merit of originality, in not re sembling one of the numerous steeples erected by that great architect. Such are the richness and beauty of this splendid church; and, as will readily be perceived, the parochial records are curious and interesting to the antiquarian and general reader. At the same time, ihe associations of the parish with many celebrated events in our history, render this church an object of peculiar attraction, and in thus removing the unimportant buildings, by which it has been partially hidden, an acceptable addition is made lo the embellishment of the metropolis, which is also highly creditable to our national taste. COSMO RAM A, REGENT-STREET. This exhibition was originally opened in St. James's street. Its removal to Regent-street has, however, enabled the proprietor to substitute natural for artificial light. It is divided into a refreshment apartment, and two galleries, whence fourteen well-executed views are seen through magnifying glasses. The Cosmorama may, at first, appear a mere juvenile exhibition, but, on in spection, its views will be found to be painted with the greatest accuracy, thus rendering it worthy ofthe patronage of adults, and as a holiday treat for the juvenile world. The views are changed occasionally. Admission to each gallery, Is. \u2014 Catalogue, 6rf."], [63, "47 ST. BRIDE'S CHURCH, AND THE RUINS CAUSED BY A FIRE, DECEMBER, 1824. Illustration No 13. It is much to be lamented, that some of the finest specimens of our national architecture are so surrounded by masses of brick and mortar, as lo be lost to the foreigner, or casual visitor of the metropolis. St. Stephen's, Walbrook, a small church of exquisite beauty, and justly considered as the master-piece of Sir Christopher Wren, in the classic style of architecture, is an instance of this triumph of speculative enterprise over the perfection of art. The casu alties and calamities io which a populous city is incessantly liable, such as fires, and gradual dilapidations, often tend to remove these obstructions ; and the spirit of improvement which characterises modern times, avails itself of such opportunities for effecting some of its greatest designs. Thus, a destructive fire in Fleet-street, in the Winter of 1824, laid open to view the beautiful church of St. Bride,'which, like St. Stephen's, and built by the same in genious architect, had, for many years, been doomed to comparative obscurity;"], [64, "48 ST. BRIDE'S CHURCH. and we are happy to report, that, through the exertions of a body of public-spirited citizens,. this view of the airy and well-proportioned spire of St. Bride's is secured, at the same time that a tasteful and judicious embellish ment to the street is accomplished. In truth, up to the term of the late fire, this spire was actually so much enclosed by the neighbouring buildings, that no view could be obtained of the entire steeple, but, from points so near to it, that its elevated parts could not be fairly seen or judged of. The opening, forming an avenue to the church, places this part ofthe edifice in the most favourable point of view, and adds to the healthiness of the spot, by increasing the circulation of air about it. These great objects have been obtained at even a very small comparative expense ; for, by making the new habitations appear to have been erected with the church, so as to combine picturesquely with the spire, and seem devoted chiefly to that object, it does not become necessary to occupy more ground for the opening and buildings than is here exhibited, to afford a favourable and an ample view ofthe noble form immediately in the centre of it. The church of St. Bride seems to have been of some antiquity, from its having had three rectors before the year 1362. It was a very small building till about the year 1480, when it was greatly enlarged by William Vaunet, warden of the Fleet-prison, who caused a spacious building, consisting of a middle and two side aisles, to be erected at the west end thereof, to which the old church served as a choir. The old church being destroyed by the fire of London, in 1666, the present edifice, which was designed by Sir Chris topher Wren, was completed by him, within fourteen years, in his very best style. It is 111 feet long, 87 broad, and the steeple was formerly 234 feet high ; but, owing to various accidents, among which was a shock from light ning, during a storm, in June, 1764, it has been considerably lowered. The tower and spire, of stone, are adorned with pillars and entablatures of the Corinthian order, arched pediment, &c. &c, and the spire lanterns are of the Tuscan order. The probable present cost of erecting the spire would be 50,000?. The annexed view is from the northern side, and is, in fact, a side elevation of all its parts ; and the towering spire smiles down on the smoking heap at its feet, as in mild defiance of that element, one of whose most terrific freaks so immediately preceded, and was, in fact, the immediate occasion of its own regeneration. We cannot sufficiently commend the prevailing industry in church-building, and, as the head of the Christian world, by encouraging such a measure indivi dually, we tend to exalt our national character. It is not our province here to discuss the several varieties of architectural taste ; but, to those who prefer the gradual variation of a spire by its broken and varied parts, to the actual cone, the spires of St. Bride's and Bow churches are the most interesting examples in our metropolis : and further, those who pride themselves for the nice dis tinction between the extravagancies of modern church-building, and the im posing order of Grecian architecture, will hail this uninterrupted view of the spire of St. Bride, with the kindred extasy of an antiquarian over the crum bling ruins of time I"], [65, "49 EGYPTIAN HALL, PICCADILLY, FORMERLY BULLOCK'S MUSEUM! Illustration No. 14. This unique and classical repository, was erected in 1812, by the celebrated Mr. Bullock, the proprietor and collector of the well known establishment, so long a favourite with the British metropolis, under the name of \" The Lon- don, or Bullock's Museum;\" since the latter collection was sold off, the rooms have not been confined to any particular object, but have been let for a variety of purposes, though principally for the exhibition and sale of curiosities in nature and art ; among which, that of \" ancient and modern Mexico \" was the object of public attention during our enquiries, and appears to be decidedly the most interesting. This rare assemblage was collected by Mr. Bullock, during a residence, which he made at Mexico, in the year 1823, for the express purpose; and had the sanction and support of the Mexican government. The jealousy which has so long existed among the inhabitants towards foreigners, has almost effectually prevented any decisiye information being obtained res- pecting their interesting and classical country. However, a more liberal system of government has facilitated the intercourse with foreigners, and, already, her sources of wealth are opened to our enterprising nation. The panoramic view of the City of Mexico is the prominent object which arrests the attention of the visitor on his entrance into the Hall. In the view, E"], [66, "50 EGYPTIAN HALL. which is the first that, as yet, been ever exhibited, of one of the finest cities in the world ; the peculiar tints of the atmosphere, and the exact proportions of the mountains, as they strike the beholder's eye in the original scene, have been given with a peculiar fidelity. Exactly in front of the panoramic view, in order to heighten the deception, and to bring the spectator actually amidst the scenes represented, a sac s?mi?e-appears of a Mexican cottage and garden, with the trees, flowers, and fruit ; they are exactly the size of their natural models, and bear an identity not to be mistaken. To give the scene still more the appearance of real life, and to fill up every void in the imagination, a Mexican Indian, in his native costume, is seen moving about, as if in his customary occupations; in short, nothing is wanting to pursuade the spec tator that he is actually transported from the smoke of Piccadilly into the luxuriant plains of Mexico. Besides these objects of peculiar interest, the exhibition is particularly rich in models, and representations of the fruit, costume, caparisons, furniture, and in fact, every thing that can be recorded curious or interesting with the arts or industry of this little-known country. The fruit is, in general, of a most extraordinary size, and gives a proof ofthe luxuriancy of the climate. Birds, beast, fish, and other natural productions are regularly classified, and are in most excellent preservation ; that ofthe feathered tribe are peculiarly beautiful, and almost serve to give tbe whole of the extraordinary represen tation the appearance of a scene of enchantment. Among the objects exhibited most likely to excite the visitor's curiosity, may be distinguished the following, which belong exclusively to that por tion of the exhibition, entitled, Modern Mexico.

Many of these were taken in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital, where they are by no means un common ; above seventy of them were kept for some time in a living state. The view painted on the back of this case is the silver mine of del Bada, near Themascaltepec, presented to Mr. Bullock by the Mexican Govern ment, and now working by his son. The cases from No. 23 to 44 are chiefly occupied with various beautiful specimens of fruit, which are in general the natural production, except where the real article could not be procured, when its place is filled by a scrupulous and faithful tribute.

Among the curiosities of Ancient Mexico, the Great Serpent, No. 63, is the most extraordinary, and Mr. Bullock affirms it to be the finest ever known to have existed of that most horrible of reptiles. It is coiled up in \u2022 an irritated erect position, with the jaws extended, and in the act of gorging a well dressed female, who appears in the mouth of the enormous reptile, crushed and lacerated, the detail of which is too disgusting and horrible for description. The Colossal Idol (No. 63), is copied from, and is of the same size as the head (No. 64). It is upwards of 8 feet in circumference in the body, and 60 feet long ; and though divested of some of the most offensive parts, will serve to give the public an idea of the monstrous deities of these people. No. 65. \u2014 The great Idol of the Goddess of War, before which thousands of human victims were annually sacrificed on the p.ltar. This monstrous Idol is, with its pedestal, about twelve feet high, and four feet wide ; it is sculptured out of one solid piece of grey basalt. Its form is partly human, and the rest composed of rattle snakes and the tiger. The head, enormously wide, seems that of two rattle snakes united ; the fangs hanging out of the mouth, on which the still palpitating hearts of the unfortunate victims were rubbed as an act of the most acceptable oblation. The body is that of a deformed human frame, and the place of arms is supplied by the heads of rattle snakes, put on square plinths, and united by fringed ornaments. Round the waist is a girdle, which was originally covered with gold ; and beneath this, reaching nearly to the ground, and partly covering its deformed cloven feet, a drapery entirely composed of wreathed rattle snakes, which the natives call cohuatlicuye, or garment of serpents \u2014 on each side of which is a winged termination of the feathers of the vulture. Between the feet, des cending from the body, another wreathed serpent rests its head on the ground ; and the whole composition of this deity is strictly appropriate to the infernal purpose for which it was used, and with which its personal ornaments but too well accord. From the neck, spreading over its deformed breast is a necklace composed of human hands, hearts, and skulls, fit em blems of the sanguinary rites that were daily performed in its honour. No. 66. \u2014 The Great Sacrificial Stone, or Altar, ornamented on the surface with the representation of the Sun ; and on the sides, with numerous groups of figures, exhibiting the Mexican warriors dragging their prisoners to sacrifice. No. 67. \u2014 The Great Kalendar Stone. This fine specimen of Mexican workmanship and knowledge, was found in the Plaza Major, under the pavement on the site Teocalli, or Temple, and not being visibly connected with the ancient religious rites, was allowed to be placed against the south side ofthe Cathedral. It is formed out of a heavy basaltic rock, and is up wards of 36 feet in circumference, exclusive of part ofthe unsculptured stone on which it is cut, and which still remains attached to it. It weighs more than five tons, and the modern Mexicans speak with surprise of the power of the ancients in moving such ponderous masses. This celebrated piece of antiquity is known to the Indians by the name of Montezuma's Watch. In the centre of this immense tablet (larger than the Zodiack of Denderah) is represented the figure ofthe Sun, the rays' in the direction of the Cardinal points ; round the head the seasons are exhibited in hieroglyphics, and, in the next circle, the name of the twenty Mexican months of eighteen days, thus making the calculation of time, nearly the same as ours \u2014 a remarkable coincidence in a people who were ignorant of the existence of the other three quarters ofthe world.

This figure is believed to have been placed in the palace of Montezuma. No. 101.\u2014 Model ofthe pyramid ofthe Sun, or St. Juan de Teotituacan. Our remarks, and the number of interesting objects in the exhibition, have almost prevented us from mentioning that it contains, besides forms, where a collection of pictures by the great masters, books of curiosity, art and virtue; and constantly on sale, a very interesting Exhibition of Casts and Pictures by Mr. Day. Mr Day's is a small but interesting collection, affording a good oppor- tunity of estimating the relative effects produced by two ofthe noblest imita- tive arts. Two or three very fine pictures, and three or four beautiful casts \u2014 from the antique, the middle ages and our own times are placed here, side by side. Among the casts is the Achilles, (resembling the figure, which has been moulded in bronze, and set up in the Park, has been so denominated) \u2014 a muse, with a masque in her hand ; and one of the colossal horses from the famous Monte Cavallo Group, at Rome. These are, besides, the Moses of Michael Angelo ; Lorenzo de Medici, by the same extraordinary hand ; a Christ bearing his Cross, also by Michael Angelo ; and the delicious group of \" the Graces,\" by the lamented Canova. Notwithstanding the lofty pro- portions of Mr. Bullock's rooms, the casts from the antique strike the spec- tator as overwhelming and gigantic. The horse attributed to the divine hand of Phidias is nothing short of an absolutely magnificent formation. In contemplating the stupendous dimensions of these figures, we are naturally impressed with admiration for the skill which has known how to preserve the most exact proportion between parts of so prodigious a mass and surface, as those that have here been combined. But we are struck with equal veneration, at least for the majestic conception that has not only ima- gined forms thus far surpassing the standard of nature's creation \u2014 but that has imparted to the images of ideal and super-human persons an air of diviner mind and energies of thought, apparently supernatural ; and yet to be traced in the lofty and beautiful expression, that the wonderful age of Grecian ex- cellence has given to its most superior productions. The vaulting ambition of our time is hardly consistent with itself, when, in statuary, it shrinks from all approach to that colossal missiveness which is a primary element of the sublime."], [70, "54 EGYPTIAN HALL. The State Carriage of the King of Ava, with other spoils captured during the French War with the Burmese Empire, exhibiting also at the Egyptian Hall. We were favoured with a view of this magnificent object of curiosity, before it was made public : even from the unfinished state in which we had viewed it, few thiDgs could more powerfully convey to the mind an idea of the wealth, the luxury, the refined taste, and the extraordinary resources of a nation, with whom our eastern government still finds it requisite to pur sue the most sanguinary species of warfare. The Carriage, which is, we understand, to be drawn by Elephants, is of the most stupendous magnitude, standing upwards of thirty feet in height, and presenting one entire mass of gold, silver, looking-glass, and precious stones ; of the latter, there must be at least many thousands in number. Our royal and civil state Carriages sink into utter insignificance when placed in comparison with this eastern example of pomp and grandeur ! Attractive as was the celebrated Carriage of Bonaparte, exhibited upon the same spot, we have no doubt this new object of wonder will have an equal number of admirers. The Countess of Blessington in her beautiful little Volume \u2014 \"The Magic Lantern,\" gives the following incident that occured on her visit to the Egyptian Hall, and which the tail piece shews the figure of the \"Hero.\" \" Two ladies of fashion now enter, attended by two Exquisites or Dandies of the first class, and their explanations of \" What an odd place ! \" \"0 dear, how disagreeable the smell is ! \" attract the notice of the fine lady before mentioned, who has been engaged in a flirtation with her beau for the last half hour ; they now recognise each other, and the languid \" How d'ye do? I'm delighted to see you ; how very funny that we should meet in the tomb ! \" are uttered at once by all three : and one ofthe Exquisites, takes this oppor tunity of lisping out that, \" The presence of such divinities converts the Tomb into a heaven.\" A vulgar looking man, who has been listening to their chit-chat, and eying them with derision, whispers, but in audible accents to his wife, a pretty modest looking woman, \" My eye I did you hear what that there young pale-faced chap said to them there painted women, about going to heaven ? \u2014 They don't seem to have any more chance of that sort of place, than they have thoughts of it just now.\" The wife gives him an im ploring look to be quiet, and whispers, that she believes the ladies are no better than they should be, by their bold looks, and loud speaking, and urged him to go to the other side."], [71, "55 THE PROPOSED QUAY ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES, FROM THE PLAN OF COLONEL TRENCH. With a coloured Copper-Plate. Among the many projected improvements of the metropolis, none can vie the boldness of conception, granduer of effect, and utility in execution, than the proposed improvements on the banks ofthe Thames by Colonel Trench. It is, indeed, little short of a disgrace to the nation, that the banks of the noblest river of its own country, and one of the noblest of any, and the boundary of the finest city in the world, should present such a beggarly appearence, as the vie w of the city and river from Billingsgate to Westminster. Splendid and important as the suggested improvement undoubtedly is, we fear that there is but little likelihood of its being carried into effect, on ac- count ofthe vast and almost incalculable expence. \u2014 However, as we under- stand the project is by no means abandoned, a short sketch ofthe plan may not be unacceptable. The Thames Quay is certainly one of the most novel, grand, and capti- vating of the various propositions that have of late been laid before the pub- lic, and is at the same time highly important from the numerous interests affected. Among the higher orders, extending up even to the Duke of York, great way has been made. Col. Trench, who is the professed origi- nator ofthe work, convened a meeting ofthe probable friends of the plan, on board of a Thames barge, and the river committee having met, a very plausible scheme was laid before it, and the Colonel convinced the party that no time should be lost in carrying the plan into effect. The Colonel's plan, we believe, is this : \u2014 It is proposed to take from the river on the Middlesex side, from London Bridge to Whitehall, a breadth varying according to local circumstances, but generally sufficient for a Quay of 100 feet wide, and leaving, between the Quay itself and the present banks, space for a floating dock. This dock is to be approached by flood-gates from the river, so that the vessels riding therein shall be always afloat. The Quay is proposed to be raised on arches ; under these arches will be wharfs, open on one side to the river, and on the other to the New Docks. This Quay will present a fine drive or walk, commanding a view of the river, and will relieve the crowded thoroughfare of the Strand and Fleet Street. The advantage of narrowing and deepening the River Thames has been admitted by all who have attended to the subject, and the late Mr. Jeslop, Engineer, presented a plan to the House of Commons, illustrative of that subject (which was published in the Report of the Select Committee for improving the Port of London in 1800). He recommended that the river should be narrowed to 600 feet, and deepened in proportion, so as to pre serve an equal capacity for the volume of water. The late Mr. Mylne's opinion, and such an opinion was valuable, was also to the same effect. Although this plan ofthe Quay comes upon us now sanctioned by Colonel Trench and the Committee with an air of novelty, it will be rememberc-d by those who have attended to the history of our great city, that the illustrious architect, Sir Christopher Wren, proposed something of the sort in his plan for rebuilding the city after the fire of London in 1666, and an Act of Par liament (22 Charles II. ch. ii.) was passed at his suggestion, to set out a Quay from London Bridge to the Temple."], [72, "56 LINWOOD GALLERY. This enlightened and patriotic measure, projected by Sir Christopher Wren, was defeated by private cupidity at the time, and various encroach ments have since been gradually advanced : at length, when an attempt was made a few years back by some worthy citizens to improve the space between the Temple and London Bridge, these very encroachments received from the legislature a sort of sanction, by a bill brought in by an interested party with sufficient influence to carry the measure into effect. Let us hope that at this day an effort of great improvement will be more successful ; and, considering the many royal and noble promoters of the measure, stirred up by the Colonel to \" such a sudden flood of mutiny \" against the old river side, it may be expected, that nothing on the part of the mere householders and wharf-holders can come in the way to prevent its completion. Nevertheless, it must be admitted, even by Colonel Trench and Mr. Rennie, that the interference with private property will be immense. The plan is also open to an obvious objection. The principle- works are proposed to be put clown in the deepest part of the river, where they will be enormously expensive to execute, and will be liable to the greatest and most dangerous attacks by floods, &c. Thus one of the advantages of nar rowing the river, viz. to procure a more uniform and equal depth of water, will be lost. LINWOOD GALLERY, LEICESTER SQUARE. This exhibition is peculiarly interesting to the fair sex, as it comprises some exquisite specimens of female skill. It consists of copies in needle work, of the finest pictures of English and Foreign schools, which are so accurate, as to be nowise inferior to the originals, in drawing, colouring, light, shade, or general effect. The rooms are fitted up in the first style of classic splendour. Among the most attractive pictures are Lady Jane Grey, with the abbot and keeper ofthe tower, on the night previous to her execution. This production, from the intense interest of the subject, is full of sympathy and expressive ness. Near it are Gainsborough Woodman and Cottage Children, which are beautiful illustrations of contentment in humble life. In the large gallery is the most valuable copy extant of Christ Blessing the Sacramental Bread and Wine, after Carlo Dolci. In addition to the important subjects are copies of Westall's Gleaner, Virgil's Tomb by moon light ; Reynold's Laughing Girls, &c.&c.

There are no names in the records of our own or any other country more calculated to rouse the enthusiasm of an Englishman, that those of Nelson and Buonaparte : the first refers to the brightest peroid of England's naval history, and to the exploits of one of her brightest Heroes, a hero whose name is associated with our ideas of courage, magnanimity, and patriotism ; while the other recalls at once to his mind the prowess of his nation, in outdoing one who seemed to hold the rest of mankind in contempt, who made king doms his play-things, and trampled on the necks of monarchs. It is hardly possible that the proprietor, after having already gratified our amor patriot with the Battle of Waterloo, which was exhibited in the year 1824, could have been more fortunate in his selection of subjects. The first series of these panoramic representations are in illustration of the naval engagements which terminated the career of the immortal Nelson. It may be as well to observe, that the Panorama is not stationary, but moves with a graduated progress the more effectually to deceive the sight, while the illusion is considerably heightened by appropriate music proceeding from invisible instruments.

You can distinguish the Royal Sovereign by the St. George's ensign at her stern. Each lost the same number of masts, the mizen-mast only remaining of the Spanish Ship, and the fore-mast of the Royal Sovereign. The Santa Anna shortly afterwards struck, but got into Cadiz in a gale. On your right of the Royal Sovereign are five ships escaping. The French Admiral Dumanoir was the first to fly ; and in the rancour and disappoint ment of a coward's heart, fired into many of the Spanish Ships as he passed them. They were afterwards captured by Sir Richard Strachan, on the 4th of November following.

H. Cisneros. The slaughter on board the enemy was almost unprecedented. In the British fleet 433 were killed and 1064 wounded; many of whom died of their wounds. Thus terminated this glorious victory, and thus ended the life of Horatio Nelson, after fighting 101 general engagements: his memory will be recorded in the annals of his country, and embalmed in the recollection of grateful posterity. The next series of views, relate to the most interesting events which oc curred to Buonaparte, from his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo until the period which ended his vicissituous life at St. Helena. View V. \u2014 Represents the flight of the French at the town of Genappe, which was their last stand after their defeat at Waterloo. The time is night, which increases the horrors of the scene ; the French are in the act of a pro cepitate retreat, with the exception of some parties, which are completely hemmed in by the Prussians. Napoleon is seen on a pie-bald Charger, having apparently first deserted his carriage, which appears at a short dis tance from him, surrounded by a group ofthe Prussian artillery. The scene is replete with the dismal horrors of war; the ground is strewed with the terrific engines of slaughter, cuirasses, and the killed and wounded. The scene then almost unperceptibly shifts, and a strain of soft music ushers in Plymouth Sound. View VI. \u2014 In the centre is the Bellerophon, the ship in which Buonaparte surrendered himself, at anchor. Napoleon is seen at the gang way surveying the spectators in thousands of barges and boats, which sur round the vessel, each anxious to catch a glance of him who was so lately the terror of the world. View VII. \u2014 Is a most interesting view of St. Helena. In the centre is seen one of the Northumberland boats conveying Napoleon, and the sharers of his captivity to that island, which, for tbe future, was to be his home \u2014 his grave. On the left of Napoleon is an Indiaman's boat, contain ing officers, &c. with whom Buonaparte appears to be an object of intense attention.

View IX.\u2014 Fairy Land, the residence of Sir W. Doveton, is a re markably picturesque and romantic representation of one of the most beautiful spots on the island. In the extremity of the picture, towards the left, an Aloe, the flower which blossoms, in general, only once in a hundred years, is seen in bloom. At the opposite corner is a group of the inhabitants, Lascars and Chinese, sitting on their heels in their usual posture. The union of the scenery, with the characteristic reality of life, is extremely picturesque. View X.\u2014 Is Longwood House and grounds, the late residence of Napo leon.

Views XI. and XII. \u2014 These two views are from the interior of the island, and represents the funeral procession of Buonaparte, which, while they are the last scenes of this great man's life, very aptly conclude this most interesting exhibition. On your extreme left, at the top ofthe hill, is the new Longwood House, which was made of wood in England, and sent over to St. Helena; Buona parte refused to reside in it, prefering his former habitation, old Longwood House, which is at the right. It was here that he resided till hrs death. Those are all gum wood trees to your right of old Longwood. In front of the house is a marquee and sentry box, which point out the limits beyond which Napoleon was not allowed to pass without an officer with him. In front of the houses are groups of the inhabitants, comprised of all nations, in their different costumes, come up from the town to witness the funeral procession. The spot where this great man is buried is of his own choice, and seems formed by nature for the cemetery of a hero. It is too grand, too sublime for the burial place of a common man. On the extreme left ofthe picture you may see the tomb beside three willow trees and a spring of water. An officer's guard mounts daily over the tomb, to prevent the body from being disturbed ; it is situated in a place called Hutt's Gate. On Buonaparte's arrival at St. Helena, there was no house ready for Marshal Bertrand ; he therefore stopped at Hutt's Gate until a house was prepared : the ex-emperor frequently visit the Marshal and his family, and they would very often walk down with him to the spring of water above mentioned, it being considered the best on the island. Buonaparte always drank of it freely, and oftentimes said to them, \" if it should please God that I shall die on this i\u00bbck, have me buried on this spot,\" which he pointed out to them beside the willow trees. The first figure in the procession, on your left is the Priest in his full robes, who reads prayers over the body ; after the Priest is Napoleon Ber trand, son of Marshal Bertrand, with the incense, the smoke rising from it, in his hands ; next following the two Doctors that attended him, Professor Antommarchi, his own Physician, in deep mourning, and Doctor Arnott, of the 20th regiment ; after them follows the body in a hearse, draw n by four horses. \u2014 The body of Napoleon was, by his own request, put into a lead coffin, in his plain uniform dress, with his star, orders, &c. and the lead cof fin was enclosed in two others formed of mahogany. Three mourners are on each side of the hearse, appointed to carry the body where the hearse could not be drawn ; after the hearse is Buonaparte's favourite horse, led by two Grooms : after them are Count Montholon and Marshal Bertrand, on horseback, who were volunteer companions in exile with Buonaparte. \u2014 Behind them follow the household and servants of Buonaparte, all in deep mourning ; after the servants, in an open vehicle, drawn by two horses, p re Madame Bertrand and daughter ; after them are seen the Navy Officers of the Fleet that were on the Station ; next to them are the Governors and Members of Council ; next to them are the Generals, Staff, and other Officers of the island ; they are seen descending the hill by"], [76, "60 SOCIETY OF BRITISH ARTISTS. a road made for the occasion. The procession is closed by the Dragoons, the St. Helena Volunteers, St. Helena Regiment, St. Helena Artillery, 66th Regiment, Royal Marines, 20th Regiment, Royal Artillery, &fc. In the procession there were upwards of 2000 Troops. The body of Napoleon was deposited in a stone vault, and covered with, a marble slab ; three discharges of 1 1 pieces of cannon were fired in laying the body down ; minute guns were fired also during the movements of the pro cession, and all other military honours the island of St. Helena could afford. The last dying words of the Ex-emperor were \u2014 \" My God, my Son, and the French Nation.\" Thus ended the career of Napoleon Buonaparte, the man who once waved his imperial banners over the ancient capitals of Europe, and swayed his sceptre over more than twenty kings.

The great increase in the number of artists since the foundation ofthe lloyal Academy by George III. having rendered the room of that valuable national school inadequate as a place of exhibition for the numerous works of arts annually sent for that purpose ; and the British Institution (the only public place of sale,) closing its exhibitions of modern arts early in April ; in order to diffuse a more general taste for the fine arts, by an annual display of the best works of the old Masters \u2014 a large body of artists (many being members of the Royal Academy,) have been induced, under these circumstances, to form themselves into a society for the erection of an \" extensive Gallery for the Annual Exhibition and Sale of the Works of Living Artists of the United Kingdom,\" in the various branches of Painting, (in oil and water colours,) Sculpture. Architecture, and Engravings, at the period when the tasteful and opulent are usually resident in the metropolis, viz. \u2014 during the months of April, May, June, and July. The regulations are upon the most liberal principles. All artists of merit in the empire have an opportunity of displaying their works, so as to be fairly seen and appreciated by the public, and they are also eligible as members of the society. The gallery is entered by a handsome doric falade, in Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, East, and consists of a suit of six rooms, well proportioned, and severally adopted to the various departments of arts. The first exhibition took place in 1824.\u2014 The leading features ofthe present exhibition are of those landscapes and domestic subjects. In the higher de partment of art there is little to attact. The historical portrait of the Em peror of Russia, by Northcote, is by far the best, and, for a recent produc tion ofthe aged artist, is an extraordinary composition. The profits of this Institution are to form a general fund for the relief of distressed members, their widows, and orphans.

This noble edifice, which is without a doubt the most superb place of com mercial resort m Europe, was built in the year 1557 ; before which time the merchants of London had no public situation to transact their business. The original structure owed its birth to Sir Thomas Gresharn, one of the greatest merchants in the world, who resolved to supply the deficiency at his own expence. Thirteen years afterwards, it was visited by Queen Elizabeth, who proclaimed with great \"pomp and circumstance,\" that it should be from that time called the \"Royal Exchange;\" the Bourse having been till then its usual appellation. . _. Sir Thomas having willed it, with his accustomed munificence, to the Uty of London, the property became vested in that Corporation.

The effect of this superb building is considerably diminished by tb. :.i .\u25a0 \u25a0 nificant shops occupying the compartments of its base. It Has"], [78, "ROYAL EXCHANGE. 62 two principle entrances : one in Cornhill, the other in Threadneedle Street. The former has a handsome tower and spire, which in the year 1821 under went the extensive alterations in the way of modernizing, &c, which our eno-raving presents ; it is still surmounted by the original vane of copper gilt, constructed in the shape of a grasshopper, the crest of the founder. The building is 203 feet high, by 171 feet broad; Sir Christopher Wren is the architect. Each of the two fronts has a piazza, which gives a stately air to the build ing, and serves as a convenient covering from the sun and rain. In the centre of each front is a lofty gate, leading into a noble area, in which the merchants assemble. This area is 144 feet by 117, and has a sine piazza carried entirely round; with seats along the four walks for the accom modation of traders from all countries, who here meet, each at their different stations, called walla. Within the piazza are 28 niches all vacant, but that in which Sir Thomas Gresham's statue is placed, in the north-west angle, and one in the south west, where was placed during his life-time, the statue of Sir John Barnard, magistrate ofthe city, and one of its representatives in parliament. The statues in the niches ofthe quadrangle in the upper story are those of Kings and Queens of England : beginning with Edward the 1st on the north side, and ending with his late Majesty on the east. So far as Charles the 1st, they are executed by Gabriel Cibber. A staircase in the south front, and one in the north, leading to a gallery above, running round the whole building and leading to various important establishments. Agreeably to the original plan, shops occupied the building to the top : they were in number not less than two hundred, filling the entire gallery, which runs above the four sides of the quadrangle, and let to milliners, haberdasher!, &c., but many years have elapsed since they were used for this purpose; the space they occupied is now more appropriated with the character of the institution, the site of the Royal Exchange Assurance Office, Lloyd's Coffee House, subscription rooms, and various offices of merchants and under writers. Sir Thomas Gresharn left either a handsome sum, or secured the possession of the Exchange, under conditions of which, this is one for one ; that a regular course of lectures should be delivered during the different terms. The manner in which these lectures are delivered, does not, it is said, either evince gratitude towards the patron, or a sense of the obligation incurred on tbe part ofthe citizens. The hours during which the Exchange is open, is from eight in the morn ing till half-past four in the afternoon. The busiest time is from two till the closing of the gates. MR.

While this splendid and substantial pile forms the finest ornament to the river, it gives the spectator the boldest idea ofthe wealth and power of the city, to which it may be called a key. The original structure was built in 1718, and destroyed by an accidental fire in February, 1814. The present magnificent building was first opened on the 12th of May, 1817. The entire site of the building is the property of the crown, and the whole ex- pence of erection, is said to have been nearly \u00a3200,000. Notwithstanding the solidity of the building, the simplicity of the design, aud its beautiful proportions, create a solemn and imposing effect. The front facing the river is of Portland stone*in the centre of which is a scene of nine lofty windows belonging to the long room. The whole length of the building is 488 feet 10i inches ; its width is 107 feet 1 % inch. The interior of the building is more remarkable for its severe simplicity and neatness, than for the- elegance of its ornaments. The long room is the object most deserving of the visitor's attention ; it is 190 feet long, 66 feet wide, and near 55 feet high in the centre, and is said to be one ofthe largest, if not the largest in Europe without supporters. This is the chief office for the transaction of all shipping business, and contains circular desks for the accommodation of the merchants and agents."], [80, "64 CUSTOM HOUSE OF THE PORT OF LONDON. The architect, David Laing, Esq., who undertook both the external and internal arrangements. From that gentleman's original plan, it appears to have been his intention to take borings out of the site, the ground contain in^ a stratum of gravity, which it was at first intended to pile throughout the foundation. But this plan seems not to have been carried fully into effect \u2014 the piling being more partial than was originally intended. Un the partial piling on a soil by no means tenacious, the walls and pieta,footed on wood, were .founded, and the fabric reared up. But not long after it was finished, the floor of the long room was perceived to settle, and continue to do so, until a few week ago it was thought necessary to support this floor by shoring under the groins of the arches in the cellars : but this precaution did not answer the desired purpose, for part of the floor of the long room fell in on the 26th January, 1825, which drew Mr. Laing's attention to the spot, and induced him to visit that building daily for some time. By ex amining the whole fabric with care and attention, he perceived that the pillars in the cellars, under the long room, had all settled, more or less. This depression of the pillars brought the weight of all the brick-work of the arches of both the cellars, the King's warehouse, and the stone floor of the long room, 190 feet by 66 feet, upon the surrounding walls. The partition walls on the east and west ends of the long room being supported by the other part of the building, stood the pressure; but the south wall having no support, except its own weight, has perceptibly bulged out, and not only rent the arches next the sou-th wall of both the cellars and King's warehouse, for a space of many feet, but it has also drawn out with it (most likely by the connection of the iron stay crossing under the long room floor,) the op posite wall, and made a rent in the floor of the long passage, which is on the same line as the long room floor. It has also rent, for a number of yards, the corridors above. These effects are not only said to be entirely occasioned by the yielding of the piers and the pressure of the above-named arches, but increased by the weakness of the girders of the whole of the roofing over the long room. These girders are by no means deficient in quantity of timber, but the manner and method of cutting, framing, and tying to the walls, does not give strength and support equal to the quantity of materials used. Hence the framing, or girders of the domes, have ex panded laterally, by the weight of timber, &c. above, so as to thrust outward, by the lateral pressure, both the front wall and the upper part of the back parapet-wall; the latter of which has opened at the end of the rasters, and shows a rent of half an inch in width, for 30 or 40 feet in length, on this light parapet-wall on the roof. In the eastern quarter of the cellar, two of the pillars have settled several feet ; the pillars above, and dependent on them, in the King's warehouse, have, of course, followed them in their descent, and brought down the arches along with that part of the floor of the long room that has fallen in. The side walls in the wings ofthe Custom House (through which light is given to the ante-rooms that look into the wells,) are all twisted a Ijttle or bulged out, most likely from the less care that has been taken to found them than to found the outer walls ; but these courts, or these well-walls, are in no danger at present, although the corridors adjoining them are a little rent. The north side of the building, and the gable-end walls, show no infirmity but what may have been original ; nor does any other part of the building appear to have settled or given way in the least. The quay adjoining the river is also fair and firm."], [81, "05 LAMBETH PALACE. Illustration No. 17. Among the many striking situations the banks of the Thames afford, none arrest the attention more powerfully than the sides of the river, as viewed from Westminster Bridge. On one side the beautiful Abbey, towering in all the sullen magnificence of monastic glory, appears to defy rivalry ; while its opposite neighbour, the palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury, shrinking as it were among the trees which partly conceal it, seems to stand secure in its venerable simplicity of a share in the gazer's admiration. The palace has been successively occupied by the Bishop of Rochester, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and latterly by the Bishop of London. The original structure was reared in the reign of Richard the First : falling into decay about a century afterwards, it was obliged to be nearly rebuilt. The portion most particularly recommended to the visitor's attention is the Lol- lards tower, which was built by Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the reign of Henry the Fifth, and owed its name to the circumstance of its containing a prison for the followers of Wickliffe, the Reformer, who were called Lollards, and were greatly persecuted by the reverend prelate. Thus the present seat of the head of our enlightened religion was once the prison of its earliest followers ! The room is yet shown; it is of elm planks, and of small extent, and still contains the staples and rings by which these F"], [82, "66 LAMBETH PALACE. wretched victims of bigotry and malevolence were confined. The beautiful gate, with a gallery, and several rooms at the east end of the Palace, were built by Cardinal Pole, who was, for a short time, one of the Archbishops of Canterbury. The Library is the magnet ofthe Palace's attraction. It was began in 1604, by Archbishop Bancroft, duringthe reign of James the First. The civil wars, while they stemmed the current of civil and religious improvements, forbid for a while the progress of this ecclesiastical establishment, and it was not until the restoration that it was completed, under the auspices of Doctor Juxon the then Archbishop. The stained glass in the windows is an object of considerable curiosity, it principally consists of the armorial bearings of the earliest founders and patrons ; among which are those of Archbishop Chicheley, Bancroft, and Laud ; and the arms of King Phillip the Second, with a portrait of Augustini. It contains upwards of 25,000 printed volumes and manuscripts, many of which are exceeding rare and costly, some illus trated by beautiful drawings and splendid illuminations, whose colours are, in general, in beautiful preservation. \u2014 Besides the pictures in the great dining room hereafter mentioned, tbe Palace boasts of some extremely fine portraits in the Library, of the following distinguished prelates and divines : Archbishop Bancroft, the founder ; Warharn ; Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester ; Martin Luther, on pannel ; St Dunstan ; a Head, most pro bably imaginative ; Dr. Peter Du Moulin, the chaplain of Charles the Second, and his Archbishop Juxon; Dr. David Wilkins, a former librarian; and a large view of Canterbury Cathedral. The Library numbers amongst its patrons Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester, and Archbishop Laud ; and many other royal and distinguished individuals, who have, at various times, added to its treasures. Among other curiosities exhibited here is a shell of a tortoise ; which animal was put in the garden of the Palace by Archbishop Laud in 1633, where it lived ninety years, when it was killed through the carelesness of the gardener. The great Dining Room contains portraits of all the Archbishops of Canterbury, from Laud to Cornwallis ; which, independent of the interest attached to their original, are worthy of minute inspection on account of their exhibiting the various changes in ecclesiastical costume. Among the most striking, are Archbishop Laud, 1633, by Vandych. Juxon, 1660, (a copy.) Herring, 1747, by Hogarth. Seeker, 1758, by Sir J. Reynolds Cornwallis, 1768, by Dance.

Although there is a want of unifor mity throughout the building, from the circumstance of its being built at different periods, yet it wears a venerable aspect, and when seen from the river is truly imposing and effective."], [83, "07 WESTMINSTER SCHOOL. Illustration No. 18. Although no spot in this large metropolis is richer in historical or clas sical research than Westminster, yet, from the confined nature of our work, we are prevented from giving even a brief detail of the various objects that are worthy of the visitor's attention ; for to do the whole of them justice, would require a much greater space than the whole of this volume affords. We have therefore preferred giving a brief notice of the School, convinced ofthe utility ofthe information to those parents who are desirous of placing their children in that admirable foundation. Westminster School is situated in Dean's Yard, which is within the precincts of the Abbey, and boasts of considerable antiquity. It was first erected about the year 1070, and was formerly attached to the Monastery of Benedictines, a most extensive and splendid establishment. The broad part on the north side of the abbey was appointed as a sanctuary; the church, of which it formed part, was built in the form of a cross, and is said to have been the work of the Confessor. Upon its being demolished, great difficulty was occasioned by the strength and solidity of its structure, and it was not levelled without considerable difficulty.

The present foundation derives its origin from Queen Elizabeth, who in 1560 re-established the Dean and Chapter, and rendered the church col legiate. The scholars on the foundation are called \" the King's,\" and are supported and educated free of expence ; eight of those most advanced are annually sent to the university, where they have the privileges of exhi bitions and collections, which render their expences comparatively trivial. Besides those who are admitted gratuitously on the foundation, a great number of the sons of the nobility and gentlemen are educated here as pri vate scholars, and reside either with their friends or in the neighbouring boarding houses. The masters are men of considerable eminence, and the course of education is of the first description, and the best preparation for academical honours ; many of our most distinguished characters have re ceived their education at this ancient establishment. In the course of the winter in every year the scholars perform one of Terences' plays, in a style and manner which is worthy of the glories of the ancient Drama. WESTMINSTER HALL. Among the recent improvements, renovations, and modernisation of ancient buildings in London, the revived architecture of Westminster Hall merits special notice. Westminster Hall is generally believed to have been built by William Rufus, about the year 1097, during his absence in Normandy, and it is traditionally stated, that on his return from the wars there, he affected dis appointment at its dimentions, as being not half big enough, and fitter for his bed chamber than the public hall of his palace, with which it was connected. The outside walls of Westminster Hall and part of its north end (which was visible during the recent renovation) sufficiently prove the Hall of William Rufus to have been a rude structure ; and the difficulty of explain ing in what manner such a span of Roof could have been supported before the flying buttresses were erected, was done away by the developement of an anciept triple door-way at the northern entrance, indicating that the Hall was originally divided by pillars of wood or stone, so as to form a nave and side-aisles in the manner of a large church. Such as it was, the Hall answered the purposes of Royal Feasting and National Councils, as well as for the usual Courts of Justice, till the reign of Richard IL, when, from the effects of time, and of a fire which destroyed the roof, it became absolutely necessary to rebuild the Hall, or to give it a thorough repair. The last was chosen, and executed with so much judg ment and good taste, as to remain one of the best specimens of English ar chitecture; which soon afterwards degenerated into a detail and ramification of ornament, calculated to exhibit the dexterity of the stone-mason, instead ot the genuine grandeur and propriety which satisfies the mind while con templating the work of a consummate architect. It is not a little singular that the actual contract for part of this repair is still extant, and is published in Rymer's Fadera. It bears date the 18th"], [85, "WESTMINSTER HALL. 09 March, in the eighteenth year of Richard II. (A. D. 1395), and by it certain masons, therein named, undertake to place a well-secured table (entablature or coping) two feet of assize in height, on the outside wall, and to infix twenty-six souses (underprops or corbels) of Caen stone in the Hall (no doubt for the support of the timber-framed roof), and also to line the inside of the wall with Ryegate stone. All this was to be finished by Candlemas (2nd February) then next ensuing ; and the rest of the work must have proceeded with equal rapidity, as the roof, and even the northern portal, was finished (as far as we now see it) four years afterwards, when the unhappy misguided Richard was driven from the throne, after keeping his last christ mas in this Hall ! Indeed, that the work was hurried beyond what was proper, sufficient evidence appear in the settlement, or swerving of the eastern tower, where it joins the older building; and the masonary of the wall which supported the great northern window, was found to have been so badly bonded as to create surprise that it should have stood so long. The inconvenience of Westminster Hall being under repair, was then felt even more sensib.y than in the late renovation : if there was less law, there was more feasting in it; and on occasion of a Parliament, A. D. 1397, the king was under the necessity of building a temporary room for a meeting in New Palace Yard. In the Northern Portal of the Hall, the evident intention of the architect was to ornament the basement story to the utmost extent of his art, and, by just gradation, to arrive at a beautiful simplicity in the battlements of the towers and the weathering, or coping course of the gable between them. The canopied niches which flank the lower windows of each of the towers, are rivals worthy of the basement niches, differing in form and fashion, but inferior to none of them in workmanship. They seem to have been intended for tutelary Saints. The Groined Porch of the Hall door is worthy of notice, surmounted as it is by one of the earliest and finest specimens of pannelled ornament ; on the eastern spandrel of the door-way appears to hang a medallion carved with the favourite device of Richard, his own escutcheon displayed and sup- ported by three Angels, with a chained Hart couchant under a tree. Over the western spandred of the door-way, the escutcheon of Edward the Con- fessor appears in like fashion, either in token of his being founder of the Old Palace, or of Richard's especial reverence for the Sainted King. The same, or similar devices, appear on the stone moulding around the inside of the Hall, and Angels supporting escutcheons are the most prominent orna- ments of the cieling timbers ; which are yet more worthy of admiration for the peculiar continuation of the appearance of pannelled ornaments there displayed, which, in a general coup-d'ail, we cannot but carry with us from the gate-way into the Hall. The dimensions of the Hall are eighty yards by twenty-two, and there fore nearly four-tenths of a statute acre in area. The ridge of the roof is thirty yards from the floor, of which seven yards reach to the souses or corbels, seven more to the Angels (which range with the Side-walls), and sixteen yards is the perpendicular height of the roof itself. The roof of Westminster Hall has always been admired for its beautiful carpentering, which supported a massive covering of lead for four hundred years, and scarcely feels the weight of modern slating."], [86, "70 RUINS OF POMPEII, Now exhibiting at Mr. B^sonls (formerly-- Barker's) Panorama, Strand.

From one view we are tempted to exclaim with Goldsmith. \" Could nature's bounty satisfy the breast, Tlie sons of Italy were surely blest : Whatever fruits in ditf'rent climes are found, That proudly rise, or humbly court Ihe ground ; Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear, Whose bright successor decks the varied year ; Whatever sweets salute the northern sky With vernal lives, that blossom but to die; These, here distorting, own the kindred soil, Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil ; While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand, To winnow fragrance round the smiling land.\" While, on the other side, what can be more awful than her frowns \u2014 a noble city with the whole of its inhabitants actually buried alive ! The fact ap pears to be too vast for our comprehension, yet it is too well demonstrated. The site of the city of Pompeii, the foot of Vesuvius, which rises with majestic grandeur in the midst of a plain, called by the ancients Campania; its walls were once washed by the waves, but the sea has since retired tp some distance. Although evidently of Greek origin, nothing certain is known of the earlier history of this city ; the foundation of which is attri buted to Hercules. The Oscans, Cum\u00e6ans, Etruscans, and Samnites seem to have been the successive possessors of these delightful plains, where nature has lavished, under a pure unclouded sky, every luxury that can procure enjoyment to man, but which too often, unhappily, enervate hi* frame and debase his mind. Pompeii, with many other cities, underwent various reverses during the Punic and social wars. It was beseiged by Sylla, and at length yielded to the power of the Dictator. After the time of Augustus it became a colony, when its history merges in the more im portant annals of the Roman Empire. Placed on an insulated elevation, formed of the lava, and by some thought the summit of a volcano, on the borders of a sea, celebrated for the beauty of its shores, at the entrance of a fertile plain, and watered by a pure stream, Pompeii offered a position, strong in a military point of view, and favour able to commerce : nor was its situation less enchanting from being sur rounded by villas, which, like so many gems, adorned the neighbouring declivities of Vesuvius. The Pompeians, according to Seneca and Tacitus, were surprised in the midst of their tranquil existence in the month of February, A. D. 63, by a terrible earthquake and eruption, which caused considerable damage. As soon as the inhabitants had recovered from their"], [87, "RUINS OF POMPEII. 71 consternation, they began to clear away the ruins, and to repair the damage sustained by the edifices ; a fact that is evident froip the quantity of parts wanting in many of the buildings even at this time. The taste, however, seems to have become materially corrupt, and purer details are covered by stuccoes, composed in a barbarous style. After an interval of sixteen years, during which several shocks were experienced, on the night of the 23rd of August, A. D. 79,* a volume of smoke and ashes issued from the mouth of the crater of Vesuvius, with a tremendous explosion : after rising to a certain height, it extended itsetf like a lofty pine, and assuming a variety of colours, fell and covered the surrounding country with desolation and dismay. The inhabitants, terrified by repeated shocks, and breathing an atmosphere no longer fit to support life, sought refuge in flight ; but were suffocated by the ashes, oppressed by flames of fire, or overwhelmed by the falling edifices. Some skeletons, which have been found, shew the futility of the attempt in many instances : \u2014 here a master seeks for safety, and is arrested at the threshold of his door by a shower of ashes ; he carries in his hands keys, coins, and precious ornaments, and is followed by a slave bearing vessels of silver and bronze ; \u2014 there we discover the skeletons of a group of females, one of whom is adorned with gold trinkets, and the impressions of some of the forms remain traced upon the ashes. At length, after four days of impenetrable darkness, light re-appeared ; but sombre, as when an eclipse obscures the brilliancy of the sun's rays. Herculaneum, which lies about nine miles distant, was destroyed at the same time ; but, being imbedded in a compact volcanic matter, it is covered so as to render its excavation a matter of extreme difficulty ; and its being situate under two villages and several palaces, precludes the possibility of continuing the researches already begun. The lighter ashes, which cover Pompeii to the depth of about eighteen feet, render this city of easier access, although the accumulation on the roofs of the edifices caused the destruction of the upper parts of the buildings. Some of the ancient inhabitants who had escaped the dreadful calamity, appear to have returned, and excavated in some parts, but were forced to leave their city, immersed in hopeless ruin, and devoted to oblivion for many ages. The decomposition of the volcanic matter, which took place in the course of time, produced a rich soil peculiarly favourable to the cultivation of vines, which, trained up the stems of poplars planted in groves for that purpose, hang in graceful festoons, and produce a beautifully picturesque effect. After a lapse of fifteen centuries, a countryman, as he was turning up the ground, accidentally found a bronze figure. This discovery excited the attention of the learned, and the government immediately appropriated to itself the right of further researches, which, however, it did not com mence till the year 1748, about eighty years after the first discovery. The excavations were prosecuted with little energy till the arrival of the French, who cleared away the greater part of that which is now open. The return of the King suspended the works for a time, but they were re sumed, though with less activity. This is to be regretted, as the progress of excavation is so slow that the present generation will reap, compara tively, few advantages from the discoveries. \u2022 Plinii Epistol\u00e6, lib. 6, cp. 16 and 20 ; in which the younger Pliny describes the eruption of Vesuvius, and the death of bis uncle, the naturalist, which occurred on this occasion."], [88, "72 RUINS OF POMPEII. Having thus briefly sketched the history of the calamity which buried this noble city beneath the soil, we will now guide our reader's attention to the most prominent objects of this most interesting exhibition. The Temple of Jupiter.\u2014 Although authority for prefixing with any degree of certainty the destination of the edifice is wanted, yet, fron^the authority of Vitruvius, and the discovery of a Colossal foot and head, pos sessing the dignified character of Jove, the appellation by which these beautiful remains are distinguished seem confirmed. The Pantheon, so called on account of the subjects represented in the beautiful paintings on the walls, and from there being in the centre of the court a circular temple, with twelve pedestals for statues Temple of Mercury. \u2014 In the centre of the court, in front of the cella or inner temple, is a marble altar with a \" basso-relievo,\" representing a sacrifice, hid from the view of the spectator by a wall. Wall of the Theatre.\u2014 This fragment always remained above ground ; it seems extraordinary that such an indication should not have caused, at an earlier period, an excavation in this part. An Arch, according to the author of the Pompeiana, of Janus, which he describes as a species of arch used to protect the statue of some important person from the inclemency of the weather. The ancient writers do not appear to confirm the opinion of the above-mentioned author. These buildings seem adapted to the uses of the Treasury, Record Offices, and Court of Justice. The Basilica served as an Exchange and Court of Justice. It was open in the centre, of an oblong form, and surrounded in the interior by a colonnade, with a gallery for the convenience of the merchants and bro kers. At the end was a raised tribunal for the Judge, and before it the pedestal and statue of a Deity, whom the witnesses invoked, in attestation of the truth of their evidence. No. 1 7, is generally called the Temple of Venus, on account of a small marble fragment of a female found among the ruins ; but the opinion on the character of the figure is disputed. . Site of Stabia, which city was overwhelmed at the same time as Hercu laneum and Pompeii ; on the shore of Stabia the elder Pliny was suffo cated by the fall of ashes. Capri, called by the ancients Capreae, celebrated as the island to which the Emperor Tiberius retired, after having entrusted the care of the em pire to his favourites ; and where he gave himself up to the most dissolute and infamous depravities that could disgrace human nature. The Island of Ischia,v/as called by the Romans Aenaria and Inarime. The mountain is the crater of an extinguished volcano : under it the ancients fabled Jupiter to have confined the giant Typh\u0153us. Ischia is now celebrated for its fertility, its wine, and warm baths. A road, which branches off from the high road from Naples to Salerno, leads to one of the entrances to Pompeii, called by the moderns, the Gate of the Tombs ; and by the ancients, the Herculanean Gate. Cape Misenum is the northern promontory of the Bay of Puzzoli. It has a capacious harbour, where was generally stationed a Roman fleet The Emperor Tiberius died at Misenum."], [89, "73 RUINS OF POMPEII. Rains of an Inn, near the Herculanean Gate. In it were found the bones of horses, and rings for tying them to the mangers ; large earthen vases for wine in the cellars, and three ears with light wheels, four feet three inches diameter. Chequers were also painted on the side of the door-way, and still remain. A Fountain, with a piece of sculpture, representing an eagle bearing off a hare in its beak ; supposed to be an allegory, by which the ancients warned those who might feel inclined to injure the ornament, by indica ting that the law would punish the aggressor. A Baker's Shop. \u2014 In it are preserved the oven, as well as three mills, and also a loaf of ready-baked bread. Kitchen in the House ofPanza. \u2014 The stoves still remain very perfect. On the wall is a painting, representing two figures sacrificing on an altar; underneath are two serpents, indicating that the genius of health presided over the culinary operations. On the side is painted a ham, or leg of mutton. The House of Panza. \u2014 On one of the piers are painted these words \u2014 pansam \u2022 aed \u2022 paeatvs \u25a0 rog. This custom of the Pompeians, of writing similar inscriptions on the walls, is not the least curious of those which these ruins alone have brought to light. On the walls of the habitations were painted the names of the proprietors, the numbers of the houses, manifestoes, notices of plays, of gladiatorial games and hunts. The House of Panza is a very complete example of a Pompeian Man- sion, which in general consisted of a succession of two courts, surrounded by chambers opening into them, two stories high, and at the further end a garden. The habitation being surrounded by a great number of small shops, which were either let out or used by the landlord for the sale of the produce of his estates, Occupied a space called \" Insula \"' by the ancients, and was enclosed by streets on each side. The opening of the principal entrance exposes the whole length of the range of building. The summit of Vesuvius consists of three heads. The same number is the crater now in action, occasionally sending forth eruptions, and is separated from the other two, called Somma and Ottaianus. The circum- ference of Vesuvius at the base is about thirty miles. One of the Shops appropriated to the sale of eatables ; in the counter are sunk large fixed jars, which hold the materials to to be sold. A shop, on the pier of which is a basso relievo of terra cotta, represent- ing a cow, or a goat, seeming to indicate the sale of milk. Prisons, in which were found some skeletons of prisoners, with the irons, attached to the wall, by which they were confined. It only now remains for us to award our unqualified commendation of the Panorama as a work of art. The colouring is most beautifully tempered, and the execution throughout most elaborately finished ; any portion of it is a picture of itself, which, when we come to consider its vast extent, affords a most gratifying proof of the power of human mind. The form of the Panorama being circular, the artist must have found it exceedingly difficult to preserve the perspective without injuring the general effect; but, how- ever, he has succeeded in doing so, and in a way which only requires the spectator's inspection to insure his gratification. The execution is, indeed, admirable. The airy, sunny effect on the distance, and the luxuriant vine-"], [90, "RUINS OF POMPEII. 74 yards in the fore ground, form an agreeable contrast to the desolute state of the exhumed city. Here may be seen an extensive colonade broken off at various heights, there a pedestal without a vestige of a statue, and in other places, walls painted in the gayest manner, broken bas-reliefs, and build ings in a more perfect state. A good panorama is the nearest approach to deception in painting, that has ever been achieved. It is an English invention, of recent date, and has given rise to many other \" oramas,\" the Diorama, the Cosmorama, the Naturama, &c. It is curious that De Loutherbourg, whose extraordinary powers in imitating the effects of nature were fully developed in his Eidop husikon, should never have thought of it. This Eidophusikon was a closer imitation of nature; but the motion and change of colour assisted it: the Panorama is a mere painting, and may be considered as a greater triumph of the art. Mr. Burford has, in general, shown great judgment in the selection of his scenes, and particularly in this case. Who has not read of the dreadful catastrophe which befel Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabia ; and who is there that does not wish to know the relative situations of the theatres, the temples, the fora, and other places in which the unfortunate inhabitants must have been collected, and the gates through which they must all have crowded to seek safety from the impending desolation. Who is there, moreover, that has not some curiosity concerning the manners of the ancient inhabitants of Italy \u2014 how they constructed their houses, how they furnished their apartments, and whether in these and other respects any similarity may be traced between them and the moderns? All these desires may be satisfied by walking to the Strand, entering a long passage, paying a shilling, ascending a few steps, and he will find himself amidst the ex cavated ruins. The late Mr. Maturin in his beautiful poem, \"The Universe,\" has apostrophized Pompeii in some beautiful lines, which commence : Of late, From its long sleep of darkness disinter*d Pompeii with its low and buried roofs, Rose dark upon the miner's progress, like A CITY OFTHE BEAU I a t.unliof chance, Where living men were buried ! tyrant, death '. \" Universe, p. 21.

Illustration No. 19. Acquires its name from being the residence of the Holland Family. It was originally built by Sir Walter Cope, in 1607, and is a venerable and interesting specimen of the architecture of that period. It is situate in the parish of Kensington, about two miles west of London, and is the ancient mansion-house of the Manor of Abbotts, Kensington. Few private dwellings can boast of higher associations than this antique pile. Here lived, and here died the celebrated Addison ; and here also spent the earliest period of his life, the \" ultimus romanorum,\" Charles James Fox. This venerable mansion came into the possession of the poet and moralist Addison in the year 1716, by his marriage with Charlotte, Countess Dowager of Warwick and Holland. It may be considered that here the retired statesman possessed the happiest years of his life ; but how fallacious are our hopes of human happiness ! When we fancy ourselves most secure, how frequently it is our lot to find that our hopes are the most deceitful. Addison with the Countess wedded rank, influence, and fortune ; but not conjugal felicity. From a dissimilarity of disposition, his domestic life was by no means what so amiable a man might have reasonably expected, and so uniform a character rightly deserved. It was here, when on his death bed, the memorable scene occurred between him"], [92, "76 ROYAL ACADEMY. and his son-in-law, the Earl of Warwick, a dissolute young nobleman, whom Addison had for a long while attempted in vain to reclaim. Upon the Earl's entering into the sick room, and enquiring of his father-in-law his commands, he received this memorable answer \u2014 \" See in what peace a Christian can die ! \" The young Earl did not survive him two years. Upon his death, which occurred in the year 1721, his estate devolved, in default of issue, to Lord Kensington, maternally descended from Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick. The Right Honourable Henry Fox, father of the celebrated statesman, afterwards Lord Holland, acquired possession by purchase ; in this family it still remains. There are few residences of our aristocracy which presents a more genuine specimen of an old English mansion-house of the first class than Holland House. The apartments are in general extensive, and fitted-up by the present proprietor in an appropriate style. The present Lord Hol land has added to an extensive collection of books. The library is about one hundred feet in length, and was originally intended for a picture gal lery, but changed its destination in consequence of the valuable additions made by his lordship. It still contains some very fine pictures, worthy of the well-known taste of the enlightened occupier. Among them are two fine landscapes by Salvator Rosa, and portraits of Addison, Sir Robert Walpole, Charles James Fox when a boy, and in mature age, by Sir Joshua Reynolds ; the first Lord Holland, and many cotemporaries of a later date : among which are portraits of the Marquis of Lansdowne ; the Earl of Lauderdale ; the Honourable Mr, Canning; and the late Mr. M. G. Lewis, author of the \" Monk.\" Many very valuable busts by Nollekins, ornament the different rooms. The grounds are about three hundred acres in extent, sixty three of which are laid out in garden and pleasure grounds. ROYAL ACADEMY, somerset house. This extensive quadrangular pile derives its name from the Protector, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, maternal uncle to Edward VI, who built a splendid palace here on the site of the ancient church of St. Mary-le-Strand, and of the mansions, or inns as they were called, of the Bishops of Chester and Worcester. On the attainder of that nobleman it fell to the crown. After the expulsion of the Stuarts, the buildings were suffered to decay ; and at length the first stone of the present magnificent edifice was laid in 1776, under the superintendance of Sir William Cham bers, for the purpose of concentrating on one spot many of the principal departments of public business. The original plan has, however, never been fully executed ; but a grant has recently beeu made by parliament for the erection of the requisite wing. The elegant simplicity of the build ing as a whole, the proportion of its parts, and their relative accordance, may vie with the noblest public structures in the metropolis ; and in (some respects may be pronounced superior to any. The exterior of Somerset House is considered to be the perfection of masonry, and the sculptures that decorate the various parts are not equalled by the ornamental acces-"], [93, "MODELS OF PARTS. 77 sories of any of our great national buildings. The decorations of the in terior are no less entitled to applause ; indeed, to Sir William Chambers we owe the introduction of that chaste character of ornament in this coun try, which has since been perfected by the studies of Stuart and others, from the classic stores obtained through their invaluable researches, amidst the remains of Grecian art. Here are the apartments of the Royal Academy, in which their annual collection of pictures is exhibited. This Academy was established by royal charter in 1768. It consists of forty members, called Royal Acade micians, twenty associates, and six associate engravers. The Academy posseses a collection of casts and models from antique statues ; a school of colouring ; copies by Sir James Thornhill, from the cartoons of Raphael, at Hampton Court, and others from Rubens, &c. The library ceiling on the first floor was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds and Cipriani. The council room is more richly decorated by the pencils of West and Augelica Kauffman, with grand allegorical designs, medallions, &c. In this room are placed the probationary pictures or sculptures, presented by the mem bers of the academy on their election ; also pictures by several of the original members : among which are whole length portraits of George III, and his Consort, painted by Reynolds. In the month of May the annual exhibition usually opens. The number of works of art exhibited, consisting of paintings, sculptures, models, proof engravings, and drawings, generally exceeds one thousand. The admission is one shilling, and a catalogue may be obtained for the same sum. The rooms are generally filled with gay and fashionable crowds, and they may be considered as the most agreeable loung in the metropolis, whilst the more intellectual visitant cannot fail to be gratified with such exquisite specimens of British art as are usually here assembled. MODELS OF PARIS, OLD BOND STREET. The citizens of Paris having been gratified with two or three different panoramic exhibitions of London ; our own countrymen have now an op portunity to criticize the capital of their French neighbours, by this Model of Paris, which is to be seen in the Bazaar, connecting the Burlington Arcade with Old Bond Street, generally called \" The Western Exchange.\" This exhibition is one of the most extraordinary specimens of human labour and ingenuity ever witnessed. The whole of one of the largest cities in the world, with every one of the public buildings, the tribunals of justice, the abodes of kings, the pavilions of pleasure, and the prisons of guilt and misery : each of them distinct from the other in figure, aspect, and desti nation. The Model of Paris conveys an admirable idea of every one of its most interesting features. The river Seine, very obviously upon this surface, divides the city into two unequal parts ; the larger to the north, the smaller to the south. Over this river, the Pont de Jena, the Pont Neuf, and the several other bridges of the capital, are well represented in all that regards"], [94, "78 MODELS OF PARIS. their several positions, and the avenues and communications which they either form or continue to the principal quarter of the city. The numerous barriers that guard the entrances of the several sections which pierce the city from all points, are very prettily imitated, and the Boulevards look absolutely fresh swept, to tempt pedestrian enterprize. All the commanding and interesting objects of this enlightened capital are par- ticularly well made out, considering the necessarily small scale upon which any model must represent them. Seen through a glass of a slight magnify- ing power, the Fountain of the Elephant, the Jardin des Plantes, l'Ecole Militaire, the Luxembourg, the Hospital of the Invalids, with its glittering dome, the Palace of Louis XVth, and the Corousel, the Champs de Mars, the Champs Elysees, the Palais Royal, the Thuilleries, the Temple, the Colonne Vendome, the equestrian statue of Henri Quatre, on the Pont Neuf, the church of St. Sulpice, the magnificent church of St. Genevieve, and the venerable cathedral of Notre Dame, together with the Odeon, and the prin- cipal theatres. All these are tolerably well developed, however minute in their dimensions ; and in some instances, as, for example, in the facade of the Louvre, and the grand front of the chamber of deputies, you may even rocognize the architectural order which is meant to be represented. Visitors, who have not seen Paris, will feel much obliged to the person who exhibits this model, for his intelligent explanations of the uses and situation of the various structures to which their attention will be principally directed, the new buildings that are going on, &c. After all, a model of this kind, much as it is calculated to excite the spec- tator's curiosity to view the original, is really that which creates a thousand not less painful than vague and interesting sensations. After a quarter of an hour's inspection of \" this mighty maze, but not without a plan,\" the eye becomes so habituated to the outline of long drawn streets, triumphal arches, and proud sojourn of luxurious magnificence, that the mind acknowledges the illusion to be complete ; and, resigning itself to the abstractions of the moment, imagines mournful realizations of the picture which is spread be- fore it. To a mind thus affected, what image does.the model of a metropo- lis conjure up! Its deserted streets, its silent theatres, its lonely baths, its voiceless palaces, its noiseless exchange, its untenanted gardens, its choir- less churches, its slumbering quays, its undisturbed race-course, its desolate pavilions, its absent citizens, its noiseless forums, its hushed tribunals, its tacit senate, its unmurmuring river, its moveless craft \u2014 bespeak not the favoured seat of art, the brilliant sojourn of genius, the soft abode of plea- sure, the refuge of joy, and the favourite of love \u2014 but a city of the dead, a capital of tombs, and a religion of oblivion. NEW BASIN. A Basin is to be excavated in the field, south of Waterloo Road, for the purpose of receiving lighters and small craft, entering the wet Dock now making at Waterloo Bridge. The canal, leading to the basin, will intersect the Belvidere Road, and consequently a bridge will be thrown over the \u25a0carriage way."], [95, "79 THE LIVING SKELETON. \" A hungry leanfac'd mortal, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A thread-bare juggler, and a fortune teller ; A needy hollow eyed, sharp looking wretch, A LIVING DEAD MANl\" ! Shakespeare. We were never more strongly inclined to suspect that Shakespeare had the gift of second-sight, the faculty of looking into futurity, than when we read the above lines ; so closely applicable are they to the unfortunate subject of these observations, that one would think our delightful bard must have had the poor mockery of mortality in his eye near three hundred years ago. The phrase \" living dead man is a wonderful paradox, but we should think could never have been applied without exaggeration until the present occasion, and we by no means feel gratified in discharging the task that their adaptation has conferred upon us. Of all the disgusting evidences of the bloated curiosity, the enervated disposition of some individuals who require the most repulsive anomalies of nature to excite their palled sen- sations ; and the unsparing cupidity of others, we consider the exhibition of the Living Skeleton as the most complete. That such a humiliating specimen of our species should have been suf- fered to have been made an object for lucre, appears to us as sadly militat- ing against our generous national character, and calculated to draw upon us the sarcasm and contempt of our continental neighbours. We confess we have not as yet \" screwed up our courage to the sticking point \" suf- ficiently to visit this unearthly being ; but, rather than our readers should be disappointed, have forwarded the following judicious remarks from that excellent co-temporary, \" The News of Literature, &c.\" We have, at length, visited this fearful anticipation of mortality \u2014 this living death \u2014 and we are compelled to say, that although some of the accounts which have been published have a little exaggerated the apparent tenuity of his body, its proportions, all those at least which depend on the due distribution and development of muscle and fibre, are sufficiently spectral td be both appalling and hideous. This ante-dated post-obit isv condemned to receive the curious, at stated periods, every day, with the usual exception of Sunday, at the Chinese Saloon, Pall Mall. There, under a gorgeous canopy, which mocks the miserable spectacle it mars, and fear- fully surrounds the breathing emblem of that condition which is breathless with the glittering trappings of ostentatious pride, the unfortunate Claude Ambroise Seurat exhibits his frame, in all its incredible poverty and mea greness, to \" Each passing traveller who can pay,\" in order to gratify, on the one hand, the cupidity of those to whom custody he has been confined, and, on the other, the diseased curiosity of those who welcome horrors as they do fashions \u2014 exactly in proportion to their rarity or novelty. It is almost needless, after so much descriptive writing as has been exhausted on this extraordinary phenomenon, again to depict him. It may suffice, that we observe he is about five feet seven inches in height, and that the expression of his head, although intensely melancholy, by no"], [96, "80 THE LIVING SKELETON. means accords with the miserable reduction of his wasted and juiceless body. They have chosen, absurdly enough, to give him a wig rather elabo rately prepared ; and, therefore, contrasting, ridiculously enough, with the mournful desiccation of his whole figure. So far as the manifestation of the frame and the proportions of the limbs was an object, and tlie exhibition of this subject being once resolved on, it certainly was an object, in a physio logical point of view, of considerable importance : this has been managed with ureat ingenuity. He is denuded down to the abdomen, and below the ribs. \u00b0 A sort'of chausses reaches from thence over part of the thigh ; but from thence to his feet he is also entirely nude. It may readily be imagined, that the aspect of a living subject, in whom all the ribs are so manifest as to be distinctly articulated, not merely to the external touch, but even to the eye, while the brim of the pelvis protrudes through apertures made pur posely for it in the chausses above mentioned, and who measures, from the sternum or breast-bone in depth to the exterior of the dorsal vertebrae or spine, less than three inches, while the whole circumference of the trunk round the loins is but one foot nine inches, and that directly under the arm pits, or at the broadest part, only two feet six inches ; thut the aspect of such an anatomie vivante must be at once distressing, and, to a certain degree, disgusting. But, besides the extraordinary deficiency of these dimensions in a man of a middle height, there is a deformity in the outline of his figure, occasioned by the immoderate protrusion of the inferior ex tremity of the ribs on the left side, and the consequent construction of the abdomen on that side. It is very true, that there is every appearance of respiration proceeding from this region of the trunk rather than from the thorax. It was truly stated the other day, in one of the daily papers, that the parchment-like appearance attributed to the skin had been greatly exag gerated ; but the skeleton-like appearance of this figure when viewed in profile, the extraordinary depression of the sternum and protrusion of the chest, occasioned by the preternatural recess of the abdomen, scarcely admit of even adequate description. In the prints of Seuiat, which have been published, the leanness of the fore-arm and of the legs is decidedly exaggerated ; but the general aspect which they present is very similar to the original. The bone of the arm has been not unaptly compared (for one cannot correctly speak of it as if it were an ordinary arm, with the usual proportion of muscle and flesh) to an old ivory flute. There are parts of it, the circumference of which would not exceed that of such a flute. We are told, that the general health os this unfortunate man is good ; and though the process of perspiration is tolerably well sustained, nothing can exceed the absolute aridity and the harshness of his skin. The nourish ment upon which he subsists is, of course, wonderfully small in its amount, but not at all disproportioned to the general disparagement of his func tions. The two most wonderful features in the physical construction of this man are, first, that his vital functions should be performed with the ordinary regularity under so impaired a state of organization; and, secondly, that his digestion, in particular, should be adequate even to the very reduced quantity of nourishment which he is capable of receiving. For how long a period Nature may continue to sustain herself in a system which that principle of decay that she appears to have universally implan ted in all her works has already so wonderfully exhausted, it is difficult to surmise ; but, to a contemplative mind, the appearance of Seurat suggests one or two considerations not absolutely uninteresting to physiology."], [97, "THE LIVING SKELETON. 81 Some of our cotemporaries have exclaimed, with something like disap- pointed amazement, that after all, the living corps of Seurat is in no respect more wonderfully attenuated than the corps of numberless victims of con- sumption, syphilis, and dysentery; but the marvel is, (these gentlemen forget) that under such a condition of derangement and desiccation, the principle of life should be at all active. The fact is, however, that Seurat does but furnish a striking, because he is a tangible, evidence of the increase of power which that principle of life derives from temperance, even where tem- perance is extended to positive abstinence. When the Bedouin Arabs joined the standards of France and England in the Egyptian Deserts, Europeans were astonished to find that the vigorous foes who had so inces- santly harassed and tormented them on their long and thirsty and fatio-uinc marches, were small-made men, spare in every respect, and of whom the alidomina appeared to be attached, almost without the intervention of any cavity, or substance, to their back-bones. Perhaps no people in the world are either exposed to more frequent or longer enduring seasons of pri- vation, or are gifted with greater powers of endurance, than these very men. To them the refuse of a dinner served up to an English yeoman, would be a meal absolutely delicious and sufficient. Our circumnavigators, also, were amazed at observing the emaciated appearance of the tall and powerful natives of New Holland ; and at first imagined that this singular contraction of the abdomen, and its apparent adhesion to the vertebral processes, were the effect of some juggling trick practised with a view to excite compassion and to extort charity. Yet, in feats of activity, and operations requiring the exercise of strong muscular tension, it would be dif- ficult to name any people who surpass the natives of that fifth continent. Of the few hardy tribes who are still to be found among the hill people, and Rajpoot or military tribes of Hindostan, the Rohillas, a sort of Guerilla soldiery, are certainly the hardiest ; they bear fatigue not merely without murmuring, but with perfect collectedness and composure ; their personal strength is extraordinary ; their prowess almost invincible ; and yet, as certainly, even among the slender-waisted and delicately-formed natives of southern Asia, the Rohillas are apparently the most meagre, wasted, and reduced. These instances might be multiplied to an unreasonable length ; but we are rather anxious to insist upon their importance to the theories of pathology.

The celebrity Mr. Barker has acquired for the great judgment he has dis played in the selection of subjects, and fidelity and grandeur of execution, is again atchieved in the present representation of the City of Edinburgh, and the picturesque view of Lausanne. The most rigid of those matter of-fact objectors who quarrel with the modern titles of the \"Modern Athens\" and the \" City of Palaces,\" must yet concede to Edinburgh the praise of local beauty and architectural grandeur. As for the surrounding scenery, the hand of nature usually designs in a style, from one end of that country to the other, too grand and vast and sublime not to defy the carpings of a prejudiced or contracted criticism. Salisbury Craigs alone, with their tow ering and perpendicular walls of granite \u2014 and the majestic eminence of Arthur's seat \u2014 the distant summit of Ben Lomond \u2014 the wide and majestic Forth \u2014 the picturesque outlines of Burnt-island \u2014 and the islands of lnch kolm, Inch-keith, May, and the grand points of North Berwick Haw \u2014 and the towering rock, upon which stands the the venerable castle \u2014 are features of such sublimity and grandeur, as would stamp a character of vastness upon any landscape in any region. The Messrs. Burford have made them out in this panorama with great effect ; and have manifested in the repre sentation of this proud and ancient city, with its superb public edifices, its picturesque palace, and its singular remains of ancient domestic architec ture, even more skill, if possible, than they have evinced in transferring to their canvas the mighty productions of nature herself \u2014 the sea, the rocks, the mountains, the plains, and the horizon which gird the Scottish metro- polis. The new buildings in and adjoining Waterloo Place and Regent Street are pourtrayed to absolute deception. We do not remember, in any similar effort, to have observed a more exact or fortunate attention to the effect of aerie! perspective ; the consequence of which excellence in the panorama we are speaking of is, that the various edifices that present them- selves in succession to the eye \u2014 the North-bridge, the Bank, the Cathedral, Heriot's Hospital, Tron Church, and so on, stand out and distinct from each other, with a degree of almost magical relief: though we feel compelled, with much reluctance, to declare, that the gale of pictured smoke sets much too strongly in the eyes of every visitor. The more distant positions in this great picture are very beautifully and very effectively described. Amongst these, a fitting and prominent centre, the castle arises in venerable but frowing pomp; the Pentland hills \u2014 the hills of Ochill\u2014 Donibristle \u2014 Aberdour Castle \u2014 Loch-End and the Bass \u2014 compose a beautiful perspec- tive ; and although its occupation and its name scarcely promise so much, it must be allowed that the building described as the Camera Obscura is interposed in this vast landscape with great skill and cleverness. Holyrood- House, and those ruins of its chapel which form so delightful a view at the Diorama, appear here somewhat insignificant, a disadvantage that must be attributed solely to the multiplicity of surrounding objects, and the near vicinity of such towering masses as the crags and hills that threaten to over- whelm them. Nelson's monument, as an architectural production, is rather whimsical than beautiful ; but owing to its commanding height and itt position, it admirably answers the national object of its foundation."], [99, "83 THE SHIP COLUMBUS Illustration No. 19. The extraordinary interest excited by the arrival of this vessel in the river Thames, in November 1824, when it was, and during the whole time it remained there, continue to be visited by a considerable number of people daily, fully entitles it to be ranked among the Lions of the British metro- polis ; and as the vessel has since been lost, a correct view and description of this Colossus of the waters will remain an object of increasing interest. The Columbus is a Canadian vessel or raft, and was built on the river St. Lawrence. She was launched during the latter end of the year 1823, for the pursose of conveying a large quantity of timber. She is perfectly flat bottomed and her bottom two feet wider than her deck ; as far as re- gards length the Columbus is certainly the largest vessel that has ever been seen in this country, but in point of effect and grandeur of appearance she falls considerably short of one of our first-rate Indiamen. 1 ne length of her keel is 294 feet, the deck 36 by 51 feet ; depth of hold 29 feet 4-12. Her tonnage is estimated at 3,690, and her cargo to 6,300 tons. Her planks and cargo throughout are on a- proportionate scale of thickness and strength ; she left Quebec on the 5th of September, 1824, but in consequence of boisterous weather, and her unmanageable form, she was run ashore two days"], [100, "84 THE SHIP COLUMBUS. afterwards, and did not make the Scilly Lights till the 29th of October, all the pumps having been kept constantly going for a week before making the land, to the great exhaustion of the crew, who were only ninety-six in num- ber. To encourage them to maintain this harassing labour a guinea extra upon the wages of each man was promised, and it is supposed but from this inducement the vessel would never have reached her destination. During the voyage the leak gained from eight to eleven feet water, and when in the river there was no less than eighteen feet water in the hold. In conse- quence of this she lay deep in the water, drawing twenty-three feet, and standing only fifteen feet above the water's edge. She reached the Downs on the 1st of November, and was afterwards towed up to Blackwall by the steam-boats. The following description of this great vessel, though some- what technical, is so correct, that we quote it as the best account that has appeared. It appeared first in the New Times paper The vaunted Colos- sus of the deep' is at length accessible to the investigation of the curious, however timid they may be, and the lovers of sight-seeing may gratify their whim and fantasy without encountering a heavy sea, a fearful lee-shore, or blue-water banyan days. Thanks to branch pilots, steam-boats, warps, and the capstan, the Columbus is now off Folly House, in Blackwall Reach, where she is likely to be easy in her berth without moorings or even a kedge. Her arrival has excited so much interest and conversation, that although we have already given her dimensions, the nature and quantity of her cargo, and some account of her appearance, and how she behaved at sea, we are induced to recur to the subject, and speak from \" ocular demonstration.\" \u2014 This Columbus is extremely deceitful in her appearance, especially when she is seen end on ; she scarcely looks half her size. She is like a wedge forward, has no cutwater, is wall-sided, carries her beam, we should imagine, to abaft the second main-mast, for she has four masts, and has a square tuck. Her run is very gradual, and from her length she looks extremely lean. From deck to keel, we believe, she measures about thirty-five feet, and as she draws above twenty-two feet, she sits low in the water. A tolera- ble sized light West Indiaman, or a thirty-eight-gun frigate in cruising trim, appears almost as lofty in the hull when you are alongside. At a broadside view from a distance, the Columbus looks a tremendous length, and though seemingly hoged or broken-backed, and very much under rig- ged, there is something sneaking and dangerous in her shew. As you approach her, however, she looks as she is, an immense mass of timber knocked together for the purposes of commerce, without any regard to beauty, and little attention to the principles of naval architecture. She has two sets of beams, the upper ones which sustain the deck, project through the sides. She has also an inner frame, for the better security of the cargo, to prevent any starting to the timber. Her blocks were laid in October, 1823 ; she is perfectly flat bottomed, and her shell was com- pletely built before a plank of her cargo was stowed. Previous to her being launched, however, 4000 tons of timber were run on board by horses, through the bow and stern ports, and she drew about thirteen feet when she first sat on the water. Unlike large ships, her galley and bitts are above deck ; between the foremast and the first mainmast there is a fore-hatchway, and a cable tier and messing-place for part of the crew, which look like a rude gap made in the cargo after it was been stowed. The height from the timber on which the cable is coiled, and where the men have two or three berths, is about"], [101, "85 THE SHIP COLUMBUS. six feet, so that there must be even there about thirty feet deep of timber. But from the first mainmast to the second, the cargo runs from deck to kelson ; and abaft the latter mast, close to the wheel and mizen or treysail mast, where the binnacles stand, is a place for the accommodation of the officers and the rest of the crew. The provisions, we believe, are stowed abaft the treysail mast. Her rudder is hung like that of any other ship, but its head comes above the taffrail, and the tilleris above deck. A great deal of the timber she has on board was, we understand, fresh hewn \u2014 it now looks extremely wet \u2014 it is principally red pine, and, like some Canadian timber, it runs large and long. The rigging of the Columbus was naturally a minor consideration with her owners ; and though it has answered the purposes for which it was intended, it presents nothing worthy of commendation to the eye of a seaman, and nothing striking to that of a landsman. The masts are ill proportioned for beauty, and injudiciously so, as far as the labour of the crew is concerned. The lower masts are too taunt, there is too much of them above deck, and this necessarily gives the courses a tremendous drop. One of the crew, an intelligent sailor-like man, said the fore-sail had fifty feet leech. The bowsprit and jibboom are but one spar : they steeve little, and the hoist of the jibs is consequently great. The topmast and top-gallant masts are also in one. \u2014 They are ex ceedingly short, and a royal can only be set on one of the mainmasts. She is not more square-rigged than she is taunt ; her foreyards does not measure above 70 feet. \u2014 The only studding sails she carried were topmast ones on the first mainmast. Her topmast rigging is rove through holes in the cross trees, and is set up with lanyard to a grummet round the lower mast. There are, therefore, no cat-harpings ; and the rest of the rigging is of the same temporary speculative description. Her hemp cable measures 26 inches in circumference, and the chain is in proportion. \u2014 She crossed the Atlantic with a single bower anchor, and a kedge of about seven cwt. It is said she worked easily and surely ; that she was perfectly under the govern ment of her rudder ; that she was in general steered with facility by a man and a boy ; that she went fronniine to ten knots or miles an hour when sailing free, and that at six points and a half from the wind she went six knots, and made but little lee-way. In a sea-way she was of course heavy, and shipped much water, as she could not rise, from her great length and want of beam. In fact, she could have been but. as a log of wood in a short chopping sea, one of which might have broken over her midships almost without any body forward or aft knowing of the circumstance. We are, however, rather sceptical as to whether we should conclude that she is actually possessed of all the good qualities attributed to her. We cannot believe that she ever sailed at six points and a half, or at even seven points from the wind, or that she even went nine or ten miles an hour. We do not think that a square-sail in her would stand at six points and a half, and she has no buttock for running. On the whole, however, she is an extra ordinary piece of workmanship ; and though vastly inferior to a first, second, third, or fourth-rate man-of-war in beauty and capacity, the Columbus was worthy the curiosity she excited."], [102, "Cs. WOOLWICH WARREN. Having given an accurate and impartial account of that mighty Leviathan of the deep, the Columbus, we must gratify ourselves, as well, we trust engage the reader's interest to some account ofthe above celebrated depot. Wool wich is a pleasant little town, about nine miles from London, in the county of Kent, consequently on the eastern bank of the river; Woolwich church is one of Queen Anne's new churches, and is handsomely built, and we can not omit a singular circumstance, that part of Woolwich parish, where formerly there was a chapel, is on the opposite side of the Thames, which, though on the Essex shore, is included in the county of Kent. What renders Woolwich a place of great celebrity is its excellent dock yard, we may venture to say the oldest belonging to the British Navy, and which at one time was reputed to have furnished twice as many men of war as any two others in the Kingdom ; but it is equally famous in being a place where that talent that so eminently marked our naval prowess in the late war was so liberally nourished, and which continues to cultivate fresh heroes to perpetuate our naval and military renown : young gentlemen are instructed in all the arts of gunnery and fortification. It is usually the resi dence of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and a company of matrosses are generally employed in making up cartridges, charging bombs, carcases, &c. It was the scene of the Congreve Rockets which have been so fatal to the enemy, and is very often the theatre of the most ingenious experiments in the art of war, and honoured by the presence of his Grace the Duke of Wellington. Woolwich Warren, where trial is made of great Guns and Mortars, is situate at the lower part of the town, and contains many thousand pieces of ordnance for ships and batteries, with immense and innumerable piles of shot, shells, and grenadoes. \u2014 At this spot the view is truly delightful, by the interesting spectacle of our floating commerce and strength. We were at first induced to give a view of this interesting establishment; but, on re consideration, we found that we could not accomplish it in one illustration, and our limits would not permit our breaking in on our plan. TUNNEL UNDER THE THAMES, at kothtrhithe. This company was formed, among many other specious concerns, some time in the spring of 1824 ; and, we must confess, from failures in similar under takings, we had not the highest opinion of its eventual success, but the time that has elapsed since that period and the present, and the apparent progress, since the commencement of this stupendous undertaking, fill us with the most flattering hopes of the ultimate attainment of this unprece dented communication \u2014 an object so vast never contemplated in the heights of the splendour of Greece and Rome. It is almost necessary to say that the bill did pass for this undertaking, after, a proper investigation before a committee of a British House of Commons,"], [103, "TUNNEL UNDER THE THAMES. 87 and we confidently anticipate a convenient opening will be shortly across (or more properly under) the Thames, east of London Bridge, to the southern side. Such unexampled confidence was placed, that the shares, which amount to \u00a3200,000, were taken up in a few days. The Tunnel was begun near Rotherhithe church, in the begining of June, 1825, and the sinking ofthe shaft is one of the most ponderous and wonder ful undertakings of the present day. The brick-work is 450 feet in circum ference, laid in cement 3 feet thick and 40 feet high : a powerful steam engine was placed on the top. While the men worked below filling the boxes, others were on the top working at the windlasses till they reached the the hippers. About the middle of September the first shaft of this Tunnel was sunk to the full intended depth, which is 80 feet, being 20 feet below the bed of the river. The distance of the Tunnel from London bridge is further than the same bridge is from Westminster on the Surrey side, and certainly will open a more easy communication between four counties ; and those concerned in the East and West India and St. Katharine's Docks will have a much earlier com munication with Tooley Street and the Borough, the most important mer cantile and shipping addendas to the city. As it may be calculated that the value of the tolls of Waterloo bridge is \u00a313,000, surely this may be estimated at double that amount, as its convenience will be unquestionable, and can hardly meet with a competition. To give some idea of the Projector's plan, the body of the Tunnel will be formed of a double archway, or gallery, each gallery is to be 13 feet 6 inches wide, and 15 feet high in the clear; the structure will be of brick and Roman cement ; the external dimensions will be 354 feet in width, and 20 feet in length. To effect so considerable an excavation, the body of the Tunnel is pre ceded by an assemblage of very strong iron frames, by means of which no more earth is removed than is replaced by the body of brick-work, retain ing thereby the surrounding ground on its natural state of density and solidity. The body of the Tunnel, which is of brick-work, is intended to be filled close to the ground, and, in proportion as the framing is moved forward, so the brick-work is made to keep activity with it. This framing strongly re minds us of the steening made use of in sinking wells, except in the latter the steening sinks with little or no effect, while in the latter it requires to be forced forward : but as the assemblage of frames would not be forced for ward all in one body, on account of the resistance of its external sides against the incumbent and surrounding earth, it is composed of a dozen perpendicular frames, which admit of removal singly, and free from their dependence one on the other, as the excavation is carried on in the front of the work. The frames are adequately provided with mechanism as is known necessary to propel them forward, and to secure them against the brick-work, when they are stationary. , It may be proper to observe, that six of these frames are alternately fixed, while the six intermediate ones are free to be pushed forward when required ; these in their turn become stationary for the reliev ing the six alternate ones, and so on. In order that a sufficient number of hands may be employed together with effect and security, each frame is divided in twelve small distant apartments, which bear the name of cells, which, in course, forms in all"], [104, "88 THE TOWER OF LONDON. thirty-six cells, in which the men operate for excavating the ground. It is observed that the ground in front, in each cell, is kept from falling in by means of a powerful shield, consisting of small boards strongly secured by frames. It is from within these cells each workman cuts out the ground, just in the way he would cut a recess in a wall, for the purpose of forming a closet ; but it is required he should move the boards one after the other, and replace them in succession as the portion is cut corresponding with it. When he has thus gained from three to six inches over the whole surface, which the same operation in each cell is reckoned will require about the same time, the frames are propelled forward, and so much brick-work added to the body of the Tunnel. Thus protected, thirty-six can be made to carry on an excavation, which is 700 feet in superficial area, in orderly and uniform quantities, with as much facility and freedom of alarm, as if one drift of 19 feet square was to be opened by one individual. The declivity of the road-way of the Tunnel under the river will not exceed 300 feet; and that of the \"approaches, whether they are determined to be circular or straight will not exceed four feet in every hundred. The whole will be lighted up all the way \u2014 success attend them. \" But it is not for mortals to command success, \"But to do more\u2014 deserve it.\" THE TOWER OF LONDON. The Tower of London, which is of great antiquity, was long called \" C\u00e6sar's Tower,\" though some good authorities believe that the great Roman never reached London. The first work is said to have been sud denly flung up in 1066, by William I. on his taking the capital ; the great square Tower, which is still denominated the White Tower, was built under that great military-priestly architect, Gundulph, Bishop of Rochester, who produced this novel but noble innovation in the structure of castles. In 1092 a violent tempest did great injury to the Tower, but it was repaired by William Rufus, who first added another castellated building on the south side, between that and the Thames, since called St. Thomas's Tower; beneath which is Traitor's Gate, through which state prisoners were formerly introduced from the river. The Lions' Tower is used, and so called a Royal Managerie, is said to have been built by Henry Beauclerc, the first of that name as King of England, and second son to William the Norman, and other additions have been made from time to time. The church of St. Peter ad vincula, in par ticular, was built by Edward III. and is remarkable for being the receptacle of many headless trunks of royal and noble personages, who have suffered on Tower Hill, during times of peculiar feeling between families and parties. Indeed, we must not omit saying, here was assassinated Henry VI. \"the meek usuper,\" by the hands of the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard III. \u2014 here the Duke of Clarence, (brother to Edward IV. and Richard) perished \u2014 here Edward V. and the Duke of York were smothered, by order"], [105, "st.

Blood stealingthe Crown, after murdering the keeper, to whose daughter he professed attach ment ; and more singular, that he was detected and employed, aye reward ed, by that monarch for his villiany \u2014 mirabile dictu. There are a number of handsome houses for the resident officers, and has greatly the resemblance internally of a fortified town. The Tower is certainly a grand addition to the scenery of the interesting Thames, and contains so many legitimate objects of curiosity, which can be no where else equalled, that we think it a laudable object to spend a day in a minute inspection. To enter into further particulars is beyond our limits ; we should add, a dismasted ship of war generally lay off the Tower for the reception of impressed seamen, and a floating fire engine in case of accidents among the shipping. St. KATHARINE'S DOCK. In a great commercial country like Great Britain, the making of an ad ditional Dock is an object of national contemplation, and even pride, if required by our increased trade and navigation. The extended trade ofthe London Docks, and although vast additions that that company are making they are not considered commensurate with mercantile accommodation \u2014 we cannot but think favourably of this undertaking. The openings to these Docks will be by entrances, one for coming in, and the other for going out ; one of these avenues will occupy the site of St. Katharine's church, (which is already demolished). The boundaries of them, when finished, appears to us will be. St. Katharine's Waterside, Little Tower Hill, Upper East Smithfield, Burr Street, and the King's Distillery."], [106, "90 TELEGRAPH COMPANY As this Company is said to have received the sanction of some eminent London and Liverpool merchants, and other individuals, both military and naval, and a number of intelligent minor traders, we shall shortly state its object \u2014 it is to convey a message of any import, from London to Liverpool, (200 miles) within one hour; the charge to be about one guinea, and the price to be determined by the communication.

We think this Company useful, and very likely to be successful, aud there fore add a few particulars from their own statement. The capital is to be \u00a310,000, and the annual profit is calculated at \u00a38,414. The entire of a circle, six miles in diameter, of which the centre is to be Temple Bar, arranged into ten divisions ; in each of which eight receiving houses are to be appointed, in the most appropriate situations. An office is established west of Temple Bar. Ten carts are purchased, of a neat and light make, but capable of carrying about one ton each. The carts are about to be numbered, and the drivers to wear a livery, with a number on their hats, and other regulations. The carts to be put up at night near the outside receiving houses, in their respective divisions. At eight o'clock in the morning precisely, each cart calls at the outside receiving house, or that which is situated farthest from the office, and takes up all parcels left there ; and then proceeds with all possible speed to the next ; and so on, until the whole eight receiving houses have been visited. The whole of the ten carts being arrived at the office by nine o'clock, the several drivers, assisted by porters, proceed to deposit the parcels they have brought, in the com partment appertaining to the division to which they are directed: \u2014 for ex ample, if the Hackney and Islington drivers have each one or more parcels for Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly, or Knightsbridge, they take them to the \" Knightsbridge \" compartment. As soon as all the carts are unloaded, each driver repairs to his particular and divisional compartment, and, as sisted, if necessary, by the porters, reloads his cart with whatever he finds there. This mutual exchange, overlooked by the clerks, &c. who will take a receipt from each driver for the number of parcels he takes from the office. Each cart is ready for starting exactly at ten o'clock. They then proceed to deliver the parcels ; and have two hours to effect this, and re turn to the outside receiving houses, three miles distance, and to feed their horses, before twelve o'clock, when they start again for the second delivery.

INTENDED ROAD FROM BATTLE BRIDGE TO HOLLOW AY. This Road has received the sanction of the legislature, and is likely, not only to be a great public utility, but an advantageous investment of capital to those who fortunately hold shares. , The Road will be about one mile and a half in length, and will pass through the fields between White Conduit House Tavern and Copenhagen House, whereby this great metropolis will be embellished by another avenue on its northern side, which was very much wanted, as an entrance to the central part of the metropolis.

The most cursory view of London excites curiosity to visit a work from whence have issued so many of the beautiful ornaments with which its pub- lic buildings have been decorated, and their durability, at least in so far as brick houses are alone contemplated, is more than sufficient for any struc- ture to which they are attached. The art is about fifty years old in this country, and many of the earliest specimens (some of which we saw) are as fresh as at the moment of their execution ; and it may be believed that the process was not in its first essays equally perfect as now. The manufactory, though stillknownby the name of Coade, the original founder, is now conducted by Mr. Croggon, who at- tends visitors over the different parts of the establishment with perfect politeness. The show rooms contain a great variety of ornamental figures, enriched vases, baptismal fonts, garden fountains, and capitals of pillars of the different orders. Some articles are first formed roughly to give them the external shape in a mould ; they are then polished by the chisel while in the soft state, which they endeavour to preserve by wrapping the block carefully in wet cloths. In some cases, particular enrichments, prepared in matrices, are added ; and in others, the whole is nearly the work of the hand. The former of these instances refers chiefly to the manner of forming vases, the latter to the manner of forming figures, which in some cases are turned like pottery on a wheel, and moulded by the hand like smaller ware. The process seemed very much like that in Mr. Chantry's work-shops, in modelling the designs in clay for the future marble to embody After the figure is completed in all its parts, it is cut into separate pieces, for the con- veniency of introducing it into the oven, and is afterwards put together, firmly cemented, and iron rods introduced into the arms or other parts that may require to be strengthened. From this account, it is evident that the worker in artificial stone approaches very nearly to the higher class of the sculptor. In every point of view, it must be considered as a very valuable approximation to the more expensive art of the statuary wherever embel lishment is desired. It facilitates the production of copies from the finest models, and by uniting the nicety of the hand with the readiness of the mould in giving the general design, at once combines cheapness with a certain degree of intrinsic value, arising out of the individual skill of the artist. It is not affected by moisture, as it is in frequent use for fountains, and this is the worst quality of our climate, in what regards the use of sculpture for external decoration. The Scagliola work equals the marble in brilliancy, smoothness, and variety of tints. It in one respect may be said to surpass it, because any defects on the surface of the original are of course avoided, and an equal degree of beauty preserved Over the whole extent of it. The Scagliola is chiefly employed in ornamental pillars and pilasters ; and as it is not subjected to the kiln, can only be used in interior ornaments, as it has not hardness sufficient to resist the action of the weather. There were also a number of vases in imitation of the different species of the most costly marbles, the effect of which was very fine."], [110, "ST. PAUL'S NEW STREET* GRAND LANDING PLACE. 94 In forming the pillar, a strong frame of wood is first used, which is covered with the artificial stone, and then coated with a mixture about one sixteenth of an inch thick, which gives the imitation of the marble intended. In its rouch state, it gives no promise of its future beauty ; but the first applica tion' of the scraper brings out all the rich tints which the artist expects from his process. It is only the rare qualities of marbles which are imitated ; of this class are fine specimens of the Verd Antique, Jaune Antique, Lapis Lazuli, Broccata, and Broccatella. Covent Garden Theatre exhibits a fine specimen of the Jaune Antique in the noble pilasters which adorn the front of the stage. St. Paul's Cathedral has in like manner the aid of imitative art in beautifying her altar-piece with pilasters of Lapis Lazuli. The process has been long known among the Italians, by whom it was employed to enrich their less valuable marbles, by inlaying them with birds, flowers, and fruit of the more beautiful kinds of the Scagliola. The imita tion may be said to be more beautiful than the real marble, as no block of marble is found uniformly perfect throughout, and the Scagliola not only exhibits the most beautiful varieties of each particular marble, but preserved the same perfection throughout. This establishment was originally situated in Bridge Road, Lambeth, the corner of Pedlar's Acre. -JL* \u25a0/>/'\" <*, \u2022\"?' .* CT^y- \u2122 fy '\u2022 *s ST. PAUL'S, NEW STREET AND GRAND LANDING PLACE. With a beautiful Illustration.(2l) At a considerable expence we are enabled to include a most beautiful view of the Cathedral, as it will present itself, should this desirable New Street and commendable improvement be carried into full effect. This stupen dous pile, the second in grandeur in the whole world, will be rescued from comparative obscurity, in which it has hitherto been doomed by its situation, cooped up on all sides by buildings, placed without regularity or symmetry. There exists no possible approach, by which a view of this great national Temple can be obtained. We rejoice to find a company has been formed to throw this magnificent pile open to public view, as no man of taste but must think it ought to be. It appears by the plan it is intended to open three grand streets \u2014 one commencing at the bank of our noble river, and terminating at the southern entrance, from which approach the beautiful view annexed is presumed to be taken ; another from the north entrance, cutting through that residence of Bibliopoles, Paternoster Row, (and some of whose necessary temporary or permanent removal we should regret, from the long associations we have had with them,) and Newgate Street, directing itself northward ; and the last from the great western entrance, in a direct line to Bridge Street. As our work may perchance fall into hands of some of our liberal country subscribers, we shall subjoin some account of St. Paul's Cathedral itself. Our readers need scarcely to be told that it was built on the site of the old Cathedral, which was burnt down in the great fire of 1666. The first stone of the new Cathedral was laid on the 21st of June, 1675, by the great architect himself, who lived to see his son, then but a few"], [111, "ST. PAUL'S NEW STREET 4 GRAND LANDING PLACE. 95 months old, thirty-five years afterwards, deposit the highest stone of the lantern on the cupola. During the early progress of the work, Sir Christopher Wren was marking out the dimensions of the great cupola, when he ordered one of the workmen to bring him a flat stone, to use as a station. A piece was brought : it was the fragment of a tomb-stone, on which but one word of the inscription was left \u2014 that word was resurgam.* Some authors suppose this circum stance to have been the origin of the emblem sculptured over the south portico, by Cjbber, namely, a ph\u0153nix rising out of its fiery nest, with this word as an inscription. In 1693 the walls of the new choir were finished, and the scaffoldino removed; and on the 2nd of December, 1697, it was opened for divine service, on occasion of the thanksgiving for tbe Peace of Ryswick. The morning prayer chapel was open for divine service on the 1st of February 1699. It is remarkable, that this mighty fabric was begun and finished by one architect, Sir Christopher Wren ; one principal mason, Mr. Strono- \u2022 and during one bishopric, that of Dr. Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The time occupied in its erection was, in truth, marvellously short. In the 9th of William and Mary, parliament passed an act \" for complet ing and adorning the cathedral church, in which there was a clause for sus pending a moiety of the salary until the said church should be finished \u2022 thereby the better to encourage him to finish the same with the utmost dili gence and expedition.\" And what does the reader imagine was the salary, the suspension of a moiety of which was to have this encouragino- influence? Only \u00a3200 ! Who but a man of genius could have brooked so unmerited an indignity? The whole time occupied in this building did not exceed thirty-five years ; while St. Peter's at Rome was not completed in less than one hundred and forty-five. The total expence of the building was \u00a3736,752 2s. 3d. The dimensions of this Cathedral, compared with that of St. Peter's, are according to the Parentalia, as follows : \u2014 St. Paul's. St. Peter's. Length,. within .... 500 669ft Greatest breadth .... 223 442 Height 340 432 lO In the construction of tbe edifice, the architect was forced to observe the general shape of a cross, and yet it exhibits little or none of the awk wardness of that form of building. By means of an additional transept or arm he has given due breadth to the west end or principal front ; the east end terminates in a projecting semicircle; and at the extremities of the principle transept, there are also semicircular projections for porticos, while the angles of the cross are occupied with square appendages, which serve as buttresses to a magnificent dome or cupola. The front of the building on the west presents a grand portico of the Corinthian and Composite orders, surmounted by spacious pediment, with a lofty tower or steeple of great elegance and richness on each side. In the tympanum, the con version of St. Paul has been well sculptured in basso relievo, by Bird ; on the apex is a Colossal statute of St. Paul, and on either hand, at different distances, along the summit of this front, are similar statues of St. Peter, St. James, and the four Evangelists. The semicircular porticos at each end \u00bb We slialtrise"], [112, "96 st. paul's new street & grand landing place. of the principal transept are of the Corinthian order, and are also crowned by statues of the apostles. The tympanum of that on the north side ex hibits a sculpture of the royal arms and regalia, supported by angels ; and that of the other, the ph\u0153nix rising from the flames, as before mentioned. Tbe side walls of the building present the appearance of a two-storied structure, there being two ranges of pilasters all round, one of the Corin thian and the other of the Composite order ; the intervals between which are occupied with windows'. The dome, or cupola, is the most striking feature of the whole edifice. A plain circular basement rises from the roof of the church to the height of twenty feet ; above that there is a Corinthian colonnade of thirty-two columns, and every fourth intercolumniation is filled with masonry, so dispersed as to form an ornamental niche or recess, while, at the same time, the projecting buttresses of the cupola are thus concealed. The entablature of the peristyle supports a handsome gallery surrounded with a balustrade. Within this rises an attic story, with pilasters and win dows, from the entablature of which springs the exterior dome. Round an aperture on the summit of the dome there is another gallery, from the centre of which ascends an elegant lantern, surrounded with Corinthian columns, and surmounted by a ball and cross richly gilt. The great dome over the central area is supported by eight stupendous piers, four of the arches formed by which open into the side aisles. The cathedral church of Ely is said to be the only other one in this country in which the central area is thus pierced by the side aisles. The advantages of this mode of construction are, that it gives an air of superior lightness to the clustered columns, afford striking and picturesque views in every direction, and gives greater unity to the whole area of the building. The view upwards into the interior of the dome is extremely striking. It has been so constructed as to show a spacious concave every way ; and from the lantern at the top the light is poured down with admirable effect over the whole, as well as through the great colonnade that encircles its basement. The inside is divided into eight compartments, in which there are as many paintings of subjects from scripture, by Sir James Thornhill ; but though originally executed with much animation and relief, the colours are now so faded, that they present to the eye of the observer below only a confused mass of stains. Sir Christopher Wren wished to have beauti fied the inside with the more durable monument of Mosaic work ; but in this, as in other instances of correct foresight, he was unhappily overruled. The choir is separated from the body of the church by handsome iron railings. Over the entrance to it is the organ gallery, and an organ in it supposed to be one of the finest in the kingdom : it was erected in 1694, by Bernard Schmydt, or Smith, for \u00a32,000. On the south side ofthe choir is a throne for the bishop, on the north another for the lord mayor ; and besides these, there is on each side a long range of stalls. The whole are richly ornamented with carvings by Gibbons. In the chancel, or semicir cular recess at the east end, stands the communion table. The altar piece has four fluted pilasters, painted in imitation of lapis lazuli, and is besides ornamented with a profusion of gilding. The pulpit and reading desk are both splendid objects : the former was designed by Mylne, and is richly carved and gilt ; the latter consists entirely of brass gilt, and is very light and airy."], [113, "ST. PAUL'S NEW STREET & GRAND LANDING PLACE. 97 In the south end of the western transept there is a chapel for morning prayers, and in the north the consistory ; both are divided from the aisles by screens of insulated columns and ornamental carved work. Descending to the vaults by a broad flight of steps, you see beneath the south east window, inscribed on a low tomb, the following simple epi- taph : \" Here lies Sir Christopher Wren, Knight, builder of this Cathedral Church of St. Paul, who died in the year of our Lord MDCCXXIIL, and of his age XCI.\" Above there is an additional inscription in Latin. \" Beneath lies Christopher Wren, the builder of this church, and of this city, who lived upwards of ninety years, not for himself, but for the pub- lic good. \"Reader, would'st thou search out his monument? Look around. \" He died 25th February, 1723, aged 91.\" At the suggestion of the late Mr. Mylne, the architect, it has been re- peated on a tablet in front of the organ gallery in the choir. There are very many beautiful monuments now erected to the memory of those, who in various times have deserved well of their country; among which are Dr. Johnson ; Howard, the philanthropist ; Nelson, Collingwood, Corn- wallis, Abercrombie, Sir John Moore, and many others \u2014 as well as some \u25a0sweet entablatures, which do honour to the arts, and add, even in their execution, to our national glory. In these vaults, also, repose the mortal remains of that prince of enter- prise, the immortal Nelson, and of his friend and companion in victory, Lord Collingwood of which were deposited here with all those funeral honours, which a sorrowing country could bestow. Here, too, lie interred those eminent masters, Reynolds, Barry, and Opie, in contiguous graves ; the eloquent and sagacious Loughborough ; the learned and pious Dr. Newton, bishop of Bristol ; Dr. Boyce, the organist ; the eccentric disciple of animal magnetism, Mainandot ; and a few others of inferior note. After examining the lower part of the cathedral, you ascend by a spacious circular staircase, to a gallery which encircles the lower part of the interior of the dome, and is called the Whispering Gallery, from the circumstance that the lowest whisper breathed against the wall in any part of this vast circle, may be accurately distinguished by an attentive ear on the very opposite side. The subjects were all chosen from the life of St. Paul, as recorded in the scriptures, from his miraculous Conversion near Damascus to his shipwreck at Melita.* Branching off from the circular staircase at this place, there are passages which lead to other galleries and chambers over the side aisles : one conducts you to the Library of the chapter, which is immediately over the consistory. The floor of this apart- ment is a great curiosity, being entirely constructed of small pieces of oak, without either nail or peg, and disposed into various geometrical figures with the utmost nicety. Above the chimney there is a good half-length portrait of the Bishop, Dr. Compton, who bequeathed the whole of his books to the library. Over the morning prayer chapel, at the op- posite end of the transept is a room called the Trophy Room, from being hung round with various shields and banners used at the ceremony of Lord Nelson's funeral. In this room are kept the rejected model, according to which Sir Christopher Wren first proposed to erect this cathedral, and also the model of the altar piece, which was left unexecuted; but to further describe this beautiful cathedral would be to anticipate the pleasures our readers must receive by an inspection.

In the whole of civilized Europe, such a great diversity of religious opinions are not to be found, as in our own beloved and happy country \u2014 long may it be the throne of tolerance, justice, and mercy. These differences have naturally led, in our great metropolis, to the building of a vast number of new places of worship for the various denominations. Among those deserving at tention is the Roman Catholic Chapel, situate as above. -The front is chaste and elegant, with no superfluous ornaments, and faces Liverpool Street, Moorfields, which leads to Bishopsgate Street. The facade is divided into five inter-columns by columns and four pilasters, and those at each end are closed saving doors with pannels over them ; over the whole is a fine allegori cal sculpture of Faith. There is a lofty flight of steps which lead up to the portico, and imparts an imposing grandeur to the whole, and the effect produced cannot fail of being highly gratifying, and must be acknowledged an ornament to the metropolis. The interior is certainly very elegant ; behind the altar, which is adorned with several fine marble columns, is a"], [115, "BANK OF ENGLAND. 99 beautiful painting in fresco, of the Crucifixion ; and on the ceiling are painted the Virgin Mary, the infant Jesus, and the four Evangelists, sur rounded by the principal events in our Saviour's life.

BANK OF ENGLAND. The derivation of the name from Banco, the Italian word for Bench, on which money changers annually sat in the public markets ; the first bank for the security of private property was that of Venice. The Bank of England was projected in the reign of William and Mary by Mr. William Paterson, a merchant, who submitted his scheme to the King in Council. It was, after considerable deliberation, established by act of parliament on the 27th of July, in the year 1694, and the statute enacted that their majesties might take particular subscriptions for \u00a31,200,000 of any person, foreigners or natives, whom their majesties were empowered to incorporate with a yearly allowance, viz. \u2014 of \u00a396,000, or eight per cent, for interest till redeemed, and \u00a34000 to be allowed the Bank for the expence of management. The title of \" Governor and Company of the Bank of England \" was conferred, and their fund above mentioned to be redeemable upon a year's notice, after the 1st of August, 1705, and pay- ment of the capital, and then the corporation to cease. The business of the Bank was originally transacted at Grocers' Hall, in the Poultry, but the present noble edifice in Threadneedle Street, or more probably Three Needle Street, was founded in the year 1733, the architect being Mr. George Sampson. The front is a sort of vestibule ; the base rustic, and the ornamental columns Ionic. Within is a court leading to a second elegant building, which contains halls and numerous offices where the business of the national debt of many hundred millions is conducted. Two wings of uncommon elegance, designed by Sir Robert Taylor, have been added at the expence of some houses and the church of St. Christopher Le Stocks. This circumstance occasioned many allusions to our Saviour's attack on the money changers, who had usurped the Temple at Jerusalem, and converted it into a den of thieves. The beautiful wings added by Sir Robert Taylor extend en- tirely from Princes Street, opposite the Mansion House, to Bartholomew Lane, opposite the Royal Exchange, and present a front range of fluted columns, in pairs, with arched intervals of stone instead of windows, the light being admitted by lantherns at the top ; and such is the increase of business, that since it has been deemed expedient to take down all the houses completely into Lothbury, which now forms a capital enlargement of this"], [116, "100 BANK OF ENGLAND. grand national edifice. We see, by notice in the Gazette, it is intended to form a way under the steeple of the church of St. Bartholomew, at the corner of Bartholomew Lane, in which alteration we contemplate a great increase of convenience and safety. Since the memorable riots in the year 1780 the Bank is very properly guarded by the military. We should have given an engraving of this great national establishment ; but at time of writing this, there is a scaffold up before its whole grand front, for it to undergo repairs and beautifying. We shall subjoin the following particulars in connexion with this sub ject : the Bank of England is under the management of a governor, deputy governor, and twenty-four directors, who are annually elected by ballot, at a general court of proprietors. The possession of \u00a34000 capital stock is the qualification of a governor ; \u00a3.3000 for a deputy governor ; and \u00a32000 for a director. Proprietors of \u00a3500 are alone entitled to vote in the general courts, which are held four times a year, or oftener, on the demand of nine members. Its business includes the banking business, dealing in Bullion, discounting bills of exchange, advancing money to government on the credit of acts of parliament, and above all, the circulation of bank notes on demand, as well as bank post bills, bearing no interest, the Bank also circulates Exchequer Bills for government. In the year 1717 the Bank lent government \u00a32,500,000 at \u00a35 per cent. In July, 1742, a further sum of \u00a31,600,000 was advanced, and though in 1760 they lent government \u00a31,000,000 more, they were so pressed by the rebellion of 1745, that on the 20th September they began making payments in a further loan of \u00a31,400,000, at 3 per cent. Under the administration of the first William Pitt they acquired credit on the continent, and after the peace of 1763 were universally current throughout Europe. Notes of \u00a310 and \u00a315 were first in 1759, and succeeded by \u00a35 in the course of years, but \u00a31 and \u00a32 notes were not circulated till the revolutionary war with France. In 1797 the Bank was restrained from paying in specie, but since May 5th, 1821, gold and silver has been plentiful. To a lover of his coun try, the contemplation of the Bank and its business form a sublime view of our national and commercial resources, never surpassed in the annals of any country, ancient or modern, and Lords of the world's great waste, the ocean we Whole forests send to reign upon the sea ; And ev'ry coast may trouble or relieve, Bnt none can visit us.

Cowper's Post Boy. The above correct view of the New Post Office, as it will appear when completed, is from the graver of the ingenious Mr Berryman. Scarcely any explanation can be required. It consists of a frontage of 400 feet, including the portico and two wings, of which the portico alone is 70 feet, and must form a considerable embellishment to that part of the city in which it is situate. The internal arrangements have been laid out on a plan to facilitate the important business of this national establishment, and greatly benefit commercial intercourse. The architect is R.

The country is indebted to a Mr. Edmund Prideaux for the Post Office, who was appointed Postmaster in 1642; when he established a"], [118, "102 STATUE OF CHARLES I. regular conveyance, by horses, of letters, weekly, to all parts of the kingdom. The sphere of the establishment was extended by the Protector Cromwell and his parliament, in 1654, the conveyance continuing either on horseback or by single-horse carts, until the year 1781 ; at which time speed, regularity, and public conveyance, began to be manifest, by the various establishments of stage coaches to and from London and every town of note in the kingdom. This led to the suggestion by Mr. John Palmer, of Bath, in 1782, of tlie present system of conveyance of letters by coaches. Mr. Palmer's sug gestions were adopted in 1784; since when, the arrangements have been progressively improved to such a degree, that it may, without fear of con tradiction, be said, that the British Post Office forms the most economical, social institution which has ever existed in any age or country. The post age of letters dispatched from London exceeds considerably the postage of those received. \u2014 Assuming an average rate of 9d. postage for each letter dispatched from London, the aggregate annual number will be about 13,500,000, or 40,000 per day, and about a ninth less received. There are about 1,000 persons, Members of both Houses of Parliament, and a few others, privileged to dispatch, free of postage, twenty letters daily, Sundays included ; and to receive fifteen daily, not exceeding an ounce in in weight each, equal to 280 single letters forwarded, and 360 weekly received. There are 544 deputy Postmasters in England and Wales, and 278 in Scotland, several, or most of which, have a sub-agent for collateral distribution ; so that, perhaps, but little or nothing remains to be done to make the order of distribution, in the general department, as complete as possible. The General Office, in London, employs about 200 superintendants, clerks, and sorters, and about 220 in delivering. The Foreign Department, about twenty sorters and clerks, and thirty-four in delivering ; and the Two Penny, about fifty sorters and clerks. The total number of persons con stantly engaged in the distribution of letters in all Great Britain, may be considered as exceeding 2,600 : whilst the total charges for salaries and wages is only about \u00a3140,000, or an average of \u00a356 each person per annum ; but the salaries and wages of those employed, are all regulated with reference to the probable amount of incidental emoluments.

PARADE OF St. JAMES'S PARK. The Horse Guards, which is a grand building in Parliament Street, and the Parade, so called, is situated at the back, and entere by that noble edifice. It presents every morning, about 10 o'clock, a most agreeable spectacle. At that hour the guard is relieved, and a new set of men are stationed at the several avenues and parts of the Park, Royal Palaces, &c. For this purpose they are convened on the Parade, neatly dressed and accoutred, making an interesting appearance. An officer of the Guards on horseback, indeed sometimes the commander-in-chief, His Royal Highness the Duke of York, directs the manual exercise, and the men are marshalled and reviewed in his presence, while his Royal Highnesses band, in which are the celebrated black musicians, with their lofty turbands and oriental instruments, add greatly to the beauty of the scene, as well as to the dignity of the fine martial music of the excellent band. So attractive sometimes is this spectacle and the grand band of music, that is attended by a great concourse of spectators. After passing through the various evolutions, the guards march away in great order, the music playing the most popular airs till they arrive at the palace ; where the guard, which are to relieve, are drawn out with their band ready to march away, that they may be discharged on the Parade, while the new guard, after relieving the necessary sentinels, are stationed in the guard houses.

There is nothing particular in its interior, which may be visited, as well as the House of Lords, for a small consideration ; but some account of St. Stephen's Chapel from its foundation, cannot fail of being truly interesting. Stephen seems to have erected this originally religious structure in honour of St. Stephen, the proto-martyr. King Edward I. however, seems to have rebuilt this chapel ; for in the twentieth year of his reign, the 28th April, 1292, the works of the new chapel began and continued for more than two years. An account of the expence of these operations is preserved in roto of weekly payments, remaining in the Exchequer. The several articles bought are stated ; then follow the payments to workmen : they are too minute to be here enumerated, but there are ap parent \u2014 to carpenters five-pence each day \u2014 to other workmen three-pence half-penny each day \u2014 some three-pence \u2014 some two-pence half-penny. Stow informs us, \"that on the 29th of March, 1298, a vehement fire being kindled in the lesser hall of the king's hall at Westminster, the flame being driven by the wind fired the monastery adjoining; which, with the palace were both consumed.\" Early in the succeeding reign this build ing engaged the royal attention, for on the 17th of May, 1330, fourth year of Edward III. the works of this chapel again commenced. The Comp troller's roll of expence of these operations, for near three years, is remain ing in the king's remembrancer's office in the Exchequer. The amount of the wages during the whole time of this account was \u00a3350 12s. Old. and of the materials used in the building \u00a3158 4s. i\\d. ; but it does not appear finished till some time after, as on the 6th of August, 1348, twenty-second year of Edward III. a royal charter, recites that a spacious chapel, situate within the palace of Westminster, in honour of St. Stephen, proto-martyr, had been nobly begun by his predecessors, and had been completed at his own expence, which, to the honour of Almighty God, and especially of the blessed Mary, his mother, and of the said martyr, he ordained, constituted, and appointed to be collegiate ; but still it does not appear that it was then finished, for the 1 8th of March, 1 350, twenty-fourth year of Edward III. the king appointed Hugh St. Albans, then master of the painters for the chapel, to take and chose as many painters and other workmen as should be necessary for carrying on the works in the chapel, as he should find in the counties of Kent, Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, and Sussex ; such work men to be paid at the expence of the king. A like appointment was made of John Atherland for Lincoln, Northampton, Oxford, Warwick, and Leicester ; and of Benedict Nightengale for Cambridge, Huntingdon, Nor folk, and Suffolk. Again, in the thirty-seventh year of Edward III., June 4th, 1363, similar orders for the procuration of painters, was given to William Walsingham. King Edward III. erected, for the use of this college, at some distance west, in the little sanctuary, out of the palace court, a strong clochard, or bell-tower, of stone and timber, covered with lead, and placed therein three great bells, which were afterwards rung at coronations, triumps, and funerals of princes, which gave such a huge sound, that it was commonly said they soured all the drink in the town. This college of St. Stephen was valued at the suppression to be worth \u00a31085 10s. 5rf., and surrendered in the first year of Edward VI."], [121, "ROYAL ARMOURY AND AUTOMATONS. 105 The Chapel of St. Stephen was soon afterwards fitted up for the meet ing of the House of Commons, which had before been usually assembled in the chapter house of the abbey of Westminster, and it has since con tinued to be appropriated to the same use to the present time.

Gray. Indeed, in this amusing and instructive exhibition, \" Helm and Hauberk's twisted mail \" is realized \u2014 we have inspected with delight, and shall add the proprietors' own account of such specimens as we think worthy minute attention. We select from the first 23 specimens, No. 2. \" The Armour of a Nor man Crusader on his barbed horse. \u2014 This ancient suit of Norman chain mail is of the utmost rarity, being the only perfect specimen extant : \u2014 it was preserved for several centuries in Tong Castle, in Shropshire, when it was obtained by the late Dr. Green, of Litchfield. It is about 700 years old, being of the time of King Stephen ; and with the highly curious and elaborate scale armour, &.c. which covers the horse, exhibits the only re maining example of the manner in which the Knights protected themselves and their horses in that early period of our history, as represented in ancient paintings, tapestry, &c. No. 5. \u2014 A fine and rare specimen of a Brigandine Jacket of the time of Elizabeth. This defence (which is composed of small plates of iron, capping over each other, and covered with cloth strongly quilted) was used principally by the archers and other light-armed troops, called Brigands, from whence its name was derived. No. 7 and 8 are exquisite treats. \u2014 No. 9. A noble suit of Knights, armour of the time James I. of bright steel. The pauldrons, or shoulder pieces are finely formed, and the guarde de reine, or skirt, remarbably wide and deep. No. 10. \u2014 The Armour worn by the King's Champion at the Coronation of His Majesty, George IV. \u2014 This superb fluted suit of polished steel was armour of the Elector of Bavaria, and with the beautiful War Saddle, chanfron, &c. was (with several others) obtained from the King of Bavaria for Napoleon Buonaparte, for the purpose of forming an armoury in Paris. This suit, which is of the most elegant form, is universally allowed to be one of the finest specimens of plate armour of the time of Henry VII. \u2014 No. 11 and 17 are armours also worn at the coronation \u2014 and No. 12 is the Champion's Shield."], [122, "106 ROYAL ARMOURY AND AUTOMATONS. No. 15. \u2014 The Armour of Henry IV of France, and his Page, with a like ness of that distinguished monarch. This very interesting and beautiful suit of armour is finely embossed and inlaid with gold : the pauldrons, or shoulder-pieces and the breast-plate are of the finest forms ; indeed, the toute ensemble of this noble suit (in which elegance and symmetry are obviously combined) has hitherto been an object of general admiration. Henry IV. is represented in this identical suit of armour in one of the fine portraits of that monarch in the Luxembourg Gallery. It was obtained in Paris by the total defeat of Napoleon. As the helmet would have taken off much of the character of the head, a hat and plume of the proper cos tume has been substituted. The noble Shield embossed with fleur-de-lis upon a gold ground, and a mace, are also fine specimens of workmanship. \u2014 The rare and interesting little suit of a boy, introduced as a page, for the purpose of forming the group, tends to prove the very early initation of persons of rank to the use of armour, which was highly necessary for those, who were intended for military pursuits, as habit and custom could alone enable them to bear its weight with any degree of ease and comfort. No. 19. \u2014 The Armour of the Elector Joseph of Bavaria, on horseback. This superb suit of black and gold, with the pectoral, chanfron, and other trappings for the horse, is another of those removed from the royal armoury of Munich, by Buonaparte, and is of the finest workmanship of the time of Henry VIII. On the centre of the breast is engraved and gilt the sub ject of the Virgin and Child ; and upon the plate in the centre of the chanfron, or head-piece of the horse, are engraved the Bavarian arms. The notice of the above, among so many interesting objects, we trust will be sufficient to give some idea of this nouvelle collection. No. 24. \u2014 Napoleon's Fire-Arms, presented him by the Directory, forms an object of history. There are eight specimens of spoil from the field of Waterloo ; and in two glass cases, and the opening between them there are 152 rare speci mens of various kinds, including the beautiful scale armour of Napoleon Buonaparte. \u2022 The mechanical and musical Automatons are truly ingenious and asto nishing, though we think we have seen some of the figures a few years ago, belonging to M. Maillardet. The following is a description of these won derful productions of art, which, if not the most useful, are certainly the most surprising. The Juvenile Artist, whose astonishing performances in drawing and writing (alternately), in presence of the company, defy at attempts all rival ship, in regard to their beauty, and correctness of design and execution. This rich and complicated piece of mechanism is so wonderfully constructed, that the graceful motions of the youthful figure, and its easy, elegant, and appropriate system of operations, will ever render it an object of the highest interest and admiration. The Musical Lady, who performs upon an elegant finger organ a variety of pleasing airs. The fascinating sweetness of her countenance, and lovely motion of the eyes, never fail in securing her admirers.

There are a great number of figures, among which some very accurate portraits of eminent persons connected with that singular inquiry : \u2014 we can only name the Queen and Lady Ann Hamilton ; the learned Counsel of both sides ; Theodore Majocci; the Interpreter ; Alderman Wood; Mr. Hobhouse ; the Artist himself, who are all below the bar : the Dukes of York and Sussex ; the Lord Chancellor ; Earl Grey ; the Bench of Bishops, and a great variety of other members of that noble assemblage, within the body of the House."], [124, "108 CHELSEA HOSPITAL. Sucn asylums as these, for the brave men who have fought our battles, do honour to a country, and form a comfortable home for many a veteran, as well as the wounded and invalided. Sir Stephen Fox, a pro genitor of Lord Holland, was the first projector of this Hospital, which met with ready encouragement in Charles II. Chelsea Hospital, which is situate on the banks of the Thames, in the pretty village of that name, was built from a design, and under the superintendance of Sir Christopher Wren. The first stone of the building was laid on the 12th of March, 1682. Sir Stephen Fox is generally sup posed to have contributed no less than \u00a315,000 ; but it has received from time to time very liberal donations. Its architecture is modest and unas suming, avoiding splendour, or too great humility, unbecoming its deserv ing inmates. The building, which contains three courts, is built of brick, with columns and cornices of free stone. The entire length ofthe principal building is 190 feet, and the whole of the premises occupy 50 acres. In the chief court is a bronze statue of the royal founder, in a Roman habit. The chapel, which is a neat building, is paved with black and white marble, and wainscoted with Dutch oak. In the dining room, which is of suitable dimensions, a dinner for the pensioners is regularly placed every day (except Sunday) at twelve o'clock, but they are allowed to take their provisions with them to their respective apartments. The pensioners are, we believe, about 470, who inhabit six teen wards ; over which are two corporals and two serjeants. The number of out pensioners is very considerable, and the amount of their allowances is annually voted by parliament with the army estimates. Except Wednesday and Fridays, each pensioner is allowed per diem, a pound of meat, twelve ounces of bread, a quarter of a pound of cheese, and two quarts of beer ; and on the other days, instead of meat, a pint of pea soup, and an extra allowance of cheese and butter is given. NEW ASYLUM FOR FEMALE ORPHANS, LAMBETH. This building is situated in the Westminster Road, Surrey, facing Mr. Maudsley's manufactory, and forms a handsome ornament to the suburbs of London in Surrey. The building forms three squares of a quadrangle, with a large court in front. The centre building is appropriated to the hall, the committee rooms, and the residence of the principal officers, and the wings to the working and sleeping rooms of the children. The chapel has not been taken down, but is connected with the new building, which is a chaste, but elegant structure, from a design by Mr. Lloyd, the architect. As the ex pence of the building is necessarily considerable, the committee appeal to public support ; and we trust will not appeal in vain, as, unless it can be"], [125, "109 NEW ASYLUM FOR FEMALE ORPHANS. paid for without encroaching on the funds of the charity, the benefits of the institution must be curtailed, and this we hope will never be the case. This charity owes its origin to Sir John Fielding, an active magistrate, who had observed, that though our laws had humanely provided parish settlements, yet cases were constantly occurring where it was next to impossible to ascertain such settlements. In consequence he and other humane individuals became desirous of forming an establishment to remove those evils. The children of soldiers and sailors, as well as indigent persons, whose parish settlement is unknown, bereft of their parents, and at a distance from their relations, are particularly objects of compassion ; and of this description, females in particular. Two hundred destitute, or deserted children, are daily sheltered and pro tected from vice and want, supplied with frtod and clothing, and taught whatever can render them useful in their future situations and happy in themselves \u2014 carefully instructed in the principles of religion, in writing, needle-work, and household matters, and trained to habits of industry, a supply of diligent and sober domestics is formed. This charity is governed by a president, (at present his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge), six vice-presidents, and a number [of guardians. A subscription of thirty guineas at once constitutes the donor a perpetual guardian, and a yearly subscription of three guineas qualifies for an annual guardian. The asylum is supported by voluntary donations and subscriptions ; oc casional sermons are preached for its benefit, at which the young women who have been brought up there, and apprenticed out, return public thanks. Children between the ages of nine and twelve years are admitted, after it is ascertained that they are really orphans, and that they are neither dis eased, deformed, or infirm. The children make and mend their own linen, make shirts, table-linen, &c. and all kinds of needle-work ; and twelve of them are weekly selected to assist the cook to wash, iron, and get up linen, and to do the general business of the house and kitchen. At the age of fifteen, or sooner, they are bound apprentices for service, as domestic servants ; but the utmost care is taken to provide for them in respectable families, whose character is a guarantee that they will be well treated : and in order to encourage the girls to serve their apprenticeship faithfully, they are presented with five guineas each at its termination, if the master or mistress will certify their good conduct. A chaplain reads prayers twice every Sunday throughout the year, and two mornino- and one evening preachers are appointed in addition to the chaplain. The preachers are generally popular divines, who attract large congregations, and thus contribute to the support of the institution. LICENCED VICTUALLERS' SCHOOL, KENNINGTON LANE. This truly valuable institution is only noticed here to recommend it as a model of establishments of the kind. If you see the children, you behold health, beauty, and intelligence, combined with religion and moraility."], [126, "no BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL. The present edifice, which is situate in the Lambeth Road, Surrey, near the Obelisk, was commenced in 1812, from the designs and under tho direction of Mr. James Lewis, architect. The first stone was laid with the usual ceremony on the 20th of April in that year, and the building was completed in 1815, at an expence of about \u00a3100,000, of which \u00a372,819 ls.6rf. was granted by Parliament at different times, and \u00a310,229 subscribed by public bodies and private individuals. The corporation of the city gave \u00a33000, the Bank of England \u00a3500 towards this sum. This building, which is a great ornament to this part of the metropolis, is constructed principally of brick. It fronts the north, and its length is 569 feet ; its altitude to the parapet 60 feet ; and the depth of each wing is 45 feet. The style of architecture is plain and simple, but the symmetry of the building is perfect, and the general effect magnificent. In the architectural design and arrangement of the interior great judg ment has been displayed, and good provision has been made for the sepa ration of the sexes, and classification of the unfortunate inmates. In the rear of the building are extensive airing grounds. Bethlehem, or Bethlem Hospital, derived its name and origin from a priory founded by Simon Fitzmary, who was sheriff of London in 1247, on the west side of Bishopgate, on the site where the street now called Old Bethlem stands. This priory was for the fratres militiae beatae Marine de Bethelem ; but the society was never very numerous. It afterwards, according to Stow, became an hospital for \" distracted people.\" On the suppression of the monasteries, Henry VIII. at the request of Sir John Gresharn, Lord Mayor, granted its lands and revenues to the cities of London, for the reception and maintenance of lunatics ; and in 1549, let ters patent were issued to John Whitehead, proctor of the hospital, to solicit donations within the counties of Lincoln and Cambridge, the city of London, and Isle of Ely. The confined limits and decayed state of the priory soon rendered a larger and more convenient building necessary, and a new hospital was built on the south side of Moorfields, and finished in the year 1676, at an expence of \u00a317,000. To this building two wings were added in 1733 for incurables. The increased value of the ground so near the city, and the decayed state of the hospital, suggested the propriety of removing the establishment. This establishment, which is supported by the estates it possesses, and voluntary contributions, is intended for the reception of indigent lunatics. At the time of admission the sum of two pounds must be paid with each patient, and security given that the lunatic will be taken away whenever the committee think proper. In summer the patients rise at six o'clock every morning, and breakfast at eight ; in winter at seven, and breakfast at half-past eight : they dine at one, and sup at six. Each patient has a separate room : the bedsteads are of iron, with a sacking bottom ; a flock mattress, a pillow, three blan kets, a pair of sheets (which are regularly changed every fortnight), and a rag are allowed for each. The patients' linen is entirely changed weekly ; and washed in a very convenient laundry, having a large drying yard in front, and an excellent stove room for the same use in wet weather."], [127, "SURREY LITERARY INSTITUTION. 111 The general breakfast for the patients is gruel mixed with milk, and two ounces of bread ; but those who cannot relish that food are permitted to take tea with the keepers, at a small weekly charge. The dinner is varied daily throughout the week : meat, either corned beef, veal, or boiled or roast mutton, with seven ounces of bread, and vegetables in season, being allowed on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays; pudding, broth, peas-soup, rice-milk, bread and butter, &c. are allowed on other days. The supper is seven ounces of bread and two of butter. Good table-beer is allowed, without restriction as to quantity. \u2014 Sick and weakly patients have a different diet suited to their respective afflictions. No person whatever, except governors, or those in company with a gover nor, is permitted to view the Hospital and patients ; but either the presi dent or the treasurer may issue written orders for the admission of any peer or member of parliament, at convenient hours. Patients, when suffi ciently convalescent, are permitted to see a friend or two on Mondays, during the hours from ten till twelve. It appears, from a return made by the physicians of this Hospital to the governors, in January, 1822, that the mumber of patients in the Hospital was 346, of whom 210 were deemed curable, 77 incurable ; and 59 crimi nals, who were to be confined for life : among these are Margaret Nicholson, who attempted to stab his late Majesty, and Hadfield, who shot at the King in Drury Lane Theatre. In the hall of the Hospital are the two celebrated figures of raving and melancholy madness, which were in front of the Old Bethlehem Hospital in Moorfields. They were executed by Caius Gabriel Cibber. SURREY LITERARY INSTITUTION, MANSION HOUSE, HIGH STREET, CAMBERWELL. This Institution opened Tuesday, 1st February, 1825, when the Rev. J. Peers, M. A. gave a Public Lecture on the utility and importance of Literary Institutions. The object of this Institution is to promote literary and scientific inter course, and to provide for the members' access to a superior library and leading room, at an expence not exceeding that of the commonest circu lating library, carefully excluding every work of a controversial nature, either in theology or politics, and every thing that can tend to loosen the moral or social ties of individuals to society. The library consists of the most valuable works in the various depart ments of art and sciences, biography, general history, voyages and travels, Belles Letters, &c. and is open to subscribers at one guinea per annum. The reading room is provided with morning and evening newspapers ; weekly, monthly, and quarterly publications."], [128, "112 THE NEW CHURCH, POPLAR. This neat little edifice is one of the handsomest new churches erected in the vicinity ofthe metropolis ; many parts are chaste and beautiful, and do infinite credit to Mr. Hollis, the architect. The plinth and area of the western entrance is of Granite; the rest of Portland stone. The portico is of the Ionic order, supported by four columns ; the basement of the tower is rusticated, from whence arises the beauties of Corinthian order : above this is the place appropriated for the dial, which is rusticated also ; on this part stands a colonnade of sixteen composite columns, rather wanting in height to appear graceful, yet, upon the whole, they have a pleasing effect ; on the entablature of these columns are several circular plinths or bases, one above another, gradually diminishing upwards ; the light and beautiful spire springing from the top one, terminates with the vane, which is 160 feet from the ground. The north and south western entrances are of the same order as the portico: there is a richness in the tower and spire. Beneath one of the windows is a descent by a flight of steps leading to the cemeteries for the dead under the church, which are admirably arranged in three aisles. The interior of the church exhibits little of architectural beauty ; the pewing of the gallery rises too abruptly ; a second gallery for children almost against the ceiling is not graceful : there is nothing in the pulpit to admire, but considerable pains have been taken to enrich the altar ; at the front of the recess two beautiful Corinthian columns with corresponding pilasters of scagliola in imitation of Sienna marble are intro duced, with a richly ornamented entablature ; these, in the manner in which they stand, are the only obstruction the eye meets with inside the church ; this may be discovered on taking a seat in the most remote place from the pulpit ; it is in other respects well adapted for the whole congregation to see and hear from any part. The painted window is under an entablature supported by pilasters of scagliola, in imitation of verd antique : there is not height in the window to admit the figure (Christ preaching) to be grace ful. The organ, by Russell, is a fine, full-toned, powerful instrument, and few can excel it: the drapery and cushions deviate in colour from what is generally seen in churches : viz. from crimson to dark blue ; the sombre appearance of which forms a striking contrast to the general character of the internal arrangement, which is exceeding light and lively. It is warmed by flues beneath the pavement connected with stoves under the church. There is a set of ten bells. The whole is encompassed by a spacious church-yard, enclosed with lofty iron railings. The parsonage house is neat, and conveniently situated at the west end, on the opposite side of a newly formed street. In conclusion, we cannot but recommend the curious in fruit and flowers to the various exhibitions in the season, which abound about London, which may be viewed for a small expence or gratuity ; and in taking leave, say our next shall be an attempt at an improvement on this.
