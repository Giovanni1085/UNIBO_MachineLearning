The text contains lists of the most important names, with noteworthy facts added in many cases, and the maps are drawn to correspond with these lists. Special attention has been given to clearness of printing, and the coast-lines have been simplified and emphasised in order to catch the learner's eye, thus enabling* him to remember and reproduce the maps more readily. A number of maps of river -basins will be found with the text and at the end of the book. A railway map of England is also given. Some remarks and definitions in Mathematical and Physical Geography are added. The main object of the book is to place before the learner names and maps in the clearest and most connected form, and hence to give the teacher more time for the explanation and illustration necessary to com plete this framework.

The earth is a sphere (slightly flattened at the Poles). Proofs that the earth is round \u2014 (1) As a vessel approaches the land, the masts are visible before the hull ; whereas, if the earth were fiat, the hull, being the largest part of the ship, would be seen first. (2) The earth can be sailed round. (3) The shadow which the earth casts upon the moon, during an eclipse of the moon, is circular. (4) Direct measure ment and calculation. AXIS AND POLES. 2. The straight line passing through the centre of the earth and the flattened ends is called the Axis of the earth. The extremities of the axis are called the Poles. MEASUREMENTS. 3. In order to measure distances on the earth's surface, two series of imaginary circles are supposed to be drawn. (1) Parallels of Latitude; (2) Meridians or lines of Longitude. Each circle is supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts, called degrees. EQUATOR. 4. The Equator is an imaginary circle drawn round the earth midway between the poles. PARALLELS OF LATITUDE. 5. Parallels of Latitude are circles drawn round the earth parallel to the Equator. The latitude of any place is its distance, measured in degrees, north or south of the Equator. i"], [126, "REMARKS AND DEFINITIONS 114 TROPICS. 6. The parallel of latitude 23^\u00b0 N. is called the Tropic of Cancer. The parallel of latitude 231\u00b0 S. is called the Tropic of Capricorn. POLAR CIRCLES. 7. The parallel of latitude 23|\u00b0 from the North Pole is called the Arctic Circle. The parallel of latitude 23^\u00b0 from the South Pole is called the Antarctic Circle. ZONES. 8. The belt of the earth's surface lying between the Tropics is called the Torrid Zone. The two belts lying between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, and between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle, are called the Temperate Zones. The caps of the earth's surface north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle are respectively called the North Frigid Zone and the South Frigid Zone. MERIDIANS OR LINES OF LONGITUDE. 9. Meridians are semicircles drawn through the poles at right angles to the Equator. The meridian passing through Greenwich is called the first meridian. The longitude of any place is its distance, measured in degrees on the Equator, east or west of the first meridian. Longitude is measured only as far as 180\u00b0 (half-way round the Equator, E. or W.), so that 180\u00b0 W. longitude gives the same position as 180\u00b0 E. longitude. DIAMETERS OF THE EARTH. 10. The length of the Polar Diameter or Axis of the earth is 7899 miles nearly; the length of the Equatorial Diameter is 7925 miles nearly. STATUTE AND GEOGRAPHICAL MILES. 11. The circumference of the earth at the Equator is about 25,000 statute or ordinary miles. The length therefore of a degree on the Equator is of 25,000 miles, or 69^ miles nearly. The length of a degree on the Equator is also called 60 geographical miles, so that 60 geographical miles are equal in length to 69^ Statute miles."], [127, "REMARKS AND DEFINITIONS 115 MOTIONS OF THE EARTH. Daily Motion. 12. The earth revolves about its axis once in twenty-four hours. This motion produces day and night. Yearly Motion \u2014 Orbit. 13. The earth also revolves round the sun in about 365 days. This motion makes the sun appear to revolve about the earth. The path traced by the earth's centre in the course of a year (or the apparent path of the sun) is called the orbit of the earth. ECLIPTIC. 14. The ecliptic is a great circle which marks the sun's apparent path. OBLIQUITY OF ECLIPTIC. 15. If the axis of the earth were perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, that is, if the earth moved in an upright position, day and night would be of equal length all over the earth. But the axis is always inclined at an angle of 23^\u00b0 to the ecliptic, and always points to the Pole star. This inclination of the axis is called the Obliquity of the Ecliptic. In winter the North Pole is turned away from the sun, but in summer it is turned towards the sun. Hence as we approach the North Pole the day gets longer in summer, and shorter in winter, and we should find at the pole itself that there is one day and one night each half a year long. At the Equator the days and nights are of equal length. EQUINOXES. 16. Twice in the year, about the 22d of March and the 22d of September, the earth reaches points in the ecliptic where the sun is exactly over the Equator. At these points therefore the line dividing the dark half of the globe from the bright half passes through the poles, and day and night are of equal length all over the world. Hence the points in the earth's orbit at which the sun is vertical to the Equator are called the Equinoxes. SEASONS. 17. The inclination of the earth's axis to its annual orbit produces also the succession of seasons. Owing to this obliquity the sun's rays fall, on any particular place, with a degree of warmth which varies as the earth revolves in its orbit. [The angle which the horizontal plane (plane touching the earth at the given spot) makes with the sun's rays, changes as the earth revolves round the sun.]"], [128, "116 REMARKS AND DEFINITIONS DIFFERENCE OF TIME FOR DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE. 18. The earth revolves daily from west to east, that is, it turns through 360\u00b0 in twenty-four hours, that is, through 15\u00b0 every hour, or through 1\u00b0 every four minutes. When the meridian (meridies, mid-day) through any place comes directly under the sun, it is mid-day at that place. Hence the clocks at places on western meridians (reckoning from Greenwich) mark mid-day later than Greenwich time at the rate of one hour for 15\u00b0 W. longitude, while those on eastern meridians strike noon sooner at the same rate. Thus, if we carry a watch showing Greenwich time, we can calculate our longitude, as we go west or east, by comparison of Greenwich with local time. ZENITH, NADIR. 19. The Zenith is the point in the sky directly overhead. The Nadir is the zenith point at the Antipodes (the spot at the other side of the globe where the people have their feet exactly opposite ours. Australians are at the antipodes of Englishmen). PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY DEFINITIONS 20. Atoll. \u2014 An Atoll is a ring of coral in a deep ocean, inside which is a lagoon of shallow water. Avalanche. \u2014 An Avalanche is a fall of snow, caused by the loosening of a mass of snow at the edge of a snow-field overhanging a steep slope. Bore. \u2014 The Bore, or tidal-wave, is the first large tide wave which rushes up narrow channels, and estuaries open towards the direction in which the tide flows. It rises to a height of 70 feet in the Bay of Fundy, and to 40 feet during spring tides in the mouth of the Severn. Calms. \u2014 On each side of the region of the Trade Winds there is a region of calms and variable winds \u2014 to the north the Calms of Cancer, to the south the Calms of Capricorn. The Belt of Equatorial Calms is the name given to the air in the neighbourhood of the Equator. This air is not, however, calm, but in constant upward movement, as it gets heated. To supply its place there are air-currents coming in from the north and south. Constant Precipitation Zone. \u2014 The hot, moist (because of vapour received from ocean) air ascending from the tropics expands and cools as it ascends, and the moisture falls continually in rain. Hence constant rains and thunderstorms give to the tropical region the name of the Zone of Constant Precipitation."], [129, "REMARKS AND DEFINITIONS 117 Crater. \u2014 The hollow at the top of a volcano, from which molten rock or lava, with other matter, is thrown out, is called the crater. Delta. \u2014 The triangle of marshy land formed at the mouth of a large river by the sediment brought down, is called its delta. Estuary. \u2014 The mouth of a tidal river. Fauna and Flora. \u2014 The animals of a district are called its fauna, and the plants its flora. Floe or Field Ice. \u2014 Vast sheets of ice in the seas near the pole, caused by the freezing of the surface of the sea. Geysers. \u2014 Boiling springs, found in Iceland, New Zealand, and the Yellowstone Park in Wyoming. Glaciers. \u2014 Streams of ice, which gradually wear their way down the slopes of mountains to below the snow-line. Gulf Stream. \u2014 A warm current (caused by the rotation of the earth and by constant winds, called Trade Winds) which issues from the Gulf of Mexico through the Strait of Florida, runs for a time parallel to the United States coast, and then turns north-eastward. As it crosses the Atlantic, it divides into two branches, one of which flows towards the British Isles and Norway (thus raising the temperature of these countries), while the other branch turns south-east towards Spain, then south down the African coast, and finally, coming again under the influence of the Trade Winds, is sent back across the Atlantic to the American coast. Within the wide stretch of sea enclosed by this second branch of the Gulf Stream is a large extent of water not influenced by currents, in which great masses of seaweed grow. This region is called the Sargasso Sea. Ice-foot. \u2014 When the sea freezes along the coast, as is the case in some northern latitudes, the ice so formed rises with the tide and is frozen to the shore. Thus a shelf of ice is gradually formed, which is called the Ice-foot. Isobars. \u2014 Imaginary lines drawn on the surface of the earth to show places of equal atmospheric pressure.

Solano. \u2014 The simoom which blows to Spain. Snow-line is the line of elevation above the sea beyond which the snow never melts. Steppes. \u2014 The great sandy plains of Eussia. Tides. \u2014 The attraction of the moon, and, in a lesser degree, that of the sun, upon the sea produces a great wave which points towards the moon and goes com pletely round the earth once a day, as the earth revolves. Corresponding to this swelling, there is another wave on the opposite side of the earth which follows the same course ; thus there are two times of high or flood tide, and two of low or ebb tide in a day. The combined attraction of the sun and moon is greatest when they are in a straight line with the earth. This happens at new and full moon, and then the tides rise higher and fall lower than usual. They are then called spring tides. When the lines joining the centres of the sun and moon to the centre of the earth are at right angles to each other, the resultant attraction of the sun and moon is least. This happens at the times of the first and last quarters of the moon, and then the tides are neither so high nor so low as usual. These lowest tides are called neap tides. Trade Winds are winds that always blow in one direction. As the hot, moist air at the Equator ascends (see \" Constant Precipitation \") continual currents of cold air flow in from the poles to replace the ascending current. These currents, owing to the rotation of the earth from west to east, seem to be continually turned west ward with increasing rapidity as they approach the Equator, where the velocity of rotation is greatest. Thus the north-east Trade Winds are produced by the current of air flowing towards the Equator from the North Pole, and the south-east Trade Winds are caused by the current flowing from the South Pole.
