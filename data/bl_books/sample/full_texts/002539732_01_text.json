Cologne, _8lh July 1824. MY DEAR C * * * *, I avail myself of a day's detention in this city, to tell you that I am thus far on my journey. Soon after my arrival this morning, and whilst I was taking some refreshment, in lending to remain about an hour, the"], [16, "A JOURNEY 10 landlord of the hotel came to me, and an nounced that my carriage required some repairs. On examination, I found that one of the wheels was slightly injured ; but that all could have been set to rights in a very short time, and I begged that the work might be commenced immediately. \" But, \" said mine host (a Frenchman), \" But, Sir, I have \" the honor to inform you that this cannot \" be done to-day. \" And the answer to my \" why ? \" was, \"Because the city of Cologne \" is so very Catholic, that the artisans are \" forbidden to labour on a Sunday. \" Now, although in a city through which there is so much travelling, a workman might surely have been found to do the needful on such an occasion, I did not consider it worth while to dispute the point; for, not having enjoyed any rest since quitting Calais, me thought it might be quite as well to halt. So, having given strict orders that all should be ready by eight o'clock in thc morning, I"], [17, "TO ODESSA. 11 obtained the assistance of a guide, and peram bulated this ancient city, \u2014 saw a body of very fine Prussian troops, on parade, \u2014 visited the churches, and, in short, filled up the day as advantageously as I could. The person who accompanied me said lhat he had formerly resided in London ; and he entertained me more frequently with the history of his adventures there, than with a designation ofthe curiosities of this ci-devant Capital of the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine : \u2014 I will, in some measure, follow his example, by giving you an account of my own proceedings since I quitted M , which I did at six in the morning of the 1 2th instant; and travelling rapidly over the thirty-two miles to Hyde-Park-Corner, reach ed the Tower Stairs by a quarter to ten.

I had not, at that time, the most remote idea of removing from a tranquil country residence to so bustling a scene; much less could I have imagined that I should so soon be pursuing my course to a distant part of the world, charged with an important mission, the success of which was to depend entirely on my own exertions. \u2014 There was something exciting, and suited to my disposition, in the idea of finding my way to the shores of the Black Sea ; for, al though such an undertaking was not of an extremely arduous nature, yet there were difficulties to be surmounted which would call forth that spirit of inquiry, and demand those energetic measures, whereby travel is rendered interesting and useful. You know, that, during my short career, it has often fallen lo my lot to visit foreign countries; and now that I was fairly ship ped, \u2014 \"in good order, and well-condi tioned\" \u2014 on board the vessel which was to"], [19, "TO ODESSA. 13 convey me to the point whence I intended to commence my long journey, I indulged in those feelings of affection for my native land which are naturally predominant on such occasions.

I have passed through Dunkerque, Lille, Tournai, Bruxelles, Louvain, Maestricht, and Aix-la-Chapelle. Fain would I have spent a day at Bruxelles, where I resided for some months, soon after the battle of Waterloo. I should have enjoyed a reminiscence ; but it was my duty to push on. At Aixda-Chapelle I managed to go through the rooms, where gaming is carried on, al most without intermission, from ten' in the morning until the same hour at night. These rooms are very handsome. I also visited the Cathedral ( which is undergoing repair) and saw the chair of marble on which the em-"], [21, "TO ODESSA. 15 balmed body of Charlemagne was found, in a sitting posture, three hundred years after his death. This chair has served as a throne for several emperors at their coronations : \u2014 on those occasions it was, of course, covered with costly materials. Some extraordinary relics are preserved in this Cathedral; but they are exhibited only to crowned heads. Perhaps a crown-piece, or at all events half a sovereign, might have in duced the guardians of these sacred remains to expose them to my plebeian gaze \u2014 but I had neither time nor coin to throw away, and therefore contented myself with the pleasures of imagination. As I was traversing the nave, a quantity of mortar fell from the roof, and a cracking noise was heard, followed by a strange sound, as though a gong had been forcibly struck.

It turned out that a poor mason,"], [22, "16 A JOURNEY who was working on a stage, suspended by ropes from the lofty ceiling, had fallen into the organ, and was killed. At Aix la Chapelle I changed all my French money \u2014 which had answered every purpose in Belgium \u2014 for Prussian coin. I witnessed an amusing scene at the table d'hote, where I dined to-day. Amongst the guests were three genuine gourmands : \u2014 I was informed that two of them were priests, and that the third was a wealthy indivi dual, who had amassed his large fortune during the late war, as a contractor, or some thing of that kind. This last was the treater; the two priests, the tveatees. They dine frequently at the table d'hote, and usually remain over the bottle till about midnight. Their conversation consists ex clusively of quaint remarks on the good things of this world. I left them at six o'clock, and returned from my stroll at about nine. The triumviri were still seated at one end of"], [23, "TO ODESSA. 17 the long dining-table, sipping their hock. The only outward sign that I could discover ofthe party having \" of liquor good store \" was, that the face of one of the holy men (a jolly-fat-friar-looking person ) was rather more rubicund than before. The contractor's eyes glistened additionally too. As for the other priest, he was as pale as ever. These worthies were sparing of words, and the few they did let fall were articulated in an under voice. They were as calm and collected as when they first sat down to dinner \u2014 vet many a bottle had they cracked together. But what excited my surprise was, that each of the gourmets had a large uncooked Westphalian ham placed before him ; and that, from lime to time, he took it up, smelt it, and then sipped his wine. Occasionally a puncture was made in one of the hams with an iron skewer, which was withdrawn, and hastily applied to the nose : \u2014 then the said ham was passed from one to another, to have \u25a0i"], [24, "18 A JOURNEY a similar operation performed by each. All was done with the utmost gravity, and I con cluded that this was a refinement in luxury pe culiar to Germany ; that the Westphalian ham was a sort of olfactory olive, to give zest to the Rhine wine. I could hardly keep my countenance. Presently the landlord entered. The smok ed hams again went round in succession : a council seemed to be holding on some knotty point ; a conclusion was come to, and (to sum up all ) I discovered lhat the politic landlord was about to purchase one of the hams, and had submitted its selection to the decision of these good judges, who were to partake of the same when cooked.

Dresden being the last capital I should pass through, I deemed it prudent to wait on the British Minister, and endeavour to re medy any omission ofthe necessary forms; for my passport was merely the usual one granted by the French Ambassador in Lon don.

There is a noble view of the surrounding country from the tower of the Lutheran Church : \u2014 it is a very fine building, and there are galleries round the interior of the dome which give it a grand appearance.

The officers at Gorlitz had declared, in an equally positive manner, that no such thing was there when I entered that town ; consequently it must have been abstracted on the road between the two places. There it was that the postil lion conducted himself so strangely, and that my whole attention was called towards him ; for he seemed stupified, and I expected an overturn every moment : no doubt the thieves"], [43, "TO ODESSA. 37 were labouring in their vocation at that time. On arriving at the post-house at Lobau, and explaining the cause of my return, Schwar, the postillion, was brought before me ; but my interrogations and threats produced no ef fect : tbe postmaster seemed rather disposed to excuse the man than to assist me. This was decidedly wrong, for he had been inebriated, or feigned to be so, and consequently ought to have been reprimanded, for the sake of future travellers. We made every enquiry on our return, but to no good purpose. Perhaps it was as well that I did not disco ver what was going on ; for had any suspi cious noise reached my ears, I should, natu rally, have tried to defend my properly, and might have fared ill in the hands of the ruf fians who swarm on the borders.

He was, however, obliging, and I was happy in having it in my power to make him a little present. The road from Gorlitz to Breslau is very sandy. A singular effect is produced by the form of the windows in the roofs of the houses in this part of the country. These windows are made in the shape of an eye, and a small projection of the tiles immediately above them imparts the character of a brow.

Breslau, the capital of Silesia, is an interest ing city. I followed my usual plan of mount ing a tower, and was repaid for the trouble of ascending that of the Protestant church, St. Elisabeth, by a magnificent prospect. I found my way to a convent of Ursuline nuns, and had an opportunity of conversing with the lady-abbess, who is very old, and of noble family. After her departure I had the pleasure of seeing a young and beautiful lady, of whom I purchased twospecimens of flowers curiously worked on paper.

The landlord of the hotel"], [51, "TO ODESSA. 45 in formed me that even the higher classes are filthy in the extreme ; that theyare consider ed as nuisances in the inns, and that when ever a plausible excuse can be made for de clining the honour of their company, it is invariably availed of. Brieg is a handsome town \u2014 you enter it through a gothic gate \u2014 the roads in the neigh bourhood are extremely sandy; and the post boys often say, on commencing the stage, viel tandt, mein herr \u2014 lcmuch sand, sir.\" \u2014 This I consider as an indication ( and lhe re sult always confirms my opinion ) lhat in ad dition to the usual tardiness, the evil is lo be encreased by a heavy road. There is a good deal of tobacco grown hereabouts. The pea santry in Silesia are civil and respectful ; the poor women appear to work very hard ; it is quite distressing to see them doing all the drudgery, and their persons totally neglected. The boundaries of the different states are marked by wooden barriers, each of which"], [52, "46 A JOURNEY consists of a long pole that crosses the road, and is raised by a very simple machinery when car riages pass \u2014 these barriers are painted diffe rently so as to designate each particular terri tory : thus, the colours of Hessen-Cassel are green and white \u2014 of Saxony red and white, Prussia black and white, etc., etc. At Oppeln I entered a Jewish inn for the firsttime. In the miserable and filthy bed-room into which I was ushered, a notice was affixed to the wall, stating, that many robberies ha ving been committed in the inns, persons are recommended to be careful ; to lock the door on leaving the apartment, and to consign any valuable property they may have, to the care of the master of the house ; otherwise he will not hold himself responsible. This, added to the wretched appearance of all around, is not very cheering ; for it shews that one is about to pass through localities abounding in rogues.

I dare say you will remember the waiter at Cheltenham, who spurned at my sixpence, tendered as a recompense for having handed us a sand wich and a glass of wine and water : his contemptuous look, and insolent speech of \"I hope you don't mean to offer me this, sir \" \u2014 at the same time turning my poor tester about in his hand ; which I was weak enough to exchange for a shilling. I now perceived that I was entering upon"], [54, "48 A JOURNEY a part of the country which would present some novel features.

The roofs are very generally covered with shingles, as is the custom in the West Indies. Sometimes there are rude wooden piazzas before these miserable dwellings ; and large uncouth wooden spouts project from the roofs to carry off the rain water, which falls like a cascade into the street. The habita- tions and the inmates exhibit signs of extreme poverty. Aj Tost there is a picturesque ruin of an old castle ; the road from thence to Tarnowitz is bad beyond description.

I have arrived at some slight degree of perfection in the management of my poor carcase \u2014 there is nothing like experience. Now by grasping firmly, with each hand, the straps at the sides of my little caleche^ I am prepared for a shock ; and rising scientifically at the critical moment, as one would when mounted on a hard-trotting horse, I manage to coincide with the cushion; and thus pre vent my head from being driven through lhat of the carriage : you will easily imagine what very pleasant travelling this must be; the worst of it is I have no one to laugh with.

The sheep hereabouts are small, dirty, and vermin looking. There is not the least appearance of an approach to comfort. The entrance to Cracow is horrible : the carriage was actually embedded in mud ; by the way-side are a number of wretched hovels inhabited by Jews, who peered at us as we crept along.

In making use of the expression bigoted Roman Catholic, I do not mean to speak slight ingly of those whose tenets differ from my own ; for I respect the feelings of all whom I believe to be sincere, let their religious per suasions be what they may .- but we meet with certain things, now and then, which cannot fail to excite risibility or disgust ; the latter"], [60, "A JOURNEY 54 feeling being produced by the effrontery of such individuals, or communities, as endea- vour to pass off the most ridiculous stories and traditions for facts.

In a field in the distance are others who are undergoing the delightful ope ration of decapitation for the same praisewor thy purpose. In the chapel of the same convent there is also a picture representing a lady praying be fore an image of our Saviour.

The most miserable ob jects are to be seen lying about the steps of the churches : in this city the contrast between penury and splendour is painfully striking. I believe it made a slight sensation that an Englishman was passing through Cracow ; for, having had occasion to go to a shop to make a small purchase, a gentleman who en tered soon after me, took an opportunity, upon observing that I had a little difficulty in ex plaining myself, to address me very politely, and in good English, offering to make my wishes known to the master of the shop.

My Polish friend sighed as he pointed out to me the patriot's resting-place : \u2014 he evidently mourned over the fate of his country, and was indignant at the atrocious partitions that have been made of it; but there was no bombast, no violence, in his language or manner. Mr. S... has never been in England; he is, however, well versed in the history and literature of our country : on our way to my hotel he did me the favour to invite me to"], [63, "TO ODESSA. 57 pass half an hour with him at his apartments, which I did, and was agreeably surprised to find that the chief portion of his small but select library was composed of the works of the best British authors. This gentleman speaks English almost without a foreign accent; he informed me that he was self-taught, and had perfected himself in the conversational part during his acquaintance with an Englishman who resides at Cracow, to whom he afterwards introduced me. I invited them both to take their coffee with me in the evening, and passed a few hours very pleasantly in their society. Thus, you see, that, notwithstanding all quarrels, and wars, and prejudices, the Bri tish name is respected by the liberal and en lightened of all countries. \u2014 Here, on the banks of the Vistula, my title of Englishman was a passport to a heart panting for freedom in the breast of a noble-minded Pole.

This city and its vicinity are celebrated for many important events during the wars with the Turks. All the great commercial houses have a facteur, as he is called, in their employ. This functionary is a respectable Jew, who is acquainted with all the rest of his tribe, and acts as a broker : confidence mayr be placed in him. I was much pleased with Meyer, the facteur } who came by order of his employers to offer me his services.

I stipulated for four horses, and that we should arrive at Odessa in eight days at farthest. Having paid my Brody deputy facteur his fee for attendance ; another facteur belonging to the hotel his fee, and various other incidental charges, I ordered all to be ready in half an hour, which space of time was devoted to the attainment, from the in telligent Mr. Jacobson, of as much informa tion as possible.

Tears filled the eyes and rolled down the cheeks of this apparently worthy man as he related his story to me. You may be sure that I did \" a ready ear incline, \" for that is the least we can do when a fellow-creature seems to find relief in pouring out his sorrows before us. I really felt for him, and offered every consoling re flection I could think of; \u2014 encouraging him by the observation that there was no degra dation in his present pursuit, inasmuch as upright principles would always ensure the respect and esteem of every well-regulated mind.

He wore a robe of light blue stuff (not very clean), tied round the waist with a worsted sash ; the brim of his low crowned hat was very broad ; and clusters of well oiled locks fell from underneath it : \u2014 his beard was of a respectable length. The four horses ran abreast, and the whitish looking outside animals, which were attached to two roughly made extra splinter bars, might be compared to the studding sails that are run out when a vessel is going with a steady breeze before the wind : \u2014 the steeds were decidedly Jewish ; for they had long beards, and were very dirty.

When nearly out of the straggling, dusty town of Radziewillow, the horses were sud denly reined in, and we stopped opposite a mean habitation, at the door of which stood a Jewess and two little children : thc latter were handed up to my poor fuhrmann, who embraced them with much tenderness, and then delivered them carefully into the arms of their mother.

We galloped"], [94, "88 A JOURNEY off again \u2014 I looked through the glass at, the back of the carriage, and perceived the poor woman and her children gazing after us, until a turn in the road took us out of sight. The weather was very fine, and we tra velled till midnight, when we stopped at a small dwelling at the entrance of a village called Katerimbourg. This I found was to be our resting place for the remainder of the night : \u2014 the spot was as silent as the grave. After knocking and calling for some time, a voice answered from within. A short col- loquy having passed between the fuhrmann and the inmate, the door was opened, and I was shewn into a most miserable room, totally destitute of furniture. On looking over my journal, I find the following memorandum : \" Katerimbourg \u2014 first litter, Jew, or Devil, fleas, etc., etc. \" I thought I had seen misery enough, but, alas ! it was my doom to witness a good deal"], [95, "TO ODESSA. 89 more. The being who inhabited this den, was a Jew of the most forbidding aspect; he was of middle stature, and clothed in a black cassock fitting close to his lean carcase \u2014 so lean that ( as a friend of mine was wont to say of a slim gentleman of our acquaintance) he would require stuffing to be a correct re presentative of the apothecary in \" Romeo and Juliet.\" His complexion was deadly pale, his eyes black as jet, and constantly in mo tion ; his hair and beard matted and ne glected. He spoke but seldom, and moved about with noiseless step,, occasionally lean ing against the wall and eyeing me from top to toe. I felt fatigued, and ordered my bed; the creature vanished, but soon re-appeared, carrying a quantity of hay, wliich he threw down in a corner of the room, shaking it up afterwards, as though a litter were preparing for a horse. I had the cushions of my car riage arranged for a pillow ; and having primed my pistols, and obtained a candle to"], [96, "A JOURNEY 90 burn until morning, I wrapped my cloak around me, and was left \" alone with my glory.\" Alone! did I say? This is a mis take, for I had company of the most piquant description : myriads of fleas hopped about my devoted frame, punctured my skin, sucked my blood, tickled my nose, and banished sleep from my eyes. I hailed the dawn joy fully, and, rushing into the open air, ran to a distance from the hovel, with my enemies on my back, shook them off with disdain, and then hastened out of their reach. No thing could tempt me to re-enter my bed room. After some difficulty, I obtained a little milk, for which slight refection, and my night's lodging, my impassible host charged me exorbitantly. We travelled thirty werstes ( equal to about seventeen English miles), and halted at a village called Jampol. As the Jewish inns are ahnosl all alike, I may as well de scribe that at Jampol. It consisted of a large"], [97, "TO ODESSA. 91 shed, or barn, having a gate at each end,so that you drive in at one entrance, and out at the other; this shed is appropriated to the reception of horses, carriages, cattle, and live-stock of all descriptions. At the mo ment we entered, it was occupied by a flock of sheep, and we had hard work to pass through them. On one side, close to the entrance, were two or three wretched rooms, covered with filth, and swarming with ver min. These inns bear some resemblance to the Ventas of Spain; but the inhabitants and sojourners are devoid of thc interest excited by the costumes and characteristic trails which are to be met with in romantic An dalusia. The tinkling mule-bell is not heard in the distance, nor does the sound of the guitar cheer or sooth the heart : the bold contrabandista with his montero-cap gaily put on, a cigarro in his mouth, and carbine by his side, does not ride up, and call for a"], [98, "A JOURNEY 92 glass of vino bianco ; no beauteous damsels peep from beneath their mantillas, and set your heart on fire by the flashes from their bright black eyes.

Prithee forgive me for having again drag ged in poor Spain ; some of the happiest years of my youth were passed there, and, with all its faults, I love it still. We must now, however, talk of Podolia. At this season, the eye ranges over inter minable fields of ripened corn. This rich monotony (if such an expression be admis sible) becomes wearisome; and in the midst of plenty, in the centre of the vast granary of Europe, one feels desolate. Why is this? Because there is no \" bold peasantry, a na tion's pride, \" no decent villages, no flourish ing towns, no gentlemen's seats, no comfort. It is impossible, when looking on these fer tile fields ( thc owner of which resides i*n"], [99, "TO ODESSA. 93 some princely chateau, revelling in every luxury ), to check the sigh of compassion for the wretched serfs, who, from generation to generation, continue in the same state of misery and degradation. The march of mind halts here; and the countermarch commences : invincible moral barriers arrest its progress. It leaves the strong-hold, which is defended by prejudice and selfishness, on the one hand, and con sequent ignorance and indifference on the other, and proceeds, like a skilful general, to make other conquests; suffering the anti quated fortification to crumble into ruins through the slow but sure action of the prin ciples of destruction contained within itself: from these ruins a firm and beautiful edi fice may hereafter be raised, but it will be a Herculean task to clear away the rubbish. The only apology I have to offer for hav ing resumed the above melancholy subject, which I am aware formed a portion of my"], [100, "A JOURNEY 94 letter from Brody, is, the painful impression that the misery I have witnessed has left on my mind. At sun-set we arrived at what is called the town of Alt-Konstantinow, and, to my great mortification, it was intimated to me that there I must remain for twenty-four hours. It was Friday evening \u2014 the Sabbath had commenced, and nothing could induce my fuhrmann to move on that sacred day. I was much annoyed, as you will readily suppose, and regretted exceedingly that I had not decided on travelling by the Russian post. Perhaps you may think it was not right to attempt to prevail on the man to break through the laws of his religion, for filthy lucre. I humbly confess that I made use of golden arguments, but, to his honour be it spoken, they did not weigh with him.

We ought to take an apparently well principled action as we find it, without searching too narrowly for the secret motive; I was, however, splenetic enough to ima gine that if the poor Jew had not been aware that he would have to run the gauntlet through every town, village, and hamlet in habited by his co-religionists, he might have yielded to my wishes.

Yield ing, then, with a good grace, I took pos session of a chamber on one side of the shed ; the apartment opposite ( for this was a large inn and had rooms on each side of the gate way) being occupied by a Polish family of rank, who had arrived a short time before me, with their carriages and servants. This detention at Alt-Konstantinow gave me an opportunity of seeing the habits of these great Polish people on their journeys. What think you of persons of distinction and immense fortune, who can make up their minds to pass nights and days in these wretched places called inns, rather than, by ameliorating the condition of others, ensure at the same time their own comforts?

In the course of the evening I went to the synagogue, which was held in a cottage larger than the rest. There \" the beards wag ged all, \" but I cannot add that \" 'twas merry in the hall.\" Some of the Hebrews mutter- ed, others shouted, whilst, here and there, groups were seen conversing together, and, occasionally casting a sinister look towards the solitary Christian who had ventured into the temple.

These Jews, though they abstain from work on their Sabbath, and from eating pork at all times, will make arrangements on the holy day for plundering you on the mor row, and are in the constant habit of rear ing pigs to sell to polluted Christians. On my return to my cabin, I observed that several bundles of hay were being carried into the rooms occupied by my opposite neighbours; seizing a favourable opportunity, I obtained some for myself, and, dropping down into my lonesome corner, slept as well as could be expected. Next morning it became necessary to keep a sharp look-out for a breakfast : I had brought from Brody some small loaves, which had been pretty well toasted in the swordcase of my car riage \u2014 indeed they were as hard as flints : the Jews would not boil an egg for me, 7-"], [106, "A JOURNEY 100 nor lend me a pipkin in which to cook one for myself : however, after divers strict re searches, and waiting a long time, three cups of coffee were brought me from a ca baret kept by a Christian.

The party which occupied the other side of the inn consisted chiefly of ladies, viz. the mother and three or four grown up daughters : the latter were dressed in the Parisian style, and it was curious enough to see them, on the Saturday morning, turning out (to use a sailor's expression, and I beg the ladies' pardon for so doing ) of their com fortless chambers, attired as fashionably as though they had just left an elegant dressing room.

It was not long before the Christian family set forth. \u2014 Having learnt that the object of the visit, of these gentry ( and of many others who had been constantly arriving from a very early hour in the morning) was to assist at the celebration of some festival of the Roman Catholic church, I found my way to a Capuchin convent which is situated at the entrance of Alt-Konstantinow. The chapel was thronged with people, all smartly dressed, excepting the poor peasants, and"], [108, "A JOURNEY 102 high-mass was being performed by a monk, assisted by several of the fraternity. A few minutes after quitting the chapel where all this pomp was displayed, and where the monks were pouring forth their orisons with stentorian lungs, I wandered, a second time, into the more humble Jewish temple, and found the children of Israel howling and muttering with an equal ap pearance of sincerity. This scene led me into a train of reflections on the bizarrene of our poor human nature. Different as are the professions of faith of these two parties ( said I to myself ), they both belong to the class of exclusives. Gen tile and heretic lhat I am ! what would be my wretched lot, here and hereafter, if the tender mercies of the Jew and of the Papist were to be showered down upon me?

Close to almost every village is a little lake; and seldom did my fuhrmann omit, to let his horses drink their fill from these translucent pools : \u2014 on my remarking that this practice might, perhaps, prove in jurious to them, he shook his head good humouredly and knowingly, and no doubt marvelled at my ignorance.

He looked very confused, and answered, \"Nothing \u2014 nu Ills mein Herr. \" I bade him get down, made him light the lamps of the caleche, and took care to examine the priming of my pistols, in order to shew those who might be observing me from the chiaroscuro of the back-ground, that I was upon my guard. \u2014 I then dismissed him, with an injunction not to intrude a second time on my slumbers in that way.

My remonstrance succeeded, that is, not until after refusing to alight at two or three vile huts; at last, however, we stopped at a house, the inmates of which ( Jews of course) appeared less dirty than those I had hitherto seen : the furhmann put-up his horses elsewhere, for this was not exactly an inn. My hostess, whose name was Berkover, was a good-looking woman of about five-and thirty. She has a daughter, ten years old, a pretty child. This infant is already be trothed to a boy of the same age, and the mother informed me that they are to be mar ried in three years.

The horses were not brought so soon as I could have wished, and I suspected the fuhrmann of an intention of again lodging me, for the night, in some miserable hovel. Tulczyn ( pronounced Tolcheen ) being the head-quarters of the Russian Army in the Ukraine, Bessarabia, etc., it was proba ble that tolerable accommodation might be had there; and, by dint of great perseve rance on my part, we arrived at night-fall ; to the evident chagrin of my worthy coach- man.

Drawing up, there fore, I uttered my \"Mosie Lebb\" in a softer tone, and found that I was actually in front of his hostelry. Soon he welcomed me, and I was ushered into a room, on the ground floor, containing plain but useful furniture."], [119, "113 TO ODESSA.

I was obliged to get my passport vise at Tulczyn, and to pay a fee, of course. There is a theatre at this place, but I was too fa tigued to wish to visit it.

I could not obtain the loan of a knife to cut this forbidden flesh; nor was such an article to be pur chased till we reached Tulczyn. Many a luckless dig did I make with my penknife, but it was labour lost ; nothing approaching to a slice could I get.

As to the Jewesses, they frequently have pearls and precious stones in their head dresses \u2014 some of these Hebrew ladies would be pretty if they were cleanly ; but the de ficiency in this particular destroys the good effect of their pleasing features. Reverting to the subject of their head-dresses, I believe that occasionally the unmarried women de corate their hair with ribbons and flowers ; whilst those who have entered the holy state of matrimony carefully conceal their tresses under a cap which comes over the ears and part of the face, terminating in a point at the chin : this cap is covered with quilted"], [124, "118 A JOURNEY linen or calico, and forms a triangular crown. The quilting is often adorned with pearls (true or false) ranged in parallel rows very close together.

The most barefaced plunder has, to my certain knowledge, been practised ; whilst the faulty system of jurisprudence, and the corruption of the judges, left the suf ferers without any remedy; and, at this mo ment, such is the deplorable decadence of Odessa, in every way, that there is little left but false appearances, and bad principles. Still there must be a good deal of local trade in a city containing a population of forty thousand souls ; and there will always be considerable shipments of corn, etc., for"], [161, "TO ODESSA. 155 the Mediterranean, and of other produce, for different parts of the world : \u2014 but there is nothing doing on a grand scale. The supplies for Podolia and the Ukraine are now fur nished in a great measure by the Brody Jews, who attend the fairs at Leipzig, and forward their goods by land-carriage. The Greeks are very intelligent and artful ; they have agents, of their own country, in all parts to which they trade : they form, as it were^ one large family, and manage to lay their neighbours under contribution. They ascertain when the landed proprietors are in want of money, and make excellent bargains, by advancing it at the critical moment. The Greeks are the chief importers of wines from the Archipelago, grapes, and dried fruits ; cotton and other stuffs from the Levant, perfumes, shawls, oil, coffee, spices, soap, Turkish tobacco, pipes, amber mouth-pieces for pipes, etc., etc , etc. Thc Armenians and Caraitc-Jews traffic also in"], [162, "156 A JOURNEY the above articles ; the best attar of roses and balm of Mecca are to be obtained from the latter. France furnishes wines, brandy, oil, cloth, silks, all sorts of manufactured goods, cambrics, and Nouveautes, provisions, porcelain, engravings, books, etc., etc. Italy supplies wines, liqueurs, oil, vermicelli, sulphur, articles of taste, such as sculpture, etc. Spain sends wines of different sorts, lead, cochineal, indigo, drugs, coarse cloths, and mats : Port and Madeira wines are brought from Portugal \u2014 and, though last, not least, England sends her innumerable manufactures, and the produce of her co lonies, as well as of the places to which she trades. The exports of corn are chiefly for the Ar chipelago, the Ionian Islands, Trieste, Ve nice, Malta, the different ports of Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France. The bulk of this corn is grown in the Ukraine, Podolia, and Wrol hynia. Thc other principal exports arc wool,"], [163, "TO ODESSA. 157 furs, Astrakan lambs'-skins, wax, barilla, Russia-leather ( called jouftis) hides, tallow, butter (for Constantinople), honey, linseed, cordage, and many other articles. There is a good deal of coasting-trade to Taganrog, and to all the Crimea. The harbour of Odessa is sometimes blocked-up by ice in December and January ; therefore the navigation is not to be depended on in those months, though it is frequently open for the whole winter. In summer, north-winds are prevalent ; the passage from Constantinople, therefore, is variable in point of time : with a fair wind, vessels frequently arrive in two days and a half, sometimes in four \u2014 but, as a general rule, ten days should be calculated on. A hundred and fifty vessels have been known to arrive in the course of one day, having made the passage from Con stantinople in forty eight hours. The cargoes of vessels that have passed by the Turkish capital are landed at thc quaran-"], [164, "A JOURNEY 158 tine establishment, where they are subjected to the needful examination and purification. Convicts are employed in the perilous duty of performing this process with regard to the most suspected merchandise : if any fall sacrifices to this exposure, tant pis pour eux, is, I suppose, the idea of the authorities ; the galley slaves being only looked upon as living tongs with which to catch hold of in fected articles ! The vessels are re-laden without taking pratique : the lighters, or barges, used for conveying the cargoes to and from these vessels are not allowed to have any sails, lest the canvass should imbibe and impart contagion : on their return from deli vering their lading, these barges are carefully washed and inspected by proper officers. The ships are thus speedily dispatched with their return freights ; but this arrangement renders Odessa a dull and dead sea-port : \u2014 there are no sailing-boats, no bustling quays, none of the life of a great maritime city, and,"], [165, "TO ODESSA. . 159 in a place which gives employment to so much shipping, you see no sailors about the streets ! To me, with my innate affection for the blue jacket and trousers, it seems quite out of character to have the sea open to the view and no honest tars \" capering on the shore. \" The merchants are divided into three classes, as is the case in the whole Russian empire. To be inscribed in the first class, it is necessary to have a capital of at least 5o,ooo roubles. The Odessa merchants were exempted for twenty years, dating from 1796, from the tax, to the crown, of 1 per cent, on their declared capital : they are not liable to have troops quartered on them, even in time of war. This country is called New-Russia, of which Odessa may be said to be the capital ; and I believe I am correct in saying that the mass of the peasantry forms a part of the numerous population styled Little Russians, being ofthe"], [166, "A JOURNEY 160 same race as the inhabitants of Podolia, Wolhynia, Pultawa, part of Gallitzia , etc. ; they differ in many respects from the Moscovi tes or Grand Russians \u2014 they speak an idiom of the Sclavonic, or a mixture of the Russian and Polish languages. The streets of Odessa are very wide, and generally of a great length ; they have rather a desolate appearance, as the houses are for the most part low. The dust is most annoying in dry weather, and the mud equally so after rain ; they are, however, Macadamising some ofthe principal streets, and making a broad foot-path on each side, formed of large slabs of a porous stone, fitted together in irregular shapes, without cement : this will be a great improve ment if the plan be followed up generally, which no doubt it will be, under the aus pices of the governor, Count Woronzow, who gives the greatest encouragement to every useful undertaking. He is building a"], [167, "TO ODESSA. 161 superb mansion at one extremity of the public promenade, which is situated on a cliff overlooking the harbour : this promenade is very gay on a fine evening. At the end opposite the Governor's house is the theatre, rather a handsome building. There is an Italian company here at present ; they attempt some of the Operas of Rossini, and other celebrated composers. I cannot say much for their musical powers, still I am very glad, occasionally, to drive away ennui by sitting the performance out to the last. Now and then there is a Polish play; the language is pleasing to the ear, but I am obliged to guess at the subject of the pieces. A most extraordinary Russian or Polish dance was performed the other night : the exhi bitor was a very tall man \u2014 he seemed all trousers, and jumped and strutted about the stage in a most violent and unaccountable manner \u2014 his head was covered with a pro fusion of hair ; and, as I sat on the first row in T I"], [168, "162 A JOURNEY the pit, and he balanced himself on one leg, and leant forwards over the stage-lamps, rolling his eyes and his head about most fiercely, I felt tempted to cry out \" shake not \" thy gory locks at me ! \" Latterly we have had some French vaude villes ; the life and soul of these amusing performances is Madame Van den Berg, pre miere cantatrice of the Imperial Theatre of St. Petersburgh ; she is really a good actress, and sings well, both in Italian and French : she is said to be rich, and to play more from inclination than for the sake of emolument. The French company is small, but they ma nage to get up their little pieces very well. The public carriages of Odessa are called droshkis \u2014 they are built low, andare usually made to convey one person only, though I have seen two, and even three, passengers stowed in them . The general way for a gentle man to sit is as though he were on horseback. The morning after my arrival, I had occasion"], [169, "TO ODESSA. 163 to mount one ofthese (to me) novel vehicles ; and, to tell you the truth, I did not know exactly where to arrange my legs ; for I had no notion of riding on cushion -back : however, I watched others \u2014 bestrode my rocking-horse (for the springs are so elastic that the carriages yield to the slightest im pulse) and was soon regularly installed a la Busse. The public droshkis are, for thc most part, drawn by two horses ; one of the animals has his head tied up to a kind of hoop, which rises from the ends ofthe shafts to about a foot above his ears, which makes him look grand : \u2014 the other is so harnessed as to have his head drawn down almost to the ground, and on one side ; this, and the management of the reins, causes him to curvet. It is painful to see the poor crea tures thus fettered, for mere shew. The driver sits on a very small dickey-box ; his dress is picturesque, consisting ofa very low hat, widening at thc top, ornamented with a 1 1.."], [170, "164 A JOURNEY broad silken band and bright buckle ; he wears a kind of frock coat, fitting close to the waist, round which it is strapped \u2014 this coat has not any collar; and, as the men have their hair cut extremely short all round, the lower part of the back of the head is bare, as is also the neck. Many of these drivers have long beards. I have heard them singing wild, but not unpleasing airs \u2014 they appear to me lo have a natural good taste for music. The public garden is not much frequented ; the plantations do not thrive. The fine dust with which, in dry weather, Odessa is almost continually infested, not being impregnated with ferruginous particles to any considerable degree, is not pernicious to health : the thousands of light waggons, which are constantly arriving and returning laden with corn and merchandise, are con structed without any iron whatever, and are chiefly drawn by oxen.

There are two large tanks at the entrance of Odessa, for the supply of water ; this (as also the sinking of a number of wells) was one ofthe earliest works of the Duke De Richelieu ; for a watering-place was indispensable in a city in the immediate vi cinity of which there is no river, and where there is a constant succession of draught cattle.

The Roman Catholic chapel is a neat, though not an extensive building ; there is likewise a Lutheran chapel; and the Jews have their synagogue, which is large. House-rent is high \u2014 provisions very cheap : there are a number of good shops, full of all sorts of useful and ornamental wares, but there is not any exterior display.

There are, however, numbers of a distinct and superior race, who do not mix with the others ; they are called Cara'ites, or Caraims, and are fine, tall, handsome men ; their costume is quite different to that ofthe other Jews : their heads are shaven ; they wear high caps, made of black Astrakhan lambs' skin, full trousers, and short jackets \u2014 their appearance is quite Asiatic.

It is very difficult to get a good servant here. The society of Odessa is as varied as are the heterogeneous elements of which it is composed : there are but very few English residents ; the Russians, Greeks, French and Italians have their respective coteries, and seem, generally, to limit their visitings lo their compatriots.

The Consulate may, at this moment, be said to be an honorary post ; for the emoluments usually attached to this responsible office are in abeyance ; but I can assure you that whenever British interests are concerned our worthy Consul-General invariably acts with spirit and discernment. I have been most kindly received and en tertained by several of the most respectable inhabitants of Odessa, to whom I have been so fortunate as lo be introduced : the English society is sometimes varied by the passage of travellers, over-land, lo and from India.

I am told lhat discipline is carried to a most disgusting extreme; for instance, that a Colonel is not allowed to sit down in the presence ofa Ge neral, until the latter graciously desires him to do so ; and that this ridiculous etiquette is also practised in the subordinate grades \u2014 the poor full private is oftentimes knocked down without ceremony.

The officers of the subaltern ranks are said to be usually men of little or no education, consequently their leisure time must be passed in the most unprofitable way. The Russian soldier's pay is about ten paper roubles, or nine shillings sterling, a year ! nine pence a month ! And the fraction, per week, that his food costs Government (according to the account given to me by a person who is well informed, and a man of veracity) is so small that I will not mention it.
