The author had often been struck with the extreme beauty of the windows of East Sutton Church as he passed along the road which runs by, and when opportunity offered looked into the Church, only however to be pained at the sight of so much neglect and decay. When one day he was attracted by the sound of workmen within, and then found that under the appreciative zeal of one of the Churchwardens, Mr. W. R. Ward, and a few like-minded Parishioners, a great work of reparation was being carried on. The removal of layers of mortar, the disclosure of long. concealed windows, and the bringing to light of other architectural gems, show*ed to him what a tale of history and art those walls and windows could reveal, and led him with an increasing and all-absorbing interest to endeavour to work out its history ; and of that endeavour this little volume is the result. He was induced to undertake it at the request of Mr. Ward, supported as it was by a very liberal offer of help from Mr. J. Church, a sympathising neighbour. Then came the loan of the electro blocks from the Hon. Company of Cloth-workers, which had served as illustra tions for a work by Mr. Angell a few years ago. This was followed by the ready contribution of photographs by his valued friend the Rev. Gardner-Waterman, all of"], [14, "INTRODUCTION. IV which demand grateful acknowledgment. Thus has the little volume grown into its present proportions. It will no doubt be noticed that no particular mention is made of the Grammar School beyond its foundation. Valuable as it is, it has of course no Arch\u00e6ological history. The present century has seen the imposing and picturesque buildings which now cover the southern slopes of Sutton hill, and he felt that there was nothing to bring the building within the scope of his original Arch\u00e6ological design. In time, no doubt, this admirable School will find its own historian. Fully aware as he is of many imperfections and defi ciencies, (especially as a considerable portion was dictated from a sick bed), he hopes that he may have been able to collect together such an amount of information as may prove interesting to Parishioners, Arch\u00e6ological neighbours, and Sutton Valence Schoolboys, past and present, and may produce some, however small, addition to the Fund which has been and is being raised for the purpose of carrying to completion the good work of Restoration so conscientiously begun.

THE MANORS. SELDOM do we find an English Parish however small, which in the history of its Manor, or in the details of its Church, does not amply repay a little research by revealing some interesting associations with the \"long, long ago : \" but it is very seldom our lot to meet with one so small, and so secluded, and therefore so little known, which is so full of the nation's history as the smaller of the two which form the subjects of our present paper, Sutton Valence and East Sutton. Originally two distinct Manors, each with its own Church, they were for some centuries so closely connected, that it becomes necessary to treat of them as one. As such we find them under the same Lords and the same Clergy. These Manors were, not once or twice, deemed worthy to be chronicled as forming part of the possessions, and in some cases the dowers, and probably also the occasional homes, of English Princesses \u2014 Saxon, Norman, and Plantagenet. In Domesday Book1 both Manors, though distinctly 1 According to the Domesday Record the two Manors, or Parishes, differed considerably in size and value. That of Sutton Aralence was rated at four (not two, as Hasted says) sullings, while East Sutton was rated at only one and a half. In other respects, they were nearly alike. Each had right of panace for fifty hogs : and each its Church. East Sutton had ten servi, but Sutton Valence none. Both were held at the same rental, \u00a310, then raised to \u00a318. Sutton Valence had a mill (molinum), for which it is still dis tinguished. 13"], [16, "2 Sutton Valence and East Sutton. described, are mentioned under the same name of Sudtone ; and both held by the same tenant, under the same Lord Paramount : in the days of the Confessor, by Leofwine, a younger brother of Harold, who appears under the varied name of Comes (Earl) Leuuin and Leuenot, but at the Conquest the Saxon element had disappeared, and Adam Fitz (filius) Hubert held both Manors under Bishop Odo, the Conqueror's half brother. In the next official survey of the land, known as \"Testa de Nevill,\" which was made in the end of the reign of Henry III. and the beginning of that of Edward I., say between 1270 and 1 280, the joint Manors formed a part of the Barony or Fee of Simon de Montford, Earl of Leicester.1 The question then arises, \" How can we fill in this interval of nearly 200 years between the two Records ? \" This can only be done by gleaning a few chance grains of informa tion from Charters preserved in the Record Office, among the Patent Rolls, Close Rolls, &c. Now a Charter of the first year of King John2 tells us that at that time, i.e., 1199, the two Sutton Manors were held in conjunction with several other Kentish Manors by Baldwin de Betun, Count of Albermarle, whose name appears in the Red Book of the Exchequer, (Liber Ruber de Scaccario,) in 1166, as \"Comes de Alba Maria.\" This transfer may be thus easily accounted for. Baldwin's grandfather, Stephen de Betun, had married Adeliza, a half-sister of William the Conqueror, and already possessed the Norman title of \" Count of Albermarle.\" His son, William le Gros, as he was called, (and is commonly known in the Patent Rolls as Gullelmus Grassus,) left an only 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 214. 2 Kalend.

In each case she carried with her the title of Albermarle, and the estates. Then, when Odo, the Bishop of Baieux, was expelled the country, and all his \u2022lands forfeited to the Crown, it was very natural that King John should confer some of his estates, and among them the Manors of Sutton, on his near kinsman Baldwin de Betun. He again, in 1203, assigned them with the king's sanction to his daughter Alicia (or Amieia), as her dower, on her marriage with William le Mareschall,1 who was afterwards created Earl of Pembroke, and with that title these Manors thenceforth remained for nearly 200 years. It was this William le Mareschall whom Hume declares to have been \" the man of greatest vigour and capacity in the English Court.\" He died in 1219, and though not himself a Templar, was honoured by a burial place and an effigy in the Temple Church. His son, also William, (commonly known as Comes Mareschall, Jun.) occupies an even more conspicuous place in the annals of England, He it was who, under the title of Earl of Pembroke, 1 \"Baldwinus de Betun, Comes de Albamarla concessit in maritagio Willelmo filio Willelmi Marescall Comitis de Pembrochie and Alicie filie Baldwini de Betun, Comitis de Albarmarle,\" P.R., 5 John, Pt. I., m. 19. The origin of this family may be thus traced. The office of Earl Marshall (Martit Seneschallus) created by Stephen (1135), was first conferred on Gilbert de Clare, younger brother of Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford ; this Gilbert was four years after created Earl of Pembroke. His son Richard, better known as \" Strongbow,\" left an only daughter, whose husband William succeeding to his father-in-law's office, adopted that as his surname, and was thenceforth known as William Marshall, and in him the Earldom of Pem broke was revived in 1201."], [18, "Sutton Valence and East Sutton. 4 Willelmus Maresca.llus, Comes Pembrohie, though his father was still living, appears at the head of the roll of the noble persons, \" nobilium virorum,\" who extorted from King John the far-famed Magna Charta at Runnymede in 1213. His effigy holds a still more honourable place than that of his father, in Westminster Abbey. He had married Eleanor, the king's daughter : but leaving no heir, the Manors again fell to the Crown, and were conferred on Fulke de Beaute,1 a low-born but clever un scrupulous Court minion, one of King John's evil counsellors, whom he had compelled Hawy se, widow of Baldwin de Betun, to marry as her fourth husband, in spite of remonstrances and entreaties. All that seems to be known of this Fulke de Beaute's connection with Sutton is that in 1281 he obtained from Henry III. the grant of a Market or Fair for Town Sutton, to be held on the vigil, the day, and the morrow, of the Feast of St. Edmund.2 This became in time one of the most important cattle fairs of the County : but it gradually dwindled into insignificance, and only a few years ago, within the memory of middle-aged men, died of inanition. In due time this man was detected and convicted of gross rapacity and extortion, and shared the well-merited fate of so many Courtiers, being banished the kingdom \u2022 while the Sutton Manors and his other estates were confiscated, and again fell to the Crown. 1 Dugdale, in his \" Baronia,\" calls him \" Bearcte,\" and many subsequent writers have followed his mis-spelling of the name, which is clearly \"Beai.te.\" \" Rex concedit . . .

To secure the powerful aid of that influential but ambitious noble, Henry III. forced his own sister Eleanora to marry him, against her own will, and in violation of the vow of perpetual widowhood, which she had taken on the death of her first husband William le Mareschall, the second Earl of Pembroke.1 Thus we are brought to that entry in \" Testa de Nevill,\" already referred to (p. 2), with its explanation, which runs thus : \" Galfridus Martel (tenet) dimidium feodi in Sutton de Simon de Monte Forti, et ipse de W. Marescallo.'' The once con spicuous, but now ruined, Sutton Castle, by tradition associated with the name of Simon de Montford, demands more than passing notice. Probably in no other of his many Manors could this ambitious and high-handed Earl have placed himself in a more commanding position, or fortified himself more securely than here. It may have reminded him of the \" Strong Castle \" on the height between Chartres and Paris, from which his grandfather took his name of Monti-forti. At the extreme end of an abrupt spur, projecting beyond the line of the Chart range of hills, here no doubt had once stood an early Roman or even British watch-tower. The discovery of foundations of a building and a large number of Roman urns, etc., in the year 18-41, led Roach Smith to think that it must have 1 Knighton. Decem. Scriplores, p. 2347.

A quantity of glass vessels and pater\u00e6, and specimens of Samian ware, fibul\u00e6 of bronze, ivory ornaments, etc.,1 which are now preserved in the Maidstone Museum, were dug up here. From this point the eye could command the Weald spread out below, from the lordly castle of the Clares at Tonbridge on the West, to the strong, if less formidable, fortress which in former days had crowned the hill at Lymne on the East ; while before him rose on the summit of the South-Down range the Beacon Light which used to blaze out on the top of the still standing Fairlight Tower, and the then grand, but now ruined, walls of Hastings Castle itself. Here, in days when every Baron was forti fying himself against his neighbour Baron, or his Liege Lord, when every man's hand was against his fellow, such a position enabled him not only to confront the invading foe, but also to defy his Kiug, or any rival Baron.4 But Simon de Montford, though himself a foreigner, protested against the excessive introduction of foreigners 1 Arch\u00e6ologia' Vol. xxix., pp. 421-3. 2 Kilnrne, Survey of Kent, p..259, says of this \"Ancient Castle\" that it was built, as is conceived, when the sea came up the valley, under the same which, that it so did, appeareth by an Anchor there found, not far from the Castle, in the memory of men lately living. Philipott, Villare Canlianum, p. 333, tells us that in his time (1676) this Castle, \"in its relicks and fragments with much of venerable magnificence, overlooked the plain. \" He also questions the claim of Simon de Montford to be the builder : for he says that \"William de Valence certainly instituted the Castle;\" and Hasted (Vol. ii., p. 414) suggests that it was built \"probably by one of the family of Valence, Earls of Pembroke.\" Yet the rudeness of the structure com posed as it is of rag stones and flints, seems to connect it rather with the earlier part of the 13th, than of the 14th century : in which case it would presumably belong to the time of Simon de Montford rather than that of the Valentia Earls."], [23, "The Manors. 7 about the Court \u2022 threw himself ere long into the cause of the recalcitrant Barons \u25a0 indeed became their leader \u2022 and eventually fell at the Battle of Evesham, fighting against the King \u2022 when all his estates, Sutton among them, were confiscated, and fell to the Crown, and his widow, sister though she was of the King, was banished the country. Henry III. had not far to go to find a recipient for these Manors \u2022 and conferred them on his own half-brother, William de Valentia, the son of Isabel of Anjouleme, the widow of King John, who, on his death, had married Hugh le Brun, (of Valentia in Spain), from whence William adopted the title of \" de Valentia,\" or Valence. From him the place hitherto known as Town Sutton, received the name of Sutton Valence. This William married Joan, the sister of William de Munchesi, and in him was revived the title of Earl of Pembroke, which had lapsed a short time before by the death of Anselm le Marshall without any family. He was succeeded in the Earldom and this Manor by his son Aymer, or as he is called in Parliamentary writs Adomarus de Valentia, with whose death in 1323 the Valentia line in the Pembroke Earldom ceased.1 Aymer married three times : his third wife, Maria de Sancto Paulo, a lady of noble descent in France, demands especial mention, as being probably instrumental in 1 These successive transfers are thus recorded in llotuli Hundredorum, p. 223. \" Dicunt quod Manerium de Sutton suit dominicum domini R(egis) H(enrici), patris regis nunc (Edwardi I.), qui dedit illud Manerium domino Willelmo Comiti Merescall, in maritagium cum domina Elianora sorore sua : et mortuo dicto Marescallo, dominus Simon de Montiforte duxit dominant predictam in uxorem, et habuit cum ea illud Manerium.

This is at best conjectural ; not so the fact that the University of Cambridge owes to her one of her Colleges, where she has left a memorial which has already lasted for five centuries. She devoted a widowhood of nearly sixty years to good works, and among them the foundation of a College, which was originally called after her own name, that of \" Maria de Valencia,\" and after wards after her husband's title, Pembroke Hall, and now College.1 In the seventeenth century work of Sir Christo pher Wren \u2022 scarcely a vestage remains of the original building of this pious foundress. As Aymer de Valencia had died without children, the title and estates passed to his sister Isabel, who had married John Baron Hastings, and then to his son Lawrence Hastings, who obtained the confirmation of the Earldom of Pembroke from Edward III. in 1339.2 On his death in 1348 they fell to his son John Hastings, who had 1 Dyer's History of Cambridge, vol. ii. p. 94.

Thus again the Manor became connected with Royalty. But it was a short-lived connection : for she was divorced from her husband very soon after marriage, and in 1368 he married, as his second wife, Agnes, the daughter of Sir Walter (afterwards Lord) Manney, who lives in history as the original founder of Charterhouse. They had a son, also Sir John, whom his father did not live to see, as he was made a prisoner by the Spaniards on his attempt to relieve Rochelle, and though released a few years after, retired to France, where he died, as is suspected, of poison. His son, also a John, was born the very year of his father's capture, and barely lived to attain manhood, and married the King's daughter Philippa; but all promise of a brilliant and distinguished career was blighted, for he had barely attained to manhood when he was killed in a tournament at Windsor. Indeed, a fatality seemed to be hanging over the Hastings family, for, as has been noticed, \" No son ever saw his father, and no father lived to see his son \" for several generations. He died leaving no heir, and with him ceased the direct line of the Hastings family in the Earldom of Pembroke \u2022 which remained in abeyance for many years. We now arrive at a period in the history of these Manors, when, hitherto united, they became separated. The change arose thus : when this last John Lord Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, died, the next heir appeared in the person of Reginald Lord Grey, a great grandson (through his daughter Elizabeth) of the first John Lord Hastings, who, as already mentioned, had married Isabel, one of the sisters of Aymer de Valencia. The lands he owned in"], [26, "10 Sutton Valence and East Sutton. Wales, at Ruthen, from whence he took his title of Lord Grey de Ruthen, bordered on those of Owen Glendower, with whom he was constantly at war. Falling in one of these encounters into Glendower's hands, he was called on to pay a heavy ransom of 10.000 marcs. To raise this sum a licence was granted by Henry to sell the Manors of Lord Grey, and among them those of Sutton. From that day the Manors have been divided, and have passed in different lines, and lost their original character. Hitherto they had been almost regarded as a Royal appanage ; a lordship at the disposal of the Crown, held, as we have seen, by distinguished members of the nobles of England. Henceforth they were to be a \" marketable commodity \" passed by sale from one owner to another, though generally held by important Kentish families. That of Sutton Valence fell first to the St. Ledgers, of Otterden, from whom it passed to the Cliffords, of Bobbing Court, near Faversham \u2022 the last of these, Nicholas Clifford, left it as a dower to his only child, Mildred, who married, as the first of four husbands, Sir Edward Harper, who sold it to Sir Edward Hales, of Tunstall, from him it passed to the De-Bouveries, and from them to the Filmers. The Manor of East Sutton would appear from Philipott's account to have gone to Leeds Priory, and on its suppres sion by Henry VIII. to have fallen into the hands of John Tufton, Esq., of Hothfield, who sold it to Richard Argall, Esq., Otteringden, whose daughter Elizabeth married Edmund Filmer, Esq., of Herst. He purchased the Manor from her brother : and in his family it has ever since remained."], [27, "11 THE RECTORS AND VICARS. FROM the Lords of the Manor we pass naturally to their Clerical nominees, to whom they assigned the revenues and the duties of the Church. Here we meet with the two bodies, the Rectors (person\u0153, or Parsons proper), and their Vicars, those who performed the Church duties vicariously. With the Rectors as a rule lay the selection of their Vicars : and it is from the records of these appointments, as preserved in the Archiepiscopal Registers at Lambeth Palace, that we are able to trace the succession of the two classes, which are so closely interwoven together. For instance, the first mention of a Hector occurs in the pre sentation of the first recorded Vicar, where Bartholomew (whose sirname is not given), in the year 1288 appoints as his Vicar Ricardus de Lemnia.1 The next Rector is \u2022Ricardus de Andevere, who in 1310 presents Gilbertus de Swafpham3 to the Vicarage ; on resigning the Rectory in 1319 he is succeeded by Radulphus de Sutton, being appointed by Adamarus (Aymer) de Valence, Comes, who had then become Lord of the Manor. Radulphus in 1324 presents to the Vicarage Johannes de Stok (or Stocke) \u25a0 and appears to have died within two years, for in 1326, Aymer de Valence being dead, aud the patronage passing for the time to the Crown, Edward Ll. appoints Ricardus de Wynneferthynqi.3 His, however, must have been a 1 Abp.

Hannyngfeld was clearly a man in high favour and confidence with Edward, for three years after he obtains \" a licence to go beyond the seas on the King's service, with Maria the widow of Aymer de Valence,\" a licence which was renewed for a further period two years after.2 Rome was no doubt his place of sojourn, and he took advantage of it to further his preferment, though apparently without success \u25a0 for the Papal Registers, recently published (by C. Bliss), mention an application made by him in 1332 to the Pope for a Canonry at Ripon, where a Minster and Chapter of Secular Canons had existed for some years, and again in 1349 for a similar appointment at St. David's.3 We find him in the latter year, still holding the Rectory, and presenting to the Vicarage of Sutton Valence Robertus Lovel.4 The succession of the Rectors now becomes somewhat rapid and confused. For while the Lambeth Register records the presentation of Baldwinps du; Merewod,6 by Agnes, Countess of Pembroke, wife of Laurencius de Valencia, to the Rectory, in a Patent Roll6 occurs the name of Johannes de Sancto Paulo, as Rector ; as if appointed to act during the absence of Hannyngfeld.

He is spoken of as having been appointed to the Rectory by John de Hastynges, Earl of Pembroke, (the son of Laurencius de Hastynges) but his presentation does not appear in the Lambeth Registers.

Robertus Lydiard resigned the Rectory in 1377, and as John Hastings, the Earl of Pembroke, had recently died and his son was a minor, Richard II. , as custodian of the Pembroke estates, appointed in his place Walter de Rammesbury,2 who seems to have had but a brief tenure of it, for he is soon succeeded by Robertus Clerk, who died in 1380. In his case the Advowson seems to have reverted to the true patron, for in his Will he indicates that he owed his appointment to the Hastings family, as he leaves a legacy to the \" Fratres Minores\" of Dorchester Abbey, for Masses for the soul of Agnes, Countess of Pembroke.3 This brings us to a very serious controversy which then arose as to the Manor, and also the Advowson, (which here chiefly concerns us). On the death of the second John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, without an heir, the King again claimed to be the custos or guardian of the property, with the right of appointing to the Rectory. The Manor however found a claimant, as we have seen, in the person of Reginald Gray, the son of Matilda, sister of the former Sir John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke. He how ever, to settle the question, conveyed the rights of Manor and Advowson to a body of Assessors, comprising the Bishops of London and Hereford, with a number of prominent Laymen, who assigned the Advowson as a dower to Philippa the widow of the last Sir John Hastings, with reversion to the Prior and Convent of Leeds.

Halle died in 1419, and was succeeded by Robertus Smale,5 in 1419. In each of these cases William Whyte's name appears as the Rector making the presentation. On his death the Rectorial rights were passed to the Priory of Leeds (as already mentioned), and all the subsequent appointments were made by that body, until in 1538 that Priory was suppressed, and its revenues and rights were transferred to the Chapter of Rochester, from whom Henry VIII. had appropriated all the endowments. The Leeds Priory was not however to be left in indis turbed and undisputed possession of the Advowson of Sutton, for in 1420, when William White was dead, a counter claim to it was made by Mr. William Clifford, evidently an influential resident of the place, for he describes himself in his formal claim as \" de Sutton 1 Abp.

The case was submitted to Archbishop Chichele, who instituted a Court of Enquiry, comprising the Arch presbyter of Ulcombe Collegiate Church, the Rectors of Harrietsham and Staplehurst, the Vicars of Marden, Thornham and Boxley, and five Laymen from the adjacent parishes, (circumvicini) . After a prolonged investigation they ignored the claim of the said William Clifford, and affirmed that of the Priory of Leeds,2 basing it on the Letters Patent of Richard II. , confirming the bequest of Philippa, the widow of Richard Earl of Arundel, which had been sanctioned by Papal Bulls.3 The first appointment to the Vicarage made by Leeds Priory seems to have been that of Johannes Petewyn, (or Petwyn, (who was Vicar of Werle, in the Diocese of Winchester, and came to Sutton by exchange with Robert Small.4 After him, Laurence Golding, of whose appoint ment there seems no notice in the Lambeth Registers.

The next name found in the Lambeth Registers is that of Nicholas Hillyngton : but no mention of his appoint ment, only the record of his death in 1519. His successor, Nicholas Won on,1 (if he be, as is most probable, identical with the contemporary Church dignitary of that name), had a career, both ecclesiastical and political, distinguished far beyond any of those who had been, or were to be, Vicars of Sutton; the first Dean of Canterbury, in 1542, he was also made Dean of York two years after ; a single instance of both Deaneries held simultaneously by the same man. His eventful career is thus summed up by old Isaac Walton, in his Life of Sir H. Wotton ; \" Nine times Ambassador to foreign Princes, and Privy Councillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth.\" On his resignation of the Vicarage of Sutton in 1530, he was succeeded by John Armorer,2 who, in 1554, was presented by the Queen to the Vicarage of Penshurst. He was evidently a man of considerable learning, for in the Library of the Inner Temple3 is a copy of Speculum Historicale, by Vincent de Beauvois, with Armorer's name on the fly-leaf, \" Vicarius de Sutton Valence, et modo de Pensehursf,\" with many marginal corrections, apparently in his hand-writing. He was probably followed by Christopher Maddington ; on whose death in 1566 the Rochester Chapter presented4 David Smythe ; and now for the first time mention is made of East Sutton Church, as forming a part of the Bene fice, (cum Capella de East Sutton annexa). Next to Smythe, in the year 1580, Thomas Partridge was Vicar, who 1 Abp. Warham, f. 366. J Abp. Warham, f. 402. 3 Hist. MSS., Com. XI. Report, App. 511. 4 Abp. Parker, f. 378, b.

When Compton died in 1606, Thomas Sandford3 succeeded, and on his resignation in 1614 Edmund Henshaw4 became Vicar. He was also Rector of Crundall and Vicar of Brenchley ; and thus the pastoral care of Sutton became deplorably neglected. So great indeed became the grievance that the Parishioners made a complaint to Parliament in 1641, through their County Members, Sir Edward Dering and Sir John Colepeper; representing that \"the Church Services were soe negligently and uncertainly supplied that they were for the most part forced to repayre to neighbour Churches ; \" that for instance, on Christmas-Day last they had \" neither devine service nor preaching,\" and on a Fast appointed by the King, \" only some fewe prayers by a neighbour minister.\"5 He was evidently soon removed, probably in 1 645, for in that year the name of Hezekiah Holland appears as Vicar of Sutton Valence. Henshaw's was probably no isolated instance of laxness and neglect. Without admitting the partizan state ments of men like White, in his Century of Scandalous Ministers, and Sylvester, in his Life of Richard Baxter, where it is represented that such men formed the rule rather than the exception among the clergy, it must be granted that the prevalence of such negligence gave the Parliament the so much desired opportunity of ejecting a large number of the Clergy from their Cures, and thrusting 1 Abp.

With the Restoration Thomas Pollington was appointed; and on his resignation in 1665, James Browne1 succeeded, who appears to have held it till 1678, or thereabouts, for in the following year the Advowson fell by lapse of time to Archbishop Sancroft, who collated John Romney2 to the Vicarage. In the \"Acts and Institutions\" of Lambeth Palace, it is stated that John Romney was Chaplain to Rachel, Countess Dowager of Westmoreland. It is quite refreshing to turn from what would seem to have been little more than a list of Vicars, whose individual history, if they had any, is lost in oblivion , most of whom have come to be but an empty name (nomen inane), to that of 1 Abp.

A gravestone at the entrance of the Church tells us that John Gohier, who was the next Vicar, was a Huguenot Exile. Now the year 1685 saw the cancelling of what may be called the \"Charter of Huguenot Toleration,\" the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, granted by Henry IV., which for well nigh a century had secured to French Protestants undis- turbed enjoyment of their own form of worship. So appalling a political convulsion could not have come upon them without some warning. The refusal of Louis XIV. to receive the deputation of Protestant Ministers in 1683, prepared them for the coming storm, and the impending attack upon their liberties. John Gohier's Epitaph tells us that he escaped from Lower Normandy in 1684, and found sanctuary in hospitable England. Here under William III. he was protected, and duly naturalised in The Inscription runs thus : \u2014 JOHANNES GOHIER de S'to Lo, Inferioris Normanni\u00e6 Civitate Incunabilis suis, Religionis ergo A.D. 1684 pulsus in exilium Cum bono Deo ad Nos profugit ; Quam omnigen\u00e6 Literatur\u00e6, pr\u00e6sertim Theologi\u00e6, studio affixus h\u0153sisset, In Episcopale Sacerdotium Apud Gallos, multun diuque desideratum, Adscitus viginti tres annos Presbyter egit.

He was born at St. Lo, and in 1681 entered the University of Leyden : he ihen had received Orders as a \" Presbyter \" in the French Reformed Church, and as such would have been received by Abp. Tillotson,2 on the presentation of the Rochester Chapter, and instituted into the Sutton Valence Vicarage; and in 1710 was appointed to a Prebendal Stall in St. Paul's Cathedral.3 Here another point of some interest arises. The Dean of Rochester was then Henry Ullack. This is an un- English name, but somewhat similar in sound to that of John Ulacq, L.L.D., of Orange University (South of France), who had been a few years before (1670), incorpo rated at Oxford : and his father was Cornelius Ulacq, Secretary to the Prince of Orange. He, too, was probably of Huguenot descent; and herein may have lain the Dean's interest in John Gohier, on the strength of which he had been presented to this Benefice. We now come upon a startling succession of instances of nepotism, which perhaps can hardly be exceeded even at that period, when the system was so prevalent throughout England. Dean Ullack had been succeeded at Rochester, in 1706, by Dr. Samuel Prat, a clever and witty Court favourite; and on the death of John Gohier in 1713, the Dean seized the opportunity to appoint his son Samuel Prat,* already a Minor Canon, to the vacant Vicarage ; when however, six years after, the more valuable Living of Boughton Monchelsea became vacant, Samuel Prat was transferred, and his next brother, George Prat,0 was 1 Agnew's Protestant Exiles, vol. 1, p. 50 ; Vol. 2, p. 54.

His tenure of it was still shorter : for another Benefice in the gift of the Chapter falling vacant, he was preferred to it in 1722; and then his younger brother, Daniel Peat,1 who was not even a Minor Canon of Rochester, stepped into his place at Sutton Valence ; which however he only held for a few months, for he was transferred to succeed his brother at Boughton Monchelsea, which just then fell vacant. Sutton had thus been a \"Family Living\" for three appointments within ten years. It would appear however that such gross acts of nepotism were not allowed to be perpetrated without stringent, though fruitless, remonstrance from several members of the Chapter. However, the spell was broken by the death of Dean Prat,2 and Culpepek Savage,3 a member of a very old Kentish family, who had been Vicar of Stone in Oxney, was presented; and held the Living till 1742, when he resigned it for that of Eastry. After him Samuel Vennour (or Venner),4 a very young man, who had only left College (Christ Church, Oxford), the year before, was appointed. On his death iu 1764 Nicholas Brown, of Christ's College, Cambridge, succeeded, and held it for nearly 40 years. He was succeeded by William Henry Menzies, of University College, Oxford, and he again in 1819 by Henry Morgan Say, of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, who died in 1831. John Barnwell was next appointed: but being a Pluralist, holding the Livings of Holdford and Stogursay in Somersetshire, where he chiefly resided and eventually died, in 1866, during his Incumbency his place at Sutton Valence was supplied by Curates, whose 1 Ibid, f. 322. 2 He was buried in St. George's Chapel, Windsor. 4 Abp.

THE Church of Sutton Valence, or Town Sutton, as it was formerly called, retains very little indeed to interest the Arch\u00e6ologist. It is dedicated to St. Mary, and was no doubt for many generations the most important of the two Churches, though now in point of architectural beauty it must concede the palm to that of East Sutton. Standing nearly on the crest of the hill, with the Weald stretching below, its position is a commanding one, and it lies in close connection with the mass of the population ; but whatever it may once have possessed of attractiveness as a fabric has long since passed away. It has been the victim of many vicissitudes and changes, especially of late years. Camden does not mention it in his \" Brittania,\" nor does Lambarde include it in his \" Perambulations.\" Kilburne in his Survey of Kent, (p. 258) who wrote nearly a century later, only says that it had \" a Church, which was called St. Marie's. Harris, writing in the beginning of the last century, describes the Church as being \"large, with a low flat tower and no spire.\" Hasted,1 some seventy years later, calls it \" a handsome Church, with the steeple standing on the north side of it, and had a high spire on it formerly; the upper half of which having been burnt down by lightning, it is at that part covered with lead.\" 1 Hasted, 8vo. edition, vol. 5, p. 372."], [44, "Sutton Valence and East Sutton. 28 It is interesting to verify these accounts by means of a series of prints which still exist, and mark the periods at which these changes in the building were effected.1 The earliest of these is in a collection of drawings made about 1 720, by John Warburton, Esq., Somerset Herald, a copy of which, by Hasted, is preserved in the British Museum.2 In it the tower is represented as being rather lofty, topped by a battlement, but with no spire. The next drawing, nearly a hundred years later, was made by Edward Pretty, Esq., at the time Curator of the Maidstone Museum, where it is preserved among a large collection of similar sketches of neighbouring Churches. This drawing was apparently made with characteristic forethought in 1823, the warning having gone for the demolition of the building. And thus it happily remains as the last existing representation of what Sutton Valence Church was when erected, (probably in the 14th century,) with enough to show to what alterations and mutilations it had been subjected since that time. Marked as is the difference between the two sketches \u2014 so marked that they hardly seem to be representations of the same building \u2014 yet, bearing in mind that th6 one was probably the work of an amateur, and in the crude style of that period, the other the more finished and accurate production of a skilled draughtsman, there is enough resemblance in their general characters to enable one to see that they are pictures of the same building, made by two so different artists, at different periods. In the later 1 For the privilege to introduce these interesting Prints we are indebted to the courtesy and kindness of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, who had them prepared for a Pamphlet on the subject, published about twenty-five years ago by one of their own body, C.

That Church, like the present one, consisted of a nave and two aisles \u2022 judging from Mr. Pretty's sketch, the east end of the Chancel, where the weather-moulding still remained, would suggest that a fine early English window once stood here, but its proportions had been more than once spoiled by the economic instinct of successive would be renovators, until, bricking up the upper portion of it, they were content to substitute a low square-headed window, such as would have disgraced a barn. Not that the old Church was utterly devoid of objects of beauty or interest. The Chapel at the east end of the south aisle, known as the \" Lambe Chapel,\" contained once a window of goodly form, of somewhat later date than that in the chancel. It was associated with that worthy \" Citizen of London town,\" William Lambe, to whom the parish and neighbourhood are indebted for the excellent Grammar-School and Almshouses, now right loyally and liberally maintained by the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, of which their founder was a distinguished brother, and to whose care he bequeathed them. Perhaps the memory of this benefactor's name is more permanently, though not so usefully, preserved, nearer the scene of his mercantile labours and successes, than at his Kentish home, in the Conduit which he built near Holborn Cross, and in the road still bearing his name, \" Lambe's Conduit Street.\" But to return to the Chapel : at its east end then stood a rich 3-light transomed Perpendicular window, a worthy"], [50, "Sutton Valence and East Sutton. 30 example of architectural taste in the reign of old \" Queen Bess.\" William Lambe died in 1581. In the so-called Restoration (demolition rather) of 1823, this window was bodily removed, and lost to sight, and would have been to memory, too, but for the timely intervention of a wealthy and appreciative resident of Maidstone, Mr. John Newington Hughes, Banker, and twice Mayor of that Borough, who rescued it from destruction by buying it as it stood, and removing it, with many other such despised works of medi\u00e6val art, into the Courtyard of his house at Maidstone, where it may still be seen behind the shop of Mr. Barling, Silversmith, in the High Street. But it is so enveloped in creepers that its bold tracery and well defined mouldings can scarcely be recognised. One interesting memorial of the earlier Church must, however, be noticed. On the floor of \" Lambe' s Chapel,\" as it is still called, is a gravestone which tells of two men, Benjamin and John Nichols, who were successively Masters of the Grammar School, each for a period of fourteen years.

The inference is that this had been the burial place of the earlier Masters of the School. It only remains now to tell the tale of the present building. It dates from the year 1828.1 Instead of attempting to preserve, and where necessary restore, such portions of the earlier fabric as were of architectural interest, the entire building was condemned and demolished, with the exception of the tower, from which the stunted spire was removed, and another upper stage added. If the old sketches are true, the site of the Church must also have been somewhat altered. In both of them the tower is represented as abutting on the north aisle, whereas it now stands at the west end of the nave* leading to the inference that the entire building was carried a little further north. A wide-spanned saddle shaped roof must then have covered the entire area of the Church, about 48 feet wide. But in the year 1872-4 important alterations were made. An arcade was intro duced on either side, converting the north and south portions into aisles \u2022 the old high pews were removed, and the present pitch-pine seats and altar rails were substituted for old seats. In 1883 the staring look of the windows, with their large square panes of glass and upright iron bars, was relieved by the insertion of mullions and tracery, and thus a somewhat more ecclesiastical character was given to the Church. Allusion has been made to a memorial window to a former curate, the Rev. Frank Walter, A.M., in the east end of the chancel. Here Mr. Haberson, an Architect of some eminence in his day, under whom the present building was erected, made an ambitious attempt to introduce, as the 3 It took five years to build."], [58, "Sutton Valence and East Sutton. 32 most striking feature of the Church, a three-light window of geometrical tracery, of an original design, in which the Canons of medi\u00e6val architecture have been studiously ignored.

The Church does not retain any noteworthy monuments beyond the two gravestones already mentioned, those to the two Masters of the School, and the Huguenot Vicar.

Very different is the history of East Sutton Church, originally regarded as the sister \u2014 but now-a-days as the daughter \u2014 almost as the Chapel-of-ease \u2014 to that of Sutton Valence, lying, as its name indicates, further to the east along the same lofty range of hills, embowered among the stately trees which skirt the garden walls of East Sutton Place, the home for nearly four centuries of the Filmer family. Here now is much that will delight the eye and rejoice the heart of the earnest Arch\u00e6ologist. He will find no modern building here \u2022 all time-honoured ; the same that has stood on this spot for many a generation.

Two or three years ago the appearance of the interior had been far from beautiful or attractive. A barrel-shaped ceiling, of plaistor and whitewash, walls coated with mildew and moss, and discoloured with long broad streaks of leakage from the neglected roof, as though weeping under a sense of their degradation and decay, and groaning under the weight of cumbrous monuments blocking up windows and recessed arches ; while the area was filled with tall square box-like pews, their sides and backs, whether of oak or deal, smeered with paint of divers colours, until the whole presented a scene of disorder and neglect \u2014 such as was utterly unworthy of a \" House of D"], [62, "34 Sutton Valence and East Sutton. Prayer,\" and could not fail to sadden the heart of the devout worshipper ; while the effluvia that escaped from the vaults below often drove the more delicate out of the Church. Happily there were zealous parishioners1 in the parish who felt that such a state of their little Church was a standing reproach. With this conviction came the desire, and also the means, for effecting the needed alteration. The result has been that a wise, conscientious, and almost thorough restoration of the building has been carried out. Yards and yards of discoloured mortar and whitewash have disappeared ; monuments which had long disfigured and blocked up the walls were taken down, and replaced in more seemly order ; the roof opened out to the original beams and rafters; open seats substituted for the cumbrous pews ; thus the whole character of the Church has been changed; long hidden beauties brought to light; features enough to enable us to trace out the growth of the building, and even to fix approximately the dates of the several parts. Such then is the restored building to be now described. The Church is dedicated to SS. Peter and Paul. It is a small building, only 75 feet from east to west and 56 feet wide ; the chancel at the east of the south aisle, known as the Filmer Chapel, 36 feet by 13 feet ; that on the north 20 feet by 10 feet.

The original Norman Church mentioned in Domesday is in all probability represented by the present nave, extending from the tower arch to the step of the choir. This view seems to receive confirmation by the discovery, made in the course of the recent work of restoration, of the foundation of substantial outer walls running along the lines of the present arcades. The first addition would naturally be by the extension of the Chancel eastward. Here the narrow slit-like windows on either wall ; of which that in the north still retains its distinctive features, its internal splays broad and deep, its exterior jambs boldly chamfered, its trefoil arch with ogee head; all suggesting the work of the 13th century, when this plinthless chancel of flint and rubble was probably built on ; and when no doubt its east end had its triplet of corresponding windows subsequently removed to make room for a graceful three-light single arched one, inserted perhaps a century later. It may be that this extension was carried out about the time when the Manor was held by William lb Mareschall, Earl of Pembroke. The next addition would probably have taken place about a hundred years after, when the Chantry Chapel on the south, now called the \"Filmer Chapel,\" was built. It is to be especially noticed that this addition was made \u2014 not into \u2014 but against the south wall of the chancel. The recent restoration has brought to light some strikingly interesting features in the construction of this Chapel. It"], [66, "Sutton Valence and East Sutton. 36 is formed by a double wall running face to face \u2014 not interbonded with \u2014 the earlier one, thus accounting for the unusual thickness of this wall, and closing up the upper part of the Early English window on the south, which no doubt corresponded with that in the north wall, leaving the broad deep splays untouched, and the lower portion open to serve as a hagioscope from the Chantry Chapel. It is evident, too, from the position of the piscina on one side and the ambry on the other, that this Chapel was at a lower level than the chancel, and was raised up to its present elevation when it was turned into a burial place for the Filmer family. The east wall of this Chapel has also a tale to tell. Though now commonly called by their name, it stood here long before the Filmers appeared in the place. The bold weather-moulding high up in the gable outside, the arched masonry, recently brought to light on the wall inside, with their wide-spanned graceful curves, belong to the time when, in the beginning of the reign of Edward III.. the Early English style was developing its broader windows and its flowing tracery. That was the time when the munificent Maria de Sancto-Paulo, the third wife, and widow, of Aymer (Adomarus) de Valencia, was Lady of the Manor. Such a pious work as adding this Chantry Chapel would well accord with the mind and taste of one who, as we have seen, was the foundress of Pem broke College, Cambridge. In the present window, reduced in size above, and with its lower part bricked up, appears but a sorry substitute for the goodly one which once adorned the east end of this Chapel, of which she not improbably was the designer.

The East Window of the North Chapel."], [71, "Sutton Churches. 37 proclaims another benefactor of the latter part of that century. Here we have a most beautiful example on a small scale of what the skill and taste of that day, with its advance in graceful decoration, could produce. Here, as plainly as mason's chisel can make stone speak, we can hear and read what a great authority on architecture, of some sixty years ago, Sir James Hall, suggests as \" the vegetable theory \" of architecture, finding, in the bending boughs, and pealing away of the bark the origin of the arches, cusps, and general tracery of the Decorated style. Standing in this Chapel, watching the moon rising behind that lovely east window, now, alas, it may be feared crumbling to decay, one can hardly fail to recall the beautiful lines in which Sir Walter Scott so graphi cally describes a similar effect in Melrose Abbey : \u2014 The moon on the east oriel shone, Through slender shafts of shapely stone, By foliaged tracery combined ; Thou would'st have thought some fairy hand, 'Twixt poplars straight, the osier band In many a freakish knot had twined ; Then framed a spell when the work was done, And changed the willow wreaths to stone. Nor was it only on the tracery of the window itself, that the architect lavished his wealth of skill and taste. Even the splays on either side supplied space whereon to exhibit his artistic powers, in the panelled recesses from the base to the spring of the arch, forming, as it were, a frame for his beautiful window. Its smaller companion in the north wall is no less deserving of special notice, as presenting an admirable object-lesson, or study, of the transition stage between the two styles which was taking place during the later years of the fourteenth century. Instead of the rich flowing"], [72, "38 Sutton Valence and East Sutton. style of the Decorated work of the east window, as already remarked upon, signs appear of the growing adoption of the more rigid lines of the Perpendicular style which was to follow. For instance, the mullion s, instead of branching off and losing themselves in geometric curves, now resume the upright lines and carry the eye, with only slight interruption, from base to the covering arch above : while the mouldings lose much of the hollowed roundness of the Decorated, and run into the more angular lines of the Perpendicular. This change too betrays itself in so minute a feature as the cusp, which instead of being gracefully trefoiled or foliated, is more or less cut up in acute lines. All these points of deviation between the two neighbour windows of the same Chapel, have suggested that this one in the north wall, beautiful as it is in itself, was a some what later insertion. To whom this little Church is endebted for this Chapel and its exquisite windows, and for its no less beautiful \u2014 perhaps almost more striking \u2014 companion under its seg mental arch in the north wall, it is more difficult to assign the credit. But when we bear in mind that towards the close of the 14th century, \u2014 the probable date of these windows, \u2014 the Manor of Sutton, with the Earldom of Pembroke, had passed from the Valencia to the Hastings family, by the marriage of Laurence (Lord) Hastings, with Isabel, the heiress of the Valencias, and that their son John (Lord) Hastings had married as his second wife Agnes, the daughter of Sir Walter (afterwards Lord) Manney, is it not allowable to suggest that East Sutton Church may possibly be endebted for her two most beautiful windows to the daughter of the Founder of Charterhouse ? Certainly the delicate tracery of the"], [73, "I'\" l'ace Page 3S. EAST SUTTON CHURCH, KENT. The North Window of the North Chapel."], [74, ""], [75, "Sutton Churches. 39 windows themselves, the wrought stone coins, the presence of a plinth (now first seen in the Church), the gracefully carved stringcourse running under the sill of the east window, would all suggest the latter part of the 14th century as the date to be approximately assigned to this Chapel. It is for the rescue of these two beautiful windows from utter ruin, \u2014 windows of which any Church may well be proud, \u2014 that an urgent plea is now put forth, in order to complete the work of restoration so well begun. At its west end of this Chapel there projects a buttress of massive proportions, within which winds a newel stair to what once was a Rood Loft, the entrance door and tho outlet above still existing in the wall inside. This Rood Loft apparently extended across the Church, occupying the entire width of one bay, as the wall and the columns retain the traces of the corbels on which it rested. All trace of the Loft itself has disappeared, but fragments of the screen which ran below still remain, though in a mutilated form, having been broken up into compartments to adorn (?) the sides of family pews. The east window of the Chancel too has its history. Originally no doubt a triplet of Early English windows, as already mentioned, of the same date as those in the side walls : to give place in time to a three-light single arched Decorated window, evidently substituted during the fourteenth century. And although traces of it in the jambs and sill were left, it had probably so far decayed as to require removal : and then about a century and a half ago in that evil day of Ecclesiastical architecture, a third was introduced, which was standing when the recent Restoration work began. But so patent were its defects,"], [76, "40 Sutton Valence and East Sutton. and so dilapidated had it also become, that removal was necessary. Happily a widow lady, Mrs. T. Brenchley, who once lived here, and was much interested in the work going on in the Church, desired to place in it a memorial of her late husband, and made an offering of the present handsome window, a copy of one in Merton College, Oxford which Messrs. Lavers and Westlake have embellished with Scriptural designs. While Mr. Lavers has himself filled in with stained glass the small window of the north wall of the Chancel, in memory of a young friend who had died at the Grammar-School. To resume the history of the fabric itself after the addition of the north Chapel : the next additions which the little Church received clearly belong to the period when the Advowson passed to Leeds Priory in the beginning of the fifteenth century. Then were added the aisles on either side and the tower, the plinth running continuously round this part of the building. The south porch is not without its interest, its stoup and two narrow windows, one on either side, now filled in with stained glass representing the two Patron Apostles, SS. Peter and Paul, have been restored. In the solid oak door remain some bullets to tell of Puritan frenzy. The font is perhaps the oldest fragment of medi\u00e6val art which the Church retains. A few years ago it was an unshapely mass of plaster and whitewash until traces of a Norman base were discovered at one corner. The careful delicate removal of mortar and plaster has brought to light a very handsome font, of probably late Norman date, with a massive bowl resting on a substantial central pier, and supported at each corner with a light shaft, presentino- a very interesting specimen of 13th century work."], [77, "To Face Page 40.

These stray fragments of glass, though dis coloured and dirty, bear testimony to the truth of the Alliances and Grants which Charters and Rolls have unfolded.
