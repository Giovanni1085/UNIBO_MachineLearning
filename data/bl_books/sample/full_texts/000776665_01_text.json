FABULOUS HISTORY. \"I humbly conceive the credit of either University is sufficiently established, without the advantage in point of time. There's no need of torturing a text, catching at bare possibili- ties, and applying almost to romances for belief. They are both of 'em, without contest, the most illustrious seats of learning in Europe ; and since they are thus well founded in merit, what occasion is there to strain for antiquity, to have recourse to questionable records, and run as it were into the dark for light and evidence.\" Jeremy Collier. (1) The improbable statements of our older writers respecting the early history of Cambridge having been frequently appealed to in the dis putes as to the relative antiquity of Oxford and Cambridge, some notice of these legends seems necessary. According to some of these statements, Cambridge owes its origin to one Cantaber a Spanish Prince, who being banished from his native country, was hospitably received by Girrguntius King of Britain, who gave him the hand of his daughter Guenolena, and with her the eastern part of Britain. Cantaber built a large city on the river Cante, where he placed and maintained at his own charge, a society of astronomers and philosophers brought from Athens, in which city he had himself been educated. ) r 4 / ; / (1) Ecclesiastical History, i. 169. E"], [44, "2 FABULOUS HISTORY. With respect to the time of Cantaber's foundation there is some dif ference. Nicholas Cantalupe, (a Carmelite who died about the middle ofthe fifteenth century,) (D assigns the date of A.M. 4321 ; John Lyd gate, (2) the poetical monk of Bury, that of A.M. 4348 ; and Dr. Caius, (3) the still earlier one of A.M. 3588. Holinshed (') refers to a statement of Caxton, that Cambridge was first built by Gorbomen, or Gorbonian, who was king of Britain from A.M. 3G76 to 3686. It were needless to relate all the incidents which are said to have occurred in this University or City of Scholars (as it is termed) sub sequent to Cantaber's foundation ; but it may be observed, that the eminent Grecian philosophers Anaximander and Anaxagoras are as serted to have been Tutors here, and that King Cassibelan is said to have granted privileges to the Scholars, several of whom were removed to Rome by Julius C\u00e6sar ! ! ! The list ofthe Rectors or Chancellors of this University commences with Amphibalus the Martyr, in A.D. 289.(5) It is stated that about A.D. 303, a party of British cruelly and in humanly massacred all the Christian Students in the University ; the utter destruction of which was effected about a century afterwards by Pelagius, whose heresies when a student here had been vehemently op posed by the orthodox Doctors. It must, however, be observed, that the first of these events is stated by some writers to have happened at Winchester, to certain monks of that place ; whilst the monks of Westminster are said by others to have been the victims of this barba rous ebullition of Pagan zeal.CD Some authors, whilst they completely disregard the preceding fables, relate that the University owes its origin to Sigebert or Sigberct, King of the East Angles, by whom it was founded, in A.D. 637; whilst those who support its claim to a still greater antiquity allege that it was then restored by him. The authority for Sigebert's supposed foundation rests entirely upon a statement of the venerable Bede,(7) that this monarch at the period referred to, instituted a school in his kingdom for the instruction of youth. There is nothing, however, to show that this school was established at Cambridge ; and although the University yet commemorates King Sigebert as its founder, his right to that distinction appears very little stronger than that of the ideal Cantaber.

These how ever are palpably fictitious. By one of the Charters, dated at London, the 7th April, A.D. 531, King Arthur exonerates the Scholars of Cambridge from public taxes and burthensome works, in order that the Doctors and Scholars might pur sue the study of literature undisturbed, as had been decreed by King Lucius, who had embraced Christianity by the preaching of the Doctors of Cambridge. 0) Another Charter is dated at Cambridge, A.D. 681 : by it KingCadvvald grants to Almericus, Rector of the Schools of Cambridge, power to punish all crimes, (high treason excepted,) together with all such privi leges as had been granted by his ancestors Asclepiodorus, Constantino, Uterpendragon, Arthur, and by his father Ceadwal. (2> A third Charter is stated to have been given at Grantchester, A.D. 915, by the hands of Frithstanus, Chancellor of the City of Scholars of Cambridge. It purports to be granted by King Edward the elder, (who is said to have restored the University after the burning of Cam bridge by the Danes,) and by it he confirms to the Doctors and Scholars of Cambridge, \" quamdiu vertigo Poli terras ac \u00e6quora circa \u00e6thera siderum justo moderamine volverit,\" all such privileges as had been granted them by his ancestors. (3) The Bulls are ascribed to Honorius I. and Sergius I., and are dated respectively A.D. 624 and 689. They prohibit the interference of all Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, and other ecclesiastical officers in the affairs of the University, more especially in any suspensions or ex communications by the Chancellor or Rectors. (4) In 1430, the originals of these pretended Bulls were stated to have been lost or destroyed upwards of 70 years, but copies of them were received in evidence on a judicial investigation which then took place relative to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the University, their valid ity being recognised by the Pope's Delegate, whose sentence was didy confirmed at Rome. (5> The Bull attributed to Pope John X. (<\") was in reality granted by John XXII., in 1318. (1) Sprotti Chron., ed. Hearne, 268. R. Parker, Hist, of Cambridge, 6 _ 16.

Cambridge, situate in the country anciently inhabited by the tribes called the Simeni or Iceni, is conjectured to have been the British city denominated Cair Graunth (4) From the remains discovered or discernible at and in the imme diate neighbourhood of Cambridge, there is every reason to conclude that here was a Roman station. This station was, no doubt, situate on the north bank of the river, a spot likely to have been fixed upon, as being sheltered by the ground rising to the north, and gently declining to the southern sun. Dr. Stukeley thus describes the site of this station (which he terms the city ofGranta) : \u2014 \" I have, in company with Mr. Roger Gale, traced out the vestiges of that city, without any difficulty ; being an oblong square which was walled about and ditched, the Roman road which comes in a strait line from Huntingdon hither, runs through the midst of it, and so in a strait line through the town by Christ's College and Emanuel to Gogmagog Hills where it passes by Bartlow and Haverhill in Essex, probably to Colchester, the Camulodunum colonia. In the garden of Pythagoras's school, south and west of thai building', the trace of the ditch of the Roman Granta may easily b-iiscerned ; and the turn or angle of it, to which the angle of that buildAg corres ponds. Then the west side of the ditch runs on the outside If the late Mr. Ketil's house, and turns quite on the outside of the town on the north, so round the outside of the Castle through Magdal* College close which is the south side of it.

He considered the Castle was the Pr\u00e6torium of the Roman station. <2) The ancient fosse appears to have been from 10 to 12 feet deep and 39 feet broad, both sides having a slope. Of the wall, on the inte rior edge of this fosse, some remains were discovered in March, 1804; the materials in the foundation consisted of flinty pebbles, fragments of Roman brick, and ragstone, very firmly cemented. (3) Roman coins have been found within or near the Castle at various periods.!2) In 1802, and the seven following years, there were disco vered a great number of ancient coins on this spot; 41 of the first brass, 25 of the second, 86 of the third, and 16 of silver, besides others which fell into the hands of bystanders, and as many destroyed on account of their legends being worn away. Three of the coins were British, the rest Roman. (4) In digging the foundations of the present County Gaol, and in works at or very near the same place, in 1802 and 1803, many other remains of the Romans were discovered: namely, urns of great variety of colour, shape, and decoration, some very elegant; <5) pater\u00e6 and other sacri ficing utensils, embellished with figures, on some the hunting of a hare, others the chasing of a stag, others the figures of rabbits, like those on the coins of Hadrian ; querns, lacrymatories, a celt or spear-head, one foot in length but corroded by time ; an armilla or bracelet of brass, encircling two small bones of a human arm ; a variety of amphor\u00e6, some with two ears some with one only and others without any ; and several fragments of green and blue glass.*6) Between October, 1805, 'and April, 1806, several broken Roman vessels were found at the Castle, together with four urns of dark brown clay neaftr entire, and one of white marl unbroken, a cinerary urn of black tarth, and many fragments of beautiful red pottery.'6) (1) Stuwiey, Palaeographica Britanniea, No. II., p. 36.

(') Mr. Gough informs us that ho had picked up fragments of urns amongst the corn in the adjoining fields.'2) In March 1804 there was dug up, about a hundred paces from the north-west side of the Roman ditch and on the west side of the turn pike gate leading to Huntingdon, an ancient cornelian intaglio (set in a finger-ring of silver) representing Mercury, with the caduceus in his left and a purse in his right hand ; and near the same spot was foimd a bronze figure of Mercury, only two inches high, with wings issuing from his bonnet as well as his feet, and holding a purse in his left hand.(S) There are, or were, Roman bricks or tiles within the walls of St. Peter's Church, winch Mr. Essex, an architect of celebrity in his day, was of opinion had been erected on the site of a Roman temple.!4) Where the Great Bridge is situate, Dr. Stukeley considers the Romans had a ford across the river ; (5) and near here many Roman coins have been found.t6) Mr. Essex, in rebuilding the Great Bridge, is said to have discovered the foundation of a bridge which had been erected at that spot in very early times, and which he conceived to be of Roman workmanship ; 0) there was at the same time found a bronze bust, the ornament of a standard, which Dr. Stukeley fancied to represent Oriuna the wife ofthe Emperor Carausius.(s) Dr. Edward Daniel Clarke, in 1S20, communicated with the Society of Antiquaries on the subject of an ancient signet discovered in Cambridge. He describes it as an intaglio, executed in a very singular variety of jasper, ofthe hardest kind he had ever seenfStriped reddish and yellow ish brown, not unlike the hydrate of Silica found in India, which goes by the name of petrified tamarind tree.

(U On making the turnpike road from Cambridge to Huntingdon, a bar row near Howe's House was removed, which contained several Roman coins.f2) At Arbury, in the parish of Chesterton, was a large squarish camp in which Roman coins have been found, particularly one of silver, with the head of Rome on one side and Castor and Pollux on horseback on the reverse.'3) On Gogmagog Hills was a camp called V andlebury, triple trenched with two ditches, rudely circular, and of 246 paces diameter. This has been supposed to be British, and it was on the hill, as the British man ner was.W Dr. Gale, however, considered it Roman notwithstanding its circular form, there being several instances in which the Romans did not confine themselves to a square, but consulted the nature and conve nience ofthe groimd.(S) Dr. Stukeley conceived it was called Vandlebury from its having been the camp of the Vandals and Burgundians whom Probus transported from the Continent into Britain.!6) In 1685 many Roman coins were dug out at this place. Dr. Gale had several of them, all of the Emperors Valentinian I. and Valens. (7> In 1730 several large brass Roman coins and a silver ring were found, and in 1752 a small brass coin of Nero, inscribed \"nero clavd. caes. nRvsvs ger. ivvent,\" and haying on the reverse a globe.(') On dig oing the foundation of Lord Godolphin's house there were found a knuckle-ring, with coins of Trajan and Antoninus Pius.W In 1778, one of the tumuli on the Gogmagog Hills was destroyed. At the bottom were found deposited seven skeletons, six of them were laid close together in a parallel direction, their heads pointing due north; the seventh lay in a different direction, the head pointing due west and the feet pointing to the side of the nearest of the six, forming a right (1) Archaeologia, xix. 401., pi. xl.

The tumulus was composed of a fine light brown soil, which must have been collected purposely and from some distance, as the natural soil or earth of the hills consists first of a thin stratum of light soil, then gravel, then chalk, to a considerable depth. The earth immediately enclosing the bones was distinguished from the rest by a blueish tint, imagined to have been communicated to it by the putrefaction of the fleshy parts of the body. The tumulus was situated about 60 yards from the Roman road across the hills.! >) On the 3d August, 1816, some labourers employed in lowering the road from Cambridge towards London, upon the top of a small emi nence, called Huckeridge Hill, near Sawston, discovered the remains of a human skeleton lying about three feet below the surface. At the feet of the skeleton stood two vessels of ancient bronze ; the larger of these was ornamented on the rim by chase work in bosses all round the circumference ; it measured 1 5 inches in diame ter. The other had a place on one side with a hole in it, as if there had been receptacles for a semicircular handle; it measured 10 inches in diameter. On the left side of the skeleton were found some fragments of the coarsest black terra cotta half an inch in thickness, also an iron sword two feet seven inches and a half in length, in a state of advanced decomposition. There was, besides, a massy bronze ring, which proved upon examination to have been the foot of the larger vessel. There were also part of the umbo of a shield of iron and a bronze brooch or buckle, formed so as to resemble an Amphisb\u0153na or double-headed serpent. Dr. E. D. Clarke was of opinion that there were circumstances which seemed to refer these antiquities to an earlier period than the time of the Romans in Britain, otherwise the situation of this sepulchre so near to the public road, added to the vicinity of the old military station at Gogmagog Hills, might induce an opinion of its Roman origin. A few years before several lance heads and celts were discovered near the same spot.!2) Many Roman antiquities have been found at Trumpington. In 1719 Mr. Thompson of that place had a great many vases, some of metal curiously cast, and others of several sorts of earth, all found between Trumpington and Cambridge. Lord Harley (afterwards Earl of Oxford) offered \u00a330 for them, but that sum was refused.!3) They were perhaps, however, purchased by his Lordship subsequently, as he had several beautiful vases and pater\u00e6 found here.

Dr. E. D. Clarke considered the swords, how ever, were after the Grecian model, differing essentially both as to shape and material from the swords in use among the Romans. A similar sword was found many years previously in the river Cam between Cam bridge and Ely.!4) A tumulus called Hay Hill, standing by the remains ofthe old Roman road westward of Cambridge, beyond the village of Barton towards Wimpole was opened by Dr. E. D. Clarke in the summer of 1817. Near this spot had been previously found a chain with six collars for conduct ting captives, and a double fulcrum intended to support a spit for roast ing meat, the coals being placed under the spit, illustrating a well known passage in Virgil: \u2014 \" Subjiciunt verubus prunas et viscera torrent.\" On opening the tumulus there were found upon the floor of the tomb, about nine feet from the summit, the remains of a human skeleton ; the head, separated from the body, was lying upon the right ear north and south, the top of the skull pointing to the south ; the bones of the body were lying east and west. In April, 1818, some labourers digging gravel near the same tumulus, discovered at the same distance and on the same side of the Roman road, fourteen inches below the surface of the soil, a rude stone slab, covering the mouth of an Amphora. Upon raising the stone, there were found within the Amphora, which was full of water, a black terra cotta vase (1) Camden, Britannia, ed. Gough, ii. 229. (2) Ibid, 219.

These Horsley thinks it probable united again afterwards.!*) Dr. Bennett, Bishop of Cloyne, considered, however, that the Grantchester branch fell into the Roman way from Cambridge to Sandy, at Barton ; but his lordship remarks, \" It must not be concealed, however, that some antiquaries of the present day are not convinced of the existence of this vicinal road ; and though they confess it to have all the marks of a trackway used in ancient times, are inclined to account for these appearances by the sup position that, when the Roman bridge and causeway were destroyed by the barbarians, travellers naturally looked on each side of the ruined station for the nearest fords, and passed the river Cam at Grantchester and Chesterton, as they did the Ouze\" at Offord and Hemingford ; and as no signs of a raised causeway appear in this line, the idea is by no means destitute of plausibility. Of this, however, any one who traces it may judge for himself.\"(5) Another road, leading from the north-east coast of Norfolk to St. David's, passed through Cambridge. Tlie course of the road from Ely was by King's hedges (within a short distance of Arbury camp, to which it seems to have thrown off a road) to the north-east gate of Cambridge Castle, whence it passed by Barton (where was a tumulus, the usual attendant on ways of this sort) to Sandy.!6) Dr. Mason traced a branch road from the above at Orwell to Ash well, pointing towards St. Albans.C) The communication between Chesterford and Cambridge, Bishop Bennett\" considered was by a military way, which probably proceeded in the course of the present turnpike road by Sawston and Great Shel ford, in the latter of which villages, very near the road, on the east side of it, on a farm called Graham's, is or was a very complete Roman camp, with a square vallum and fosse.!8) Horsley was assured that the (1) Archaelogia, xix, 56. pi.

Dr. Stukeley states that in the same year Carausius built a city, to which was given the name of Granta, at the head of his navigation on the north side of the river.

And if the Lord [of the gild] ne glect it he shall pay a pound, unless he be on lord's need (4) or be very sick. If any one kill a member let the fine be not less than eight pounds. Then if the slayer refuse to pay the fine let all the gildship avenge the member and every one bear his share. If one do it let all bear equally. And if any member slay a man and he be needy and he must make compensation for his deed, and the slain man be a man of twelve hundred shillings, let each member give half a mark to help him. If the man slain be a ceorl let each give two oras, (5) if a *Welshman; one ora . If the member slay any one by wrong and by folly let himself bear the consequence of what he has done. And if a member slay his fellow member by his own folly let him satisfy the kinsman himself, and buy again his place in the gild with eight pounds or lose for ever the right of fellowship and fraternity. And if any member eat or drink with him who has slain his fellow member unless it be hi the presence of the king, or of the bishop of the province, or of the aldermen, he shall pay a pound, unless he can make it appear by two wit nesses that he did not know him.

A number of Saxon prelates, nobles, and clergy (goaded to resistance by the arbitrary measures of King William), retired with their forces to the morasses of the isle of Ely, where they formed an encampment, which received the name of the Camp of Refuge. The King subsequently came to Cambridge Castle with a powerful army, for the purpose of reducing the insurgents ; but after a prodigious waste of men and money, he was only enabled to obtain possession of the isle in the year 1072, through the treachery of the monks of Ely, whom he alarmed by the seizure of their landed pos sessions without the isle.!3) 1073.

From it we learn that this town (therein called the borough of Grantebrigge) was in the time of Edward the Confessor considered as one hundred of the county of Cambridge, and that the town was at this period divided into ten wards,!2) containing altogether about 400 houses,(3) of which number, however, at least one-eighth were waste or decayed, besides twenty seven which had been destroyed to make room for the Castle, and others pulled down by Picot the sheriff of Cambridgeshire, when he erected certain mills. It also appears that the customs!4) ofthe town amounted to \u00a37 per annum, and the landgable to a few shillings more.!5) The town was held of the Crown, by Picot the sheriff, (6) whose conduct appears to have been much complained of by the burgesses, whom he had deprived of common of pasture ; he also required the loan of their ploughs nine times in the year, whereas in the reign of the Confessor they lent their ploughs only thrice in the year, and found neither cattle nor carts. Besides three mills erected by Picot (who thereby took away pasture, and destroyed many houses), there were two others, one (1) Thierry, History of the Conquest of England by the Normans (Hamilton's Translation, edit. 1840), 112. (2) From the Inquisitio Elieasis (507) we find that the second ward was called ' ' Brugeward,\" i. e. Bridgeward. (3) This number is conjectural ; for although ten wards are mentioned in the survey, no account is given of the sixth. The number of houses in the nine other wards is stated at 373, of which 49 were waste. (4) On the trials respecting the claim of the Corporation to a toll on laden carriages coming into or going out of the town, considerable discussion took place as to the meaning of the word \" Consuetudo,\" as used in that part of Domesday which refers to Cambridge. On the one hand it was contended it meant Toll, on the other a payment out of Houses ; and this latter construction is strongly supported by the context, for several houses are mentioned as paying all customs. It is probable that the \"Consuetudines\" mentioned in the concluding part of Die survey of this town, were the payments called Hagable (corruptly High Gable) is suing out of houses : this supposition is strengthened by their being placed in connection with \" Landgable,\" or payment out of land. In the reign of Edward I. the bailiffs of the town received Hagable out of nearly 200 houses in tlie town ; and to this day the Corporation receive two or three small rents under the name of High Gable Rents.

At the period in question, the burgesses or tradesmen in great towns had their patrons, under whose protection they traded, and to whom they paid an acknowledgment, or else they were in a more servile condi tion, as being altogether under the power of their lords.!3) At the time this survey was taken, there appear to have been in this town twenty bur gesses under protection of this kind. Of these, ten were the burgesses of Earl Alan, three of Earl Morton, three of Ralph de Bans, three of Roger, a man of Bishop Rcmigius,!4) and one of Erchenger the Baker.!5) All these were exempt from the King's customs ; (6> and so it may be presumed paid an acknowledgment to their protectors instead of the Crown. Three Normans and a priest are also stated to be exempt from customs, and thirteen houses are specified as paying no customs. It is important to add, that in this survey there is no mention of any University or academical society,!7) nor any thing which can induce a belief that any such institution existed here at this period.'^) 1087.

At this period a great part of the King's revenue arose from the rents, customs, Src, of the Royal demesnes, which were usually farmed by the sheriffs of the several counties, who were frequently guilty of great op pression and exaction. This caused the inhabitants ofthe larger towns to unite together, in order to obtain a grant of the Town from the Crown at a fixed rent or farm, and thus exempt themselves, to a certain extent, from the sheriff's power. Such was the original of most of our muni cipal corporations which can boast of any great antiquity. It was about the beginning of the reign of Henry I. that that monarch granted to the burgesses of Cambridge, that they might hold their town at farm, paying to him the same sum as the sheriff of the county had been accustomed to render. Neither this grant, nor any copy or enrolment of it, is now known to be extant ; but it is mentioned in ancient legal documents. which appear entitled to credit.C) 1109. This town, which had been previously subject to the Bishop of Lin coln, this year became parcel of the newly-erected diocese of Ely, and an archdeacon was appointed, with the title of Archdeacon of Cam bridge.^) 1110. The only account of the origin of the University of Cambridge which appears entitled to the slightest credence, has reference to this year. It occurs in the additions of Peter de Blois to the History of Ingulphus, (1) Corporation Cross Book, so. 14, Sic. 12) Bentham. His1 and Antiq. of Ely, 123, 130, 269"], [65, "HENRY THE FIRST. 23 Abbot of Croyland. Speaking of Joffrid, abbot of that monastery, De Blois informs us, that \u2014 He sent also to liis manor of Cotenham near Cambridge Sir Gislebert his fellow monk and Professor of Divinity, with three other monks who had followed him into England, and they being well instructed in philosophical theorems, and other primi tive sciences, and coming daily to Cambridge, in a certain hired public barn, openly taught their sciences, and in the course of a short time, had collected a great number of scholars. But, in tlie second year of their coming, tlie number of scholars was so greatly increased as well from the whole country as from the town, that not even the greatest house, barn, nor any church, was sufficient for their reception. Whereupon they separated into various places, and followed the form of study of Orleans. Early in the morning brother Odo, a grammarian and satirical poet in that time famous, read grammar according to the doctrine of Priscian and Remigius, to the boys and younger sort assigned to him. At the hour of prime,' Terricus, a most acute sophister, taught the logic of Aristotle, according to Porphyry and the comments of Averroes to the elder. At the hour of tierce, brother AVilliam lectured on Tully's Rhetoric and Quinliliau's Flores. But Master Gislebert preached every Sunday and feast-day in some church, the Word of God to the people in the English tongue ; but well furnished and profound in his Latin and French, he strongly disputed against the error of Judaism. On festival days, before the sixth hour, he explained the text of the sacred page to l hotars and priests especially flocking to bear him ; and moreover, some yet unbelieving and blinded with jtidaical falsehood, were struck with remorse, and came at his words into the bosom of the mother Church, having scarcely abandoned their former error. And thus daily, and from day to day, the Christian faith was confirmed. By their industry no slight advantage accrued to the monastery, and they compute that not only was nothing added to the burdens of the manor, but it was much meliorated ; every year a hundred marks being trans mitted from those parts for the building of his church. Chiefly by the venerable Abbott Joffiid visiting his sons in those parts, and most eloquently in his manner preaching to the people, innumerable men and women assembled from the neigh bouring towns, who although they the less were able to understand him speaking in Latin or French, yet they listening to him, by the power of God's word and the grace of his countenance, were very often moved to tears, and made innumerable grants for the rebuilding of his church lately burnt, a matter he always urged at the conclu sion of his discourse. Always also three or four at the end of his discourse followed his footsteps, nothing diverting them, as well laymen as clerks, and either incorpo rated themselves in his monastery, or the neighbouring ones of Burgh and Thorney, or became monks in places more remote, as his epistle recommended. And thus from a small fountain which increased to a great river, we behold the city of God en riched, and all England made fruitful, through the means of some masters and doctors goingout of Cambridge, in the likeness ofthe most holy Paradise.(l) To this statement, the learned and judicious Selden appears to have given entire credit.

Dr. Peacock, with reference to the narrative of De Blois, observes : \u2014 \" The course of studies which they are said to have pursued, and the books which they read, would more properly characterise the beginning of the fourteenth than of the twelfth century ; but though we may feel compelled to refuse to this legend the authority of genuine history, yet there are many cir cumstances which connect the University of Cambridge with that of Orleans.

The Canons of St. Giles were this year removed to a new and spacious monastery erected at Barnwell by Pain Peverell, who had been standard bearer in the Holy Land to Robert duke of Normandy, and to whom Henry I. granted the estates of Picot, which were forfeited by his son Robert, who fled the kingdom on a charge of treason. Pain Peverell augmented the endowment and increased the number of Canons. This House or Priory of Barnwell was the richest of the various conventual foundations in this Town. On occasion of the removal of the Canons to their new habitations, there was a vast concourse both of the clergy and laity, and ofthe burgesse3 of Cambridge. (D 1117.

Fuller's commentary is an amusing specimen of argumentation : \u2014 \" Some adversaries to the antiquity of Cambridge, represent and improve this action much to her disadvantage, as if newly now, and not before, she began to be an University. Objecting, that if Scholars were at Cambridge before the coming of those four Professors thither, they shewed small civility in giving those strangers no better entertainment, to whom they should' have said, as once Laban to Abraham's servant; ' Come in ye blessed of the Lord, wherefore stand you without?' wel- coming them to their halls, hostles, chambers, studies, with the best fare their present condition afforded : especially, seeing Scholars of all men are soonest acquainted, the sameness of pro- fession commonly making them familiar at the first sight. It seems therefore that at their coming thither, either Cambridge had no Scholars in her, or her Scholars had no manners in them \u25a0 yea had not read so much as Tully his OiEees, to teach them civility to strangers professing learn- ing, but suffered them to live, and read in a barn by themselves. \" In answer hereunto, may the reader be pleased to take into his impartial consideration the following particulars:\u2014!. Not much more than twenty years since that mischevious man Robert of Montgomery had despoiled Cambridge. And no wonder if the blackbirds were slow in flyin\" back to their nests, which had been so lately destroyed. 2. Yet a racemation at least of Scholars either remained in Cambridge all that plundering time, or returned soon after it- for we find King Henry the First, in the second of his reign, by order commanding some civilians there to perform their acts, and pay the beadles their fees, which formerly they refused \u2022 and this was some years before tlie coming of the Croyland Professors liither 3 Probably some emulation, not to say envy (a canker we find fretting the fairest flowers) might make some \u25a0distance betwixt the old stock of standing Scholars in Cam bridge, and this new addition of Pro- fessors. Our aunt Oxford may easily remember what little love, yea how great grud'rim* there was betwixt her ancient students, and that new plantation of Scholars which St Grimbald under King Alfred, first placed there. 4. The marvellous increase of learning in Cambridge iii so short a time after the coming of the Croyland Professors thither, is jusriy imputed to this cause, for that Cambridge had formerly been a place of learning. Thus when \"Teen wood is long in kindling, brands (which before were half burnt, and then quenched) do ouicklv take fire, and presently blaze into a bright flame. > i l \u00ab\u00ab\"= \" In a word, such men who have made remarkable additions, to what wasbe<_n Ion\" before oftentimes, as proudly as falsely, conceit themselves the first sounders thereof.

First, we will and ordain that the master of Glomery(l) at Cambridge for the time being shall hear and decide all the suits of the Glomerels on the defendant's side, willing that^in this particular the aforesaid master shall enjoy the same privi lege as the other masters have with respect to their scholars in deciding their causes, so that whether they be schola rs or laymen who wish to convene the Glomerels> or desire to get anything from them by means of a judicial prosecution, they shall do this in the presence of the master of Glomery, to whom we decree that the con dition of such suit shall rightfully belong, unless the cognizance of such cause re - late to rents of houses rated by the masters and burgesses, or to the evidence of an enormous crime having been committed, which incurs the penalty of imprison ment, or of exclusion from the privileges ofthe University. For in these cases and in no others, the Glomerels shall answer to any plaintiff in the presence of the Chancellor, who exercises his authority in these matters as is elsewhere observed. But if the master of Glomery decides between a scholar as plaintiff, and a Glomerel as defendant, and his interlocutory or definitive sentence happens to be appealed from, we will and ordain that the appeal be made to the Chancellor, who shall pro ceed in treating the cause of the appeal itself, according to the order observed when an appeal is made by another regent master, who has taken cognizance of the said suit of his scholar on either side, plaintiffs or defendants, to the Chancellor. But the Chancellor shall not interfere in any of the suits of Glomerels amongst them selves, or between laymen and Glomerels, unless the point at issue be the rent of rated houses or the enormity of an offence as is above expressed. And whereas, we have seen it contained in the statutes of the University, that two bedells ofthe University should be present, bearing their staves, at all vespers, inceptions, congregations, exequies of the dead, and at all other assemblies, no one else being allowed to bear a staff to their prejudice. We enjoin that the bedell of Glomery shall not bear a mace before the Chancellor and masters in the aforesaid assemblies and places ; but in other places he is licensed to bear a mace, freely and undisturbed, when and wherever he pleases, especially for the execution of his office. And whereas, in the statutes ofthe same University, among other things, it is contained that the household servants of the scholars, the writers and others, who (1) The Master of Glomery was the master of the students in grammar, who were called Glomerels.

We declare this ac cording to the intent of these presents on such condition that in this case under the term household servants, we wish to be included only the scholars' servants residing in houses with them, whilst they serve the aforesaid scholars in person. Also the term writers and others, who exercise offices peculiarly assigned to the use of the scholars, we wish that it be understood of writers, illuminators, and sta tioners, who serve the scholars only, and that they must answer before the Chan cellor ; but their wives, who are under the charge of adultery or any other crime, the cognizance and correction of which pertains to the Archdeacon in a similar man ner with the other persons under his jurisdiction, and the rest of their family, not especially deputed to the service of the scholars, shall be under the Archdeacon's jurisdiction in all and everything, just as other lay-persons of the town of Cam bridge and our diocese of Ely. And we have caused to be inserted in these presents that which we ordained verbally only at Barnwell, in the presence of the aforesaid Archdeacon, the Chan cellor and others, whom it concerned, viz., that the Rectors of churches, Vicars, parochial Chaplains, and other ministers of the churches of Cambridge, shall be subject to the Archdeacon in all things, like others in his archdeaconry ; adding our declaration, that, under the appellation of ministers of the churches, we will to be in this case included the Rector, Vicar, and the clerks in the service of the Church, as well as the Priests who celebrate the masses of the Blessed Virgin, and the masses for the souls of the faithful, provided, however, that they have been deputed by one ofthe parishioners in Cambridge, and are staying there principally for the sake of celebrating such masses, although, perhaps, they may desire to study and to attend the schools incidentally. But if they have come to Cambridge chiefly for the sake of learning, although, perhaps, they may celebrate the afore said masses at the desire of the parishioners, we will and ordain that they be entirely subject to the jurisdiction of the Chancellor ; so that if a doubt is raised with what intention they principally stay in the aforesaid town in this matter, the oath to be corporally taken by the Priests themselves, in the presence of the Arch deacon and Chancellor abovementioned shall be abided by, and thus the jurisdic tion over the persons of such Priests shall be his, to whom it shall appertain by virtue of the oath taken in the form above noticed. But if by chance the Rectors, Vicars, or ministers of such churches in Cambridge, shall make a contract with a scholar, or shall fail in a scholastic exercise in these cases only and in no others, we enjoin that they shall be compelled to answer before the Chancellor. Moreover, we have diligently inspected amongst other statutes the commend able and beneficial one published by the said Chancellor and Masters, that no one shall receive a scholar who has not had a fixed master within fifteen days after the said scholar has entered the University, or who has not taken care that his name has been within the time aforesaid inserted in the matriculation-book of his master, unless the master's absence or legitimate occupation with business prevent the same. In fact, if any such person be found to remain under the name of a scholar, he shall be either expelled or detained, according to the King's permission. And although every master before he is actually admitted to be a regent is bound by his promise to maintain this statute, we have, however, ascertained that many of the masters have often incurred the charge of perjury, and have flagitiously violated their faith by defending some persons, as scholars, contrary to the purport of the said statute : wherefore, we being desirous to obviate the malice of men, enjoin that no one, under pain of excommunication, shall receive any one as a scholar against the purport of the 6tatute abovementioned, or shall in any respect shew favour to him as a scholar. I"], [100, "EDWARD THE FIRST. 58 And whereas the churches of our diocese are subject to us and to our Arch deacon, but the scholars of the same University are subject to the Chancellor abovementioned, we enjoin and order that the scholars about to become Priests shall be examined for their ordination in the presence of each of them, or of their deputies, and be approved or rejected according as they have been found compe tent or incompetent. And that we may not seem to neglect our duty whilst we encourage others in the practice of justice, we prohibit (on pain of excommunica tion to be incurred by any one actually opposing this regulation) the aforesaid Chancellor and University from ordaining or enacting anything, separately or jointly, secretly or openly, from observing or causing to be observed, such decrees or enactments to the prejudice of our jurisdiction, or of that of our Archdeacon of Ely, if we are not especially consulted or have not given our consent to such statutes, enacted or about to be enacted, for we decree that whatever has been attempted by any of them contrary to this our prohibition is vain and invalid. Moreover, whereas the jurisdiction of the aforesaid Archdeacon is plainly dis tinguished from the jurisdiction of the aforesaid Chancellor by the regulation of contracts as well as of causes and persons, and it appears that both are imme diately subject to us, we are unwilling that the said Archdeacon or his household be subject to the aforesaid Chancellor in anything, or that the Chancellor himself or his househol d be subject to the aforesaid Archdeacon in anything ; but each of them by virtue of his own peculiar authority shall correct his own household by reducing it to the rules of law, so that if the aid of a superior power be requisite in those things about which the Church passes judgment, recourse shall be had to us or to our Official.

Chu rches, Sic. \u2014 The following are specified : The church of Blessed Mary, in the patronage of the King ; the church of St. Michael, in the patronage of Matilda de Walda, by hereditary right ; the church of St. Benedict, in the patronage of Sir Giles de Argentyne, by hereditary right; the churches of All Saints, St. Peter, and St. Giles at the Castle, St. Sepulchre in the Jewry, St. Edward, St. John, and St. Botolph, appropriated to the Prior and Convent of Bernewell ; the churches of St. Clement and All Saints in the Jewry, appropriated to the Prioress and Nuns of St. Rhadegund; the church of the Holy Trinity, appropriated to the Abbot and Convent of Derham ; the church of St. Andrew without Bernewell Gate, appro priated to the Prior and Convent of Ely ; the chapel of St. Edmund, in the patronage of Luke de St. Edmund, by hereditary right ; the church of St. Peter, without Trumpington Gate, appropriated to the Master and Brethren of the Hos pital of St. John; the church of Bernewell, the advowson of which was given by Gilbert Peche to the Prior and Canons of that place. The parish of St. Rhadegund is mentioned, as is also the hamlet of Hawes, in the parish of St. Peter. Mills.\u2014 The mill held by the burgesses of the King is incidentally mentioned, and it is stated that the Bishop of Ely held one water-mill, and that another was held by Lionel Dunig under Sir William de Mortimer. Two wind-mills and two horse-mills are also mentioned. Bridges.\u2014 The burgesses were possessed of the oridge at Whittlesford ; and with respect to the Great Bridge of Cambridge, it is found that the reparation and re building ofthe same was a charge on the owner of certain lands in the county held by that tenure. This bridge was at this period in a scandalous state of decay. Fishery. \u2014 The burgesses had common fishery in the common waters pertaining to the town. Markets and Fairs.\u2014 The market is found to belong to the burgesses, who had also a fair in the Town of Cambridge in Rogation week. The following other fairs are also specified: One at Bernewell on the feast of the nativity of St. John the Baptist, for four days, belonging to the Prior and Canons of Bernewell ; one on the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin for two days, belonging to the Prioress and Nuns of St. Rhadegund ; and one on the vigil and feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, belonging to the Warden of the Hospital of Steresbrigge. Privileges.\u2014 The various franchises granted to the burgesses by Royal Charter are enumerated; and it is stated that they were also entitled to gallows, cucking stool, pillory, and other things which pertain to the execution of justice, and the assize of bread and ale. Grievances.\u2014 It is presented that the Chancellor and Masters of the University claimed greater privileges than were granted them by their charters, and especially that they, to the King's great damage, compelled by sentences of excommunication, the bailiffs ofthe town to take corporal oaths respecting matters which neither con cerned the King nor the office of Bailiwick : certain encroachments on the King's"], [102, "EDWARD THE FIRST. 60 ditch are specified, and the Bishop of Ely is presented for a purpresture upon the common pasture of the town, by filling up a certain ditch of the length of eight perches.

Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely, removed the scholars who had been theretofore maintained by him in the hospital of St. John to two hos tels, near the church of St. Peter, without Trumpington Gate ; and by an instrument dated the 31st of March in this year, he ordained that they should for ever be styled \"The Scholars ofthe Bishops of Ely.\" He also put them into immediate and perpetual possession of these two hostels, and of the church of St. Peter, with the tithes of the two mills thereto belonging, all which the brethren of the hospital before used to have, and to which ordinance of the Bishop they submitted. And that the brethren of the hospital might not be losers by this appointment he further ordained that they should have certain rents and several houses near to their hospital, which he had before assigned to his scholars.

Hereupon the friars appeal to the Pope of Rome, and both parties appointed their proctors to solicit their suit. But taking wit in their way, considering the costliness of that court, and the long journey thither, they remitted the matter at Bourdeaux to Thomas, Cardinal of St. Sabine, who accorded them on the following conditions : \u2014 1. That the Chancellor of Cambridge should retract his excommunications in the same place wherein they were denounced. 2. That no act of the regent house should extend to derogate from the rights of the friars. 3. That though by the statutes of the University, only the Chancellor (or some by him assigned) were to preach on the first Advent, Septuagesima, and Ash Wed nesday, yet nevertheless the friars might freely preach the same days and hours in their own convents. 4. That Friars Nicholas de Dale and Adam de Hoddon, if pleased to reassume their places in the University, should quietly be admitted, and should have their remedy against such who had offered violence unto them, as in such cases is usual against the disturbers ofthe peace. 5.

The Bishop at first hesitated about the performance of his episcopal functions in the diocese of another prelate ; but after some discussion, and on its being represented to him how injurious it would be for the University to remain without a head (more especially as a litigation was at this time going on between that body and the Prior and Convent of Barnwell, on the subject of a foundation of two priests to celebrate in the University), he confirmed the election, and gave his benediction to the Chancellor, (1) Rot.

The more important grants to the University were confirmed by a charter of inspeximus, dated at Clarendon on the 14th of February, and tested by ~W alter Archbishop of Canterbury, John Bishop of Winchester the King's Chancellor, Roger Bishop of Salisbury, John de Warren Earl of Surrey, Humphrey de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Essex, Henry de Lancaster, Hugh le Despencer the elder, Walter de Norwich the King's Treasurer, William de Montacute Steward of the King's house, and others. The King also granted \u2014 I. That the Chancellor, Masters, aud Scholars, might enjoy all liberties granted to them or their predecessors any previous, non user, notwithstanding. II. That in addition to the amerciaments imposed on regrators by the charter'of Henry III. they should forfeit the thing sold. III. That the provision in the said charter relative to the imprisonment of per sons inflicting grievous hurt on a layman, should be extended to lighter injuries. IV. That if die Chancellor of die University, for the time being, should suspect any scholars to be improperly kept in prison, the persons in whose custody they were should (at the request of the Chancellor, or of any Master deputed by him,) permit him to examine such prisoners, and the manner in which they are kept, as often as he should deem ii necessaiy and expedient ; and should also (at the warning of the Chancellor) correct all such defects and excesses as should be found. V. That clerks having lay fees, and being students in Cambridge, as long as they should continue their studies here, should not be put on any assizes, juries, or recognitions. VI. That if any scholar should be slain or receive any great hurt in the town or suburbs, and the bailiffs should be negligent in doing what to their office in such case belonged, the said bailiffs, and also the commonalty, should be amerced respectively. VII. That whenever the mayor and bailiffs should take their oath of fealty in their Common Hall, the corporation should forewarn the Chancellor of the day, in order that he (by himself or by some other person) might be present if he would, (which oath, as far as regards the scholars, should be, that they, the said mayor and bailiffs, will maintain, to the best of their power, the liberties aud customs of the University as concerning the keeping of the King's peace, and the assize of bread and beer and other victuals ; and that they will not wilfully or maliciously impugn the other liberties and lawful customs of the University), and that otherwise the oath of fealty should be of no avail ; but if the Chancellor, after being forewarned, would not be present by himself or his Proctor, the said oath should nevertheless be taken.

He also con firmed all privileges and indulgencies granted to them by the Kings of England, or preceding pontiffs or kings. (D \" One privilege obtained by this sanction of the apostolical see was, that those who were Doctors of the University of Cambridge might now read their lectures in any part of Christendom ; before they were con fined to their own schools, but this was a small part of the advantage derived from the papal favour. The University acquired a full exemp tion from the ecclesiastical and spiritual power of the Bishop of the diocese, and of the Archbishop of the province ; and those powers, as far as the members ofthe University were concerned, were vested in the Chancellor or Rector of that body.

They carried off many books, and other effects ; scaled walls, broke doors and windows, and committed great devastation. In the midst of the tumult they slew Walter de Skelton, parson of the church of Welton; and when a writ concerning the liberties of the University was presented to the mayor and bailiffs, the rioters seized it, and threw it in the mud ; and another of the same nature being fixed on the Tolbooth door, they tore it off, and trampled it under foot. The University immediately represented to the King, that unless such outrages were severely punished, no scholar could continue to reside in the place. The King therefore issued commissions (dated at York on the 18th of May) for the trial, by juries of the county, of Simon de Reefham the Mayor, Wm. de Thackestede, William de Sledmere, John Pourfisshe, and Robert de Bury, the bailiffs, and 319 others, amongst (1) Rot.

This year, Hervey de Stanton (whose family name was Aungier) Chancellor of the Exchequer and Canon of York and Wells, founded, on the west side of what was then called Milne-street, a college dedicated to the Holy and undivided Trinity, the blessed Virgin Mary, and St. Michael the Archangel. He gave to the Master and Fellows of this college (usually styled Michael House) the advowson of the adjacent church of St. Michael, which was to be their ordinary place of attending divine service, and subsequently added the church of Barrington to his other endowments.!3) In 1546 this college was surrendered to Henry VIII., who included the site in that of Trinity college, to which its endowments were also transferred. By letters patent, dated at Huntingdon the 28th of November, the King, out of his regard to the Chancellor and Masters of the University, granted to the mayor, bailiffs, and good men of the town for three years, certain customs upon saleable articles brought to the town. These customs he directed to be applied in repairing and amending the pavement, under the advice of the Chancellor and Masters, or those whom they should depute.!4) On the 21st of September, the King, by writ tested at Porchester, exhorted and required the good men of the town to raise 30 able foot soldiers, equipped with aketons, habergeons or plates, bacinets, gaunt lets of steel or whalebone, and other fit arms, to serve in the war with France.!5) By a subsequent writ, tested at Nottingham the 23rd of December, these soldiers were required to muster at Portsmouth, on Midlent Sunday (17th of March), ready to cross the sea at the King's wages. <e> A third writ, tested at Westminster the 17th of February, (1) Rot.

The Official required that he should shew a procuratorial authority, and also the resignation of the last Chancellor in writing. It was answered, that by the custom of the University, the election of Chancellor was without writing, and was notified viva voce ; and that the election to that office was biennial, without waiting for the resignation of the last Chancellor.

They prayed therefore that this grant (which they state to have been obtained by the mediation and counsel of Hugh de Spencer and Master Robert de Baldake, and by the solicitation of the kindred of the latter, then residing in the University,) might be revoked. About the same time, the burgesses complained that under the charters granted to the University, laymen committing injuries on clerks were punished, whilst clerks committing injuries on laymen, were liberated at the request of the Chancellor, without making amends to the parties aggrieved, for which they prayed a remedy. These petitions were referred by the King to the consideration of his Justices, who were to compose the differences between the parties ; and it seems the Chancel lor of the University was frequently summoned to produce his charters.

Then the University exhibited a bill setting forth in detail the excesses and tumults of which the mayor, bailiffs, burgesses, and commonalty had been guilty. After ineffectu ally craving copies of this bill, and as ineffectually excepting to the jurisdiction of the court, the accused stated that the insurrection was solely confined to the lower orders of the town, and the traitors of Essex, Hertford, and Kent, who came to the town in prodigious numbers ; that the mayor, bailiffs, and other gentlemen and persons of consequence did not take any part in the outrages, but had done their best endeavours to restore peace and order, and that all the delinquents who had been apprehended had been put to death, and the others had fled the country. To this it was replied, that the late mayor and bailiffs were always present with the malefactors agreeing and ratifying what they did, and it was intimated to the accused that they must at their peril, either abide by their answer, or plead only as to their franchises.

His arms were, Within a bordure argent, charged with ten lions rampant purpure, France and England quarterly, with a label of three points, each charged with as many torteaux. In the same Parliament the Chancellor and scholars presented a petition, complaining that the burgesses from ill-will caused certain of the scholars, who were guilty of no offence, to be indicted and convicted of felony, and that many scholars, fearing mischief to their persons and loss of their goods from such indictments, purposed to leave the Univer sity. To the intent, therefore, that the scholars might more easily live and study at their leisure, as they desired, they prayed the Parliament to grant, that commissions of the peace should from time to time, be issued to the Chancellor of the University for the time being, and to certain persons ofthe most worthy ofthe burgesses, and ofthe county without the precincts of the town : That scholars and their servants charged of felony and mayheim before the said justices, should be pre sented by sufficient persons, of whom half should be burgesses and the other half gentlemen of the county, residing without the town and precincts ; and that all indictments against scholars or their servants in any other manner should be void.

A condition, however, was annexed, it being provided that this decree should not be published or take effect, unless the Universities would agree that men of religion, being students in divi nity, might graduate in that faculty after ten years study therein, although they had not previously been regents in arts, and that scholars in the Canon Law might be created bachelors in that faculty, after seven years study therein, without studying the Civil Law.

The particular grievances of which they complained, are specified in four articles, of which, and ofthe answers ofthe University thereto, abstracts are subjoined: \u2014 COMPLAINTS OF THE MAYOR, BAILIFFS, AND COMMONALTY. ANSWERS OF THE UNIVERSITY. I. That whereas they were possessed of the right of hearing all manner of causes, of contracts, and trespasses within the precincts and limits of the town, the persons before named had attempted to deprive them of this right in a certain cause between Thomas Hierman, plain tiff, and Robert Bakere, servant of the Prior of Barnwell, defendant, for a debt of 25s. for six quarters of corn, by taking and imprisoning the said Thomas Hier man. I. That they had only acted as they had always done, agreeably to their un- doubted privileges. That as to persons being obliged to leave the town on their account, they asserted that by the vexa- tions ofthe mayor and his accomplices, particularly Attilbrigge, in exacting money to carry on their prosecutions against the University, many had left the town, as Page, Tesdale, Lovelorde, and thirty other scholars, and Brewer, Cowebrigge, and many other laymen, to the detriment of the University and col- leges, having houses in the town. As to Thomas Hierman, he was imprisoned especially because he had scandalized the University and scholars, by laying certain things to their charge of winch laymen had been guilty (as appeared by certain curates who came to have leave of the Chancellor to absolve certain of their parishioners, because in such cases absolution was reserved to the Chancel lor by papal privileges), and for denying the Chancellor's authority.

As to the schedule, &c. they de nied knowing anything thereof. That at the time in question, Fyshwicke was at York, and Markaunte in London, and that it was notorious, that at that time, many laymen were every night in the streets armed for jetting, (D (I) \" Ad jettando.\" To jet is defined by Nares as to strut or walk proudly, to throw the body about in walking.

That the before-named Thomas Cressale and others, had unjustly seized and imprisoned Robert Hierman, a com mon servant of the mayor and common alty, who was employed to serve a writ on Barkere aforesaid ; and because he brought his action for false imprison ment, they had banished him the town, and broke into his house that they might beat him if they had found him there: on which account he was obliged to quit tlie place, and could not attend his busi ness. III. That Robert Hierman was banished as a notorious disturber of the peace, particularly in maintaining common women in Steresbrigge fair, that he might receive from them the wages of their shame. That he broke open the Chancellor's house in that fair, for which he was cited before Thomas Lopham steward of the University and justice of the peace. That he grew from worse to worse, in wandering in the night and jetting. That his banishment from the University was not put in force, but he was permitted to remain in the town authorities cites this passage from Shakspere (Twelfth Night, act 2, sc. 5) :\u2014 \" O peace ! Con templation makes a rare turkey cock of him ; how he jets under his advanced plumes!\" He also gives an instance in which it is used in the sense of to rejoice, exult, or be proud. In 1 GOG a decree of the Heads was made \"for reforming hight jetters, keepers of greyhounds,\" Arc. (Stat. Acad. Cantab, p. 471.) In the preamble, mention is made of scholars who being but private persons, go forth into the town, pretending and abusing the proctors' authority, and of scholars who shoot in guns, cross-bows, and stone bows, nearhomeandin the neighbour towns ; and the decree forbids any to presume to usurp the said authority, or to go abroad to make the night scrutiny, or shoot guns, crossbows, or stone bows.

That there were many reasons for imprisoning him : one being that he sold putrid corn to an alewife, warranting it to be good, so that she was deceived, and the ale she made there from was so very bad, that it nearly killed those who drank it.(l) IV. That Henry Dunmowe burgess, having prosecuted an action for debt in AVestminster Hall, against William Hat felde, the aforesaid persons imprisoned him for forty days, and by their threats forced him to leave the town. The council directed that all matters in dispute between the two bodies, should be referred to the determination of four persons, namely, one clerk and one lawyer on each side, and that in the mean time, all proceedings should be stayed. The townsmen nominated Master William Alnewicke (2) and William Godered on their part, and after a delay which was much complained of, the University appointed on their part, Master Richard Holme licentiate in decrees, and James Strangweys sergeant-at-law. The arbitrators appointed the 10th of April, to meet at Cambridge to determine the disputes, but the event of their arbitration does not appear. Pending this reference, the two bodies continued to prefer fresh com plaints against each other. The mayor and burgesses in a petition to the Duke of Bedford, stated that certain clerks, armed in warlike manner, by night, broke the windows and rails of Richard Barix goldsmith, and of John Bilney the mayor, and beat William Weggewood and Robert Norres the mayor's servants, and Richard Parys common clerk of the town, and wounded and ill-treated one John Buste, who came out of his house to quell the riot. At another time they exclaimed, \" come out of your houses, you villians, whoremongers and scoundrels, or you shall be burnt in them,\" and there are charges for ill-using Robert Attilbrigge, John Knap ton, John Metham, and others. In another petition to the Parliament, the mayor and burgesses complained of the cost to which they were put by the delay of the University in appointing arbitrators, and prayed that unless they appointed arbitrators, they (the petitioners) might be remitted to pro secute their remedy at the common law, and that the Chancellor might mot banish any person of the town, without, the consent of the lay gentlemen of the town, according to the tenor of a composition between the University and town,(\") if he were not a scholar or clerk, under pain of losing a great sum of money.

That in the same year he arrested one Sutton a scholar, by writ of capias in an action of trespass, and imprisoned and ill-treated him ; and raised a general insurrection on that account, in which he and others would have been slain, had not the scholars saved them. III. That in the same year he let to farm to laymen, his hostle near St. Michael's church, although scholars were willing to inhabit it, saying to the scholars he in tended to live in it himself, in violation of the statute of the University \" De pen sione Domoru m,\"(3) and against his oath. IV. That notwithstanding he was sworn to observe the statutes, privileges, and customs of the University, he said he would not observe any statutes or customs unless they had them under the King's seal. This was said on the feast of St. Michael, on the reception of Iris oath from the Chancellor in the Tolbooth, publicly before all the burgesses. V. That, he refused to permit the bedels to collect amerciaments in tSe leet of the Chancellor; and when Thomas AVering bedel, took a distress for such an amerciament, he took it away, and threatened AVering with indictment. VI. That when Master John Rikinghale Chancellor of the University and justice of the peace, sent for him to the church of the Augustine friars, to allay his malice in certain matters, Bilney offered to fight him; and when the Chancellor threatened to send him to the Castle if he did not behave better to the University, he replied that it was not in the Chancellor's power to punish him, as he (Bilney) had a hundred fighting men to resist the Chancellor. VII. That whilst in office, he did not assist the Chancellor in chastising pertur bers of the peace. That he encouraged the scholars to rebel against the Chancellor, and laboured by Attjlbrigge and others, to make divisions in the University between the various faculties aud countries, insomuch that by means of Nicholas Hauke, one of his partisans, a noblemen was slain by certain scholars in jetting, in order that they might be taken by laymen, to the defamation of the University.

Nevertheless, neither he nor any other burgess complained to the Chancellor or his deputy of any person in particular ; but he and other laymen, at his excitation, ahvays said when any mischief was done that the scholars had done it, insomuch that in the autumn of the 5th Hen. V. he caused laymen to go jetting in great numbers, and said they were clerks ; and in the Lent following, certain other laymen went jetting, and were supposed to be clerks till they were taken. And at the end of the town, a little time since, a smith was robbed and so nearly killed that he was left for dead; which action was imputed to the clerks, until the smith accused two or three laymen, who were afterwards hanged for it. XI. That under colour of a grant of return of all writs touching the burgesses, he incited the townsmen to take out writs of capias, and thereon to arrest and outlaw scholars and their servants, contrary to what had been used to be done by Robert Goodrich,(l) and other mayors. That he arrested two friars, doctors in divinity, viz. Nicholas Swafham and Thomas Cressale, and two scholars' servants, and refused to release them from prison till they paid certain sums for their redemp tion, although fines and redemptions, &c, where scholars were parties, belonged to the University by royal grant.

That he falsely asserted to the King's council in certain articles, that he had the power to hold plea of all trespasses and contracts in the town and suburbs, although the Chancellor had that power where a master, scholar, or scholar's servant was party ; and that he attempted by these false pretences to obtain a grant for hearing suits as to debts for victuals. XX. That he executed a writ in Hierman's case, notwithstanding an injunction to the contrary from the Chancellor of England, the Duke of Exeter, and the Earl of AVestmoreland. XXI. That he in pleading, falsely asserted that Thomas Cressale prior of the order of friars hermits of St. Augustine, and his fellows, broke into the house of Robert Hierman, and procured persons to slay him (Bilney).

That if the Chancellor had not the power of banishing laymen, or if those banished should be protected by the mayor, then persons expelled from Oxford might reside in Cambridge, contrary to the statutes ofthe University/ 1) Articles were also exhibited against Robert Attilbrigge for exciting suits between the scholars and the laymen.

He was also charged with threatening to make the Chancellor and his officers clerks convict, in consequence of which threats, they durst not enforce their right of keeping the assize of bread &c. and it was alleged, that many by like threats of being indicted for felony, to the number of thirty scholars of the northern parts, had been driven to leave the University, whilst heavy fines were extorted from others, and that although the Chancellor, Proctors, &c. had in the first year ofthe King's reign risked their lives to save this Attilbrigge, Gerveis, Cappe and others ofthe town harmless, by banish ing Tesdale, Page and Lovelorde, and making others pay fines &c. so that peace was restored and a pretended reconciliation effected, yet he (Attilbrigge) and his accomplices, afterwards indicted for felony the very persons of whom they had received these fines/3) 1421.

In a chapter of the Augustine order, held this year at the monastery of St. James near Northampton, the visitors of the respective Arch deaconries made returns of the abbots and priors who had made default in sending scholars to the Universities. AVhereupon the King, at the solicitation of William Westkar, D.D. sent letters to the presidents, prelates, and procurators of the order, for the foundation of a College of our Lady, and ordered a levy of the penalties incurred by not send ing scholars to the Universities/2) On the grant of every tenth and fifteenth, the town of Cambridge paid \u00a346. 12s. 2id. ; the mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty now com plained to the King, that they were yearly chargeable to him for the farm ofthe town \u00a370. in addition to \u00a38.

That towards these charges they had not in farms, rents, and other casualties, above \u00a340. yearly in certain. That many places, late mansions, had been approved to King's College. That other places, sometime mansions inhabited with people and chargeable, were then unoccupied. That others late inhabited with craftsmen and chargeable, were then occupied by scholars, and so not chargeable. That for these causes great part of the craftsmen dwelling in the town had departed, and others were about to do so, to the im poverishing of the town, and probably to its utter destruction, unless his Majesty gave his gracious succour and relief. The King therefore, in consideration of these circumstances, granted by letters patent dated the 18th of July, that on all future parliamentary grants of tenths and fifteenths, the town should pay only \u00a320. for a whole tenth and fifteenth, and so on in proportion/3) The statutes of King's College were accepted on the 20th of July in this year/-*) One clause permits the\" election by the choristers of a boy-bishop, who might on the feast of St. Nicholas perform divine offices (except the secret mass), but who was however prohibited from doing so on Innocent's day/5) (1) Corporation Cross-book, 5.\u2014 MS.

On the 30th July, the Bishop of Ely, issued a commission for con solidating the parishes of St. Edward and St. John the Baptist, an agreement for which had been made on the 8th of June 1444. This consolidation took place in consequence of the reduction* in the number of the inhabitants of the latter parish, a great part of which was required for the buildings of King's college. The advow sons of the two parishes had been granted by the patrons, the Prior and Convent of Barnwell, to the King, who afterwards conferred that of St. Edward, upon Trinity Hall/') It appears that the King designed to have rebuilt the church of St. John,(2) but this intention was never carried into effect. On the 14th of December, writs were issued convening a Parliament at Cambridge, on the feast of St. Scholastica, (10th of February), but on the 20th of January, Bury St. Edmunds was substituted as the place at which Parliament was to assemble/3) This year, one Thomas Collage left \u00a340. to preachers of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, viz. \" to every one so long as the money lasted 6s. 8d. at a time, to the end that encouragement might be bestowed on divinity, which now was at a low ebb.'Z4) 1447.

If these verses are authentic, they must refer, not to the present chapel, but to the buildings connected with the first foundation, which doubtless occupied the site so long called the Old Court, immediately adjoining the Schools. It was subsequently to 1441 that the site of the present Chapel was acquired by the college (vide ante, pp. 191 192, 193.) With respect to the year to which the King's letter may be assigned, I may remark, that 1447 is the last year in the September of which, the title of Marquis of Suffolk could with pro priety be used, as that nobleman was on the 2nd of June 1448, created Duke of Suffolk, and"], [241, "HENRY THE SIXTH. 199 1447 A 8J had intended to have himself laid the first stone of the chapel of King's college, but was deterred from doing so on account of the prevalence of contagion in the town : \u2014 By the King.

After reciting, that by four several letters patent confirmed by Parlia ment, he had enfeoffed to the use of his will, certain prelates noble men and others, in divers castles, lordships, manors, lands, tenements, Src. parcel ofthe duchy of Lancaster, and of the gross annual value of \u00a33395. 11s. 7d. ; he charged the feoffees, that until the edifications and other works of bridges, conduits, cloisters, and other things began and advised by him in his colleges of Eton and Cambridge, were fully performed and accomplished, they should pay yearly \u00a32000. for those that the removal ofthe Parliament from Cambridge to Bury in Jan. 1446-7, was most likely on account of Cambridge being then visited with contagion. If this supposition can be admitted, the allusion in the King's letter to the pestilence that had long reigned in the University, will render the conjectured date almost certain. It is worthy of remark too, that in the King's will (hereafter cited) the annuity for the works at the college was to commence from Michael mas 1447. In the parliamentary confirmation of the site ofthe College in 1448-9 (vide ante, p. 193) is the following passage : \" Ordinantes et disponentes, eundem Fundum per easdem literas nostras, eisdem Preposito et Scolaribus, et successoribus suis, ad hos fine m et effectum dedimus, conces simus et confirmavimus, ac ad eandem intencionem, primeviim lapidem Ecclesie ejusdem Col legii, ad ipstanciam et ex assensu eorundem Prepositi et Scolarium in eodem Fundo, ad lau dem, gloriam et honorem Dei, ac beatissime Virginia Marie matris Christi, neenon gloriosi Confessoris et Pontificis Sancti Nicholai, propriis manibus nostris nupcrposuerimits.\" (Rotuli Parliamentorum, v. 164.)

When these expences could not be maintained by their ordinary revenues and annual income, the moveables of their house were sold or pawned, nor were their sacred vessels spared, or indeed longer sacred, but were sold and prostituted with their other furniture ; and when these would not satisfy (as'nothing is enough for lust and riot), their lands and estates were at last alienated or engaged for large sums of money.\" He adds, that ultimately \"the master and brethren were dispersed, hospitality and the service of God (the two great ends of their institution) were equally neglected, and in effect the house was abandoned.\" It appears the revenues of this housewere atits dissolution, but \u00a380.

The College was stiled St. John's College, and Robert Shorton was appointed the first Master.

It may be inferred he was acquitted, as the prosecution is said to have been \" of the pure malice ofthe townsmen.\"(2) There was a suit pending at this time in the Duchy Court of Lan caster, between John Pounfrett and others, tenants of Walden, and Edward Slegge and John Henryson bailiffs of this town, respecting the exemption from toll claimed by the inhabitants and tenants of Walden. A decree in favour of the exemption, was made in Easter term this year.t\") From fear of the plague, Easter term was postponed till the feast of St. Barnabas, and this year the commencement was held in the church of the Friars Minors.!4) Robert, prior of Caldwell, preferred a bill in chancery against the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses for the rent of \u00a38. 10s. per annum, pay able by them.(5> To this bill the corporation demurred ; but in Trinity term, Cardinal Wolsey then Chancellor of England, made a decree in favour of the plaintiff, who in his bill alleged that the mayor was so friended in the county of Cambridge, that he (the prior) could have no indifferent trial within that county by the common law. After the fall of the Cardinal, the corporation petitioned his successor, Sir Thomas More, to reverse this decree, which they stated to have been procured by the singular labour of the prior and his friends made to the Cardinal.(6) It appears that the Corporation obtained letters on their behalf to the Cardinal from the Bishop of Ely.U) George Foyster the mayor was excommunicated by Richard Croke, D.D. Deputy Viceehancellor, for maintaining the jurisdiction of his mayoralty against the liberties of the University, and refusing to come at the command of the Viceehancellor.

Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of those in authority to suppress Luther's works, it appears that by this time a considerable number of the members of the University had embraced the doctrines of the reformed Church. Many of these resorted together at the schools, and to the sermons at St. Mary's and St. Augustine's. They also held private meetings for discourse and edification, at a house called the White Horse,<4) which their adversaries nicknamed, Germany. The colleges in which those of the reformed faith seem to have been most numerous, were King's, Queen's, St. John's, Peterhouse, and Corpus Christi, Pembroke Hall, and Gonville Hall. There were several of the Augustine friars who held the same opinions, particu larly Dr. Robert Barnes the prior of that house, and Miles Coverdale, afterwards Bishop of Exeter/5) On the morrow of St. Dennis, there was a fire at Clare Hall, which burnt down part of the master's lodge and the treasury/6) On Christmas eve, Robert Barnes, D.D.

For this sermon he was accused of heresy before the Viceehancellor, and afterwards convened before Cardinal Wolsey and other bishops at London. The charges against him were embodied in twenty-five articles ; in one he was accused of having omitted to pray for the three estates ofthe holy church, and for not having made his prayer at the beginning of his sermon, \" according to the old custome, but at the last ende, and for the true knowlege of al christen men, makyng no praier to our lady, nor for the soules in purgatory, nor for grace expedient.\" The other articles set out the passages objected to, which appear to have been as follow : \u2014 1. If thou beleve that thou arte more bounde to serve god tomorowe, wytche is Christmesday, or of \u00c6sterdai, [or] of Whytsonday, for any holynes that is in one day more than in another, than art thou no faithfull christen man, but supersticious ; And S.

After these foundations laid, then did he read openly in the House Paul's Epistles, and put by Duns and Dorbel.\" At first however he opposed the Protestants, especially in a disputation with George Stafford, fellow of Pembroke Hall, on the latters proceeding to the degree of B.D. but he was soon afterwards converted \u2014 the reformed faith by the celebrated Thomas Bilney, (Fox, Acts & Monuments.ed. 1684, Hen. VIII. p. 435.) Perhaps he was the \"Mr. Doctor Barnes \" who in 1503, on the espousal of Catharine of Arragon to Henry the Eighth, then Prince, was appointed to publicly defend the validity of the marriage, and to read the Pope's bull, (Hardwicke State Papers, i. 13.)

It can not be proved by scripture, yt a man ofthe church shulde have so great temporall possessyons. But they wyll say, yf they had not so great possessions, they coulde not kepe so many servauntes, so many dogges, so many horses, as xl. or 1. and mayntaine so great pompe and pryde, and lyve so deliciously. 8.

Nowe because \" I myght do somthyng with the churche warden, therefore the poore manes wyfe came \"wepynge aud waylynge to me, desyryng me in ye way of charyte to speake to the churche \" warden for to be good to her poore husbande, wherby I was moved to sende for this my \"frende, his name is called John Drake, a man wel knowne in Cambrige, unto whom I spake \"in this maner : Contreyman, I am very sory to here of your uncharitable demeanoure, here \"hathe bene with me a poore woman wepyng _ wayling & cryeng out howe you have undone \" her, her poore husbande, & her myserable chyldren, for all they have not one bytte of bread \"towardes theyr fode, nor she is not able to labor.

Unto this he made me \" answere on this maner: Howe that thing pertayned not to him, but unto the churche. \" Wherfore he sayde that all doctoures of law dydde saye that they must sewe therfore under \" the paine of deadly synne.

Subjoined is a curious account by Dr. Barnes himself, of the pro ceedings against him in the University, and at London : \u2014 In ye yere of our lorde 1525, the 24 day of Decembre, dydde I make a sermonde at the request of the parysh, in saint Edwardes church, of Cambrige, out of the whiche sermonde dyd mine adversaries gather these articles,(2) whiche whan I knewe, I offered my seise to preach againe the sonday Mowing, and to declare my seise, and my meanynge clerely. But doctour Rydley,(3) and Doctour Preston, chaplens, & kynsmen to the byshop of London found yc meanes, that the vicechauncelour did inhibet me to preache. But I coulde never knowe any reasonable cause why, but that alonely he saide, it shoulde be for my profile to holde my peace. And of this I was so content. Tyl at the last, that these foresayd docters with one maister Tyrell, gathered in wrytynge certaine articles,(4) and presented them to the Vice chauncellour, whiche sent for me, and asked me, what I sayde to those articles. I aunswered, that thei were none of myne. But certaine wordes, and sentences there were in them, that I had spoken, but that was lefte out, yl shulde make for my declaration. Wherfore I said they were none of myne, and that I would be reported by the audience. To this he sayde, that I shuld take hede what I denyed, for if they brought witnes against me, than must I nedes dye. I aunswered, that the wytnes shulde be false, for I never spake them. Then sayde he, I coulde not prove a negatyve. I answered, that I wolde prove the wytnes false, whatsoever he were. He sayd whether they were true or false, I must suffer for it, yf witnes (1) The reference to \"pillers and pollaxes,\" was designed as a reflection upon Wolsey, (see Cavendish, Life of Cardinal Wolsey, ed. Singer, i. 44,) and from the following curious statement of what passed between the Cardinal and the Doctor, it seems the former well un derstood the allusion : \u2014 \" My lord cardinall reasoned with me in this article, all the other he passed over savyng \" this _ the sixt article. Here dyd he aske, if I thought it good and reasonable that he shulde \" lay downe his pillers and pollaxes & eoyue them. Here is the heresye that is so abhomynable. \" I made hym answere that I thoughte it well done. Than sayde he, howe thynke you were it \" better for me (beynge iuthe honour and dignitie that I am) to coyne my pillers and pollaxes, and \" to gyve ye money to v or syxe beggers, than for to mayntayne the commen welthe by them aa \"I do.

Then I answered, & sayd, well, let God helpe, whiche knoweth all thynges. This was in ye universitie scholes, the dores shutte fast, no man beinge within on my party, but I alone, But of my adversaries partye was there doctour Rydley, doctour Watson/ 1 ) doctour Preston, and a doctour of law, whose name I have forgoten. Theire was also one mayster Fooke, & mayster Tyrell whiche was appoynted amonge them to be the presenter of these artycles. Nowe the Vicechauncelour when he coulde have no more of me in comunicacion beetwene us, he asked me what I wolde do, I answered, he shulde go his waye and set hym downe & heare their complaint. And I wolde make suche an answere as god shuld put in my mynde, He required me instantly not to cast my seise away. So he went and set hym downe, and I was called before hym. As sone as I came, then stoode forthe maister Tyrell Si presented a role, in the whiche were certaine articles (as he said) gathered out of my sermon, of the whiche some of them, said he, were contencious, some were sedicious, some were sklaunderous, and some were heretical. Whan he had thus spoken, Than sayde I to hym, Good M. Tyrell, wyll you presente any of these articles as heresye? At this worde spake the Vicechauncelour to me, Good mayster doctour, let that passe. Wyll you be content to submyt your seise ? Then sayde I, whersoever I have spoken agaynste gods worde or against the exposition of holy doctours, I wyll be content to be reformed, and to submytte my seise. But with this was not doctoure Rydley, nor doctour Watson contente, except I should adde unto it, yf I had offended the lawes ofthe church. But at that I stopped and sayde, it was to large, for I knewe not what they ment by the lawes of the church, nor I was no doctour of lawe. Wherefore I iudged it sufficient for me to be reported by gods worde, & by the exposicion of holy doctours, For that was my facultie, Than the vicechauncellour rekened, that it was sufficient for me. But we coulde not agre in a great space, in this thinge. Wherefore I sayde I woulde agree to al maner of lawes, that were not agaynst gods worde, nor saint Augustine nor saint Hierome, nor yet agaynst none ofthe foure doctours. So dyd it reste that day at this poynt, and no more was handeled. For in thys time was the hole body of the universite gathered together, and knocked at the schole dores, and sayd, they wold here the examination, seinge ye matter was manifest. And these few persons shuld not take auctoritie on them onelye to here, & to determyne suche causes. Than the vicechauncelour sent the bedyll to the doore, requiringe theym to be contente. But they were the more moved, and knocked sorer. So rose the vicechauncelour, & went him self to ye dore, & gave them as good and as fayr wordes as he coulde. But the conclusion was, they woulde not depart, excepte they might here this matter iuged, and as they saide it appertained to learnynge, And they were the body of the universite. So the vicechauncelour came backe againe unto us al, and saide, we must give over this matter for tlie universitie is in a rumour, & so departed we asonder. Than within two or thre dayes after, was I called into Clare hall, to ye vice chauncellours chamber, wher were also the forsaid doctours gathered agaynst me, There dyd they entreate me with good wordes for to he content to be ordered after Maister vicechauncelours counsayll. I did requyre that maister vicechauncelour wolde indifferently here me and myne adversaries together, And then if I had saide any thinge against learnynge, I wolde be ordered at master vicechauncelours (1) John Watson, Master of Christ's College."], [359, "HENRY THE EIGHTH. 317 commandement. Then sayd they, that it was done for my profite, that maister vicechancelour dyd not sytte in iudgment. For (as they sayde) they were all my frendes, and woulde be lothe that my mater shulde be herde in Judgement. For if there came any witnes againste me (as they were sure there wold) then were I but lost. I answered, what witnes soever shulde come to prove those articles as they were layd agaynst me, I wolde prove them false. For I had preached openly, and many lerned men were at my sermonde, and I doubted not but they wolde testifie the truthe for bothe parties. But than aunswere was made me, that yf thre witnesses came against me, than would not thre and twenty helpe me, for that was the course of the lawe. Then said I, This is a pituous case, that a man shall not be reported indifferentlye by his audience, seing it was in the universite, But by ii or iii false witnesses. Wherfore I woulde abide the daunger, and let myne adversaries doe theyr uttermost, yf I shall thus dye, I must be content (sayde I) I am no better than our maister Christ. Than was there manye wordes used, and manye daungerous ways shewed me, to have withdrawen me from this purpose, but I dyd stand faste in it. So they required me to goo backe into a chambre and they comuned together secretely alone. And at laste sent unto me the vycechan celour, whiche intreated me very soore to be content with their ordynaunce. For by his conscience he coulde not perceive, but thei were al my frendes, & intended to save both my name & fame, which thei culd not do, the law was so daungerous, onles I wold folow then 'e counsel], then asked I of M. Vicechauncelour, what theie wolde that I shulde do. For trueli saide I, these articles were falselie and uncharitablie laide unto me. He answered, that there shulde be no ieoperdie in the matter, I shulde be contented to graunt them. But unto that I wolde not agree in no wyse, wherfore I desyred hym to departe agayne unto them and I wolde come & make them a resonable answere. So came I in, makynge this protestation fyrste, Ryght worshypphill maysters, I trust you be all my good frendes, and have so moche charite in you, that you wyll not caste me awaye onles you perceyve a great saute and obstinacy in me, the whiche I truste you shall not fynde, for I dyd never intende to speake, nor yet to do, agaynst Christes holy doctrine. Notwithstandyng, seing that the lawe is so daungerous, as maister Vicechauncelour, and you have tolde me. Therfore I had rather put myselfe unto your charitie, then to stande to the danger ofthelawe. And for this purpose to these articles that he layd unto me thuslanswer: These articles as they do here stande, were never myne, nor I never intented to speake them, as thei be here wryten. But nevertheles I doe graunte, that there be many of my wordes & also a great meyny of my sentences that I dyd speake. Wherfore I do submyt my seise unto you, desyrynge you charytably to deale with me, and not to take my wordes to the worst sentence. As I had sayd thus and suche lyke other wordes, Than made they me to be sworene, to stande to the Vice- chauncelours determinacyon. At that I stopped a great whyle, but at the last I graunted to abyde by his determynation, yf it were not agaynst lernyng & charitye. And upon this the Vicechauncellour assoiled me, as they saide ab excommunica- tione iuris. Nowe had they there standyng unknowen unto me, a notarye which dyd make an instrument of al my agrementes. For I dyd not know, but that they handeled with me as frendes, and as private persones. And this instrument made by ye notary, was afterwards presented unto the court, for wytnes agaynst me, when 1 was brought before ye by shops. WHS UI UUglll. ucivic J ujjuvj.j.

And than sente up certeyne maysters, and bachelours of divinite to the vicechaunloure, requirynge hym that they myghte be admytted to here the examinicion of me, in as moch as they had herde me preach. Answere was made agayne, that there"], [360, "318 HENRY THE EIGHTH. was no suche matter in hand, but that they dyd handle with me frendly, to devise an ende moste to my profyte. By the reason of the which congregacion, we were compelled to departe asunder, as for that tyme. And so rested the matter til the space of a month. In the whiche tyme, doctour Watson and doctour Preston, at the agrement of ye Vicechancelour, wente and wrote a revocacion, and made it of every article by it seise, makynge me in the revocation to grant the articles as they were layde agaynst me. Addynge also to every article, that bycause some men had so understande me, therfore I shulde revoke yt article, As in ye fyrst article, where I had sayd after the mynde of saynt Hierome, that all dayes were of lyke vertue, They added, yt certayne men dyd take me, that I wolde have no holy dayes. And therfore I muste revoke that artycle as heresye. Item, where I had spoke in myne articles agaynst the gor gyous pompe and pryde of spirituall ornamentes ; They dyd adde, that certayne men dyd take out of my sayinge yt I wolde have no halowed chalyces, nor vesti mentes, nor yet any ornamentes in the churche ; And therfore I must revoke that artycle as heresye. And so in every one of my artycles where they coulde expounde a word to an evyll sentence or els ofmalyce make any mischevous or sediciouus sayinge, that layde they to me, & wolde have me revoke it, as thoughe it had ben my sayinge and meanyng. So that there was never an article, but that it was eyther heretycal, sedisious, contencious, blasphemous or elles piis auribus offensivus. Moreover, I had in that same place a good frende, the whiche wrote the same revocacion pryvely, as fast for me as he dyd wryt it for doctour Preston. The which man is yet alyve. Nowe when I had this thyng in wrytyng I called into my chambre, an eyght, or tenne, ofthe best lerned men that were in Cambryge, the whiche be yet alyve as farre as I knowe, savyng mayster George Stafforde and mayster Bylney. Of all these I asked theyr counsel], what they thoughte best to do seynge this revocacion was so uncharitably made, and thynges falsely layde unto my charge, which were not in my articles, nor yet coulde be charytably taken out of them. They al concluded, that it was neyther ryghte nor conscience, that I should agree to this revocacion ; wherfore afterwarde whaii the Vicechauncelour called me agayne afore doctour Rydley, doctour Watson, doctour Preston and mayster Tyrell, & delyvered mee this revocacion in his chambre, which I shuld rede openly ye sonday followyng in saynt Edwardes churche, and shulde saye neyther more nor lesse, then was therin wryten, ye & shulde also promyse, that yf I were afterwarde called forthe by any higher power spirituall, to be content, and suffer all payne, and punyshement, that he or they shulde laye unto me. Then wolde I not agre in no wyse to this determinacion, nor consent to these condicions. For they were neyther agreable to learnynge nor yet standynge with charitie. There were certain articles condempned for heresye, that were as true as S. Jhons gospell. And charitie wolde not that I shuld be blamed for that thyng, that I neither spake, nor thought, but alonly malicious personnes dyd take oute of my sayinge false meaninges. Wherfore here was a greate tragidie amonge them, For some saide, that I was pariured by the reason I was swome to abyde the determi nation of the vicechauncelour. And the other parte rekened, that my othe bounde me not, by the reson that it was so uncharitably made, the whiche was not their promyse to do : ye the Vicechauncelour him seise, thought it to exstreame. So that after many wordes the congregacion of them was dissolved, and I shuld make an answer within viii dais, what I woulde do. Now in ye meane season, dyd mayster Tyrell ryde to London, & found ye means (by the reason yt he coulde not opteyne his minde in the Universite, for I sayde I wolde appele from y\u00b0 vicechauncelour to the whole body of the Univer site) that the Cardinall sent downe doctour Capon, and a sergeant of _n_.es, called"], [361, "HENRY THE EIGHTH. 319 Gybson, which dyd arest me in the universitie, for to appere before your graces counsell/D So was I broughte up to London, the tuesday afore shrove sondaye, and on the weddensdaye at nighte after , was I brought afore the Cardinal in his gallery at westmynster, which toke & redde all my articles quietlye, tyll he came to the vi. There he stopped and asked me, yf a byshop myght have any more cities then one. I aunswered, yt a byshop was instituted to instruct & teach the cytie, And therfore he might have as niuche undemeth hym, as he were able to preache and teache to. And to that me thought Saynte Paule dydde agree commaundynge Timothe to set in every citie a byshoppe. wherefore I knew none other order but this, than sayde he : That in Paules daies, a Cytie was syxe or seven myles long, besyde ye subbarbes, And of that whole Citie, was there but one byshoppe. So lykewise nowe, a byshop bad but one Cathedrall sea, and all the resedue of the countrey, were as subbarbes unto it. To this I said nothing, for he wold herde me no more, but retoumed and redde forthe the articles, tyll that he came to the xxii article, where he founde his pyllers, and pollaxes. And there he stopped, & had a great dispu tation with me of them, as 1 have written afore in my articles/2) So at the last we came so farre, that I sayde, how these articles were uncharitably gathered out of my sermonde. Than he sayde you are defamed of heresye. I answered and sayde : I truste there is no good man that knoweth me, whyche will suspecte me, He sayd do not you knowe that there is a iumoure how that you be brought afore us for heresy ? I aunswered, that rumour is scattered by myne adversaries of malyce, and not of any occasion that I have gyven. He sayde I beleve that to be true, but how wyll you pourge youre seise : I answered, I wyll be bounde to brynge unto your grace xx honest men, and well learned, of good name & fame, that shal depose for me, how that I am not worthy of this infamye. Than he sayde, can you bryng me vi or x doctours of divinite, that wyl swere for you, that you are neither gylty, nor yet worthy to be suspected ? I answered, that it was not possible to bryng so many Doctours for me, seing there were no more but ij at my sermonde, & they belonged bothe to byshops, wherfore I supposed they wolde not testifie with me : But I wold bringe as many honest men, as shuld be required, & they shuld .be as well learned, and better than I, for to testifie for me. But he sayd, that wold not helpe for they muste be my peares, after the forme of the lawe. I sayd that was impossible. Than said he, you must be burned. I aunswered, howe I trusted to have more grace, and favoure at his hand. He sayd, he was sworne to mayntayne the lawes ofthe church and therfore he must folowe ye forme of the lawe. wherfore I shoulde take deliberation with my seise whether I woulde stande to the course of the lawe or elles submytte my seise to his grace. Now because I had ones submitted myself to the vicechauncelour, & I was thereby circumvented : Therfore I thought I wold now not be so hasty in sub mittyng myself: And therefore I answered, yt I wold submyt my seise to his grace, in any thynge that could be proved against me, that I had spoken, contrarye to learnynge. He sayde that this was no submissyon. And I woulde graunt no more. So after much communication, he concluded with me, and sayde howe that I was but a foole, and could not perceive, howe good he was unto me. wherefore seynge that I wolde be reported by my dedes therfore he had signed xv. or xvi.

As sone as they had them, than had they what they wolde, for I was nowe come in forther daunger than I wiste of, for now muste I nedes pourge my seise after theyr request, or elles revoke all thinges yt they layde agaynst me, as though they had ben myne, or elles I must nedes dye, after theyr lawe. The whiche thynge I than neyther knewe nor suspected.

And whether my Lorde Cardynall were myne ordinary iuge or not, wl other lyke captious interogations, at the laste they came to my first article, and inquired of me, yf all dayes were alyke. I saide, after the mynde of saint Hierome, that all dayes were equall. Then asked they me, if we shulde kepe any holy dayes ? I sayd, yes. And in this matter we had a great disputation tyll at the last my lorde of Rochester came. And he asked me yf this eommaundement, Sabatum sanctyfices, were a ceremoniall, or a morall precepte ? I answered, that it was a ceremonial, aledging for me S. Augustyne. Than said he, that I was not learned. But alwayes when they had asked of me a question, & I had assoyled it, so that they neyther woulde, nor coulde abiecte any thynge agaynst me, than was I com maunded alwayes to stand a parte.

So I desyred them to knowe, yf they had condempned any of my articles for heresye. They sayde, yea. I asked them whiche it was. They sayde they wolde not tel me more than was wryten. I aunswered, Alas my Lordes, the truthe is, yt to my Judgement I have spoken nothing but that standeth with saynt Augustine, with saynt Hierome, & with other doctours of holy church, wherfor yf it shall chaunce me thus to be condempned, & not to be taught wherin, I cannot tell what I shulde preaclie in tyme to come. The byshop of Bath answered, that I shuld take no care for that, for as for preaching he wold provyde for me. But I shulde alonlie answere yf I wolde rede this rolle, or not. I desired that they wolde fyrste point with theire fynger yf they wolde not speake it, which article they had condemned for heresy, And I wold be bounde to prove it true by saynte Augustyn or els by saint Hierome, or I wolde be taken for an heretike. To this sayd the byshop of Bathe, that yf saynt Augustine, & saint Hierome were here, they shuld stand to the determi nacyon of the churche.

Then saide I, I will not graunt to it, excepte I maye firste se it. Do as it shal please you. At this theie sat al stil, wone looking on ye other ; than the bisshope of Bathe comaunded me to departe asyde. So toke they theire counsel togethers. And at ye last I was caled agayne, and this was sayd to me. Sir ye shal have a man that shal rede it unto you afore, wel saide I, I am content. And so one of theyr notaries, a lay man, was assignede unto me, & we departed a litel aside, and there he began to rede. The yere of our Lord, such a daie of ye moneth, was one doctour Barnes convented before the bishops in Westmynster, for certeine articles, which were gathered out of a sermond, that he preached in Cambrige, of the which, some of them be sclaaunderous, some be erronyous, some be contencyous, some be sedicious, some be folyshe, and some be hereticall. whan that he came to this word heretical. I asked hym, whiche of them were heretical? He answered me againe, ye have harde what mi lordes saythe, I can make you no answere . Alas said I, shall I be thus condempned for an heretike and can not tell what is myne heresye ? Then saide he it belongeth not to me, speake unto them. W ell sayde I. Reade no more. So wente I agayne afore the byshoppes. And felle downe on my knees, and desyred them for the bytter passion of Christ, that they wold shewe unto me, whiche article they condempned for heresy, And than yf I wolde not be taughte, they shuld handle me after the fourme ofthe lawe. But to this the byshop of Bathe answered, Si sayde, I shulde chose whether I wulde rede that rolle, or els be burned : the one of both I shulde do.

But in very dede, and yf I had knowen, that there had ben so myschevous poyson, tyranny, & cruelnes, in them, as I founde afterwarde, I wolde never have redde it, to have dyed for it.

But the byshop of Bathe (our Lorde forgive hym) sought all the meanes yt he could, and used all maner of cruelnes to have destroyed me. Never theless, at ye last he delyvered me that rolle for to rede. Than was all ye people yt stode ther, called to here me. For in the other thre dayes, was there no man suffered to here one worde that I spake. So after theyr eommaundement that was gyven me, I red it, addyng nothyng to it, nor saying no word, yt might make for myn excuse, supposyng that I shuld have founde the byshops the better. After this, I was commaunded to subscribe it, and to make a crosse on it. Than was I commaunded to goe knel downe before the byshop of Bathe, & to require absolucion of hym, but he wolde not assoyle me, excepte I wold first swere, that I wolde fulfyll the penaunce, that he shuld enioyn to me.

The Court took up the matter, and although the King seems rather to have countenanced Latimer, as being friendly to the divorce of his Queen, yet it seems to have been considered necessary to put an end to all further controversy.

Pleaseth it your highness to be advertised, that arriving here at Cambridge upon Saturday last past at noon, that same night and Sunday in the morning, we devised with the viceehancellor and such other as favoureth your grace's cause, how and in what sort to compass and attain your grace's purpose and intent; wherein we assure your grace we found much towardness, good will, and diligence, in the viceehancellor and Dr. Edmunds, being as studious to serve your grace (1) It would appear that the King had previously \" sent to six of the bestlearned men of Cam \" bridge and as many of Oxford, to debate this question, ' Whether it were lawful for one \" brother to marry his brother's wife being known of his brother ?' Of the which Cambridge ' ' doctors Cranmer was appointed for one, such was his fame then in that University for learning. \" But because he was not then at Cambridge, another was chosen in his stead. These learned \" men agreed fully with one consent that it was lawful, with the Pope's dispensation, so to do. Strype, Memorials of Abp. Cranmer, ed. 1840, p. 4.

Upon Sunday at afternoon were assembled after the manner of the University, all the doctors, batchelors of divinity, and masters of art, being in number almost two hundred : in that congregation we delivered your grace's letters, which were read openly by the viceehancellor, And for answer to be made unto them, first the viceehancellor, calling apart the doctors, asked their advice and opinion; whereunto they answered severally, as their affections led them, et res eratin multa confusione. Tandem they were content answer should be made to the questions by indifferent men : but then they came to exceptions against the abbot of St. Benet's, who seemed to come for that purpose ; and likewise against Dr. Reppes and Dr. Crome ; and also generally against all such as had allowed Dr. Cranmer's book, inasmuch as they had already declared their opinion. We said thereunto, that by that reason they might except against all, for it was lightly, that in a question so notable as this is, every man learned hath said to his friend as he thinketh in it for the time ; but we ought not to judge of any man that he setteth more to defend that which he hath once said, than truth afterward known. Finally, the viceehancellor, because the day was much spent in those altercations, commanding every man to re sort to his seat apart, as the manner is in those assemblies, willed every man's mind to be known secretly, whether they would be content with such an order as he had conceived, for answer to be made by. the University to your grace's letters; where unto that night they would in nowise agree. And forasmuch as it was then dark night, the viceehancellor continued the congregation till the next day at one of the clock ; at which time the viceehancellor proponed a grace after the form herein inclosed ; and it was first denied : when it was asked again it was even on both parties to be denied or granted ; and at the last, by labour of friends to cause some to depart the house which were against it, it was obtained in such form as the schedule herein enclosed purporteth ; wherein be two points which we would have left out ; but considering by putting in of them we allured many, and that indeed they shall not hurt the determination for your grace's part, we were finally con tent therewith. The one point is, that where it was first that quicquid major pars of them that be named decreverit should be taken for the determination of the University. Now it referred, ad duas partes, wherein we suppose shall be no difficulty. The other point is, that your grace's question shall be openly disputed, which we think to be very honourable ; and it is agreed amongst us that ill that dis putation shall answer the Abbot of St. Benets, Dr. Reppes, and I, Mr. Fox, to all such as will object any thing, or reason against the conclusion to be sustained for your grace's part. And because Mr. Dr. Clyff hath said, that he hath somewhat to say concerning the canon law ; I, your secretary, shall be adjoined unto them for answer to be made therein. In the schedule, which we send unto your grace herewith, containing the names of those who shall determine your grace's question, all marked with the letter A be already of your grace's opinion ; by which we trust, and with other good means, to induce and obtain a great part ofthe rest.

The mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses complain and find themselves grieved by the Viceehancellor, masters, and scholars of tbe said University, forasmuch as the said Viceehancellor and proctors of the same University, accompanied with a great number of persons, use every year upon the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, to come to the Guildhall of the said town, and there, without authority or any com mission to them given or made in that behalf, usurp and take upon them, to minister a corporal oath to the said mayor, bailiffs, and other officers of the said town in their Guildhall, the said day assembled, to the manifest wrong and injury of the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses. Wherefore the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly prayen, that good order and indifferent redress may be had and made in that behalf, by your high wisdoms, according to the authority to your honorable lordships committed, fur by means of the said oath, no little trouble, vexation, and unquietness to the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses hath growen and ensued.

Item, where in the time of the noble King of famous memory [Henry the Third] for the good rule, peace, quietness, and maintenance of study in the said town and University ordained, and it was by his said highness provided, that every year after the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, within fifteen days after the said masters shall resume and begin their reading, as well the said Chancellor Viceehancellor, masters, and scholars, as the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses should assemble and meet together, which meeting to this day is called the Black Assembly ; and at the same assembly, that as well the said clerks and scholars, that is to say, five scholars of every county of England, and three of Scotland, two of Wales and three of Ireland, of the most sage and discreet, resiant within the said University ; and also ten burgesses, that is to say, seven for the borough and three for the suburbs, should be sworn every year at the said assembly, hinc modo tam clerici quamlaici, to observe and keep the King's peace and quietness of study, as irt a writing or cirograph between the said parties thereupon made, more at length is declared, and may appear/1) The said Viceehancellor, proctors, masters, and scholars utterly refusing to observe and keep the said ordinances and provisions on their behalf, do compel and command the said burgesses, that is to say, two alder men, four councillors, and two men of every parish within the said town, to take oaths before them, devising the said oath, in such forms as shall make most to their appetites and pleasures against the said burgesses. And in no wise will suffer any of the said masters and scholars to be sworn at the said Black Assembly, according to the ordinances before rehearsed, by means whereof, no little trouble, vexation, and unquietness, hath ensued to the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, and is not unlike more and more to ensue, if remedy the sooner be not provided; for the said scholars, being now-a-days in great number and multitude increased within the said town and University, and perceiving themselves not charged by oath in this behalf, be many times the bolder to make unlawful assemblies, routs, and riots upon the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses in the night-time, beating down their doors and windows, as of late time they have done, in the most riotous mariner that could be devised, against God's peace and the King's, so that the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses stand daily in great danger and fear of their bodies, lives, and goods. For remedy whereof, the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly beseech and prayen, that the said masters and scholars may every year be charged by oath and solemnly sworn, with the said laymen at the said assembly, called the Black Assembly, to keep the King's peace like as the said laymen be, according to the true meaning, tenor, and effect of the charters and grants there upon had and obtained : or else, that the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses may be discharged, and no more compellahle to be sworn at the said Black Assembly, according to equity and good conscience. 3.

And forasmuch, as by the said ordinance between the said parties heretofore made, no mention is made ne order taken, for the said persons, and such otheT like so disobeying and offending, as is aforesaid ; the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly prayen, that order may be taken in this behalf, according as by your high wisdoms shall be seen to stand with equity and good conscience. 4. Item, whereas in the charters and grants made to the Chancellor, Viceehan cellor, masters, and scholars touching the assize and assay of bread, ale, and other victual within the said town and suburbs, which at this day they do use, exercise, and occupy, is contained this clause following, \" Et licet major ballivi et alder \"manni seu alii homines dicta? vill\u00e6 et suburbiorum ejusdem de pr\u00e6missis seu \" aliquo pr\u00e6missorum de cetero se non debeant intromittere, Volumus tamen et *' mandamus, quod in pr\u00e6missis omnibus et singulis faciendis Cancellorio dicta? \" Universitatis qui pro tempore fuerit, vel ejus vices gerenti vel Commissario \"auxilienter pareant humiliter, et intendant, prout decet.\"(l) The said Viceehan cellor, proctors, masters, and scholars of the said University, upon these words \"pareant humiliter,\" usurp and take upon them to command the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, to appear before them, as often and whensoever it pleaseth them, affirming that the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses are bounden to come at all their callings and commandments, adding to the same, the pain of excommu nication : which thing, the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses trust and suppose was never meant nor intended, at the time of the said grants and charters made, that the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses should be made subjects and obedientiaries to the said Viceehancellor and proctors, or to any of them. Wherefore the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly prayen, that effectual declaration may be had by your high wisdoms and learning, of the true meaning of these words \" pareant humiliter et intendant prout decet.\" And what pre-eminence or autho rity the said Chancellor or his deputy uught to claim and use, by force of the said words, \" pareant humiliter, &c.\" For at all times heretofore, when the said Chan cellor, Viceehancellor, or their deputy, list to take displeasure or bear malice against the said mayor of Cambridge for the time being, he will by his high pre sumptuous power, cause the said mayor to be called and commanded to appear before him by one of his bedels, not showing or declaring at the time of the said commandment or calling, any manner of cause why or wherefore he doth so call the said mayor; and in case the said mayor appear not upon the said commandment or calling immediately, he shall be declared accursed, without respite or tarrying, saying and affirming, that the said mayor was called to assist and be present at the assize of bread and ale, which was no part of their intent nor mind, for they never have used to call the said mayor to be present with them at the said assize of bread and ale, by express words or knowledge before given, but after they have wrought a mischief or displeasure against the said mayor by excommunication as above, (1) Vide ante. p. 125."], [391, "HENRY THE EIGHTH. 349 then they defend and colour the same by these words, \"pareant humiliter, &c.\" saying, that by virtue of these words, the mayor is bounden to come and appear before the said Viceehancellor, at all his commandments and calling, adding there unto, pena excommunicationis, which is not expressed in that charter, nor in any other the King's charters to the said University given or made. And in case the said Viceehancellor, would call or give warning to the said mayor, to be present with him at the said assize of bread and ale, and other things mentioned in the said charters touching that point, the said mayor would give attendance with all diligence ; trusting that by his presence and being there, the common wealth of the town should the better be preferred, and also more indifferent order had as well in the said assize of bread and ale, as in other things specified in the said charters ; for where, at the time ofthe said grants made to the University for the said assize of bread and ale, the substance and greatest part of the said University, consisted in hostels, halls, and other small places ordained for students, which at that time were furnished of all their bread and ale and other victual, of the poor occupiers and inhabitants of the said town : now at this present time, the great substance and more part of the said University consisteth in colleges as well of old time as now lately builded, which by reason of their great riches, substance, and posses sions wherewith they be endowed, been waxen so politic and wise that they have provided brewhouses and bakehouses of their own, and so at these days the more part of the said colleges do brew and bake in their own houses, by means whereof, the officers of the said University give the less care and diligence to the true and just assize of bread and ale, but many times for lucre, meed, gifts, and rewaids do suffer great misusage in that behalf. And when any offences be made either by brewers or bakers, or other victuallers there, they do not see due and just correction for the same, as they be bounden according to the order of the King's laws, but for the most part the said officers take fines, and otherwise agree with the said offenders for money and other like things. So that the common wealth of the said town little or nothing is regarded or tendered on their behalf. Wherefore the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses eftsoons most humbly prayen, that good and indifferent redress and reformation may be had by your high wisdoms in the premises, according to right, equity and conscience. 5. Item, where the said mayor, bailiffs, and every of them been under the ordi nary jurisdiction ofthe Bishop and Archdeacon of Ely for time being, and for all manner of offences spiritual concerning the soul healths of the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses or any of them have alway been at the correction, punishment, and reformation of the said Bishop and Archdeacon of Ely, and their officers spiritual, according to the order and laws of the church. The said Viceehancellor, masters, proctors, and scholars, divers and many times bearing grudge, malice, and dis pleasure against the said mayor and bailiffs for exercising and using of their said offices and authorities within the said town (in such things as concern sometime the execution of the King's laws, and sometime the accomplishment of the King's pleasure and commandment, directed to the said mayor and bailiffs to be executed,) of their froward and malicious minds, have surmised causes and matters as well against the said mayor as against the said bailiffs and other burgesses ; and there upon have sent sometime for the said mayor, sometime for the said bailiffs or burgesses, by their officers and bedels, commanding as well the said mayor as other before rehearsed, to appear before the said Viceehancellor at such hour, time, and place as he list and appoint. And in case either the said mayor or the said bailiffs, or other burgesses, or any of them, having never so great let or business, about any matter touching the execution of their said offices, for the King or otherwise, do not appear at the very same hour and time by the said Viceehancellor appointed, immediately and without further respite, the said Viceehancellor will"], [392, "350 HENRY THE EIGHTH. excommunicate the party so by him called as above, be he mayor, bailiff, or bur gess, and thereupon without delay or tarrying, set up the excommunication upon the market cross, with rebuke and despite that can be devised. And when the party or parties thus unjustly excommunicate, have appeared, alleging his or their reasonable let and excuse, desiring and asking his or their absolution, like good christians and the King's faithful and humble subjects, the said Viceehancellor little or nothing regarding the learning of God, but more replete with malice than with good charity, hath utterly denied to minister absolution in that behalf, unless the party so by him unjustly excommunicate as above would be sworn upon a book to do such penance as he would enjoin him or them so unjustly excommunicate as above. Insomuch that one Crooke, Doctor of Divinity, as deputy to the Viceehan cellor ofthe said University, having none authority in that behalf, did excommuni cate one George Foyster, sometime mayor of the said town of Cambridge, because only that he did not come and appear at the eall and commandment of the said Doctor, the said mayor being then occupied and greatly busied in matters touching the town and his said office in that behalf. And when the said mayor came before the said Doctor Crooke, alledging his reasonable let and lawful excuse as above, in nowise he could be heard, but immediately the said Doctor, replete with malice and pride, immediately denounced the said Foyster then being mayor, excommuni cate by his pretensed letters set and fixed upon the market cross. Whereupon the said mayor being a very simple mail, unlearned and desiring rather to live in peace with his wrong, than to seek his remedy in that behalf, came to the said Doctor Crooke desiring his absolution, which in no wise he could have, unto such time as the said mayor upon the feast of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, within the church of the friars Augustines in Cambridge, holding a candle, the price of a halfpenny, in his hand, and kneeling on his knees openly before the image of our lady in the said church, at the commandment of the said Doctor Crooke, offered the said candle therebefore the said image as a penance. And after that done, before the said mayor could be assoiled, at the further commandment of the said Doctor Crooke, he was compelled and constrained to make a submission, which the said Doctor Crooke and one Thomas Hall Doctor of Divinity had before conceived in writing, and caused the said mayor to say at the instigation and bidding ofthe said DoGtor Hall : the tenor of which submission hereafter followeth : \" For the offence that I have committed against the University in maintaining the jurisdiction of my mayoralty against the liberties ofthe University, and refusing to come at the call of you Master Viceehancellor, contrary to mine oath and mine obedience in this behalf, I acknowledge myself guilty, and desire of you therefore absolution.\" Which submission, was conceived and devised only of a pride and malicious pur pose, to bring in note and precedent the said mayor to be subject and obedientiary to the said Viceehancellor, which is expressly false, for the said mayor never pro fesseth no such obedience to the said Viceehancellor, nor yet maketh any oath, by virtue whereof the said mayor is bound to come at the call of the said Viceehan cellor, as in the said submission it is falsely and untruly deduced and surmised. And over this, the said Dr. Crooke, then being deputy to the said Viceehancellor, of a mere displeasure, caused a public instrument to be made, under a notary's sign, purporting the whole process and circumstance of the penance done by the said mayor, with the tenor of his said submission ; and the same instrument hath hanged upon the common schools of the said University, for a precedent and note, to be shewed and declared to all strangers that thither shall repair, in perpetual rebuke and reproach ofthe said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses. 6. Item, tbe said Viceehancellor and proctors ofthe said University, of a further malice and displeasure that they bear to the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, in whom ne of -whom they have no manner jurisdiction spiritual as above, at another"], [393, "HERNY THE EIGHTH. 351 \u25a0time, did excommunicate one Edward Slegge, then being mayorof the said town of Cambridge, because only, that the said mayor would not banish and put out ofthe town, at their commandment and pleasure, one Thomas Slater, a burgess and common officer of the said town, no cause, reasonable or good ground why the said Slater should be banished and put out of the town, to the said mayor before shown ne in any wise declared or lawfully proven, save only it was the wilful mind and pleasure of the said Viceehancellor so to have it done. And over this, the said Viceehancellor and proctors not herewith contented, but minding the further vexa tion, trouble, and unquietness of the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, now of late days, did excommunicate one Edward Thompson, b.irgess ofthe said town, because the said Edward did serve one Richard Brashawe (a layman and an iunholder dwelling within the said town) before the King's justices of the Common Place in an action of debt, according to the order of the King's laws, surmising the said Thompson by his so doing, to have broken the privileges of the University, which could not be proved. Wherefore, forasmuch as in the said award and composition no mention is yet made, nor order taken, for such manner of excommunication as it is before said, onjustly, oncharitably, and without authority against the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses by the said Viceehancellor and his deputies, fulmi nate, promulgate, and executed ; by reason of which the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses been daily so sore vexed, troubled, and onquieted, that they been pur- posed rather to forsake the town and inhabit themselves elsewhere, than thus to continue in such bondage and thraldom as of long time they have been, the same mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly prayen, that convenient redress and remedy may be to them provided by your high wisdoms and authority. 7. Item, whereas Oswald Thompson cordwainer, the King's natural subject born within this realm, by force and virtue of the King's statute and ordinances heretofore provided and made the 20th year of the King's reign, commenced an action of debt before the mayor of the said town of Cambridge against John Weale and John Hasenor, alien strangers born under the dominion of the Emperor, which by the maintenance of certain of the University of Cambridge had set up houses and shops within the said town, contrary to the King's laws as above, and the said Oswald the said John Weale and John Hasenor arrested upon the same action ; the Viceehancellor of the University then being, called Doctor Watson, greatly favouring, bearing, and maintaining the said strangers in this behalf, called the said Oswald Thompson before him, and immediately committed him to prison, and there kept and detained him by the space of three days, in the most strange manner that could be devised, and still should so a continued unless he had withdrawn \u2022his said action. And so by fine, force, and compulsion the said Oswald Thompson was driven to withdraw his action as above, not only to the loss and hindrance of the said party and let of justice in that behalf, but also to the great prejudice ofthe said mayor and bailiffs, and in derogation of the King's court, there holden before the said mayor within the said town of Cambridge. 8. Item, where amongst other liberties and grants made to the said University it is contained as hereafter followeth, \" Quod si laicus inferat clerico gravem aut enormem lesionem, statim capiatur : et si magna sit lesio iucarceretur in villa predicta, et ibi detineatur quousque clerico rationabiliter fuerit satisfactum. Et si clericus inferat gravem vel enormen lesionem laico, incarceretur in predicta villa, quousque cancellarius universitatis ipsum postulaverit.\"(D And forasmuch as by the said grant is no manner provision had or made, for any manner recompence or other satisfaction to be made to the layman, for any offence or hurt to him committed or (1) Vide ante, p. 50."], [394, "352 HENRY THE EIGHTH. done by a clerk, but only incarceration till the Chancellor him shall ask, as is before-irehearsed, which incarceration hath not been so done, ne put in execution at any time heretofore, nor any manner satisfaction or recompence made to any layman, be the offence or hurt never so manifest or duly proved, but contrarywise, the same offence by high power, supportation, and maintenance of the masters and scholars of the said University, shall colourably be defended, and imputed to the said poor laymen, which shall rather be compelled to make satisfaction and recom pence, to the said scholar, than to receive any, as but of late it hath been seen, Wherefore the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly piayen, that order may be taken in this behalf accordingly. 9. Item, where the said Chancellor, Viceehancellor, masters, and scholars of the said University claim and pretend to have authority to hold two leets within the said town and University, at two several times in the year ; the officers and ministers ofthe said leets do not use the same, according to the order of the King's laws, nor as other lords having leets do, appointing honest and indifferent men, burgesses of the said town, to be of the quest at the said leets, taking the pre- sentment of the same indifferently, as from time to time they shall be made and found ; but the said officers and rulers, and other ministers, have heretofore used to let the said leets to farm, to au officer called a bedel of the said University, for a sum certain, which officer hath paid for the same yearly i. 10. sterling, over and above the fees and rewards which he giveth to the officers of the said leets; that is to say, to the steward of the said leets, 40s. ; to the under steward, 20s. ; besides the costs and charges of dinners and other banquets, made to such as been ofthe quests, and besides the daily service which the said bedel doth to the said University, having none other fee nor wages of them for his said service, but only the fee farm of the said leets ; all which charges, with the profits and advantages yearly coming and growing of the said leets, amounting by estimation to the sum of 40 marks or above, which sum the said officer doth yearly levy and gather, ofthe poor occupiers and inhabitants of the same town, specially freemen and burgesses, by reason of which great sum so yearly to be levied and gathered, as is above said, the said officer is partly enforced to use great exactions and false means, not only to levy and gather the said sum of money, for the -which he is bounden as above, with the costs and charges above rehearsed, but also with the profits of the same leets to maintain his own living : and to bring that his said purpose to effect, the said bedel doth yearly and from time to time, appoint and choose such persons to be of the quest in the said leets, as shall be retaining unto him and to the said University, and ready to accomplish all his desires and onlawful requests, and to make such onreasonable fines and amerciaments upon the said freemen, as by the officers of the said leets and the said bedel, before shall be to them limited and appointed : and over this the said onreasonable amerciaments in the said leets, notwithstanding the proctors and taxors ofthe said University, as clerks of the market, have used to call before them the said occupiers and inhabitants ofthe said town, specially burgesses and freemen, and for the selfsame cause that they were before unjustly accused at the said leets, the same proctors or taxors, of pure malice and displeasure that they bear to the said freemen, not only will surmise cause of forfeiture of such stuff and ware, as the said occupiers use and occupy, and so in very deed forfeit the same, but also commit the same occupiers to prison, aud there keep and detain them oncharitably, unto such time as the said poor occupiers have made new fine or fines with the same proctors or taxors, and either of them, for the same stuff and wares, for the which they were before amerced at the said leets, as is aforesaid. And nevertheless the said bedel hath levied and gathered the said amerciaments made at the said leets, as above, as well to pay the \u00a310. which the University ought to pay to the King, for their liberties ofthe assize of bread and ale, according to their"], [395, "HENRY THE EIGHTH 353 charters, as also to bear and sustain the charges above specified. Wherefore the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses most humbly prayen, that order may be taken in this behalf according to equity and good conscience ; and that such indifferent persons, hereafter may be appointed and assigned to be of the quests at the said leets, as by the mayor and bailiffs of the said town of Cambridge, for time being, shall be thought meet and convenient, both in honesty and substance ; and also, that the amerciaments hereafter to be found and presented at the said leets, may be levied and gathered by the said mayor and bailiffs, or their officers, justly and truly, according to the presentments made in that behalf; the same money to be employed toward tlie payment of the King's fee farm of the said town, by the said mayor and bailiffs yearly to be made, by reason that the assize of bread and ale, which the said mayor and bailiffs of old time had, is now taken from them, and given to the said University. 10. Item, the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses complain and been grieved, forasmuch as they having the said town of Cambridge, in fee farm of our Sovereign Lord the King, with al) and singular rivers, waters, fishings, pastures, feedings, aud all other commodities whatever they be, to the same town in anywise appertaining and belonging, as by the said charters and grants, more at large may appear ; the masters, scholars, and students of the said University, little or nothing regarding the said grants, by their extort power, and against all good right and conscience, do usurp and take upon them daily to fish , as well the common rivers of the said town, as the several waters belonging to the said mayor and bailiffs, which several waters, the said mayor and bailiffs, have used to let to farm in times past, for the sum of 40s. or 33s. 4_. at tlie least, by the year. And now the same waters can scantly be letten for 20s. ; by reason that the poor men which were wont to hire the said waters, cannot quietly nor peaceably enjoy and occupy the same, but been many times driven out of their boats with stones and other like things, to the danger of their bodies and lives. And many times, their nets and tow cut and broken in pieces, not only to the great impoverishment of the said poor men, but also to the great loss, hindrance, trouble, and unquietness of the said mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses. For remedy whereof, it may please your honourable lordships, to take order and direction, according to your most high wisdoms and discretions. 11. Also furthermore, as well the said masters, scholars, and students of the said University, as other laymen inhabitanting within the said town, and pre tending themselves to be scholars servants, and common ministers of the said University, bearing neither scot, lot, offices, nor other impositions or charges,belong ing to the said town, do usurp and take upon them, by extort and high power, not only to keep and feed their horses, geldings, sheep, bullocks, and other their beasts and cattle, upon the feedings, commons, and pastures belonging to the said town, which the said mayor bailiffs and burgesses have and hold in fee farm as above ; but also many times, at their liberty and pleasure, dig and delve in tbe said common and pastures, utterly wasting and destroying a great part of the same, to the no little hurt arid hindrance of the said mayor, bailiffs and burgesses. Wherein they most humbly prayen and beseech, that indifferent redress and reformation may be had, by your most high wisdoms in this behalf accordingly. And your said orators shall daily pray to Jesu in preservation of your said most honourable lordships .(1) From the accounts of John Fanne and John Richardson, treasurers of the town, for the year ending at Michaelmas, it appears that Thomas Brakyn and Richard Chapman received \u00a35. os. each as burgesses ofthe Parliament, for attendance from the 15th of January to the 25th of (1) Corporation Muniments. z z"], [396, "354 HENRY THE EIGHTH. 1532*1 33 J March, and from the 10th of April to the 16th of May.

(\") At the Black Assembly, there were some disputes between the scholars and the townsmen, and the latter re-delivered to the proctors their bill of complaint against the University, with a new article added, and desired to have an answer with expedition and in writing. The proctors received it, and stated they would call the University together to have their advice, and this bill of complaint or libel was read at a congregation held the Friday after Hallowmas, when Dr. Buckmaster, the deputy Viceehancellor, read letters which Dr. Maye had brought from the Viceehancellor in London, stating that the King, the Queen, the Peers, and especially Mr. Cromwell, were very gracious concerning the confirmation and enlargement of the University privi leges. Dr. Maye also brought from London a copy of the town privi leges.(4) This year the University granted a pension of 40s. a year to Secretary Cromwell for his life,(5) and on the Friday after Hallowmas, a bedel was sent to town with the grant or patent, but it not being written to the satisfaction of the Viceehancellor (then in London), he sent the bedel back to get it better written and resealed.C\") \" Apon O Sapientia Day,(\") the Erie of Sussex lodgynge at ye Fawken \" was presented [by the University] with a great Pyke & Ele & a \" Tenche.\"(8) (1) MS.

One was served in St. Michael's church upon Mr. Peynell, who struck thepursuivant with aprocessionary. Dr. Buckmaster, the deputy Viceehancellor, sent for the pursuivant, serjeant, and toller, and threatened to punish them, and reproved the pursuivant for wearing his cap in his presence. At night there was a great fray at Castle End, Genyngs one of the bailiffs, Hugh Hare, and others, assaulting the proctors and their servants (whilst engaged in searching for a woman of loose character) with bills, staves, and flails ; several on either side were hurt. On the night of Shrove Tuesday, about thirty \"getters\" assembled on the Market Hill, and pursued Dr. Buckmaster to King's Hall, where he closed the gates on them, they threatening him without. On Thursday in cleansing week,(2) Dr. Buckmaster convened the doctors, masters, and presidents of colleges, and principals of hostels, at the Regent House, where he read letters from the Viceehancellor, which Mr. Paynell and other scholars sent up to London, bad brought from thence on the Sunday previous. These letters intimated that it was the King's pleasure that the Viceehancellor with the assistance of the mayor, should sit and enquire of the late affray, and punish such as should be found faulty, and that a command ment should be set up under the Vicechancellor's seal of office, requiring the masters, presidents, and principals of hostels, to see the peace kept, and to have their gates shut at a due hour, for that they should answer for all their scholars. On the following day, Dr. Buckmaster convened Genyngs, Hare, and others before him, for the affray at Castle End. Some ofthe parties submitted to be examined, but Gen yngs and Hare alleged that they had already answered for this matter before the King's council, and denied the Vicechancellor's jurisdiction.!3) The townsmen had in Michaelmas term submitted their articles of complaint against the University to the King's council, and the University appointed the Viceehancellor, Robert Swynburne, and Ralph Aynesworth to make answer on their behalf.

About this time, Dr. Haynes the Viceehancellor and Dr. Skyp (after wards Bishop of Hereford) were sent from the court to Cambridge, to preach in favour of the King's supremacy and against the authority of the Pope,(2) which was, however, stoutly maintained by a considerable number in the University/3) and especially by Oliver Prior of the Black friars, whose conduct gave great offence to Archbishop Cran mer.(4) A public disputation was held on the question, whether the (I) Dr. Lamb's Cambridge Documents, 34.

And chancing among his company to speak against the Pope, \" was in all likelihood to be put by his election. For this coming to the ears of Dr. Metcalfe \" the Master, Ascham was called before him and the seniors. And after grievous rebuke, yea \" and some punishment, open warning was given to all the Fellows none to be so hardy as to give \" him his voice at that election. But notwithstanding he had the good fortune to be elected, by \" the Master's means privately favouring him, as it seems, for his learning and hopefulness. \"Which himself relates after this manner: 'Yet for all these open threats the good Father \" ' himself privily procured that I should even then be chosen Fellow. But the election being \" ' done, he made countenance of great discontentation thereat.' And then he goes on to express \" his gratitude in these words, which I must take leave to subjoin in memory of that useful man \" and excellent scholar : ' This good man's goodness and fatherly discretion used towards me \" ' on that day shall never out of my remembrance all the days of my life, S:c.

For being persuaded that universities have been of old founded by princes chiefly for this purpose, that both the Christian people may be instructed in the law of God, and false errors (if any should arise) be altogether eradicated and dispelled, by the care and solicitude of learned divines : Wherefore meeting according to our custom, to deliberate on the aforesaid question, and on mature consultation comparing plans in what manner and order we should proceed with the greater certainty, to the investigation of truth, and the suffrages of all having at length been taken, the following office was required ofthe most learned doctors of divinity, bachelors of the same, and the other masters, that, having very diligently examined passages in holy writ and collated them, they should tell and relate what they thought to be adapted to answering the said question. Since, having heard, weighed, and discussed, after a public disputation on the said question, with mature deliberation, those things in the aforesaid question, which might establish or de stroy either side, those appeared to us more probable and sound, and also true and certain, and to convey the genuine and true sense of scripture, which deny that such power was given to the Roman Pontiff by God in scripture. Persuaded there fore by these, and meeting with one opinion, we have decreed to answer thus to the aforesaid question, and we do answer in these writings in the name of the whole University ; and in conclusion we assert that it is most true, that the Roman Pontiff has not greater authority or jurisdiction over this kingdom of England, granted him by God, than any other foreign bishop.
