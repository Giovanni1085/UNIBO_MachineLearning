REPORT. In pursuance of the authority vested in them by the City Council, the Committee proceeded, immediately after their appointment, to the performance of the service required of them. They engaged Lemuel Shattuck, Esquire, \u2014 a gentle- man who, from great familiarity with, and a strong interest in, the subject of statistics, they considered thoroughly qual- ified for the task \u2014 as their chief agent. In person, and by individuals acting under his direction, the work has been ac- complished; and the Committee have great satisfaction in submitting to the City Council the results of this labor, in the following pages. They have admitted some topics that were not originally anticipated, believing that, in furnishing a full and minute history of the condition of our City, some account of its early institutions and habits, its present means of happiness and progress, its advantages for mental and moral culture, its preeminent position for internal and for- reign commerce, &c, they were rendering a service of no in considerable utility to their constituents."], [12, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. IV That all minds will alike appreciate the importance of every branch of statistical information presented, the Com mittee do not expect. They trust, however, that every por tion of it will be deemed of sufficient value to meet the ac ceptance of their fellow-citizens. As a whole, it exhibits the City of Boston in a light highly gratifying to its friends, and encouraging to all who have any interest in its growing pros perity. The subject of statistics has of late attracted the attention of several of the enlightened governments of Europe, who have carried it in practice, to a degree of minuteness of detail far beyond that embraced in the following work. And it is easy to perceive that the lessons to be deduced from the re sults, may become the means of meliorating the mental, moral, and physical condition osman. The interchange of these statistical documents, (which it would be well to encourage) becomes the vehicle not only of general information, but introduces the brotherhood of man to a more intimate acquaintance with one another, and enables the citizens of countries however remote, to contrib ute something essentially beneficial to others of the human family. The Committee regret their long delay in presenting this Report ; and have to say, in explanation, that not only has the labor of procuring the elements of the work been exces sive, but sickness in the person and family of the agent has more than once arrested its progress. They now most re spectfully present it to the City Council, in the hope that it will meet their approbation and the approbation of their fel low-citizens. S. G. SHIPLEY, -} S. S.

To the Committee of the City Council appointed to obtain the Census of Boston. Gentlemen, \u2014 I have the honor to submit the following Report as the result of the investigations undertaken under your authority and direction. In discharging the important and laborious duty assigned me, I have not considered it suf ficient to give the mere numbers of the population. This is important, but in itself alone, without some collateral facts, it affords a very imperfect view, and is of little comparative utility. I have regarded the purposes of a census, when properly taken, to be in some respects a general survey of the people, embracing such facts and illustrations as would truly exhibit their condition, and their means of progress and pros perity, and as would suggest measures for their modification and improvement. Entertaining these views, the following topics of inquiry have received attention. 1. Historical Notices of the Population. 2. Errors of the National Census of IS 40 3.

Some of these matters were embraced in the Schedule au thorized to be used ; others have been introduced as important for additional illustrations. These topics have opened an ex tensive field for examination; and the mass of facts, which have been gathered, is so great, that abstracts only can be given. We shall endeavour to present the information in as brief, simple, and intelligible a form, as its nature will admit; and with a view to its practical utility. The abstracts will be accompanied by such explanations, illustrations, and de ductions, as will be likely to give more interest than usually attaches to mere columns of figures. Such accompaniments are deemed a necessary part of statistics. I. HISTORICAL NOTICES OF THE POPULATION. We have no -pre<_se account of the population of Boston, for nearly the whole of the first century of its existence. In 1638, eight years after its settlement, it was said to be \" rather a village than a town, consisting of no more than 20 or 30 houses.\" In 1648, the inhabitants being too numerous to meet in one assembly, formed themselves into a distinct church, and erected a new place for public worship in the north-east part of the town, being separated from the rest \" by a narrow stream [the Mill Creek,] which was cut through a neck of land by industry.\" In 1669, the inhabitants, having"], [19, "HISTORICAL NOTICES. 3 increased too much for two churches, built a third \u2014 the \" Old South.\" In 1675, the inhabitants were estimated at 4,000; in 169S, at 7,000, (both estimates were probably too large ;) in 1704, at 6,750 ; and in 1720, at 11,000. The first enumera tion now known was made in 1722, during the prevalence of the small pox, when Eneas Salter was employed by the select men to ascertain the number of the inhabitants, or as Douglas, the historian, says, to make \" a perlustration of the town.\" He reported 10,567, \" beside those who had died or removed out of the town.\" Of those reported, 4,549 were north, and 6,018 south of Mill Creek, now Blackstone street. Bonner's map of Boston, dated 1722, states that at that time there were \" 42 streets, 36 lanes, 22 alleys, near 3,000 houses, 1,000 brick, the rest timber, and near 12,000 people.\" This was probably nearly the correct number before the ravages of the small pox that year, when 281 persons north, and 490 south of Mill Creek, fell victims to that disease. In 1735, the population was estimated at 16,000. The town was first divided into wards in 1736, (N. S.) the boundaries of which are described in the Appendix (B. ) In 1742, a census was taken, of which the following is a copy : \u2014 (a) Ward. Persons. Houses. Warehouses. Colored. Horses.

The colored persons are included in the 16,382, leaving 15,008 whites ; but the report says \" 1 10 in the almshouse, and 36 in the work-house, are not included ;\" and \" we also appre hend that there are about 1,200 widows included in the above number, 1,000 whereof are in low circumstances, and a great number of other persons so poor that they are not taxed.\" Douglas remarks, that several beside were gone to Cuba, and \" several sons and apprentices were designedly overlooked, to ease the quota of Boston from tax.\" He estimated the whole population then at 18,000, \u2014 as great a number as the town contained during the subsequent fifty years. In 1752, a census was again taken, on account of the small pox, which gave 15,731, of whom 14,190 were whites, and 1,541 colored. The slaves in 1754 were 989. In July, 1765, a census was taken by order of the General Court, when there were found to be 1,676 houses, 2,069 families, and 15,520 inhabitants, as follows Males. Females. Total.

In 1776, it was said to contain 2,719 white inhabitants only ; many being dispersed in the country. In 1777, the whole number of males of 16 years and upwards, was 2,863, of whom \" 11 were Quakers, 7 belonged to the Castle, 188 were colored, 36 in Charlestown, Falmouth, and Newport, 200 at sea, and 543 in the army ;\" leaving a balance of only 1878; and \" of this number,\" says the record, \" many are old, infirm, and decripit.\" The following is a statement of the number of polls, and an estimate, which may be con sidered nearly accurate, of the population at the several periods specified."], [21, "HISTORICAL NOTICES.. 5 (6) From this statement it appears that the population of Bos ton remained nearly stationary for many years. It has been said that the new dwelling houses erected during this time, scarcely averaged one a year. The native inhabitants pour- ed out their treasure and their blood so liberally in the vari- ous Indian, French, and Spanish wars, in which the colonies were engaged, at various times prior to 1775, and especially during the revolutionary war, as materially to check the pros- perity and growth of the town. After the peace of 1783, the population of Boston began gradually to increase. The number of dwelling houses, from actual enumeration, was 2,178 in 1784 ; 2,235 in 1789 ; 2,390 in 1791; and 2,493 in 1794 ; not as many however as were said to have been in the town 70 years before. The houses in 1790, may be estimated at 2,300, and in 1800 at 3,000. From the account in 1789, which I have before me, it appears that there were Estimated Houses. Stores. Population.

The constitution ofthe United States provided that a census should be taken in 1790, and at the expiration of every sub sequent period of ten years. A National Census has been taken according to these provisions ; the sixth and last being that of 1840. The State of Massachusetts required a census in 1837 and 1840, for the purpose of apportioning the repre sentatives to the General Court, according to the new provi sions of the constitution then going into operation. And special City censuses were taken in 1825 and 1835, which, with the one taken this year, will make the three City cen suses at periods of ten years, each five years equally distant from the national decennial censuses. The forms, by which these censuses have hitherto been taken, have not been alike. In 1790, the only distinctions were the numbers of dwelling houses and families, and the white males under 16 years osage, and 16 and upwards, and the white females and the colored persons, without distinction of age. In the censuses of 1800, 1810, 1820, 1825 and 1835, the white males were taken separately from the white females, and in the different ages, as under 10, of 10 and under 16, of 16 and under 26, of 26 and under 45, and of 45 and upwards. The colored persons were taken without distinction of age or sex in 1800 and 1810. In 1820, their ages were designated, as un der 14, 14 to 26, 26 to 45, and 45 and upwards, for eaclrsex separately. The forms for the national censuses of 1830 and 1840 were substantially the same. The white males and females being numbered separately, as under 5 years of age, 5"], [23, "ERRORS OF CENSUS, 1840. 7 to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20, 20 to 30, and every subsequent decennial period to 100 and upwards. The colored persons were not taken, as they should have been, in the same divis ions of ages. In both censuses the ages were distinguished as under 10, 10 to 24, 24 to 36, 36 to 55, 55 to 100, and 100 and upwards. Several other particulars were required. The State census of 1837 required simply the number of the population, though, as taken by the City, the number under 4, of 4 and under 16, 16 to 70, and over 70, were specified separately as to the males, the females, and the colored. That of 1840 distinguished those under 4, 4 to 16, and 16 and up wards, each sex separately, but without distinction of color. The form for 1845 will presently be specially described. Tables containing the particulars of these several censuses, have been compiled and are given in the Appendix. (See Appendix C to J.) II. ERRORS OF THE NATIONAL CENSUS OF 1840. The particulars of the State census of 1840, as taken by the City, are given in the Appendix (H.) I have also given, from the printed copy, the official statement of the national census of that year, for the purpose of exhibiting two re markable errors which it contains. The other statistics ac companying that census, will be referred to when speaking of the productive industry of the City. One of these errors was made by transposing the total population, and all the facts and figures in the subsequent columns, of Ward eight (8136) against ward ten, and Ward ten (6702) against ward eight, making the aggregates of both appear very different from what they really were. This seems to have been an error of the copyist or printer. T,he other error appears in the number of the population of the City. The aggregate of the census taken in May, in cluding paupers and all others not required by law to be enumerated, was 84,401 ; and of that taken in June, one"], [24, "8 CENSUS OF BOSTON. month later, was 93,383, making a difference of 8,982. One of these aggregates must be erroneous ; and it is a matter of considerable importance to ascertain where the error lies. The number of representatives which Boston is entitled to send to the General Court, is fixed once in ten years, accord ing to the population. This renders it important that a proper mode of enumeration should be adopted, and that no errors, which would affect the ratio of representation, should be committed. This consideration has induced me to exam ine the subject with care. The population of the wards by each of the two censuses, (after correcting the errors of Ward 8 and 10 above referred to), and the number of persons stated to be \" employed in naviga tion of the ocean,\" stand thus : \u2014 X From this statement it appears that five of the wards showed a less, and seven a greater, population in June than in May, the principal difference being in ward two.

This led me to suppose that the error, if any, arose in enumerating the males. And to ascertain whether this might be the fact, the original manuscript copy of the National Census, in the District Clerk's office, and the State Census, in the City Clerk's office, were examined-, which contain the names of the heads of families, and the number of the families. The following facts are compiled from these documents. See Table (e,) next page. Here then we have the results of an estimated number of males in these wards, from which it appears, that in the 2nd ward 41 families contained 7,225 white males between 15 and 50, and 439 colored males, (7,664 in all,) 7,589 of whom are stated to have been engaged in navigation, or within 94 of the number (7,683) returned for the whole ward. Two families are stated to contain over 1,000 each. In the 8th ward 17 families contained 2,081, of whom 2,069 were returned, as engaged in navigation. I then examined the State Census to ascertain how many were contained in these same families by that enumeration, and found those in Ward 2 contained only 307, shewing a difference of 7,357 in those families alone !

It hence appears that the same errors were committed in this ward in both censuses, as were committed in Ward 2 in the National Census. From these facts, which the importance of the subject seems to re quire to be detailed, it appears that the disagreements between the State and National Census of 1840 arose from the modes of enumerat ing the seamen, said to belong to the sailor boarding-houses.

I am informed, however, that all were considered as \" inhabitants of Boston who made the house their home, or stopping place, when in port, whether present or absent ;\" and in making up the estimated number of the respective fami lies in Wards, 2 and 8, the census takers sometimes counted the names which had been entered on the books of the house for the previous three years ! Is this a correct mode of enu meration ? Has it before been adopted in Boston, or in any other place ? I have carefully examined, as far as existing records would permit, the details of every census of Boston, abstracts of which are contained in the Appendix, and no such mode of estimation was adopted until 1835. The males in Ward 9 (now 8) that year, were 1,490 more then the females, while in all the other Wards, except 3 and 4, the females exceeded the males. One of the census takers (the same person who took the State Census of the Ward in 1840) says in his re port, in 1835, that \" one of the difficulties they had to contend with was to ascertain the number of the floating population, particularly the seafaring men. These they have obtained from mutually questioning the inmates of the houses where they resided when at home ;\" and they further say that they \" are satisfied they have not erred in over estimating the number of that part of the population.\" Here then is the first introduction of this mode of \"\" estimating,\" not enumerating, the seamen. It was followed, as already shown, in the State and National Census in that Ward in 1840, and in the National Census, with enlarged liberality, in Ward 2. In the official census of the United States, a number \" em ployed in navigation of the Ocean \" is stated. And among the documents, annually printed by Congress is one contain ing the number of seamen registered in each port of the United States. From these documents, the following state ment is compiled. These figures are given not as worthy of much reliance as facts, but as matters deserving preservation in this connection."], [28, "12 CENSUS OF BOSTON. (/) This statement shows that Massachusetts returned nearly half of all the seamen of the Union. According to it, in Barn stable and Nantucket counties, where ocean labor constitutes the principal occupation, 1 in every 6 of the whole popu lation was a seaman, and in Boston 1 in 9. This maybe cor rect as to the former, but cannot be so as to the latter place. This mode of enumeration has not been adopted in any other place. The city of New York in 1840, with her ex tensive commerce, returned but 2,786 seamen, only 804 more than were said to belong to the 8th Ward of Boston. This clearly proves that they were not so enumerated there ; and the above statement shows, that they were not in other places. His Honor the Mayor of New York informs me that in taking the census of that city for 1845, \"such seamen only were enumerated as were considered actual residents, and hailed from this city.\" Neither \"temporary boarders belong ing to foreign vessels,\" nor \" those whose only habitation was the vessel to which they belonged \" were enumerated ; the law requiring the marshals \" to make actual inquiry at each dwelling-house, or of the head of each family residing there in.\" \"Persons temporarily absent, belonging here, were enumerated.\" It is certainly proper and desirable that all seamen who belong to Boston should be enumerated here.

The principle adopted, in the Census of 1845, was to take the names of, and lo enumerate all, who generally sailed out of Boston, and considered this place their home, whether born here or not, and whether present or absent. It was not considered proper to number persons as inhabitants, who go to a sailor boarding-house for one or more nights, and then leave, if they belong to Maine, New Orleans, or Europe. It would be no more improper to count the names of persons on the books of the Tremont House, or other hotel, for the last three years, and consider them inhabitants. It would be very easy to swell the number of the population to an indefi nite extent, in this way. The result of the enumeration gives 2,593 seamen as belonging to Boston, which comes within 193 of the number which New York returned in 1840. The number in each ward is given in the table (h,) page 15. To test the accuracy of this result, Mr. Daniel Tracy was employed to make a re-enumeration of the seamen. He was himself once a seaman, more recently keeper of the Sailors' Home, and now has a shipping office in Broad street, and is familiar with all the sailor boarding-houses in the city. He visited every house, and made 208, in Wards 2 and 8, less than our previous enumeration. In Ward 2, are 42 houses, the same number as in 1840, and 19 of which are kept by the same persons. In Ward 8, are 16 houses, 10 of which are kept by the same persons as in 1840. The whole number of seamen in Great Britain, in 1841, is stated in the census, at 184,081. Of this number, 45,915 only were counted among the population of particular places in the kingdom ; the others were set down separately. Lon don contained 3,841, of whom 292 were under 20 years of age ; and Liverpool, 4,288, of whom 516 were under 20. The mode of ascertaining the number of seamen, then adopted by that kingdom, was to enumerate all, at their lodgings, who slept on shore or in port, on a given night, wherever their place of birth, or wherever belonging. I ap plied this principle in Boston, and, in company with Mr."], [30, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 14 Tracy, made a third enumeration of the seamen at the sailor boarding-houses, on the 23d of October, (perhaps a favorable average time,) which resulted as follows : \u2014 In the 58 houses, in Wards 2 and 8, there slept the previous night, 632 seamen, of whom 36 considered themselves as belonging to Boston, though but 3 of them were born here; 267 belonged to other parts of the United States, and 319 belonged to foreign countries. This adds confirmation to what has already been said on the subject. On that day the following vessels, un der register, were in this port. <_0 The aggregate of these numbers is 117 vessels, and 37,839 tons, among which was an English steamer of 1,418 tons, If all these vessels were fully manned, allowing 20 tons to a seaman, 1,891 seamen would be required, and be in port; but it is well known that crews are generally discharged when they arrive in port, and often visit their friends in other places before shipping for another voyage. This will very much reduce the number remaining here. The number of vessels in port was larger then, than at any time after wards before the lst of January, 1846. One object in taking the number of people in a place, is to compare it with other places, and itself with itself, at different periods. The health of a people is partly measured by ascertaining the number of deaths, for a given period, among a given number of the living. It is obvious, however, that any such comparison in regard to a population, portions of whom are numbered in one place, while they are somewhere vned in loston. Owni parts id in other U. States.

When a merchant sea man dies in our port, his death is reported at our health office ; but when he dies abroad, it is not. Seamen actually in port might, perhaps, for this reason, be numbered. In further illustration of this matter, I have given, in the Appendix, the number of arrivals and clearances at this port, the tonnage owned here, and the imports and exports. There are many other things suggested by this subject, but in view of the facts already stated, the conclusion appears irresistible that the National Census of 1840 was materially incorrect ; and that 8,383, at least, should be deducted from 93,383, the officially stated aggregate ; and that the enumera tion of the seamen, this year, is nearly correct and gives as large a number as accuracy would allow. The population of the wards is accordingly corrected, as in the following statement : \u2014 . (A) From this statement, it will be perceived that 6,883 are deducted from the second Ward, leaving there 1,582 as en- gaged in navigation ; and 1,000 from Ward 8, leaving 982 as engaged in the same way.

They were therefore enumerated twice. The navy yard is in Charlestown, and the vessels of war sometimes lie there, and sometimes in other parts of the harbor. If any one dies on board these vessels, he is not reported at our health office, as the death of a citizen is, but is interred in Chelsea. It is clear, that the persons on board that vessel should not have been considered as part of the inhabitants of Boston, though they were so counted, in both the State and National Censuses of 1840 ; and 500 are consequently deducted from the population of the 4th Ward. The number under \" popu lation corrected,\" in the above statement, will be considered in this Report, as the correct population in 1840. III. MODE OF TAKING THE CENSUS OF 1845. The value of a census depends upon the extent and the degree of accuracy of the information obtained. Mathemati cal exactness in every particular is perhaps impossible ; but those means should be used, which are likely to secure the nearest approximation to it. Some of the censuses of Bos ton, hitherto taken, have contained important errors ; and it was deemed expedient to make the attempt, at least, this year, to obtain a correct one. The first and most important step in this matter was the preparation of a proper form or schedule for collecting the information from the families, to be used by the agent or enumerator. In preparing this schedule we have not been so much attached to old plans, as to suppose they were incapable of improvement : and have not considered it improper to avail ourselves of the experi ence of others, wherever found, who were known to have devoted much time and to have brought scientific knowledge to this subject ; and whose plans, when carried into practical operation, have been known to answer the purpose well."], [33, "MODE OF TAKING CENSUS, 1845. 17 We have already remarked that a census should be, in some respects, a survey of the social condition of the people ; and for this purpose, it should contain something more than the mere number of the population. Almost every census taken in the United States and elsewhere, contains other matters. Those who supposed that the schedule, used in taking this census, sought for information that was unimpor tant or too particular, must have misapprehended, or at least had an imperfect idea of the purposes of a census, and the means proper to be adopted to obtain a correct one. To be understood, this matter must be thoroughly examined and studied. Particular facts, not generalities, are what is want ed; and the questions proposed must be particular to obtain them. There was, however, a less number of particulars in quired for, than were embraced in the last United States cen sus, and other censuses recently taken ; and the order passed by the Ccouncil expressly authorized the collection of such other statistics, as might be deemed proper. The schedule, however, having features somewhat novel, and not hitherto used in this country, and having been a matter of discussion and criticism, it is deemed proper to present a copy of it in the Appendix, as intended to be filled up by the enumerators ( See Appendix A ;) and to make the following explanatory remarks. The enumerators were instructed, in filling up the sched ule, to insert from personal observation, the ward, street, number, and description of the houses, how occupied, &c. This information was sought in order to furnish the means of correcting any error or omission that might occur. The number of families in each case was inserted after taking the other facts concerning the population of each house. The first question asked was, \"Does the occupant own the house?\" The answer to this was considered a matter of interest and importance, as will appear in the developements of this Report. In asking this and other questions, the precise phraseology of the schedule was not always used, but it was varied accord ing to circumstances. The fact sought for being the object to be obtained. 3"], [34, "18 CENSUS OF BOSTON. In column 1 of the tabular form the figures 1, 2, 3, &c, are inserted for the convenience of the enumerator, to shew instantly the number of families, and persons in each family. Column 2 is designed for inserting the whole, a part, or the initials, of the name of every person. This was desirable for the two following reasons ; lst, that the enumerator might obtain every individual in each family, and be better able to correct any imperfection, error, or omission ; and 2ndly, that he may obtain specific facts concerning each particular person. The name of the particular person was designed to be known only to those who were concerned in taking the census. It was considered of little consequence, and was not regarded after the specific facts concerning a person, described by the facts, were obtained. The facts, not the names of the persons, were most essential. The aggregate facts were what were wanted ; but it is apparent, if the individual facts concerning each person are incorrect, the aggregate cannot be correct. The method formerly adopted for obtaining the numbers be tween specified ages, has been considered by some sufficient. The inquiry, \" How many in the family between 20 and 30 ?\" &c, or, \"How many engaged in navigation?\" might be an swered correctly by some persons ; but in a great majority of cases, errors would be much more likely to occur, than if given according to the present method. In this way a mere census of the population may also be taken correctly, more economically, and in less time. If the enumerator wished to obtain the census of a family correctly, according to the old method, he must first ascertain the age of each, and after wards classify them in their appropriate places in the sched ule. This is substantially the present method. The facts obtained by the old method, however, are too general to ad mit of any classification except the one originally made. Ac cording to the one now used, many different classes of facts may be abstracted, possessing a greater or less degree of in terest and importance. Abstracts will be given in this Report which it is supposed will show the superiority of this mode. In filling up this part of the schedule, the enumerators were instructed to insert, first, the name of the father, the mother,"], [35, "MODE OF TAKING CENSUS, 1845. 19 or other persons who were the heads of the family ; next, the children, beginning with the eldest; next, the inmates, board ers, or lodgers ; and lastly, the domestics. The 3rd column is designed for inserting in full years, the ages \" on the last birth day \" of the males ; and the 4th, the ages of the females. The ages of a population are among its most important elements of information, and form some of the best means of comparing the people of one place with those of another ; or the people of one place, at one period, with those of the same place at another period. A census in which the ages are not taken is comparatively useless. A people may be more or less healthy or unhealthy, efficient or inefficient, happy or unhappy, according as a greater or less number are found of one age or another. The ages may be elevated so high, or depressed so low, as to indicate one or an other of these conditions. These truths will be appar ent to all who study the laws of health, life, and longevity, and compare the operations of these laws in different places. And we trust the facts developed in this Report, will make their importance apparent to all in regard to Boston. A recent writer of high authority, says \"a minute classification of the ages of the living, in every locality, and in every class of so ciety, is indispensable.\" \" The collection of the ages of the living with all attainable accuracy, is an object the importance of which does not admit of dispute.\" Another writer of equal authority, says, \" The enumeration of a people would be very incomplete without a correct knowledge of the age of every member of the community. Age is the first element of mortality. From the cradle to the grave successive waves of individuals are swept along, and no estimate can be form ed of their condition as a body, whether as to education, oc cupation, or productive power, without this information as the first indispensable preliminary. But a comparison of ages at successive periods, affords a test of advancement or retrogres sion.\" This feature of the schedule has, however, formed the principal objection to it. Any inquiries, concerning the ages of individuals, has been deemed by some as impertinent ; and"], [36, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 20 a few have declined answering them. The government, for purposes of great public utility, wishes to know the condition of the people over which it exercises its control. Their ag gregate ages are one means of knowledge. It directs certain officers to obtain them. This cannot be done without as certaining the age of each individual; and this particular age cannot be obtained without personal inquiry concerning the individual. There might perhaps be some reason for withholding an answer to such inquiries, if made by an in dividual for purposes of mere curiosity ; but no possible reason, it seems to us, could exist against answering a gover nmental inquiry of this kind, having the public good in view. Some have objected to give this information, supposing that the ages ofthe people had never before been required, when in fact they almost always have been, though not precisely in this form. It has been conjectured, that there may exist in the minds of some persons, so great a desire for \"fictitious youth\" as to induce them to use deception, or to withhold their ages, through fear of destroying that fiction, or for other reasons. And some have supposed that these objections were peculiar to women \u2014 that undue anxiety to conceal their ages existed only among that sex. But this has not been confirmed by our experience. It is more imaginary then real. Many more men have objected to give their ages than women. The same results occurred in England in 1841, when the proportion of men was to the women nearly as 10 to 1. These proportions will apply to Boston ; that is, there were 10 men who objected to give their ages, where there was one woman. The number, however, who did object was so small, that the general result remains almost entirely unaf fected by it. The reasons for soliciting information to be inserted under the other heads of inquiry in the columns, numbered 5 to 17 inclusive, will be stated in the sections of this Report, treat ing of the Domestic Condition, Occupations, Place of Birth, Legal Voters, and Health, of the Population, where the re sults of the inquiries will be given. To these sections the"], [37, "\u25baMODE OF TAKING CENSUS, 1845. 21 reader's attention is particularly directed. No objections were offered against answering inquiries in regard to any of these matters. The 6th question, immediately under the tabular form, was inserted for the convenience of the enumerators to place the numbers of the families after they were recorded. The 7th, 8th and 9th questions were designed for obtaining valuable information. The enumerators were instructed to ask \u2014 \" Was there a marriage ? a birth ? or a death ? (either ?) in your family during the year, ending May 1, 1845?\" If answered in the negative, nothing further was said respecting it ; if in the affirmative, the particulars specified in the sched ule in regard to each birth, marriage, or death, were inquir ed for and inserted. The year ending May lst, was selected to conform to the law of the Commonwealth, which requires information on these subjects to be returned to the Secretary annually ; though the usual year would have been preferred, and would probably have resulted in obtaining more full in formation. Further remarks on these matters will be made in this Report under the head of Births, Marriages, and Deaths of the Population. The information to be elicited by the questions in regard to the supply of water, was considered useful at this time ; and the results are detailed in this Report. By examining the schedule, it will be perceived that the words \" yes \" and \" no,\" are placed after questions admitting of a positive, or negative answer. This was done to save labor. Instead of writing words in full, the questions were answered by merely making a mark in each case thus, \"1,\" after yes or no, as the fact might be. In the same manner, in the description of the houses, a mark was placed after brick or wood. In silling up the tabular schedule under \" Sex and Domestic Condition,\" \"Place of Birth,\" \"Legal Voters,\" Not Naturalized,\" and \"Health,\" the same mark was made, opposite the person's name in the column in which it ought to appear, according to the fact. (See Appendix A.) This mode of obtaining the facts, while it ensured greater accura cy, simplified and abridged labor, and was an immense sav-"], [38, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 22 ing of time. In its practical operation, it was found to fulfil all the anticipations entertained, when it was prepared. In questions which do not admit of a positive or negative an swer, the schedule is so framed as to require as little writing as possible. In most of the National censuses, the City was divided into districts, and the enumerator for each district, being provided with blanks, filled them out by personal inquiry at each house. In some of the City censuses, blanks were left at the houses to be filled out by the respective families. Hav ing known the operation of both methods, we have found, that it has been of little use to leave blanks at the houses ; many ofthe schedules were lost, few have been filled out, even when requiring as few facts as were taken in the State Cen sus of 1840 ; and those which were supposed to be filled, con tained so many errors, that the time consumed in correcting them, would often be as great as would have been necessary to have filled them out originally.* To insure correctness and uniformity in filling the schedules, it was determined to do it principally by personal inquiry. Few were consequent ly left at the houses. In some cases, in consequence of the ab sence of families in the country, or other causes, the enumer ators were subjected to much embarrassment, and were oblig ed to visit the houses or places of business of individuals several times ; or by other means to obtain the facts. Great labor has been expended to prevent any mistakes or omis sions. After the information in the schedules was collected from the people, notice was given in the newspapers, re questing any one who might have been omitted to give notice of the omission. Notes were received concerning 12 families, 8 of whom had been previously taken, though supposed by themselves to have been omitted. The following statement will show how our efforts were * Each blank used for the census of 1840, a copy of which is given in the Ap pendix (H.) required about one third the quantity of paper of that of 1845 ; and yet I am informed that there were printed 60 reams of paper then, and only 13 reams now ; a fact, among others, shewing the superior economy of the present method."], [39, "MODE OF TAKING CENSUS, 1845. 23 regarded by the people, and to what extent information was refused.

This statement shows, that in 56 families only, out of the 19,175 contained in the city, was information refused, which was sought for by the enumerators. The greatest proportion of refusals was in Ward 4. It would seem that there must have been something rather in the manner of seeking the information, than in the character of the information sought, which should have induced a refusal by so large a number in that highly intelligent ward. Other means were taken, by which the information, very nearly approximating to accu- racy, was obtained in regard to these families. Their refusal, therefore, does not materially affect the grand result. The people generally regarded the effort, to obtain full and accu rate information, with great favor ; and expressed not only a willingness, but an anxiety, to give the particulars fairly, honestly, and with exactness. Very few cases indeed oc- curred, where there appeared any design to deceive by false answers. This reflects high credit on the intelligence of the people of Boston. A law of the Commonwealth requires a return of all the children in the city, between the particular ages of 4 and 16, to entitle it to receive its proportion of the income of the public-school fund ; and those persons, who refused to give the information in regard to their families, may reflect, that they used an influence calculated to prevent the city from obtaining its just share of this fund. Having been entrusted with the whole responsibility of"], [40, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 24 carrying into effect the purposes of the Committee in regard to the census, individuals were employed as assistants, who were deemed competent to the discharge of the duties as signed them. Before commencing, they were instructed as to the use of the schedule and modes of proceeding; and were required to report frequently the results of their labors. The schedules, as they were filled up, were examined, re vised, and corrected ; and questions relating to particular cases settled. The whole number of schedules amounted to nearly 13,000. Those belonging to each ward were kept separate ; and the several classes of facts, amounting in all to several millions, were carefully abstracted, collated, and ar ranged, as they appear in this Report. In addition to the facts, elicited by the questions in the schedules, many other matters have received attention, which the order of the City Council, at the discretion of the Committee, authorized, and the results are also herein presented. Such is a brief account of the mode of taking the present census. As it may be a matter of some importance hereafter, to have the benefit of past experience, we venture to recom mend the general features of this schedule for future use, as one well adapted for the purpose, and better designed to secure fulness and accuracy, than others heretofore adopted. A different method of using this schedule might be intro duced. The census of England, for 1841, was all taken in one day; during which, more than 15,000,000 names, and all the accompanying facts, were entered in the schedules, in 35,000 districts, by 35,000 individuals employed. In this enumeration, every person was taken as an inhabitant of the house in which he slept the previous night, it being sup posed that the strangers present would equal the citizens absent. This mode of simultaneous enumeration mi-jht, per haps, be adopted here. In such a case, however, it would be proper to select a day when our average population was present \u2014 say in April or November, and not in July. And it would be necessary to divide the city into a sufficient num ber of districts to allow one individual to complete the enu meration of a district in one day. The people should be"], [41, "MODE OF TAKING CENSUS, 1845. 25 particularly notified of the day appointed, and the enume rators should be properly instructed in their duty. For the purpose of simplicity, and for avoiding confusion, all other statistics beside those relating to persons, should be collected by a separate schedule. Modes of estimating the number of our population have been sometimes devised. Two of the most prominent are the number of rateable polls ; and the names in Stimpson's Bos ton Directory. The Revised Statutes provided that a poll tax should be assessed on every male inhabitant between the ages of 16 and 70, except those persons, \" who by reason of age, in firmity and poverty, may, in the judgment of the assessors, be unable to contribute to the public charge.\" This had been the law of the State for many years before. In 1843, an act was passed altering the ages to include those only be tween 20 and 70 ; and in 1844, another act was passed in cluding all persons over 20, \"except paupers and persons un der guardianship,\" which now remains in force. These alterations will somewhat affect the relative proportions of the numbers. The following table is compiled to show the proportions these numbers have borne to the population at times when both have been stated. It shows that reliance cannot be placed upon these modes of estimation, though an approximate result is obtained. The changeable nature of a City popula tion affects the relative proportions of the polls more than in the more stationary population of the country towns. (0 4 POLLS. INAMES IN THE DIRECTORY. Years.

NUMBERS OF THE POPULATION IN 1845; AND ITS PAST INCREASE. The number of persons enumerated in the Census of 1845, was 114,366. In describing the mode by which this census was taken, some of the difficulties attending an exact enumeration have been mentioned. In a City population of a fluctuating char acter, and of locomotive habits, like that of Boston, these difficulties are far greater then in the more stationary popula tion of the country. I believe, however, that the results are entitled to great confidence, as being as nearly correct as could be obtained under existing circumstances. The par ticulars of the census are inserted in the Appendix (Table J. p. 18 and 19) and will be frequently referred to in this Report. The Increase of the Population since 1840, has been 29,366, or thirty-five per cent.; or an average annual increase of 5,873, or 7 per cent. By comparing this with previous enumerations, some inter esting results are produced. The population previous to 1790, has already been stated. The increase, since that time, in periods of ten years, according to the National census, appears to be thus : (i) This statement shows the least increase from 1810 to 1820, being 30.31 per cent.; and the greatest from 1820 to 1830, being 41.78 per cent. Combining the National and City censuses will shew the increase in periods of five years each, since 1820. ACTUAL INCREASE. INCRFASE PER CENT Years. Population. Total. Annual. Total.

There is however, a remarkable difference in the ratio of increase in these quinquennial periods. From 1820 to 1825, it was 34.60 per cent., while from 1825 to 1830, it was only 5.33, showing a difference of increase between these two periods of 29.27 per cent. And again, between the two periods, 1830 to 1835, and 1835 to 1840, there was a difference of 19.89 per cent. On the supposition that these several enumerations were all accurately made ; and that the National censuses of 1820 and 1830 were not too low, nor the City census of 1825 and 1835 too high, it is difficult to account for this apparent irregular growth of the City. Dur ing the year 1825, many mechanics were required to make the improvements near Faneuil Hall Market, and to build up portions of the City destroyed by fire ; and 1835 was the commencement of a \" Speculating Age.\" These circum stances might have produced a temporary increase. Whether there were other influences to interrupt the regular progres sion of the City I will not venture to say. The facts seem to be confirmed by the statements given in the Appendix, by which it appears that the polls increased 3,850, or 49.29 per cent, from 1820 to 1825, and only 1,436, or 10.94 per cent., (being 38,35 per cent, less) from 1825 to 1830. And again they increased 3,092, or 23.61 per cent, from 1830 to 1835, and only 1,508, or 9.31 per cent, from 1835 to 1840. The whole increase from 1790 to 1845, was 534 per cent. The demand for mechanical labor for the few past years, has un doubtedly added much to the present population. The polls ACTUAL INCREASE. INCREASE PER CENT. Years. Population. Total. Annual. Total.

Should the building operations become less extensive, this in crease of the population would be checked. V.\u2014 POPULATION OF THE WARDS AND SECTIONS. The City was first divided into wards in 1736. The number of wards then was twelve, and that number has since been continued. As the population of different sections in creased, a new geographical division was made, for the pur pose of proportioning to each, as nearly as possible, an equal number of persons. A new division was made in 1S05, 1822, and 1838. For the purpose of providing the means of com paring the growth of different sections of the City, the boun daries of the wards in each division are described in the Ap pendix (B. ) These alterations ofthe wards render it impos sible, however, to make a perfect comparison of their growth prior to 1838. Notwithstanding, it may be interesting to know the population of each, and it is consequently given in detail, in the several abstracts in the Appendix. The fol lowing statement shows the aggregate population of each ward at different periods, and the increase from 1840 to 1845. (0 INCR ASE. Ward. 1810.

The topography of Boston is somewhat peculiar. For the purpose of reference and distinction, it may be divided into geographical sections, as follows : Section First. All north of Boylston and Beach streets. Section Second. All the peninsula south of these streets to Roxbury. Section Third.

The outer boundaries of this section were fixed by successive acts of the Legislature, beyond which no wharf, or other improvements, can extend. This line is nearly reached, and space is not left for further extension. The principal increase of population in this section, for the last five years, has been in the southerly boundaries of Ward 9, near the United States Hotel ; in the vicinity of the Lowell Rail-Road Depot in Wards 3 and 5 ; and by over-crowding, in some instances, it is believed, to an injurious extent, in Wards 2 and 8, and in other places. Upon the kind of population which Boston shall contain, will depend in some measure its future increase. The de mand for business accommodations is so great, that dwelling houses have been torn down and stores erected in their places. This has been done to so great an extent, that it has been supposed the population in some wards, especially Ward 8, had decreased. The actual enumeration, however, shows a different result. Ward 8, allowing for the errors in the cen sus of 1840, already noticed, has increased 1,408 for the last five years. The number of foreign population was not dis tinguished from the American in the census of 1840, and a separate comparison of increase or diminution of either can not be instituted with accurate results ; but facts in posses sion lead to the conclusion, that the American population in Ward 8, and some other parts of this section, is less than it was in 1840.

The number of alien passengers which arrived at this port during the last five years, as will be shewn in a subsequent section, was 34,551, a considerable portion of whom are residents of this section. The density of a population is a matter deserving considera tion. This section, including all streets, wharves, &c, may be estimated to have contained in 1790, one inhabitant to 161 square yards; in 1840, it contained one in 39; and in 1845, one in 34. A section between Beacon, Charles, Pinck ney and Belknap streets, contains about one in 48 square yards. A section in Ward 8, bounded by Hamilton street, Humphrey Place, Oliver, Batterymarch, and Broad streets, and Washington Square, contained 3,131 inhabitants, or one to every seven square yards. In this section, each of the dwelling houses, many of which had within them stores, shops, and places, where fruits, vegetables, refreshments, &c, were sold, contained on an average 37 persons ! A more densely populated locality is scarcely to be found in any country. This section will again be referred to as the Broad Street Section. The first section of the City, especially the easterly part of it, is the great business emporium of New England. It is already occupied to a considerable extent by wharves, warehouses, stores, and public houses, for facilitating vast business operations. And should the country remain in its present prosperous condition, the business of this section is destined to increase in a proportion far beyond the increase of its population. By the great extent of the facilities of rail roads and other means of intercommunication, the whole coun try is made contributary to the growth of this section. It may be compared, in a limited extent, to the ancient city of London. That city \" within the walls \" containing 370 acres, and \" without the walls \" 230 acres, or 600 acres, (less than one square mile in all,) now forms the centre and prin cipal business section of the vast metropolis of the British Empire. The population in the beginning of the last centu ry was about 140,000, but space within its limits, having"], [48, "32 CENSUS OF BOSTON. gradually become more valuable for warehouses than for human habitations, it was reduced in 1841, to 54,626. The population without the walls was about 69,000, at the same time ; and 70,382, in 1841. \" The city within the walls,\" says a recent writer, \" must be regarded as one vast counting house or warehouse, where the banker, the merchant, the warehousemen, and the retail dealer meet, and to which no small number of consumers resort. The tide of population flows in large streams into the city every morning, and is again disgorged at the close of the day. The resident popu lation consists principally of the tradesmen of the principal streets, the tavern-keepers, inn-keepers, &c. ; the warehouse man, the warehouse laborers, porters, attendants, carmen, and drivers, and working mechanics of the clothing, building and other trades. In the city without the walls these latter are in still greater proportion. With them are found great numbers of hawking venders of fruit, fish, vegetables, &c, of general laborers, and of people who do not know, when they rise in the morning, by what chance job in the streets, or the markets, they are to get food for the day.\" This may be considered in some respects, a description of the easterly part of the section of Boston, now under consideration, an ticipating its condition a few years. It is destined to sustain relations to the towns and country surrounding Boston, simi lar to those which the ancient city of London bears to the more outerly parts of that vast metropolis and its surrounding country. Section Second. This section, embracing the present Wards 10 and 11, has an area, according to Mr. Lewis, of 520 acres, 230 north and 300 south of Dover street. It was formerly only a narrow strip of land, serving to connect the Tremont with the main land at Roxbury, and was known as the Neck. Large tracts of land on each side have been reclaimed from the ocean, and are gradually becoming cov ered with solid blocks of houses. This section contains 24,924 inhabitants, having increased 76.11 per cent, within the last five years. Of these 20,141 were north, and 4,783 south of Dover street. Ward 10 has increased 88.80 per"], [49, "GROWTH OF SECTIONS. 33 cent. The principal increase has been in the section easterly of Harrison avenue, and by the increased density of the foreign population, near Sea street and the upper part of Eliot street. The vacant land being principally occupied, this ward cannot receive a large future increase. In Ward 11, the increase has been 64.69 per cent., and there is a large quantity of land, owned by the City or individuals, yet unsold or unoccupied, which may be brought into use for building. Should proper sanatory regulations be adopted, concerning drainage and other matters which are sometimes incident to such locations, it will eventually contain a large population. The dwelling houses already erected, or in the process of erec tion, and the houses vacant, in these two wards, were, accord ing to the returns, 525, which, if inhabited by the average number in the city, would accommodate over 5,000 persons. Section Third. This section contains about 600 acres. It was annexed to Boston in 1804, having before formed a part of the town of Dorchester, and included \" Dorchester Heights,\" celebrated for their beautiful elevation, and their revolutionary recollections. It has a population of 10,020, being an increase of 62.24 per cent, for the last 5 years. Section Fourth. East Boston contains about 700 acres, and a population of 5,018, being an increase of 244.89 per cent, for the last 5 years. The wharves of the British Mail Steamers and of the Eastern Rail Road, are in this section ; and various other causes have combined, to give a most re markable impetus to its growth. Section Fifth. The islands, forming this section, will probably remain for some time to come, nearly stationary. Many circumstances have transpired to produce the rapid growth which Boston has experienced within the last few years. It is the central point where great plans have been devised for bringing into profitable use, within their own territory, the industry and skill, in aid of manufactures, of the New-Eng land people. Here is the centre of those vast operations, which have contributed so much to increase the population, and to enrich the laboring classes of the interior towns, as well as of the^capitalists. Thither the products of this indus-"], [50, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 34 try are sent for sale and distribution throughout the world. This alone, however, would be insufficient without facilities for transportation. And the same skill and enterprise which devised plans for employing the manufacturing industry of the country, devised plans also for easy intercommunication with its different sections. Rail roads radiating in various direc tions, and to hundreds of miles in extent ; and commerce extending to every part of the world, now afford means for distributing the products of our industry, and facilitating the operations of business, possessed by few other places, and not possessed by Boston itself, until within the last few years. These and other circumstances have attracted an immense increase of transient or permanent population to our city. It is impossible to arrive at precise results in this matter; but in the following statement, an attempt is made to show the number of persons who arrived and departed daily from the city, during the year 1845. The account of the passengers over the rail roads was received from the superintendents ; the other items were obtained or estimated by persons most competent to give the information. The Old Colony Rail Road was opened too late in the year to be included, and some branches of other roads were not opened during the whole year, or are not included at all. Mode or Conveyance.

It is supposed that 40 per cent, of these passengers come into the city, 40 per cent. go out, and 20 per cent, are \"way passengers.\" From these facts, it is fair to estimate that the population of the city is increased daily about 8,000, or 7 per cent, nearly, by the influx of transient persons ; and in some seasons, it is very much larger than the yearly average. What a contrast this presents to the picture of the town 50 years since ! The Boston Directory of 1796 says, \" Eight years ago the intercourse with the country barely required 2 stages and 12 horses on the great road between this and New Haven, distant 164 miles ; whereas there are now 20 carriages and 100 horses employed. The number of stages that run, through the week, from this town, is upwards of 20 ; eight years ago there were only 3.\" The growth of Boston and its increase of business, pro duce a corresponding, and even greater growth, in all the surrounding towns, and in places on the rail roads, easily accessible from the city. We have collected many facts in relation to these matters, and present the subjoined state ment, concerning the towns immediately adjoining Boston, and a few others on the rail roads, showing their population and increase for the last five years. These facts show a growth of those towns unparalleled in their history. Towns adjoining Boston. Census of 1840. Population. Increase. State. National. 1.45. Number. Per cent.

The future increase of Boston is so dependent on the prosperity of the country generally, on the amount of land within its limits which shall be reclaimed from the ocean, on the kind and density of the population, and on other circumstances, that any calculations of the per centage of increase must be very hypothetical. The facts above presented, may afford means of forming some approximate conclusions on the subject. VI. PLACES OF BIRTH OF THE POPULATION. The birth places of a population are quite interesting and important. In instituting our inquiries on this subject, three distinctions only were made. 1st, of those who were born in Boston ; 2d, those who were not born in Boston, but in other parts of the United States ; and 3d, those who were not born in the United States. Other distinctions might have been made, and it is a matter of regret that they were not, since the people generally gave to the enumerators the particular places of their birth. It is a matter of conse quence to know how many persons were born in the city or town in which they reside, as showing what influence dif ferent localities have on life, health, and longevity. The value of the census of New York, taken this year, would have been greatly enhanced, if that distinction had been made. There was not, however, a more particular distinc tion made, than those \"born in the Stale of New York.\" The mode of personal inquiry adopted enables us to make a distinction of those under, and of those over 20 years of age ; and ofthe children of Americans and foreigners. The an swers to the question \u2014 \"How many in a family were born in a place?\" give a very imperfect view of the population, without a statement of the age and specific individual to whom the facts apply. In making the abstracts, we have preserved these distinctions, and have given the result in the Appendix,"], [53, "PLACES OF BIRTH. 37 (Table K, p. 20.) From this table the following statement is derived, showing the number, and proportion per cent. of each class of persons. (o) These facts are very remarkable , and show that 35. 92 per cent., a little over one third of our population, are native born; and of these, 26.16 per cent, are under 20 years of age, and 9.76 per cent, only over 20! the remainder being emigrants from other places in the United States, or from foreign countries. The foreigners and their children are 37,289, or 32.61 per cent, of the whole population ! The foreigners under 20 were 16,370, being 35.29 per cent, of the population of that age, showing a greater proportion than that of all ages. Some other of these results are full of interest, and the whole table should command grave perusal. The facts confirm the truth of the remark often made, that a large ma jority of the active business men of Boston are from the country, \u2014 men who have copie to this metropolis to seek their fortunes, bringing with them the economical habits, the industry, the energy, and the perseverance, which are pecu liar to the people of the interior towns of New England. The foreign population is found to be greater than has been generally supposed. The interest which attaches to this subject will justify further investigation and detail. Among the statistical papers published annually by Con gress, is one containing the number of passengers which arrive at the different ports of the United States, from foreign countries. Though containing many errors, these docu- It* BACH 100 THERE WERE IMRER. CLASSES OF PERSONS. Born in Boston, of American parents, Born in Boston, of foreign parents, Born in U.

The fol lowing tables are compiled from these publications, and from information obtained at our custom house, in relation to the passengers, who arrived at this port during the last eleven years. Table (\u00bb) shows the number of passengers which arrived, distinguishing the sex, and the places of birth, whether born in the United States, in Great Britain, in British America, or in other foreign parts. (p) From this statement, it appears that 59,444 passengers arrived at this port during the last eleven years. Of those whose sex is stated, 35,787, or 62.69 per cent., were males; and 21,301, or 37.31 per cent., were females. Of those whose place of birth is stated, 13,074, or 22.62 per cent., belonged to the United States; 31,118, or 53.85 per cent., to Great Britain ; 10,302, or 17.83 per cent., to British American Provinces; and 3,295, or 5.70 per cent., to other foreign places. In several of these years, the places of birth are more particularly specified. In 1845, they appear as in table (q,) next page. From a statement, which we have given in the Appendix, it appears that 6,346 passengers from Liverpool, and 1,286 from Halifax, were brought to Boston by the British Mail Steamers, since their first voyage in June, 1840. This will account for a part of the increase of passengers to this port. SEXES. PLACES VF BIRTH. Years. Wales. Females. Uncertain. Total. United Stales. Great Britain. British America.

To shew the alien passengers alone, the following statement has been obtained from Calvin Bailey, Esq., the Superintend- ent, giving for each year, the number who arrived and were sent away, and the money received and paid on their ac- count."], [57, "PLACES OF BIRTH. 41 (0 From this statement it appears, that during the 9 years, 1837 to 1845, inclusive, 33,436 alien passengers arrived at this port. In this time 715, or 2.13 per cent., were sent home to Ireland, and 4,706, or 14.07 per cent., were sent out of the State. A large portion of the latter returned to the British American Provinces, from whence they came. There was expended in their removal, $20,163.23. Owing to the facilities of intercommunication, by rail roads and other means, and the great desire of emigrants to reach Boston, Mr. Bailey estimates that a number equal to one half of those coming by water, (say 16,718,) arrived here by land, mak ing the whole number, which arrived during the time, 50,154. Deduct from this number, 715 sent home, 4,706 sent out of the State, and 16,718, or half the number who arrived by water, for an estimated number who leave the city on their own account, and we have a balance of 28,015, who are now here, if alive. \" I am fully persuaded,\" says Mr. Bailey, \" that many, very many emigrants, are deluded from their own homes, by wrong impressions given them by their friends in this coun try. I know many who had received information from their friends, that they could find constant employment here at high wages. For instance, a man in New York writes home, that he gets 12 shillings a day for labor ; and another, a carpenter or mason, that he gets 16 shillings a day, and 6 NUMBhR OF PASSENGERS.

His friend in Ireland supposes (for he does not know) that a shilling is the same the world over, and that it means the same as 12 or 16 shillings a day, Irish money. Many others are deceived, by hand-bills posted at the public places in England, Scotland, and Ireland, by agents of the passenger ships, stating the demand for labor, of every kind, in America. Many of them have told me that they have seen posted up, this season, before leaving home, at the public places, hand-bills ofthe following import: \u2014 3,000 Men wanted, to work on the Boston and Montreal Rail Road. 3,000 Men wanted, to work on the Portland and Quebec Rail Road. 5,000 Men wanled, to work on the Boston City Water Works. Any number of laboring men could find constant employment, and at high wages, in and about Boston.\" Ill addition to these facts, it is well known that bounties have been paid by the British Government to pauper emi grants. The number of naturalized Foreigners. The number of foreign males in Boston, over 21 years of age, in 1845, was 9,763. Of these, 1,623 were returned as naturalized. Some are stated as having \"obtained their first papers,\" but 7,053 were returned as not naturalized. The previous censuses gave 1,752 not naturalized, in 1820; 3,468, in 1830; and 4,606, in 1835. These are extremely interesting statistics connected with our population, and deserve serious consideration. Other facts will be presented in regard to foreigners, under the heads of Pauperism, Crime, Health, and in other parts of this Report. VII. CLASSES OF THE POPULATION. For the purpose of exhibiting more clearly the condition of the people, it is proper to divide them into classes. We have already illustrated the classes according to their places of birth. We now propose to consider them according to their"], [59, "CLASSES OF THE POPULATION. 43 color, sexes, and ages. In a subsequent section, we shall present the classes of the unmarried, married, and widowed. 1. The colored population, in 1845, amounted to 1,842. They are included with the whites in the general abstract of the ages (Appendix J. p. 18.) The following table exhibits the number of this class, and the proportion it has borne to the number of whites at different periods. (u) From this statement it appears that the proportion of the colored population has been gradually diminishing. It has been reduced from 4.70 per cent, in 1800, to 1.61 in 1845, or 3.06 per cent. In the national census, the ages of the colored population were not taken in the same classification as the whites. This mode is objectionable. It is important to compare the longevity of the whites and colored, but this cannot be done, unless they are classed under the same ages. The first enu meration of the ages was in 1820. The following results are abstracted from the subsequent enumerations. See Ta ble (.,) page 44. In this statement 350 males, of the ages between 24 and 36, and 89, between 36 and 55, are deducted in 1840, for errors in enumerating the seamen. (See page 15.) The colored children educated at public expense, are as follows : \u2014 Numb.r of Persons. 'I'O EACH 1110 Pp RSON8THE- WERE, Year. Total. Whites. Colored Whites.

The colored voters were 249 in 1838, and 357 in 1845. This is an indication that the condition of the colored popu lation has improved. 2. The Proportion of the Sexes is a matter which de serves some attention. It appears in the following table. Prior to 1820, the sexes of the colored population were not designated ; that class is therefore excluded in these enumer ations in this calculation. See Table (w) page 45. This table shows that the proportion of the sexes varies at different periods, the males being greatest in times of the greatest prosperity. Such times attract large numbers of young men to the city for the purposes of labor or trade. The proportion of females to each 100 males was 121.86 in 1790.

TABLE (sr)\u2014 Continued. These tables afford remarkable illustrations of the changes in our population. In looking at the censuses, taken in the same divisions of ages as in 1800, there will appear a differ ence in the proportion at the .respective periods. The pro portion under 5, in 1830, was 13.44 per cent. ; 13.57, in 1840 ; and 12.63, in 1845 ; showing great uniformity in those ages. At other ages, however, there will be found a greater difference. The proportion of the aggregate number of each sex of all ages, was, in 1790, as 100 males to 104.72 females; and in 1800, as 100 to 110.77. The proportion, however, became more equal in 1825, when it was reduced, and was as 100 to 101.95. In 1830, it was as 100 to 111.43; and in 1845, as 100 to 101.03. In 1810, there were fewer females than males under 10 years ; at all other periods, under 26, excepting in 1825, there were more fe males than males. In the ages 26 to 45, there were more males than females, at each enumeration, excepting in 1800. In 1845, the males, of the ages 25 to 45, greatly prepon derate. Special divisions in regard to ages, may properly be made.

In a letter to the Secretary of this Commonwealth, pub- lished in the Fourth Report on^the Registration and Returns of Births, Marriages and Deaths, I have stated that there are various modes suggested of comparing the energies and pros- perity of one people with another. It has been said, with much truth, that \" a country is placed in the most favorable circumstances for advancement, when it has the largest pro- portionate numbers of its inhabitants of an age suited to active employments.\" That age, according to the opinion of some, is between 15 and 50. It appears to me, however, that, in New England at least, 15 to 60 would be a better division ; for most persons here between 15 and 60 are able to labor. I propose, therefore, to adopt the following stand- ard of comparison. Those under 15 years of age to be called the Dependent Class, because they are dependent on those older for support ; those from 15 to 60 to be called the Pro- ductive Class, because they are the only class who enjoy the full vigor of life, and are capable of discharging all its mani- fold duties ; and those over 60, the Aged Class. The first and third classes combined may be called the Unproductive Class, and the other the Productive Class. The word pro ductive is used here as applied to labor, in contradistinction from idleness or inability. One class are producers, and the other consumers. 7 Number of Persons. In each 100 there were!

This shows 205 inhabited, and 342 as the total number of houses, more than are embraced in the abstract from the assessors' books. This difference is accounted for on the supposition, that there had been an increase from May, when the account was taken, to the time when the census was taken. Changes are also taking place in the different sections daily, and an enumeration which would be correct at any one time, would not be correct a few months subsequently. The following table exhibits a general view of the dwelling houses, show ing the number and proportion per cent, of the population to, and the number of persons in, each inhabited house at differ ent periods."], [70, "54 CENSUS OF BOSTON. (dd) The number of houses in 1790, and in 1800, is estimated by comparing the number, by actual enumeration, in 1789, 1794, and 1810. The State valuation (See Appendix), it is supposed, gives an incorrect number. The table in Ap pendix M shows the number and description of the dwelling houses, and how owned and occupied, in each ward in 1845. It appears that of the inhabited dwelling houses 6,253, or 57.83 per cent, were built of brick, and 4,559, or 42.17 per cent, of wood; that 946, or 8.74 per cent., had shops, stores, &c. within them, or \"were used for other purposes;\" that 3,361, or 31.09 per cent., were owned by one of the occu pants and 7,451, or 68.91 per cent., were not owned by an occupant, but were held on lease. By the term family we mean either one individual, living in a house, or part of a house, on his, or her own means of support, or several individuals living together in a house, or part of a house, upon one common means of support, and separately from others in similar circumstances. For in stance, a widow, living alone, was reckoned as one family, while two or three hundred persons, in a boarding house or hotel, were also counted as only one family. According to this rule the number of families was enumerated. The fol lowing statement will show the aggregate number of families inhabiting each class of houses. POPULATION. Years. Inhabited.

Our facts are not sufficiently nu merous to give full comparative illustrations of this matter, though, as far as they go, they show a greater number of persons to a house now, than in past periods. This incon venience is, perhaps, more than overcome by a larger and better class of houses.

DOMESTIC CONDITION OF THE POPULATION. The Registrar General of births, marriages and deaths, in England, in his last Report, observes, that \"it is not a little remarkable, that although the increase of population and the influence of early and late marriages on the welfare of na tions, have for the whole of the present century occupied public attention, and been made the basis of theories which have guided or biased legislation, no provision has yet been made for determining the simplest fundamental facts \u2014 the foundation of all reasoning on the subject \u2014 such as the ages at marriage, the ages of mothers of children, and the numbers of married and single persons at the several periods of life. Upon many of these points the greatest ignorance prevails, writers on population depending on rough approximations, derived from scanty, imperfect, and often erroneous data, be-"], [74, "58 CENSUS OF BOSTON. cause the censuses and registers have not yet been taken and abstracted upon a comprehensive and well-considered plan.\" In taking the census of Boston for 1845, an attempt was made to carry out these principles in regard to the \" numbers of married and single persons at the several periods of life,\" or to ascertain the domestic condition of the population. The mode of personal inquiry, proposed in the schedule, afforded the means of easily designating the married and widowed, males and females ; and the facts became known to the enumerators generally, while taking the other particulars of a family, without the necessity, except occasionally, of asking a direct question. The humber of persons at the respective ages, of all conditions, having been ascertained, the number of unmarried was readily found by deducting the number of married and widowed from the whole number. Three tables are given in the Appendix (O; P ; and Q,) containing the ab stract of the facts in relation to the married and widowed. The first embraces the population born in the United States ; the second, those born in foreign countries ; and the third, combines the two. Tables of similar construction, illustrating the age at marriage, are given in the Fourth Report of the Secretary of State, on the Registration of Births, Marriages, and Deaths, in Massachusetts ; and it is found that the same form of tables might, with great propriety, illustrate the ages of the married. These tables may be understood by the following explana tion : \u2014 Look at the left hand column for the ages of the men, and opposite, on the right, for the number at each specified age of the different classes \u2014 those that live with their wives, those that live apart, the total of both, and the widowers. Near the top of the table the ages of the women are given, and at the bottom, under the same column, the number of that age in the different classes, the same as the men \u2014 those that live with their husbands, those that live apart, the total of both, and the widows. Read table O, page 25, thus : \u2014 At the age of 25 to 30, of 2,195 married men, 94 had wives under 20 ; 934, between 20 and 25 ; 955, between 25 and 30 ; 170, between 30 and 35, &c. &c. At that age, 64 married"], [75, "DOMESTIC CONDITION. 59 men lived apart from their wives, and there were 19 widow ers. At the same age, at the bottom of the page, of 2,473 married women, 1 had a. husband between 60 and 65 ; 3 be tween 55 and 60 ; 10 between 50 and 55, &c. &c. At that age, 50 married women lived apart from their husbands, and there were 99 Avidows. Other parts of these tables are read in the same way. There are three columns on the right, representing the males at the respective ages, \" living together,\" and those \"living apart,\" and the widowers; and three columns at the bottom, representing the females under similar divisions. The second of these columns may require some explanation. It appears from table Q,, that there were 443 married men, who did not live with their wives; and 352 married women, who did not live with their husbands. This does not show that there was that number of persons separated from each other on account of domestic trouble. A great proportion of the cases were those, where one of the parties had come into the city, or gone from the city, for purposes of business, pro ducing merely a temporary separation. The demand for mechanical labor draws many here, who leave their families in the country. Others go hence to other places, and leave their families here. In a small portion only had the husband deserted the wife, or the wife the husband. A distinction is made in the two tables, between the Americans and foreigners, for comparing their ages. The following statement is compiled from these tables, to show the relative proportions, at the respective ages, of the two classes of persons. See table (ff,) page 60. These figures do not show so great a difference between the Americans and foreigners, as might have been supposed. At the age between 20 and 30, the married Americans were 23.78 per cent., and the foreigners 22.32, and the American females 35.75 per cent., and the foreigners 37.10 per cent. of the whole of each class. At the age 30 to 40, the propor tion of foreigners, of both sexes, was larger than that of the Americans."], [76, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 60 The class of facts obtained in this department of our inves tigations, gave us the means of constructing the following curious table, giving the number of the unmarried, married, and widowed, of both sexes, at different ages ; and the pro portion they bear to the whole population at those ages. By these calculations, persons of either sex may, on the average of the whole population of the city, learn their chances, not of getting married, but of living in the married state, or of being widowed, at the specified ages. See table (gg,) page 61. From these tables it appears that a man, living at the age of 30 to 35, has 31.23 chances in 100, that he will be un married; 68.12, that he will be married, and .65, that he will be a widower. A woman, living at the same age, has 25.97 chances in 100, that she will be unmarried; 69.42, that she will be married, and 4.61, that she will be a widow. A man, living at the age of 60 to 65, has 15.54 chances in 100, that he will be unmarried ; 76.05, that he will be mar ried, and 8.40, that he will be a widower. A woman, living at the same age, has 16.70 chances in 100, that she will be unmarried ; 30.24, that she will be married, and 53.06 that she will be a widow : showing that the chances of being widowed, at 30 to 35, are as 4.61 to .65 per cent, greater in the female than the male ; and, at 60 to 65, they are as 53.06 to 8.40 per cent, greater ! iff) Number of Persons.

The great proportion of widows in the population is worthy of remark. It is, however, not peculiar to Boston now, or at any other period. In 1700, Mather said, the \"town is at this day full of widows and orphans, and a multitude of them are very helpless creatures. In the church whereof I am the servant, I have counted the widows make about a sixth part of the communicants, and no doubt in the whole town the proportion differs not very much.\" If this were true, the widows constituted about 16 per cent, of the whole popula tion ! We have already stated that, in 1742, the widows were estimated at 1,200, or about 1 in 14, or 1\\ per cent, of the population. These facts show that the proportion of widows now is not greater than at other periods of our his tory. And it is supposed that a considerable portion of this class of citizens, now in Boston, have come hither from the country for the purpose of keeping boarding houses, or for other occupations ; and a less number become so, while in Boston, by the death of their husbands, now than formerly.

This is probably true, though to what extent this influence operates here more than in other countries, our facts at command will not allow us to determine. Accord ing to the Fourth Registration Report of Massachusetts, the average age at which marriage first took place, in 2,671 cases last year, was 25.84 years, for the man, and 22.69, for the woman. If the ages of the married people of Boston were the same at marriage as in other parts ofthe State, \u2014 and nothing appears to lead to a different conclusion, \u2014 then the average length of time, in which they have lived in this domestic condition, is only 12.59 years for the man, and 12.17 for the woman, and this may be regarded here, according to these facts, as the average duration of married life. {ii) TO EACH 1UU OF THE WHOLE POPULATION THERE WERE \\ Males.

An act of the General Court was passed, in 1647, \" to the end,\" says the statute, \"that learning may not be buried in the graves of our fore fathers,\" requiring every town of fifty householders to have a free school ; and every town of one hundred householders to have a free \" grammar school ; the master thereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university.\" The Latin School in Boston was founded at this time ; and about twenty-five years afterwards, was said to be \"the principal school in the British colonies, if not in all North America.\" It was situated near the present Stone Chapel in School street ; and was then known as the Gram mar School, and from 1713 to 1790, as the \" South Latin School.\" It was subsequently removed to the opposite side of the street, and in 1844 to the new building in Bedford street. The Second Grammar School was founded in 1713. The house was situated in North Bennet street, near the pre sent site of the Eliot School, and was known until 1790, as the North Latin School, now as the Eliot School. Free schools to teach children \" to read and write,\" and called \" writing schools,\" were founded as follows : \u2014 The first, in 1684, situated in Queen, now Court street, and called the \" Centre Writing School ;\" the second, in 1713, in North Bennet street, and adjoining the Eliot School, and called the North Writing School ; and the third, in 1717, at the corner of Tremont and West street, called the South Writing School, now the Adams School. These were all the schools until 1785, when another was founded, situated on the site ofthe Brimmer school in Common street, and was then known as \" Mr. Cheney's School,\" and subsequently as the Franklin"], [81, "EDUCATION. 65 School. These schools were under the inspection of the Selectmen and such \" gentlemen of liberal education, togeth er with the reverend ministers,\" as should be appointed for the purpose. The following statement will show the number of scholars that attended these schools at different periods : \u2014 0)') In 1789 the schools were remodeled. The North Latin School was discontinued as a Latin School; \"reading schools,1' in separate departments from \" writing schools,\" were established ; and the whole placed under the common direction of a School Committee, chosen annually by the town. Since that time, new schools have been founded, and new houses erected for their accommodation. (See Ap pendix R, p. 28.) The classes of schools now supported at the public ex pense, by ordinary payments from the treasury, are Primary Schools, Grammar Schools, an English High School, and a Latin School. Besides these, there are schools connected with the House of Industry and House of Reformation, which are supported by special appropriations for those insti tutions. The Primary Schools were established in 1818, and are under the management of a Primary School Committee, independent of the general School Committee. Children between the ages of 4 and 7, are admitted into these schools ; and all are taught by females in the elementary branches of knowledge, preparatory to admission to the Grammar Schools. 9 Names of Schools.

The Grammar Schools were founded in different years, and are under the direction of a general committee of twenty-six citizens, including the Mayor and President of the Common Council. These schools provide the means of giving a thorough education to all the children in the city, in those branches of knowledge which are necessary to qualify them for discharging the ordinary duties of life. Children are ad mitted to these schools at the age of 7 ; and boys are not allowed to remain beyond the day of the annual examination, next after they have arrived at 14, and girls at 16 years of age. The date of their foundation and other particulars are given in the Appendix, (B. p. 28.) One school was founded by a donation from Abiel Smith, and is exclusively devoted to colored children. The branches of knowledge taught in these schools are as follow : \u2014 In the Grammar Department : \u2014 Class IV. Spelling, Reading. Class III. Spelling, Reading, Grammar. Class II. Spelling, Reading, Grammar. Class I. Spelling, Reading, Grammar, History, Composition, Dec lamation, and Astronomy.

The English High School was founded in 1821, for the pur pose of \"furnishing the young men of this city, who are not in tended fora collegiate course of study, and who have enjoyed"], [83, "EDUCATION. 67 the usual advantages of the other public schools, with the means of completing a good English education. Here is given instruction in the elements of mathematics and natural philos ophy, with their application to the sciences and the arts, in grammar, rhetoric, and belles letters, in moral philosophy, in history, natural and civil, and in the French language.\" The Latin School was founded, as already stated, about 1647. In this school \" the rudiments of the Latin and Greek languages are taught ; and scholars are fully prepared for the most respectable colleges. Instruction is also given in mathematics, geography, history, declamation and English composition.\" The number of scholars in these schools is given in the Appendix. (See Table S, p. 29.) The number of children belonging to all the schools, at different periods, appears as follows : \u2014 (__) The sexes of the scholars are matters of interest. For the first one hundred and fifty years of the existence of Boston, boys alone enjoyed the benefits of the public schools. Girls were first admitted in 1790 for 6 months of the year only ; and it was not until many years afterwards, that they attended the whole year. The following table is compiled to show the relative number of each sex, that have belonged to the schools at different periods. [Table (11) p. 68.] It appears from this table that, in 1800, the proportion of the males was 58.52 per cent., and the females was 41.48 Classes of Schools. In 1820 Aug. 1825. Nov. 1829. Feb. 1836.

It seems to me, however, that this specific classification is injudicious, and that 5 to 15 would be a bet ter division. One object in specifying any age, is to have a basis by which to proportion the public school money to the several towns. It is probable, however, that it would make little or no difference in the result, whether this sum were proportioned to the children between 4 and 16, or between 5 and 15. The latter are universally adopted by nations, as important points in the divisions of the population, and in the statistics of the dead ; and there are many reasons why the educational age should be within these points. It would be less labor to make the enumeration ; and, from examinations which have been made, it appears that the ages of children attending school, more nearly correspond to them. Compar isons could be more readily made with the ordinary divisions of the population. I agree in opinion with a recent eminent writer, in thinking, in its application to schools, that \"here after 15 will be the age at which, in any census, it will be considered that, in the mass of the community, occupation begins and education ends.\" The classes of the whole population of the city, according to this legal division, appear in three different periods, as in the following table.

The expenditures for education in Boston have often been a subject of remark. They are partially exhibited in the Ap pendix.

The other expenditures of the schools from 1820 to May 1, 1845, including those years not given in the table, amounted to $1,821,109.35. This includes re pairs of school-houses, salaries, fuel, &c. The statements in the Appendix, page 31, show the number of teachers, and the salary of each, at different periods. The whole amount of expenditures for public education, exclusive of that for the institutions at South Boston, for the twenty-five years, ending May 1, 1845, including houses, was $2,437,327.03. This sum would be considerably increased, if what is ex pended at South Boston, and for printing and other expenses, on account of the Schools, were included. In looking at the last year, it will be perceived, that the sum expended was $205,843.13, equal to about 25 per cent, of all the city taxes, or $2.00 for every inhabitant, $8.00 for every child between 4 and 16 years of age, and $13.26 for each scholar attending school. And the proportion of some other years was as great, or even greater. The Tables referred to in the Appendix show the cost, each year, (estimating in this cost the houses built,) of educating a child in the several classes of schools. It seems from these estimates, that the cost of educating each child in the Primary Schools, since 1835, has varied from $6.50 to $8.91, annually ; in the Grammar Schools, from $11.35 to $20 ; and in the Latin and High Schools, from $40.25 to 57.18.

Of this sum Boston has re- ceived $22,341.17, in the ten years, as specified in the state- ment in the Appendix, page 29. None was received in 1844, and $1,169.95 less, in 1845, than the just proportion which the city ought to have received. The division is made ac- cording to the number of persons between 4 and 16 years of age, the last division giving $165.30 6-10 for each 1,000 persons. Of that age, for the whole city, only 18,487 were returned, instead of 25,552, the number obtained by the enumeration. The number of persons returned between 4 and 16, is less than the same return gives of the scholars ac- tually attending the public and private schools! The State has also distributed to the several towns a considerable sum for District School Libraries, but it seems, according to the last Report of the Secretary of the Board of Education, that Boston has not availed itself of this bounty. Our view of the Education of the Population would be in complete without some description of the Private Schools of the city. These are more variable, as to numbers, than the public schools. Means exist to give an account, approx imating to accuracy at five different periods, as in the follow ing table.

This would very much increase the amount. There remains one other consideration \u2014 what proportion of the population are absent from school, or do not avail themselves ofthe public provisions made for their education. Deducting from the number of children at school, those over 16 years of age, the remainder are those at school belonging to the different divisions of the educational age, (4 to 16 ;) and the proportion they bear to the whole number of persons in the city- of this age, will appear by the following state- ment (ss) From this table it appears that 6,422 children, between the ages of 4 and 16, or 25.13 per cent, or one quarter of the whole number in the city, do not attend any school. To these should be added those belonging to the schools who are occasionally absent. The average attendance is stated in table U, page 32 ; from which it appears that about 20 per cent., or 3,578 are absent daily, which added to 6,422, make 10,000 who are absent daily from school.

The Athen\u00e6um has over 40,000, and the Historical Society over 20,000 of these works. There are numerous large private libraries in Boston ; and all classes are provided with opportunities of gratifying the universal desire for reading, at extremely small expense, if not by means of their own, by a public, or a circulating library, or by the public press. 3. Periodical Literature is one of the most powerful means of educating the people, and of influencing public opinion. It has been deemed of so much importance, that an effort has been made to obtain the number of sheets, in* a given period, printed in Boston. In the statistics of industry for 1845, (See Appendix Z, page 44,) which were collected at consid erable expense, this branch was entirely omitted ; yet we deem it much more important to be known, than some mat ters which received attention ; inasmuch as the influence of a periodical work on the public mind is more important than the production of \"Root Beer,\" \"Plumes,\" boot \"Black ing,\" and many other articles, which were enumerated. There are difficulties we acknowledge in obtaining exact informa tion in regard to periodicals. There is a reluctance in some publishers to disclose the amount of their circulation. For the purpose I had in view, however, the publishers were in-"], [93, "EDUCATION. 77 formed that a statement was desired that could be relied upon as correct ; that whatever was communicated to me should be confidential, if desired ; and in the abstract to be pub lished, the circulation of individual works should not be par ticularized. In a very few instances only, was I induced to believe that the statements given were incorrect ; or to resort an estimate of my own, or to other sources of information. The subjoined statement of the results of the inquiries can, therefore, it is believed, be relied upon as a very near approxi mation to accuracy ; and if erroneous at all, to be an under rather than an over-estimate. The publications being on different sized paper, each sheet has been carefully measured, and the number of square inches calculated. 1.

From the above facts the following statement is compiled, giving a general view, specifying the number of the circula tion, square inches, and value of these publications for a whole year. See Table (vv) p. 79. It thus appears that 32,890,508 publications are issued an nually from the Boston press, averaging 109,098 daily, allow ing 310 working days to the year, valued at $825,074. These contain 24,132,117,132 square inches, or 3,847 acres of printed sheets, averaging 12 acres each day. Deducting ten per cent, for the margin of the sheets not printed, and there remains 6,926 acres of printed surface which goes out to the public mind, to influence or educate it for good or for ill. And it is supposed that the number of sheets printed for books and other publications, not named in the above ac-"], [95, "LEGAL VOTERS. 79 count, or not periodical, makes a near approach to the same amount ! (\u00ab0 XII. LEGAL VOTERS OF THE POPULATION. The admirable system for exercising the right of suffrage, and for preserving the purity of the ballot box, possessed by Massachusetts, is carried into practice in Boston with great ease and simplicity. The age for exercising the right of suffrage, which might be called the Political Age, is 21 years and upwards. The number of persons in the city, of this age, in 1845, was 64,900, of whom 32,363 were males, and 32,537 females. A male of this age is qualified to vote, who has resided within the State one year, and within the city the previous six months, and who has paid a tax assessed upon him within the two years preceding the election. The assessors annually make out alphabetical lists of the legal voters, for each ward, which are printed on sheets 22 by 24 inches, with spaces between the different letters for writing additional names. These sheets are attached to boards, of equal size, and remain at the office of the Mayor and Alder men fourteen days before voting, and notice thereof is pub licly given ; and any errors or omissions, on being made Class of Publications.

These lists are distributed to the wardens of the several wards, at the opening of the polls on election days ; and the Inspectors of Elections make a check mark against each name, as the vote is deposited. By this method, fraud can rarely be at tempted without instant detection ; and no disturbances ever occur at elections. From the printed lists of several years since the present arrangement of the wards, I have compiled a table in the Appendix, specifying the number of legal voters at the pe riods stated: (See Appendix, p. 33.) The last two years named (1844 and 1845) contain the numbers on the day of voting, as corrected, and tbe last year, the number of names beginning with each letter of the alphabet, in the respective wards. From this statement, and the record of votes given, I have prepared another table, subjoined, to show the propor tion of the legal voters of the population, and to illustrate how far the people use the important right of suffrage. See table (ww.) p. 81. The legal voters increased 5,877, or 40 per cent., from 1840 to 1845. It appears that in 1840 they were 14,474, or 17.02 per cent, of the population, and 44.74 per cent, of the males over 21 years of age ; and the votes given were 11,573, or 79.95 per cent, of the legal voters, and 13.61 per cent, of the population. This was the largest proportional vote given since the year 1816. At the Presidential election of 1844, the votes given were 13,502, or 13.15 per cent, of the estimated population at that time. At the election of Governor in 1S45, the legal votes were 20,351, or 17.79 per cent, of the population, and the votes given were 10,191, or 8.91 per cent, of the population, and 50.07 per cent, of the legal voters. An examination of the wards will show which gives the largest, and which the smallest, proportional vote. For the purpose of further illustration of this subject, we have compiled the two other tables in the Appendix, WW ; one containing an abstract of the votes given in Bos ton, at the election of Governor, since the adoption of the Constitution in 1780 ; and the other of these given at the"], [97, "LEGAL VOTERS. 81 (ww) Statement of the number and proportion per cent, of the Votes given in the several Wards, in 1840 and 1845 ; and the number in 1844. 11 Election of President, 1840.

It ap pears that 1807 and 1812 were the years in which the largest number of votes, in proportion to the population, was given ; in the former, 16.8 per cent., and only 10 scattering votes; and in the latter, 16 per cent., and only 6 scattering votes. In 1S40 the proportion was 13.61 per cent. There have been 1 1 only, during the 65 years, in which Boston has not given a majority for the successful candidate. We suppose that these tables will be regarded with particular interest, as illus trating important matters connected with our political insti tutions ; and that they will command perusal. XIII. OCCUPATIONS OF THE POPULATION. In the census of 1840, an attempt was made to obtain an account of the occupations of the people, and the following questions were asked : \u2014 \" What is the number of persons in this family employed in mining operations ? Agriculture ? Commerce ? Manufactures and trades ? Navigation of the ocean ? Navigation of canals, lakes, and rivers ? Learned professions, and as engineers ?\" The following statement comprises the result of these inquiries, and also a similar re sult of the census of 1S20. Number of Persona employed. In 1820. In 1840. Agriculture, 64 152 Commerce, 809 2,040 Manufactures and Trades, 399 5,333 Navigation of the Ocean, . 10,813 Navigation of Canals, Lakes, and Bivers, . 19 Learned Professions, and as Engineers, . 586 Total, 1,273 18,943 These questions were too indefinite to elicit exact infor mation. They were differently understood by different enu merators \u2014 by some, in not giving a proper meaning to the word \"commerce,\" as distinguished from \"trade\" or \"navi-"], [99, "OCCUPATIONS. 83 gation ;\" by others, in including or excluding families only, instead of persons ; and by others, in other particulars ; and the results obtained are very imperfect and of little value. The better, and perhaps the only correct mode of obtain ing information in this matter, is by personal inquiry of each individual, and by noting down at the time, opposite the name, each person's occupation or description, as stated by himself. This was the mode adopted in 1845. (See sched ule, Appendix A, p. 2, column 9.) The inquiries were con fined principally to male persons, over 20 years of age. It would be desirable, however, to include all persons over 15, agreeably to suggestions already made, distinguishing those between 15 and 20 from those over 20. This method was generally successful, though some of the enumerators, from its novelty, were not quite as careful to note down all the occupations, as it had been intended they should be ; and hence the results are* given as an approximation only to accuracy. This statement will aid future enumerators, and render their labor more easy. It will be perceived that the subdivisions are very numerous. It is worthy of notice that, in stating the occupations of persons, such terms should be used as would define clearly the chief business of their lives. When the same person pursues more than one occupation, or is a maker or producer, as well as a dealer or trader in an article, as is often the case with our population, it is difficult to preserve this distinction ; but it is important, as far as pos sible, to show the leading and most prominent occupation. Sometimes the same occupation also has different names ; \" housewright\" and \" carpenter,\" \"mason\" and \"plasterer/' \"grocer\" and \"West India goods dealer,\" <fcc, may be re garded, in some instances, as synonymous terms. The only persons stated in the abstract as contributing to religion, are \"ministers.\" Many other persons, however, such as mis sionaries, Sabbath-school teachers, and others, contribute to the same object, although it may not be the leading business, or occupation of their lives. We have carefully considered different modes by which an abstract of this information, which would be most appropriate"], [100, "84 CENSUS OF BOSTON. and useful, could be presented ; and after considerable reflec tion, have determined to classify the occupations according as they contribute to our personal necessities and comfort. This seems to be the most natural classification, since this is the ultimate object, which all occupations should have in view. We have accordingly given, arranged in alphabetical order, the number employed in the several occupations, under the following divisions : \u2014 Divisions. Females. Males. 1. Those contributing to Building, 6 3,325 2. \" to Clothing, 841 2,610 3. \" to Education, 250 224 4. \" to Food, 161 2,133 5. \" to Furniture, 218 2,377 6. \" to Health, 114 566 7. \" to Justice . 584 8. \" to Literature and Fine Arts, 206 920 9. \" to Locomotion, . 903 10. \" to Machinery, . 430 11. \" to Navigation, . 3,239 12. \" to Beligion, ' .104 13.

The number of domestics, or persons at service in families, is considered worthy of notice, and affords some illustration of the occupations and habits of the people. The facts in regard to the families appear thus : \u2014 Classes of Families. Domestics employed. 15,774 families do their own household work. 0 138 hotels and boarding houses employ 831 2,194 families employ 1 domestic each, 2fl94 729 \" 2 domestics \" 1,458 204 \" 3 \" \" 612 31 \" 4 \u00ab \" 364 31 \" 5 \u00ab \" 155 8 \" 6 \u00ab \" 48 4 \" 7 \u00ab \" 28 2 \" 8 \u00ab \" 16 19,175 Total, 5,706"], [101, "PROGRESSIVE WEALTH. 85 Of these, 722 are males and 4,984 females, comprising 3,S04 foreigners and 1,902 Americans. This number varies from the number in the abstract in the Appendix, (page 43,) some under 20 years of age being included. The Employment Societies may be here referred to. Two societies exist in Boston, whose object is to provide employ ment for such persons as wish it \u2014 one for males and one for females. From the reports of these excellent institutions, for the year ending September 30, 1S45, it appears that the male applicants, during the year, at the Boston Employment Society, were 1,678, of whom 1,017 were Americans, and 661 foreigners. For 623 employment was found; 150 left the city, by advice of the Society, and returned to their homes ; and 905 remained on the books. At the Female Employment Society the applicants were 4,531, of whom 456 were Americans and 4,075 foreigners, besides 277 under 15 years of age. Employment was found for 3,200, of whom 248 were Americans and 2,952 foreigners, and 202 under 15. Of those employed, 1,789 went to places in the city and 1,411 in the country. XIV. PROGRESSIVE WEALTH OF THE POPU- LATION. Several different classes of facts will be presented to illus trate this part of our report. 1. The Manufacturing Industry of a people is a means of wealth which has been considered as deserving of partic ular notice. Facts on this subject were collected by authority of the United States in 1840, and by that ofthe State in 1837 and 1845. Abstracts of these facts are given in the Appen dix, (see Table Z, page 44) rearranged, and placed side by side of each other, for the purpose of presenting them in a more intelligible form, and for more forcible illustration. If any thing were needed to show the imperfection of the sta tistics, collected in connection with the census of 1840,"], [102, "86 CENSUS OF BOSTON. this statement would seem to be sufficient. By comparing the abstracts of 1837 and 1845, some difference will appear \u2014 some important branches of industry were omitted in both periods. And among others, periodical works, printing presses, books, and clothing, which are among the most important branches of manufacture in the city, appear not to have been noticed at all in 1845. The aggregates from this table ap pear thus. In Manufactures. In 1837. In 1840. In 1845. Capital invested, $5,830,572 $2,442,309 $4,330,600 Males employed, 6,320 2,289 5,260 Females employed, 4,450 . 970 Value of the product, $11,070,576 $4,016,573 . $10,648,153 It might be inferred from this statement that the manufac turing industry of the city was not as great now as in 1837, while the opinion of the best judges on the subject, form ed without actual enumeration and investigation, is, that it is nearly twice as great ! 2. Commercial Industry. Under this head we present five tables in the Appendix, compiled from the annual state ments of the Commerce and Navigation of the United States, from records at our Custom House, and from other authentic sources of information. Appendix AA, page 50, contains the number of arrivals and clearances at our port, for each of the six years, 1840 to 1845, compiled from records kept by an individual, and de signed to include all vessels, except perhaps a few loaded with wood and lumber. Appendix BB, page 51, contains the number of foreign arrivals and clearances, specifying the countries from which they came, obtained from the same source. Appendix CC, on the same page, shows the amount of tonnage owned by Boston, Massachusetts, and the United States, in each year, since 1825. Appendix DD, page 52, contains the number of arrivals and clearances, specifying the tonnage and crews, since 1825, compiled from the annual statements of the Commerce and Navigation of the United States. With this statement may"], [103, "PROGRESSIVE WEALTH. 87 be contrasted the following. In 1748, 500 vessels cleared from Boston for, and 430 entered from, foreign ports. In 1784 the entries of foreign and coasting vessels were 37 2, and clearances 450. In 1794. the foreign entries were 567 ; in 1795, they were 725; and in 1S06, they were 938. Appendix EE, page 53, shows the imports and exports, and the revenue of Boston, and side by side, the imports and exports of Massachusetts, and of the United States, since 1824. These interesting facts show that the foreign com merce of Boston has not increased in proportion to its in crease of population. They however show that it more than maintains its relative commercial rank, when compared with Massachusetts and the whole nation. This is proved by the following deductions from this table, and from that on page 51. (xx.) This does not indicate precisely the amount of Commerce of Boston, since a large amount of tonnage, in parts of ves sels is owned here, which is not registered or does not enter at this port. Appendix FF, pages 54 to 56 inclusive, contains the par ticulars of each voyage made by the British Mail Steamers. These packets are so intimately connected with the prosper ity of Boston, that I have deemed it advisable, though attended with considerable labor, to present the details at length. The summary of each year appears thus : OF TH_ PERCENTAGE OF ALL. THE COMMERCE UF THE UNITED STATES. BOSTON HAD MASSACHUSETTS HAD Years. Tonnage Imports. Exports. Tonnage. Imports.

The great increase in the valuation of the property of Boston has led to the inquiry, how far particular estates have been af fected ? There is a general rise in the intrinsic value of real estate, but, in some places and sections, this rise is greater than in others. For the purpose of illustration and compari son, three estates were selected in different parts of the city, so situated as not to be specially affected in regard to their valua tion, by any local improvement in their immediate neighbor hood ; and the valuation and taxes assessed upon them at three different periods ascertained ; and the following results were obtained : \u2014 (bbb) This shows that the same property was more highly valued, and paid a higher tax, in 1845 than in 1835, notwithstanding there is a vast increase in the real value of certain sections, and a vast amount of new property created ; and it has been sup posed that this \" marking up\" the property will partially account for the increase ofthe aggregate valuation of the city.

State Valuation. Table MM (Appendix, page 66) contains the valuation affixed upon Boston by the Legislature at differ ent periods, which has formed the basis of the state tax. As this is a matter of considerable interest, we have examined the ancient valuation of the city, and ascertained its proportion of the whole state tax. Some facts on this subject we deem wor thy of being presented in this connection, before proceeding to notice particularly the table in the Appendix.

(ddd) It appears from this statement that in 1790, Boston had 5 per cent, of the population of the whole state ; in 1840, it had 11J per cent. ; in 1791, it had 13.4 per cent, of the property ; in 1840, it had 36.4 per cent. ; in 1791, it paid 9 per cent, of the state tax ; in 1840, it paid 33.9 per cent. Prejudice has existed between the country towns and Boston ; and although their interests and prosperity are mutual and de pendent upon each other, yet it has been supposed by some persons, that measures unjust to the city have occasionally been proposed and adopted. The existence of such an opinion will justify a further detail of facts to illustrate this matter.

A comparison of the amount received and expended on these accounts, between Boston and all the other towns in the state, will show which bears the greater propor tion of the public burden ; and this is the fairest way of arriv ing at correct results in this matter. In making the comparison, receipts and expenditures of a general character, having no reference to the towns, should not be embraced. Table KK (Appendix, page 63) presents the facts necessary to illustrate this subject. The fees and forfeitures paid into the treasury from the County Attorney of Suffolk, appear in the balances of the County Attorneys of other Counties. I have calculated the proportion per cent, paid and received by Boston, and by all the other towns, and it appears as follows : \u2014 (cee) This statement shows that Boston, for the last six years, has, on the average, annually paid into the treasury 58,07 per cent. of the whole state revenue ; and all the other towns only 41,93 per cent. ; that Boston has received only 27,14 per cent. ; and all the other towns 72,86 per cent. If the other towns had received in the same proportion to what they pay, as Boston receives for what it pays, they would have received only 19,59 per cent, instead of 72,86, or a little over one quarter of what they have actually received !

XV. PUBLIC CHARITIES OF THE POPULATION. The address of the Hon. Josiah Quincy, delivered in 1830, at the centennial celebration of the settlement of Boston, con tains a statement of the donations made, chiefly within the pre vious twenty years, by \" the citizens of Boston, towards objects of a public nature of a moral, religious, or literary character.\" In an article by the Hon. Samuel A. Eliot, which appeared in the North American Review for July, 1845, this statement was republished, accompanied by an account of the donations of a similar character, since 1830. Both of these statements were combined, and published in the American Almanac for 1846. The statements of these gentlemen, both of whom have held the office of Mayor ofthe city, are entitled to much consideration, and deserve to be handed down in connection with a statistical view of our population, though they exhibit a sum far below the amount actually given. The whole matter has undergone a partial revision, so far as to include several donations since Mr. Eliot's article was prepared, to the close of the year 1845 ; and to fix a date by which the several accounts were limited. This is done for the purpose of aiding those who may hereafter make further investigations of this interesting subject. The original classification of the donations is however preserved. These facts were ascertained by direct application to the most authentic sources of information. Mr. Eliot states that \" application was also made to the churches of the city, associations which are well known to be in the constant habit of contributing not only to many of the objects above mentioned, but to others of various descriptions, both permanent and temporary. From the pastors or olher of ficers of some of these churches returns were received of great exactness ; but from the majority they were, perhaps from the"], [117, "PUBLIC CHARITIES. 101 necessity of the case, so incomplete as to be unsuitable for the desired purpose. It is probable that no records are kept of many donations made by these religious societies ; but it is not the less certain that such donations are made, because their amount cannot be ascertained with precision. It will not be doubted by many persons, that, in the churches which have existed in the city within the last fifteen years, from seventy to eighty in number, an average of not less than $10,000 a year has been raised for the support of the poor belonging to them respectively. This item alone would make an addition of $150,000 to the foot of the following account. But there is another branch of benevolence, the great extent of which can neither be doubted, nor precisely ascertained ; and that is, the unnumbered acts of love, pity, and sympathy which are and can be known only to the agent, the recipient, and Him who formed them to give and to receive. It would be no matter of surprise, if the amount bestowed in this secret way should make a near approach to that given openly ; but as such deeds cannot be counted, nor their value be estimated in dollars and cents, the whole must be left to conjecture, till the arrival of that day when the gift even of a cup of cold water shall meet with its fit reward. \" One of the first observations which naturally occur to eve ry one on looking over the subjoined list, is, not merely that there is a large amount of money voluntarily bestowed, but that it is given for a great variety of purposes. There are thirty-one societies or institutions having religious objects, twenty-six for purposes of literary education, and twenty-five for the relief of physical and moral wants. Thirty-one other objects of more or less general interest are added, and doubt less many more may be known to individuals. And it is a little singular, that, in a country so often reproached as this with want of gratitude to its benefactors, there should be contained in such a list no less than thirteen subscriptions for monuments to the memory of as many honored individuals, ten of whom were the contemporaries of the present generation ; and besides these, there is the comprehensive monument in honor of the achievement of our fathers at Bunker Hill.\""], [118, "102 CENSUS OF BOSTON. 1.

The extent and circumstances of pauperism, however, vary in different places, and among different people; and are interesting traits illustrative of their character. Boston has some peculiarities in these respects. The classes of pau pers, here receiving public charity, are 1. those who obtain oc casional relief from the income of funds given for the purpose, but are not considered as public paupers, and who are sometimes denominated silent poor ; 2. those who are relieved in the different wards by money drawn from the treasury of the city, and who are denominated out-door paupers ; and 3. those who are supported in the House of Industry, and in the Lunatic Hospital, and who are denominated in-door paupers. Each of the last two classes embraces many persons who have obtained a temporary lodgment here merely, without becoming \" resi dents ;\" and are chargeable to other towns to which they be long, or to the State. The management of our whole pauper system is committed to two separate boards. One, called the Overseers of the Poor, consists of twelve individuals, one in each ward, chosen annu ally by the voters. This board has the distribution of the in come of the corporate funds given for the benefit of the silent poor, and the other money appropriated to out-door paupers. The other board consists of the Directors of the House of In dustry, who are chosen annually by the city council. The Lu natic Hospital, designed principally for the accommodation of paupers, is also under the direction of another and separate board. This division of our pauper system is not to be com-"], [123, "PAUPERISM. 107 mended ; though it has become so interwoven with the opinions and habits of the people, that a change has not been attempted without successful opposition. It is not our intention in this place to go into a history of pau perism in this city, how interesting soever the topic might be, but merely to advert to some of the leading facts of recent date connected wilh it. And we first present the following tables, giving a general view of the number ot paupers.

They also show a very remarkable diminution, especially since 1840. XVII. CRIME OF THE POPULATION. Crime, like pauperism, is an unavoidable concomitant of a population constituted like ours. The proportion which the number of criminals bears to the whole people, the nature of the offences committed, the character of the prisoners, and other attendant circumstances, are interesting topics of inquiry ; and the results should be exhibited in a work like this report, designed to give a general view of a population. It may be presumed, however, that cities are more liable to crimes, of 15"], [130, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 114 various kinds, than country towns generally. Many persons of depraved character, such as generally compose the dregs of society, find a temporary lodgment in cities, and are there de tected. The proportion of natives and permanent residents of this city among the criminals has been generally very small. Without going very minutely into this subject, we propose to present a few of the facts which we have gathered, for the solution of the question, whether crime has increased, de creased, or remained nearly stationary ? A comparison insti tuted between different periods is, however, only an ap proximation to accuracy, since the facts have not always been registered, nor abstracted on a uniform, systematic plan. Courts. There are two principal Criminal Courts in Boston \u2014 the Police Court, and the Municipal Court. The Police Court takes cognizance of nearly all criminal cases arising un der existing laws ; and cases not within their jurisdiction are sent to grand juries. All indictments arising under State laws, except for capital offences, are tried at the Municipal Court. Capital offences are tried at the Supreme Court. The Circuit Court and District Court of the United States try all criminal cases not within State jurisdiction. The County Attorney for the County of Suffolk reports each year to the secretary of state, the cases to which he attends, from which reports, abstracts are prepared and published annually. Prisons. Besides the Jail, to which persons accused of crime are committed before trial, there are three prisons, to which persons convicted of criminal offences are sent \u2014 the State Prison, the House of Correction, and the House of Re formation for Juvenile Offenders. The following general table shows, for each year since 1830, and the total and average in each quinquennial period, the num ber of commitments to the jail ; the cases before the Police Court ; the cases before the Municipal Court ; and the \" con victions \" and '\u2022 acquittals \" before that and the Supreme Court ; and the number sent from this County to the State Prison, and to the House of Correction. (See table, mmm, next page.) The commitments to the jail do not always indicate the number of persons committed, since, in some cases, the same person is committed several times.

These facts and re sults are not as favorable as those given in regard to pauperism. While pauperism has diminished, crime has seemed somewhat to increase. They are, however, to be considered with some qualifying circumstances. Modes of administering the laws may have been more stringent at one time than at another. Many cases before the courts, also, have arisen under the license law, or from some other cause, not of general operation. These causes have no doubt increased the number of cases, without increasing the number of convicts. It is deemed expedient to append to these brief statistics of crime, the following account of the new cases, mostly civil, which have been entered in the other courts in the city, within the last sixteen years, for the purpose of illustrating the legal history of our population. It is proper to remark, in explana tion, that the jurisdiction of our courts has been altered during this period, and some cases which have come before one court at one period, would not have come before the same court at another period. The cases in the Supreme Court include the criminal cases enumerated in the next column. Of these, 9 were trials for"], [137, "CRIME. 121 capital offences in 1831\u201435 ; 4 in 1836-40; and 11, in 1841\u201445. The others before 1839 were cases appealed from the Municipal Court. After that year causes were carried up from that court by \"exceptions.\" Criminal jurisdiction was given to the United States District Court in 1842 ; and from that time to 1845, there were 40 cases, which are included in the criminal cases in the Circuit Court. The others are exclusive of the cases in bankruptcy, and in naturalization. The numbers in the Circuit Court include common law and equity cases. Of the latter there were 13, in 1831\u201435; 65 in 1836-40 ; and 110, in 1841-45.

MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS OF THE POPULATION. The moral and religious institutions of a population exert a powerful influence on its character. To present the facts on this subject, we have constructed the following series of tables, the design of which is to show in regard to the several religious denominations, in our city, \u2014 1. The Church accommodation ; \u2014 2. The expenses of public worship ; \u2014 3. The Sabbath Schools, and \u2014 4. The population of each denomination. The attempt to carry out this design to its fullest extent, was attend ed, we regret to say, with considerable difficulty, on account of the imperfection of records and other attainable information, and from other causes, in a city like ours. It is imperfect in some particulars, but it will aid future investigators into this most interesting subject. Facts like these in regard to most towns might be gathered and presented ; and they would show to what extent a population comes under the peculiar influences of the several religious denominations and institutions ; and how far their general religious sentiments are formed and mo dified thereby. There are several religious denominations which have only one or two societies each. Concerning some of them we were unable to procure satisfactory information. We therefore can-"], [139, "RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. 123 not present an account of each separately. Of these there is 1 New Jerusalem, which has built an elegant church in Bow doin street ; 2 Christian ; 2 Free Will Baptist ; 1 German Evangelical ; 1 German Lutheran ; and 1 Mormon. There is also a Quaker meeting house, but there are few if any Quakers in Boston. These are classed in the table under the name of others. I. Church Accommodation. The subjoined table shows, for each denomination, in alphabetical order, the number of socie ties, the number of churches, their aggregate cost, the extent of their accommodations ; and also of the other places of worship. The original cost of the churches was ascertained, when practicable; and when it was not, the value was estimated. (ooo) 2. Expenses of Public Worship.

There are twelve Catholic clergymen in Boston, some of whom are not paid stated salaries, but depend upon transient collections, and fees for baptisms and marriages. The amount of the expenses of their worship can not therefore be stated. It may be safely estimated that the whole amount annually paid in Boston, on account of religious worship, is not less than $200,000. 3. Sabbath Schools are now connected with nearly all the religious denominations. The subjoined statement exhibits the facts in relation to the principal denominations, showing the number.of schools, teachers, scholars, &c, and the proportion they bear to the whole population. Sabbath schools are also connected with the New Jerusalem church, and some other societies, not classified in the table. It thus appears that about 17,000, or 15 per cent, of our popu lation, equal to about two thirds of the number between 4 and 16 years of age, are members of some sabbath school. 4. Population of each Denomination. An attempt was made to obtain from several clergymen, the number of the population which composed their respective societies. It was not, how ever, very successful, it being found difficult, if not impossible, on account of the great fluctuation in our population, to attain more than an approximation to accuracy.

The table shows the number of communicants in the churches, and the proportion they bear to the whole population. ___ The number of Catholics here given is greater than has been generally supposed, but it is not, we think, an over estimate, if the facts respecting our population be compared. The foreign ers and their children (Appendix, page 20) were found in the enumeration to be 37,289. Of these a small proportion are Protestants. On the other hand, a considerable number of adult Catholics are American born. The estimate is confirmed by a calculation made from the number of births, marriages and deaths, which took place in that denomination According to the number of baptisms in this church, furnished me by the bishop, about half of all the children born in the city are of Catholic parents ! Every person when baptised becomes a member of this church ; and it is hence impossible to state the number. Besides the churches and sabbath schools, a great variety of other moral and religious associations exists in Boston. These institutions are indeed among its peculiar, distinguishing traits of character. We have already given an imperfect list of the public donations to many of them, and it would be desirable to give a particular account of their labors, and the results of their charities, but our limits will not permit.

Since 1841, when the Parent Washington Total Abstinence Society was formed, \" 39,0S3 persons,\" says the president, \" have signed the pledge of total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks ; of whom, as nearly as can be ascertained, less than 1 0 per cent, have for feited their allegiance to the pledge, leaving about 36,000, who, so far as known, are in the enjoyment of the happiness result ing from a life of temperance. Out of this number reformed, 890 have, since signing the pledge, united with the various churches ; showing that, so far as this number is concerned at least, their reform has not been a temporal one alone.\" A great many other societies, male and female, exist in the city, and co-operate in this great reformation. And in no class have we witnessed its benefits more than among the Catholics. In that class of our population, six total abstinence societies ex ist, many of which are formed on the principle of mutual relief; and, it is said, \" the whole number of Catholic tetotallers is not far from 15,000.\" And it is but justice to say that none, who sign the pledge, regard it more sacredly, or keep it more faithfully. It promises to do much, very much, to improve and elevate their pecuniary, their physical, and their moral condition, and they deserve every encouragement, aid, and assistance. XIX. BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS, IN THE POPULATION. The number of births, marriages, and deaths, that annually occur in a place, is an element of information, indispensable to a correct view of the population ; hence, in almost all civilized governments, records are now made, and means exist, for ob taining these facts. In our own State, a law was enacted soon after its settlement, requiring records of this kind ; and it was observed with considerable care in the early periods of our"], [143, "BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS. 127 history ; but latterly, it has been much disregarded. It appears from the reports on the registration of births, marriages, and deaths in Massachusetts, that no returns in relation to either were made for Boston for the last two years. Previous returns show that 19 births were recorded in the year ending May 1, 1842, and 4 only in 1843. It also appears from the records of the city clerk, that very few births, and not all the marriages, are returned to him to be recorded. We will not here go into a statement of the many personal and scientific reasons, which might be urged in favor of registration. Its utility, wherever known and understood, is admitted. It is worthy of such a decisive effort of the city authorities, as would secure the adop tion of an efficient system. It cannot be supposed that the other towns in the State will carry this useful law into effect, while its wholesome provisions are disregarded by Boston \u2014 the metropolis. To supply the facts, which should have been furnished by a good system of registration, an attempt was made in the census of 1845, to obtain them by personal inquiry; and for this purpose the questions in the schedule were inserted. (See Appendix A, p. 3, questions 7, 8, and 9.) Without going much into detail on this interesting subject, in this connection, we propose to state a few facts in relation to births, marriages, and deaths, and in reference to the tables in the Appendix. 1. Births. The records of births in Boston commenced in 1639, and are embraced in one volume from that time to 1689. The second volume covers the period, 1689 to 1744. Subse quently to the latter period, the number of entries in the regis ter gradually became less and less each year, until they almost entirely ceased. During the early part of last century, it was the general custom to baptize nearly all the children born. From 1731 to 1774, the number of these baptisms in Boston was ob tained annually from the clergymen, and published in the newspa pers. The practice, however, towards the latter part ofthe above named period, became less general, and is now unobserved ex cept among certain classes of religious professors. Though these abstracts may not contain more than two thirds or three fourths of the births that took place, yet we have deemed the facts worthy of being gathered and inserted in the table, referred"], [144, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 128 to in the Appendix, (p. 71.) The following statement may be interesting, as showing the relative proportions, which the aver age annual baptisms bore to the population in each decade : Average annual Proportion to Population. Period. Population. Baptisms. In 100. one in 1725 \u2014 1734, 13,000 430 3.30 30.23 1735 \u2014 1744, 17,000 578 3.40 29.41 1745\u20141754, 15,731 473 3.00 33.25 1755 \u2014 1764, 15,631 412 2.63 37.93 1765\u20141774, 15,520 442 2.84 35.11 The number of births during a part or all of this period, we are inclined to think, was as high as 5 per cent., or 1 in 20, of the population. An abstract of the number of births recorded for the last thirty-five years, is given in the second table referred to, (page 73,) not as being of any other value than to show how far the laws respecting registration are regarded. Public attention having been called to this subject more for two years past than formerly, several persons have given in the names of their whole families to be recorded. This has increased the number of entries during these years ; though in the abstract, the years of birth, and not the years of record, are regarded. The following is the result of the efforts to obtain information on this subject in the census of 1845. The whole number of living children ascertained to have been born in the year ending May 1, 1845, was 3592; and perhaps all were not obtained. They are classified as follows : Of parents, both of whom were born in Boston, Of parents, one of whom was born in Boston, and the other was not, Of parents, both of whom were born in the United States but not born in Boston, Of parents, one of whom is an American and one is not, Of naturalized foreign parents, Of unnaturalized foreign parents, 200 468 1,180 171 461 1,112 Total, 3,592 There were included in the above, 26 cases of twin-births, or 1 case to 138 cases of lying-in. In the rest of the State of"], [145, "BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS. 129 Massachusetts, during the same period, there was one twin case to 128 cases of lying-in. The proportion of males and females stands thus : Number. Proportion. Males, 1,824 50.78 as 100 or 103.16 Females, 1,768 49.22 to 96.92 to 100 Total, 3,592 100,000 The still-born during the same period, recorded by the Super intendents of Burials, and not included in the above, were 205. The number of births is in much greater proportion to the pop ulation among some classes of our citizens, than among others. The number of children baptized in the Catholic churches in Boston, was 1597 in 1844, and 1914 in 1845; and since nearly all Catholic children are baptized, this may be regarded as about the number of births, which take place in that part of our population. The births in the Broad street section, (see page 31,) con taining 2131 inhabitants, almost exclusively foreigners, were carefully enumerated, and amounted to 212 in one year, or one in fifteen of the whole population. This prodigious fecun dity is a most remarkable characteristic of our foreign popula tion, and generally prevails throughout the city. It is no doubt one of the principal causes of the increase in the number of deaths of children under 5 years of age, and of the low average age at death, which will be presently noticed. In some sec tions of the city, the births do not amount to one in 50 of the population. The proportion of births to the population, accord ing to the latest returns, was, in England, 1 in 31 ; in France, 1 in 35 ; in Austria, 1 in 26 ; in Prussia, 1 in 27 ; and in Russia, 1 in 23. 2. Marriages. According to the laws of Massachusetts, no persong can be married, without previously entering their inten tions of marriage in the records of the town or towns in which both parties reside. These intentions of marriage in Boston, from 1707 to the present time, are preserved. The number in 17"], [146, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 130 each year, from 1715 to 1774, and from 1811 to 1845, is em braced in the tables in the Appendix, (pages 71 and 73) ; and the following abstract shows the average annual number in each decade, and the proportion it bears to the population : Average Average Annual Proportion to Population. Periods. Population. Intentions. In 100 one in 1715\u20141724 11,000 205 186 53.65 1725\u20141734 13,000 234 1.80 55.55 1735 \u2014 1744 17,000 259 1.52 65.63 1745 \u2014 1754 15,731 250 1.58 62.92 1755\u20141764 15,631 238 1.52 65.67 1765\u20141774 15,520 231 1.48 67.18 1811 \u2014 1820 38,274 557 1.45 68.71 1821 \u2014 1830 58,281 950 1.63 61.34 1831 \u2014 1840 78,603 1,369 1.74 57.41 1841 \u2014 1845 102,620 1,893 1.84 54.21 It is remarkable how nearly the proportion of intentions of marriage to the population in recent periods, coincides with the same proportion 100 years before, as is indicated by the above result. These numbers, however, do not show the num ber of marriages solemnized, as will presently be seen, since many of the \"intentions\" were never carried into execution, and some were married elsewhere. The marriages, prior to 1663, were recorded in our oldest book, with the births and deaths. No records are preserved of the marriages from 1663 to 1689; and but few from 1751 to 1761 ; and it is believed that very many in nearly all the years, took place, which were not recorded. Great negligence has prevailed among many persons solemnizing marriage, in keeping records, and in making returns. We have counted the number recorded in the years, embraced in the tables referred to, (page 73,) not for the purpose of exhibiting the number of marriages, which actually took place, but to show how far the important matter of conforming to the law on this subject, has been re garded. It will be perceived that very many of the marriages are not recorded at all ; and we are precluded from the means of making any calculation, from authentic data, which would show the proportion of marriages to the population. This neg ligence renders it difficult, if not impossible, in many cases, to"], [147, "BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS. 131 prove a marriage, however necessary it may be, for the preser vation of our own rights, or the rights of others. The following account abstracted from the records for the six past years, exhibits some curious facts on this subject : No. recorded. In 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844, 1845 Of intentions of marriage, 1,489 1,587 1,729 1,810 1,987 2,351 In which both parties be- longed to Boston, 1,147 1,244 1,371 1,433 1,559 1,856 In which one party only be- longed to Boston, 342 343 358 377 428 495 Forbidden and withdrawn, 18 10 16 25 19 39 Marriages solemnized and recorded, 756 905 912 904 1,029 The returns of the clergymen are usually made to the city clerk about the month of April, for the previous year ; hence the marriages for 1845, are not recorded. The Roman Cath olic marriages were 439 in 1844, and 510 in 1845, or nearly half of the number recorded. The totals and proportions for the five previous years, appear thus : Number. 8,602 Proportion. 100.00 Intentions of marriage entered, Marriages recorded, Difference, 4,506 4,096 52.39 47.61 The result of the inquiry, in taking the census of 1S45, was not so successful in obtaining the exact number of marriages, as it was thought it might have been. There are so many changes in the residence of a city population \u2014 so many persons move in and out of the city \u2014 that it is believed to be very difficult, if not impossible, (judging from this trial,) to obtain an accurate account by personal inquiry of the inhabitants. If the inquiry had covered the period of the ordinary year, instead of the one ending May lst, as the law of the State requires, it would have been simplified, and perhaps been more successful. The only sure and correct method is registration at the time of marriage, for which an efficient system should provide. Deaths. The deaths are recorded with the births prior to 1663. From that time to 1689, no records of deaths are known to exist. From 1689 to 1719. they are preserved in a separate"], [148, "132 CENSUS OF BOSTON. volume; and from that time to 1810, very few are recorded. From 1810 to the present time, all the deaths, which have taken place in the city, have been recorded by the Superintendent of Burials. From 1704 to 1774, the sextons, or keepers of the burying grounds, made weekly returns to the newspapers, of the number of deaths in Boston, from which an annual statement was com piled and published. These annual statements have been gathered, and are embraced in the table in the Appendix, (page 71.) We think they may be relied upon with considerable con fidence, as being nearly a correct account of the deaths. The whites and colored are specified separately, though no other particulars, as to sex, age, season of the year, or cause of death, are given. They contain useful information, in relation to the health of the people during that period, and will be presently referred to more particularly. The following is an abstract of these tables for different periods : Average Average Annual Proportion to Population. Periods. Population. Deaths. In 100.

This is just double the mortality which pre vailed in 1826 to 1835, having been then only 1310 \u2014 one in 46, or 2.13 per cent. The lowest mortality in any single year, was 407 \u2014 one in 38, in 1763 ; and the highest, 909 \u2014 one in 14, in 1730 ; and 1009 \u2014 one in 15, in 1752. These were years in which small pox was particularly fatal. The mortality of the colored was much greater than that of the white population. In the period, 1745 \u2014 1754, it was as lovv as at any time, having been I in 18, or 5.58 per cent. This, however, showed a difference of 1.46 per cent., when compared with the whites. The highest mortality was in 1725 1734 \u2014 having been 1 in 12, or 8.63 per cent, and showing a difference from the whites, of 5.21 per cent. XX. PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE POPULATION. Climate is supposed to have an influence on the Public Health ; and it has seemed proper to present some facts in this matter, as introductory to this part of our report. No me teorological observations are presumed to be more correct than those made by Mr. Wm. Cranch Bond, the Director of the Observatory at Cambridge. Though they may differ slightly from similar observations made in the city, yet their great value renders them appropriate illustrations of our climate, and they are accordingly given in the Appendix, (page 68.) An abstract of the monthly means of the thermometer, deduced from the tables, is subjoined. The latitude of the State-house in Boston is 42\u00b0 21' 22.7\" ; and that of Cambridge, 42\u00b0 22'.

The winds and weather in Boston appear thus : \u2014 ( sss ) The facts in regard to the winds, and the great number of days in which they are variable, is a striking illustration, and an interesting feature of our climate. It is supposed that there is an upper current of wind blowing at all times, at different heights, from the SW., W. or NW., and which *s most per- ceptible in the early part of the morning. During the spring months especially, and in some other parts of the year, an under current of easterly or variable winds, often flows near the sur- face of the water or land, at different heights, extending to a greater or less distance from the ocean. These opposing winds, after a few days' continuance, generally produce a storm. These facts will account for the great nufnber of days of varia- ble winds. Public Health. \u2014 No subject is more intimately connected with the prosperity and happiness of a people, than the degree of public health that they enjoy. Some places and some cir- cumstances are known to be more favorable than others to the developement and prolongation of the vital energies of man ; and it is a matter of the greatest moment to the whole popula- tion collectively, and to each one individually, to know what facts exist in the place selected for a place of residence, which influence its character in this respect. There is a mode by which all this information may be obtained ; and by which the force of mortality pressing upon a people may in some degree be weighed and measured.

This mat ter may be illustrated by the information we already possess. It appears from accurate investigations now made, that of 100 deaths in two different places, 40 may take place in one and 60 in the other, showing that mortality presses upon the one with fifty per cent, greater force than upon the other. In a subsequent part of this report, it appears that of 16,414 deaths in the ten years, in the period 1831 to 1840, only 6.46 per cent, occurred in June, and 10.74 per cent, in September, show ing that mortality pressed upon us with 66.25 per cent, greater force in the latter, than in the former month. It also appears that in the last five years 4,859 persons died under five years of age, showing that mortality pressed upon that tender age equal to 46.62 per cent, of all the deaths. It moreover appears that in the same time 812 deaths were caused by scarlatina, showing that that disease, or that form or force of mortality, pressed upon us equal to 7.96 per cent, of all forms or forces. In like manner may this force be weighed and measured in all its details. The accuracy of the measurement depends, however, upon the degree of accuracy, by which the facts are registered and abstracted. We are aware that objections exist against inquiries of this kind \u2014 most people being satisfied with the generally received opinion, that \" no place is more healthy \" than the one they live in. We have also been told that this is a subject which might be interesting to a medical man, but not to the people generally ! Others have objected to any investigation, which might show one section of the city to be more unhealthy than another, because it would impair the value of real estate ! It has, however, appeared to us that if facts do exist, which show any section to be unhealthy, they should be made known, that the lives, the health, and the happiness of our fellow beings may be preserved ; and that the suffering, and the public and pri vate burdens which their premature sickness and mortality occa sion, may be averted. In proportion as we view human life, with all the manifold consequences of its preservation, to be more valuable than the few dollars and cents, more or less, which is"], [154, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 138 a landlord may receive from a tenant in an unhealthy locality, in the same proportion should we value the exhibition of facts which have a bearing on this subject. The private, social, or public consequences of sickness and mortality cannot be meas ured by money. This is a matter of great magnitude, and de mands a far more extended examination and discussion, than can be given in this report. Compared with it, all other investiga tions are unimportant. It concerns ourselves, our health, our existence ; and the persons, the health and existence of all that great mass of human beings that congregate in this growing, prosperous city. But how strongly soever we might be inclined to go into the subject, the object of this report throws around us such restraints, that a few only of the facts, which have been gathered, can now be presented. The principal sources on which we propose to rely for the information about to be presented, are the \" Abstracts of the Bills of Mortality,\" prepared by the Superintendent of Burying Grounds. Records have been kept by this officer, since 1810, of all the deaths that have taken place in the city, an abstract of which has been published annually since 1813. That for 1845, is printed entire in the Appendix (pp. 74 and 75), for the purpose of showing the mode in which the information has been given. All the previous abstracts are substantially in the same form. These papers are not preserved among the printed documents of the city ; and copies of them, for any considerable number of years past, are rarely to be found. It is very much to be regretted that some improvement has not been introduced into the mode of keeping the records ; and especially that abstracts have not been made in such a manner as would be of more practi cal utility, and more creditable to the city. We have, however, not deemed it expedient to make a new abstract from the original records, except for a single class of facts, which will presently be noticed ; but have confined ourselves principally to those al ready printed, an entire set of which we have before us. A general abstract ofthe number of deaths, designating each sex separately, and showing the proportion they bear to the population each year since 1811, has already been noticed"], [155, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 139 (see Appendix, p. 73). In this and most of the subsequent ta bles in relation to the deaths, we have divided them into four periods, for the purpose of comparison between each other, according as they occurred between 1811 and 1820; 1821 and 1830; 1831 and 1840; and 1841 and 1845. Tfie diseases, or causes of death, are given in the Appendix in two general tables. One arranged in alphabetical order, and containing the number who died by each disease in each year, since 1811; the other, classified with some modification, ac cording to the arrangement adopted by Mr. Farr, in the Reports of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England. A particular analysis ofthe annual printed abstracts shows not only, that a great variety of causes of death has ex isted, but very many different names have been given to the same cause. Many vague, unmeaning, and incorrect terms have been used. The nomenclature has been several times al tered, and a disease is often stated one year under a name dif fering from that ofthe same disease, contained in the abstract of another year ; and even in the same year, one and the same disease often appears under two synonymous names, sometimes under the popular, and sometimes under the scientific name. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to make a statistical analysis of each in detail. For the purpose of presenting the facts as concisely and intelligibly as possible, we have grouped those that are synonymous, or nearly so, under one name, and those operating in a similar way, or affecting a particular or gan, under one class. The advantages of such a classification are too obvious to need discussion. It has been well said that a \" nomenclature is of as much importance in this depart ment of inquiry as weights and measures are in the physical sciences.\" It has been considered sufficient by many, to present such ta bles as would exhibit the number of deaths only by each disease, for certain given periods of time. But this information appears to fall short of the result which ought to be presented in such tables. To render them useful, a comparison should be made between the number of deaths by each disease, and the whole"], [156, "140 CENSUS OF BOSTON. number of deaths in a certain given period, and this result should be again compared with a similar result concerning other periods. In this way the prevalence of any particular disease compared with that of other diseases at the same period, and with the same diseases at different periods, may at once be seen, and a judgment formed from the per centage, what pro portion of deaths that particular disease occasions, and whether it be on the increase or decrease. The sex, age, and place of nativity ofthe deceased, and the season ofthe year in which the deaths occurred, are not stated in connection with the diseases in our printed tables, as they should be. This is a great defect in our tables, and it should be avoided in future. The fatality of disease depends much on the age of the patients, and it is not the same in childhood, manhood, and old age, nor with the dif ferent sexes, and in the different months of the year. It is very desirable to know all such facts in relation to each disease, and the danger that man has to encounter in all ages, at all times, and under all circumstances. It is also useful to know the number of deaths by each disease in proportion to the deaths from all diseases. When facts like these are known, they may lead to inquiries into the causes of the increase or diminution of disease, under different circumstances ; and to the adoption of such measures as would modify or control them. Without further introductory remarks, we proceed to a more particular examination of the causes of death, as they are given in the classified table in the Appendix, page 84. It appears that In 1811-1820. 1821-1830. 1831-1840. 1841-1845 The Deaths from all causes were, 8,470 11,470 16,414 10,445 The Deaths from specified causes were, 7,522 9,554 15,077 10,196 Leaving for causes not specified, 948 1,916 1,337 249 This shows some improvement in presenting the causes of death. Zimotic Diseases. \u2014 This is the term used by Mr. Farr to designate all epidemic, endemic, and contagious diseases. It is the property of Zimotic diseases to prevail more at one season"], [157, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 141 than at another, or more in one locality than in another ; and to become epidemic, endemic, or contagious, under certain circumstances. The best index to public health may be de duced from the proportion in which these diseases prevail. This class of diseases appears to have caused 1 1 92 ; 2037 ; 4155 ; and 2892 deaths; or 15.85 ; 21.32 ; 27.56 ; and 28.36 per cent, of all the deaths, in the different periods, showing a large increase. This may be taken as an indication, that the lat ter periods have not been as healthy as the earlier ones, if, as has been supposed, an increase of this class of diseases, shows a decreasing degree of health. The table shows that cholera has decreased from 1.37 to .32 per cent., and cholera infantum has increased from .25 to 2.19 per cent. The kindred diseases of diarrh\u0153a and dysentery vary in their proportionate frequen cy, the latter causing 3.80 per cent, of all the deaths, in 1821 to 1830. Erysipelas has increased from 0.1 to .99. Fevers of all kinds caused 503 ; 602 ; 817 ; and 504 ; or 9.95 ; 6.29 ; 5.42 ; and 4.94 per cent, of all the deaths at the different periods, showing that this cause of death has decreased. Hooping cough has somewhat varied. Measles, scarlatina, and small pox are among the most fatal Zimotic diseases, and it may be proper to notice them more in detail. Measles was very fatal in 1713. In 1730, it prevailed exten sively but mildly. Few died. In 1759 and 1772, it caused many deaths. An examination of the tables in the Appendix shows the number who have died by this disease in each of the last thirty-five years. It appears to have been fatal in 149 cases in 1821. It was also the cause of many deaths in 1825, 1829, 1832 and 1835, producing in the last named year 188 deaths. It has also been fatal in many cases in each year since 1840. Scarlatina, or Scarlet fever. \u2014 Under this name are included cases of ' spotted fever,' ' putrid sore throat,' ' ulcerated sore throat,' ' throat distemper,' ' canker rash,' ' cynanche maligna,' &c, which are supposed to be nearly synonymous. The first notice of this disease, as it appeared in Boston, occurred in 1735 and 1 736. In those years it was often fatal. It has been said that 4000 were sick with it in Boston, of whom 1 in 35 died. At"], [158, "142 CENSUS OF BOSTON. that time it spread generally through the New England towns, carrying off in some instances whole families. In Kingston, where the usual mortality was not above 9 or 10, it rose in 1735 to 102, and an equal increase of mortality was found in other places. It is somewhat singular that after the expiration of a century, it should have prevailed again as one of the most fatal diseases of New England. I am not aware that a particular ac- count of its prevalence in Boston during the period, many years prior to 181 1, exists. Since then it has caused 30 ; 48; 972 ; and 812 deaths; or .40 ; .50; 6.45; and 7.96 per cent, of all the deaths in the different periods. A careful examination of the table will show, that it was particularly fatal in 1832, 1839, and 1842, causing in the last named year 273 deaths. It has also been fatal in every year since 1840. The suddenness of its attack, the indiscriminate selection of its subjects, the irregu lar mode of its operation, and its generally fatal termination, have rendered it one of the diseases most to be dreaded. The increased proportion of deaths of children may partly be attribu ted to the increase of this disease. \u2022Small-pox. \u2014 This disease prevailed in Boston as an epidemic in 1649, 1666, 1678, and 1690. It is said to have been very fatal in 1678, but we have no particular account of its victims. Mather said in 1698 \u2014 \" The small-pox has four times been a great plague upon us.\" \u2014 \" Often had one hundred bills desiring prayers for the sick been read in one day, in one of our assem blies. In one twelve-month, about one thousand of our neigh bors have been carried to their long home.\" In 1702, 313 died of the disease, being about 4.4 per cent, ofthe inhabitants. In 1721, the disease broke out with great violence; and 5,759 persons (more than half the inhabitants,) had it in the natural way, of whom 844, or 1 in 7 died. Inoculation was then, for the first time, introduced, but not without great opposition. Two hundred and forty-seven were inoculated, of whom 6, or 1 in 42 died. In 1730, it was estimated that 4,000 cases occurred, of which about one-tenth were by inoculation. Of these about 500 died. In 1752, the disease again appeared in Boston, and became very fatal. The town then contained 15,684 inhabitants; of"], [159, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 143 these 5,998 were supposed to have had the disease. One thou sand eight hundred and forty-three removed out of town. All the remainder, except 174, had the disease by inoculation, or in the natural way. We have compiled the following statement, to illustrate the prevalence of the disease at that period : \u2014 (ttt) It appears from this statement, that the liability to death by this disease among the colored, was about 50 per cent, greater than that among the whites, when taken in the natural way ; and more than three times as great, when taken by inoculation. The deaths took place in the different months of the year, as follows : \u2014 (mmm) In the twenty days, beginning May 19, there were 220 deaths, averaging 10 per day. On the 1st June, 25 took place. This disease occurred again in 1764, in 1776, in 1778, and in 1792. The following statement exhibits its ravages in the last named period. The town then contained about 18,000 in habitants, of whom 10,655 were supposed to have had the NATURAL. INOCULATED. Ratio per cent. Ratio per cent. Persons. Cases. Deaths. Cases. Deaths.

The rest had it. The cases by the natural way, and by inoculation, were as follow : \u2014 (vvv) The following table exhibits a view of the disease at different periods of its appearance in Boston, since 1720 : \u2014 (www) During the first twenty-seven of the thirty-five years, the period covered by the tables in the Appendix, it will be perceiv ed, that very few deaths occurred from this disease. From 1811 to 1820, only 6 ; from 1821 to 1830, only 8; and from 1831 to 1838, only 39; and most of these cases were at the hospital on Rainsford Island. It never appeared in the city as an epidemic until 1839, after the repeal of the law in 1836, which required persons, who were affected by the disease, to be immediately removed from the city to the hospital. Since then no sanatory regulations have existed to prevent its extension, except vaccination ; and the consequence has been, that the disease has existed at all times to a greater or less extent in the city. In 1839, 60 deaths occurred; 115, in 1840; and 185, in the last five years. During the present winter it has been more prevalent, and more fatal, than at any time during the last fifty years.

Diseases of Uncertain or General Seat. \u2014 The proportion under this class of the causes of death, was 29.30 ; 16.58 ; 14.07; and 15.48 per cent, of all causes, in the respective periods, showing a large decrease from the first ; the principal difference being in the number assigned to the indefinite terms of Infantile Diseases and Sudden Deaths. More accurate medi- cal observation, and greater care in making the returns and records, have given a more definite character to the causes of death, and assigned more of them to their proper places. Many cases, which would have been entered in the former periods un- der these names, have in the latter been entered under cholera infantum, or the other and more specific diseases of infancy ; or under apoplexy, diseases of the heart, and other causes of sudden death. This has apparently decreased the number of cases of infantile diseases and sudden deaths, and increased the number of cases of other diseases in the tables. These facts are to be considered in estimating the comparative mortality of the different diseases in the tables. An inspection of the tables will show great inequalities in the number, of entries in the different years from other causes. This is especially the case with atrophy, under which are included cases of ' debility,' ' decline,' ' cachexia,' ' emaciation,' ' marasmus,' &c. Since the laws of sporadic diseases are such as to produce about the same proportion of deaths in the same population in specified 19"], [162, "146 CENSUS OF BOSTON. periods of time, it is certain that these entries cannot be implicit ly relied upon. 3. Diseases oj the Nervous System. The diseases of this class show considerable uniformity in their prevalence. The only one which exhibits a very essential variation is Hydro cephalus, or dropsy on the brain. This disease caused 1.14; 2.83 ; 3.67 ; and 4.21 per cent, in the different periods. The whole class shows 562; 980; 1,717 ; and 1,067 deaths; or 7.47; 10.26; 11.39; and 10.47 per cent. 4. Diseases of the Organs of Respiration. Diseases of this class are more numerous than either of the other classes of sporadic diseases. Consumption, that great destroyer of human life, produced 1,891; 2,054; 2,306; and 1,543 deaths; or 25.14; 21.50; 15.30; and 15.13 per cent, at the different periods. From this statement it appears to have decreased more than one third from the first to the last period. Entire reliance, however, should not be placed on this statement. There is so much indefiniteness in the application of the term consumption, as well as many other terms in our annual ab stracts, that it should be regarded only as an approximation to the truth. The more accurate diagnosis recently observed has probably given a different classification to many cases, from that assigned to them in the first period. Consumption is, how ever, a most formidable disease, not in Boston particularly, but in all cities and country towns. Sufficient facts are known to show, that from one fourth to one seventh of all the deaths in the Northern and Middle States, and perhaps throughout the whole Union, and the civilized world, are caused by consumption. This frightful mortality is to be arrested, if at all, by means of prevention, rather than the cure of the disease after it has once become seated. Pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs, a kindred disease, caused from 5.79 to 7.38 per cent, of the deaths at the respective periods. The deaths from the whole class were 2,460; 2,802; 3,611 ; and 2,444; or 32.70 ; 29. 33 ; 23.95 ; and 23.97 per cent, of all the deaths from known causes. 5. Diseases of the Organs of Circulation. The diseases of"], [163, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 147 the heart and kindred organs, seem to have increased, having produced .30; .85; 1.36; and 1.88 per cent, of the whole deaths in the different periods, constituting nearly the whole of the deaths of this class. 6. Diseases of the Digestive Organs. Cholera, Cholera In fantum, Diarrh\u0153a, and Dysentery, the most prevalent and fatal of the diseases of these organs, have already been noticed under the Zimotic class. Ofthe sporadic diseases of these organs, En teritis, or inflammation of the bowels, was the most frequent and fatal, producing .08; 1.70; 2.39; and 3.16 per cent, of all the deaths ; and showing a decided increase. Other diseases of these organs, but not specifically described, such as ' Bowel Complaints,' 'Diseases of the Stomach and Bowels,' &c, have also increased; having been .01 ; 1.90; 2.23; and 2.55 per cent, in the respective periods. Information in regard to other diseases will appear in the table. This whole class produced 228; 645; 1,236; and 969 deaths; or 3.03; 6.75; 8.20; and 9.50 per cent, in the respective periods. 7. Diseases of the Urinary Organs. Gravel appears to have been the cause of the greatest number of deaths of this class. All of the class were 9 ; 30 ; 22 ; and 33 ; not at any time amounting to 1 per cent. 8. Diseases of the Organs of Generation. The cases of child-birth are sometimes given under puerperal fever, and puer peral fever under child-birth, though the two kinds of cases should always be entered and kept separate. 9. Diseases of the Organs of Locomotion. Under Rheumatism are included cases of Rheumatic fever , and under Diseases of the Joints, &c, are included cases of disease of the spine, hip, &c. The whole number of cases in this class has not amount ed to 1 per cent, in either period. 10. Diseases of the Integumentary System. This is a small class of diseases, having produced, according to the printed abstract, only .04; .18; .20; and .28 per cent, in the respec tive periods. Ulcers constitute the greatest proportion of these diseases. 1 1 . Old Age. The number in the abstracts, as having died"], [164, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 148 of old age, appears to have been 379 ; 420 ; 645 ; and 326 ; or 5.04 ; 4.40 ; 4.28 ; and 3.20 per cent. 12. Deaths from External Causes. These exhibit some variation. A less aggregate number appears in the latter than in the earlier periods. No person has been executed during the last ten years. Deaths from Intemperance increased from the first to the second period, but they are less than half in the last, compared with the period immediately previous, which is one evidence of the beneficial effects of the temperance re formation. Suicides have varied, but were fewer in the last named period. One death only by Hydrophobia has oc curred during the last thirty-five years. The whole class shows 371 ; 756 ; 1,035 ; and 431 ; or 4.93 ; 7.91 ; 6.86; and 4.23 per cent, at the different periods. From a general view of all the cases it appears that \u2014 The Deaths. In 1811-1820. 1821-1830. 1831-1840. 1841-1845.

A more particular analysis of the diseases might be made, but it is deemed inexpedient in this place. Those who feel interested in such matters are referred particularly to the tables in the Appendix. Still-born. The still-born interments are not registered in England, though they are on the continent of Europe, and gen erally in our American cities, where any records of deaths are kept. They ought always to be registered, as exhibiting inter esting facts in the physical history of man ; but having never had a separate living existence, they are excluded in all cal culations of comparative mortality. The following abstract exhibits the facts in a separate form in relation to these inter-"], [165, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 149 ments. The number each year appears in table, (Appendix, pages 82 and 83.) (zxi) The number of the still-born, and the proportion they bear to all the burials in the respective periods, appear as follows : 1811.-1850. 1821-1830. 1831-1840. 1841-1845. In Boston. Number.

The difference in the mortality of the sexes, is shown in the tables already referred to in the Appen dix, (pages 88 to 96.) There occurred 180 more deaths among males than among females in the period 1811 \u2014 1820; 420 in 1821 \u20141830; 402 in 1830\u20141840; and 69 in 1841 \u2014 1845.

An examination of these facts shows that this mode of comparison is the same as was partially developed in the previous one. If there be an increase of deaths of children under 5 years of age, or any other age, in one period, or in one place, as compared with another period or place, there must of course be a less proportion who survive all others above that specified age. The facts already developed in these two methods of calcu lation are full of interest, and should arrest attention. We first called the attention ofthe public to the alarming increase of in fantile mortality in a publication which was prepared in 1839, and then suggested that its causes should be investigated and if possible removed. In attempting then to account for this increase, we examined the original entries of deaths, and found that all the persons, who were interred in the Roman Catholic burying grounds, had been distinguished from the others in the records. This part of our population is composed principally, though not entirely, of the laboring classes ; and the inquiry was instituted, whether mortality pressed upon them with greater force than upon others. In speaking of this class separately, we do not wish to foster any prejudice ; their peculiar condition should rather excite our sympathy. They are the only persons, unfor tunately, who can be selected as a class. They are mentioned separately only to show the influence of circumstances. It is presumed that any other classes similarly situated would show the same results. If the records had specified, as they ought to have done, the locality of the death, the inquiry as to that influence might have been investigated. A list of those who died in the city, and were buried in the Roman Catholic grounds, was furnished by the late Superintendent of Burials, from which list the following statement was obtained and pub lished. 'Of the 1987 Catholic burials during the six years, 1833"], [172, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 156 to 1838, comprising 1028 males and 958 females, 61.39 per cent, were under 5 years of age. The still-born, during the same time, and in the same class, not included in the above, were 125, or 5.77 per cent, of the whole burials. About 5A per cent, only, or 112, lived to see 50 years osage ; and 30, or less than 2 per cent, lived to 70. During the year 1838, there were 439 burials, of whom 303, or 171 males and 132 females, were under 5 ; and 136, or 57 males and 79 females, were over 5. This is a mortality among those under 5, of 75 per cent, of the whole male deaths ; and 60 per cent, of the whole female deaths, leaving 25 per cent, only of the males, and 40 per cent, of the females, or 31 per cent, of both sexes, to survive that early age. This shows a great increase of infantile mortality, and will par tially account for the increase of the deaths under 5 years of age. The influx of unacclimated foreign immigrants, and the great number of families crowded into the houses in Broad street, Ann street, and other densely populated parts of the city, ren der the air very impure, and expose the lives of infants, who are compelled to breathe it, to disease and death. The influ ences of such circumstances are not confined to the places where they exist, but they are extended to the population in the neigh borhood ; and epidemics are generated, which are, no doubt, injurious to the general health of the city.' The records, from 1838 to the close of 1845, have been ex amined for the purpose of ascertaining whether subsequent in vestigation would confirm the above statement. From all the facts thus obtained, the following table has been compiled, show ing the number of deaths in this class of our population for ten years, 1836 to 1845, inclusive, divided into two periods of five years each ; the proportion that died at each specified age ; and the number that survived the first mentioned age."], [173, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 157 (cccc) This remarkable result confirms the former statements ; and shows that 60.88 per cent, in the first, and 61.66 per cent, in the second period, died under 5 years osage, leaving 39.12 in the first, and 38.34 of the second, to survive that age ! That 5.54 per cent, of the first, and 6.15 of the second, survived 50 ; and of these, half died in the next ten years, before they arrived to be 60. The average ages of those who who died under 20, over 20, and of all ages, were as follows : \u2014 Period. Number. Under 20. Over 20.

This would add a great annual increase, probably 2500 in the whole city, notwithstanding the mortality which prevails among chil dren. Death seems thus to be abundantly supplied with new materials to work upon ; and his agents are able to make easy victims. Children seem literally ' born to die.' It has been often said that \" the proportion of births to a population is greatest, where there is the greatest mortality.\" The facts above detailed seem to confirm this, though it is not strictly true.

It is drawn in ten squares or periods each way ; and each from left to right, representing by figures ten years of life ; and from the top to the bottom, ten per cent, of the survivors. Let us take 100 individuals from each of the four classes al ready mentioned\u2014 100 ofthe select lives of Preston, England; 109 of those who died at Newton; 100 who died in Boston 1841\u20141845 ; and 100 of the Catholics of Boston. If each of these classes of 100 persons had lived 100 years each each"], [175, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 159 class would have enjoyed 10,000 years of life, and all the squares in the cut would have been represented by white sur face. We have seen, however, that persons die at all ages, and some classes much younger than others. The proportion that survive the age at the top, in the several classes, is represented by curved lines drawn diagonally across the cut, \u2014 below these lines being light, to represent life, above the lines being dark, to represent death. The upper line represents the survivors at Preston, the next below, those at Newton, the third, those in Boston, and the fourth, the catholics. It will be perceived that 82 per cent, or 82 out of every 100, of the select lives of Pres ton pass the line of ten years, or survive that age, while only 34 per cent, or 34 out of every 100 Catholics, pass the same line ! That 38.75 per cent in Newton, survived 60 years, while only 9.95 in Boston, 1841, \u2014 1845, survived the same age ! Fol lowing out these comparisons in regard to other ages by the use ofthe tables already given (pages 154 and 157), and the cut, we show in a most forcible manner the great difference in the amount of life enjoyed by different classes. Thikd Method. \u2014 By ascertaining the proportion per cent, of persons surviving specified ages, but who die before the next speci fied age. This mode of ascertaining the law of mortality from the deaths alone, is more accurate than either of those before mentioned. It is found by dividing the number that died be tween two specified ages, by the number that survived the first mentioned age. We have constructed the subjoined table showing the number that survived each period ; and the number and proportion per cent, that died before the next period ; and the aggregate number of years of life, which those that survived and those that died, enjoyed ; and the average age of the sur vivors. In the first period in the table, it will be found that 5322 survived the age of five years, and of these 284 died before they arrived at 10. Dividing the latter by the former produces 5.33 as the per centage of deaths, as appears in the lower part of the table. Again, of 1,064 who survived 60, there died 456 before 70. Dividing the latter by the former, gives 42.85 as the per centage of deaths. In this way are all the ages"], [176, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 160 calculated.

It is found by adding the particular ages of all that die, and dividing the aggregate by the number of deaths. As statements of deaths are usually given, however, the particular ages are not mentioned, but only the number between specified ages. The average in such cases is found by multiplying the number that die, by the medium age between the two periods. Thus, those who die under one are multiplied by \\\\ ; those between 1 and 2, by 1 J ; those be tween 2 and 5, by 3\u00a3 ; those under 5, by 2J ; those between 5 and 10, by 7\u00a3 ; those between 10 and 20, by 15 ; those be tween 20 and 30, by 25 ; &c, because it may be supposed that the number in each period would on the average live half the period. The product is the aggregate number of years of life which each class enjoyed ; and the aggregate of all the pro ducts divided by the number of deaths at any age, the average age. This is not mathematically correct, but sufficiently so for all practical purposes. The aggregate number of years of life of all that survived, and their average age, appear in the above table (dddd, p. 160). It will be perceived that the average of all was 27.75 years in the first period ; 25.88, in the second ; 22.72, in the third ; and 21.43, in the fourth. That the aver age age of those who survived 60, was 73.07, in the first ; 73. 17, in the second; 72.79, in the third; and 73.17, in the fourth. These facts show that while the average age of all that died has decreased, that of those that survived 60 remained the same ; and a similar result appears in regard to other ages above 5 years. Deduct from the average age, the age at which the average is taken, and the remainder will be the chances of living, or the expectation of life at that age, deduced from this class of facts. Thus the average age at 60 was 73.17. Deduct 60 from that number leaves 13.17 years as the probable lifetime at that age. Other ages are calculated by the same method.

The average age at death is, however, adopted by some emi nent English statists. While these sheets were passing through the press, a statement from \" one of the most eminent,\" was published in the New York Medical and Physical Journal, from which we make the following extract, italicised as in the origi nal : \u2014 \" I find they [the New England towns and ' community,'] have fallen into those evils deeper than any whole communities in England, bad as I have shown them to be. In Boston the average duration of life appears to be lower than in Liverpool. The town of Lowell, which is praised for its excellent health, presents the most ghastly results of any I have met with. One year the average age at death appears to have been as low as sixteen, \u2014 in the worst town in England I have met with it is twenty for the whole community. In Liverpool, the average age at death after twenty is forty-eight. In Lowell it is in one year as low as thirty-seven. The infantile slaughter is worse even than in Manchester, as bad as are its cellars.\" We have no wish to disguise any actual evil arising from any cause, which may exist among us, to produce disease and short en the duration of life. On the contrary, we acknowledge we have many \u2014 very many, that should be removed; and we desire that all facts on this great subject should be spread be fore our community, that all practicable measures for ameliora tion, improvement and prevention, may be adopted. But when any statement, like the above, is put forth, by such eminent authority, as the measure of our general ' health,' in compari son with that of other places, it is deserving of notice and ex amination. Is it true ? Are the inferences just ? Is the appli cation of the principle correct ? We will examine it briefly, by referring to a few simple facts. We shall speak of Lowell, first, since what may be said in relation to that city will par tially apply to Boston. The first inquiry is \u2014 what are the ages of the population of Lowell? I have before me the national census of 1840, and"], [182, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 166 a city census taken May 1844, an abstract of which, with the deductions I have made from them, appears as follows : \u2014 (hhhh) This exhibits a most remarkable population, more so perhaps than can be found in any other place. It is on the average young \u2014 but peculiarly so; for while their average age was 23.16, in 1840, and 23.57, in 1844, there was still only 25 per cent, under 15, indicating that it has a larger proportion belong ing to the productive age than is elsewhere to be found. Eng land had 37 per cent, under that age. Is this condition of the pop ulation the result either of the health of the place, or of their occu pations? Certainly not. Lowell is but about 21 years old, and was built where nobody had lived before. Its population are mostly young emigrants from other towns, many of whom are op eratives in the manufactories. And they are not to blame, neither is the health of the city to blame, because they are not old, for they have not had time to become so. It is the result of una voidable circumstances; but such circumstances as increase the health and productive energies of the people. It would be more probable that such a population should have children than an older one ; and every additional child, (among whom mortality is universally greater than among adults) adds a probable in crease to the number of deaths. Young persons are almost the only persons that can die there, because there are few others to die. And, in an estimate of the average age, it would take twenty deaths of children under 15, to equal one person of 60 years of age. This of course must cause a very low average age at death ; but instead of being an evidence of inferior, it is rather an indication of superior health.

We will presently contrast these highly favorable results with similar ones concerning other places, showing their compara tive health. What is said in regard to Lowell is true, to a considerable extent, when applied to Boston. The rapid increase of the population of this city is principally owing to emigration from interior American towns, and from foreign countries. These immigrants are generally persons of the younger class, who, (especially among certain portions, as we have shown), are more likely to have, and do actually have, more children than an older and more stationary population. We acknowledge that our population is comparatively young. The risks of life, and especially infantile life, are increased by the increased den sity, and by other circumstances of a city population ; and in such a condition the proportion of children dying will be great er, and the average age at death less, than among a population of different circumstances, even if both, on the average, enjoy equally good health. We have constructed the subjoined table to exhibit a com parative view of the health, longevity, and chances of life, in different places, by showing the proportion of deaths to the living in three periods of life. The years of observation were 1844 for Lowell, as stated in the above table, 1845 for Boston, 1841 for England and her cities, taken from the Fourth Eng-"], [184, "168 CENSUS OF BOSTON. lish Registration Report ; and 1842 for Manchester, taken from the Report of the Health of Towns' Commission.

While, of all the inhabit ants, 1 in 69 died in Lowell, 1 in 53 died in Surry, 1 in 41 in London, and 1 in 29 in Liverpool ; showing that the chances of life, on the average of all ages, are 133 per cent, better in Lowell than in Liverpool ; and in the dependent and aged classes, they are even better than the general average.

It is not quite as favorable in the dependent, but more favorable in the aged classes.

That the principle of taking the average age at death alone, as a measure of the health of different places, is incorrect, and even absurd, when applied to places affected by immigration and other circumstances, as are Boston and Lowell. 2. That this principle, when applied to places, or to classes of persons, without being combined with the number, increase, rate and cause of increase, and other circumstances of the liv ing, will be likely to mislead the inquirer. 3. That the number of births, which take place in a given time in a population, and the number and ages of the living, as well as the ages at death, are indispensable elements of infor mation for correct estimates and comparisons of this kind.

What are its expenses ? and how much of it is preventable ? 1. Amount of Sickness. \u2014 In some places and seasons sick ness is greater than in others, but it is generally in proportion to the number of deaths, which take place. According to the investigations of Mr. Farr, an eminent English statist, it has been assumed as a principle \u2014 That the proportion constantly sick in a population is double the annual proportion per cent., which the deaths bear to the living, in that population. An increase in the force of mortality will decrease the proportion and duration of cases of sickness. According to the facts al ready given, the proportion per cent, of the deaths in Boston for the last year was 2.04, which being doubled is 4.08 ; and 4.08 per cent, of 114.366, is 4.666 \u2014 the number, on this hy pothesis, constantly sick in Boston. At some ages, however, the number is greater than at others. We have given (table gggg, p- 164) the proportion of deaths in each class, under 15, 15 to 60, and over 60. Applying the above principle con cerning sickness to these classes, we obtain the following re sults : \u2014 Ages Persons. Proportion Sick. Number Sick. Under 15, 35,442 7.06 2,503 15 to 60, 75,284 2.28 1,716 Over 60, 3,640 12.30 ,447 Total, 114,366 4.08 4,666"], [190, "174 CENSUS OF BOSTON. According to this estimate there are, on the average of the whole year, constantly sick 2,503 children, or persons ofthe de pendent class, 1 ,7 1 6 of the productive class, and 447 of the aged class. It has been proved, however, that in some seasons \u2014 August, September, and October, especially, the number of deaths of children is more than double the annual average. This would give about 5,000 sick in those months. We are inclined to think this is an over estimate, and that the amount of sickness is much less in Boston. Dr. Lyon Playfair, in an able report on the sanatory condition of the large towns in the county of Lancaster, England, in which Liverpool and Manchester are situated, published in the Parliamentary Report of the Health of Towns' Commission, states, that out of 324,041 cases before the Manchester Medical Institutions, during 12 years, there were 11,587 deaths, giving about 28 cases of sickness to 1 death ; and he assumes this as about the average proportion for the whole county \u2014 \" there are, every year, in Lancashire, 1,252,412 cases of sickness, each case being of three weeks' duration.\" Perhaps it may be safe to take these data for an estimate of the amount of sickness suffered in Bos ton, since they correspond in some respects with our local facts. It appears that out of 22,005 cases, which came under the Bos ton Dispensary (table ssss. p. 173) there were 791 deaths. This is 28 cases of sickness, nearly, to 1 death, agreeing with Dr. Playfair's calculation. The facts procured in the census enumeration show a much less proportion of sickness. Taking the above data, however, we obtain the following indication of sickness in Boston, for the year 1845. Population, 114,366 Number of Deaths (including still-born,) 2,585 Number of Cases, or attacks of Sickness, (2585x28) 72,380 Years of Life lost by Sickness, (742,380x3)-^52) ' 4,175 Loss of time per cent, in years, ofthe population, 3.65 According to these results, 63.28 per cent, of the population are, on the average, attacked once with some kind of disease, every year ; and 3.65 per cent, are constantly sick ; equal to"], [191, "PUBLIC HEALTH. 175 the loss of the entire life time of 176 individuals of the average age of our population. 2. Expenses of Sickness. \u2014 It is difficult to estimate the pecuniary losses which sickness occasions. But we will suppose the loss by incapacitating for labor, the expenses of lodging, nursing, medical attendance, medicine, &c. to be only $1,00 per day, the sickness of 4,175 individuals would amount annu ally to $ 1,523,875. And if we take into the account the dimi nution of the physical and mental energies of the survivors from sickness, and other depressing causes, the loss from the substitution of young and inexperienced labor for that which is skilful and productive ; the heavy burdens incident to the large amount of widowhood and orphanage ; the cost of maintaining an infantile population, many of which are swept off before they become adult, productive laborers ; and especially, the absolute loss of labor and life by premature deaths ; this amount would be increased to an indefinite extent. 3. Preventable Sickness. \u2014 Dr. Playfair states as the result of his investigation, that there are yearly in Lancashire 39S,O0O cases of sickness, and 14,000 deaths, which might be prevented. Of the deaths 11,000 are adults engaged in profitable la bor. And further, that every individual in that county, loses 19 years, or nearly one half of the proper term of his life, and that every adult loses more than 10 years of life, and, from premature old age and sickness, much more than that period of working abil ity ; \u2014 that \" the annual slaughter from typhus alone, in England and Wales, is greater than the loss sustained by the allied armies in the battle of Waterloo ! Yet what sort of a bat tle do we here find sought and won by preventable disease against the population of the county of Lancaster ! What would be thought of a war in which 5,000 of the able bodied men in one county fell every year in battle ? And yet this is only one half of the number annually slaughtered in that county by removable epidemics ! Yet this annual loss of able bodied men, so much greater than the most cruel of known wars in modern times, is scarcely more severe than the loss sustained by the continued physical deterioration ofthe survivors. It was a mat ter of constant complaint to me by the recruiting officers in the"], [192, "176 CENSUS OF BOSTON. various districts of the county, that the sons are less tall than the fathers, and that the difficulty is constantly increasing of obtaining tall and able bodied men.\" These results, though made in reference to a foreign popula- tion, are applicable, in a limited extent, to our own city. Like causes produce like diseases and like effects on man, wherever found. Though few cities of its size, are more cleanly or more healthy, as a whole, than Boston, yet even here a large space is left for that advancement towards perfection, that might be attained. We have shown the great destruction of infantile life which prevails here, and that certain classes of epidemic diseases are increasing. The \" battle \" and \" slaughter \" be- tween avoidable disease and the people, exist in Boston to some extent, as well as in Lancashire. We have no doubt, however, that one third of all the cases of sickness, and ofthe deaths, might be prevented. We have no doubt that 24,000 of the estimated 72,380 cases of sickness, that 800 of the 2,585 deaths, and that $500,000 of the estimated expenses of $1,500,000, might have been prevented last year, had the laws of life and health, the causes of diseases, and the means of pre vention, been more generally known and observed. And in such a case we should have avoided, instead of suffering, much of the public and private burdens of widowhood and orphan age, and the unnumbered pangs of mental and physical anguish, which premature death has occasioned. It behooves the city authorities \u2014 it behooves every individual citizen, to seek out and remove every removable cause of dis ease and death, in whatever section of the city, under whatever circumstances, and among whatever class of citizens, it may ap pear. An increase in the number and density of a population increases the liability to disease. Greater caution should there fore be taken in the structure of our dwelling houses, our school houses and our work shops, to secure better ventilation, that we may better enjoy that indispensable element of life pure air. More strict attention should be given to internal and exter nal cleanliness. Pure water should be introduced into every dwelling house. All vegetable and other offal should be removed before it decays and poisons the atmosphere. Our excellent sys-"], [193, "GOVERNMENT OF THE POPULATION. 177 tem of sewerage and drainage should be further extended. A more strict supervision should be exercised over cesspools, pri vies, and all other noxious agencies to the public health. And especially should every individual take care of his own health, and strive, as far as possible, to live without being sick. XXI. GOVERNMENT OF THE POPULATION. The Government of the city consists of a Mayor, 8 Alder men, and 48 Common Councilmen, composing two boards, who together are denominated the City Council. They are chosen annually, the Mayor and Aldermen from the people at large, and the Common Councilmen, 4 from each of the twelve wards. The Legislative power is vested in the City Council, and the Executive power in the Mayor and Aldermen. The Police consists of the Mayor, 1 Marshal, 1 Deputy Marshal, 22 Police Officers, 46 Constables, 1 Captain of the Watch, 14 Constables ofthe Watch, and 153 Watchmen. The Judicial Authority is exercised by the Judges of the United States and State Courts, who hold their sessions here; and by I Judge of Probate, and by 3 Judges of the Justices' and Police Courts, who are especially appointed by the Governor and Council for the city. There are also elected annually in each ward, 2 members of the School Committee, and 1 Overseer of the Poor, for the special management of these departments of our government. There are likewise elected in each ward, for the government of its meetings, a Warden, a Clerk, and four Inspectors of Elections. All the subordinate officers are appointed by the Mayor and Aldermen, or are chosen by the City Council, in convention, or by concurrent vote. m"], [194, "CENSUS OF BOSTON. 178 XXII. CONCLUSION. We have now presented facts on the several subjects which we proposed to illustrate. The investigation has increased the size of the Report, and imposed an amount of labor, which was not anticipated at its commencement. And yet several of the subjects are very imperfectly illustrated, much less so than we desired, and their magnitude seemed to require ; and several others, not noticed at all, might with propriety have been included in a work of this kind. It has been deemed best, however, to bring the Report to a close. We have endeavored to present the facts with the utmost brevity ; and have made no other effort in style than was neces sary in order to be clearly understood. The facts generally speak to the eye, and convey their own lessons of instruction. We have rarely obtruded our own opinions, or indulged in speculations, except where necessity seemed to call for them ; neither have we had a desire to give or suppress a fact, which was deemed useful, from any motive. The only bias we have been conscious of indulging, was that in favor of truth. If more time had been allowed to have gone through the investi gation ; or if the field of our labors had been, in some cases, less a wilderness \u2014 if its paths had been before trodden, and its courses marked out, our task would have been easier, and we could have presented a more satisfactory work, and in a less period of time. As it is, it would not be surprising, if, in the great mass of figures and calculations, some errors should have es caped detection, though much labor and care have been be stowed to avoid them. Great assistance would be afforded to the statist who may hereafter describe the progress of the city, if some improvement were introduced into the modes of gathering, arranging, and preserving the various facts that occur from time to time, in regard to matters which it may be proper to notice. And we venture to recommend to the various departments of the city"], [195, "CONCLUSION. 179 government, to all associations, churches, and religious socie ties, and to all others concerned, that greater care be taken to systematize and preserve the statistics of their labors. We also recommend that hereafter, in every successive period of five or ten years, all the important facts of such period be gathered and published, to exhibit the comparative growth and progress of the city. The information here given, we have persuaded ourselves, will be duly appreciated by those who regard facts as necessary to the illustration of the history and condition of a people, and of their means of progress and prosperity. Some of the facts will be new to very many of our citizens, and most of them are not generally known. They will afford food for thought and speculation to all, who view human society as capable of depres sion or elevation. They are generally highly creditable to our city, and exhibit a people making rapid progress in wealth, and numerical greatness, and willing to distribute their wealth to aid others in a similar progress, or to assist the less fortunate. While some facts are presented, which it were desirable should have been otherwise, there are many others, of which our city may well be proud. The improvements which are in progress and in contemplation will make Boston still more worthy of dis tinction. We may safely say that few cities of ihe same extent of territory can present stronger hopes of suture progress. In the benevolent operations of our citizens, the poor and unfortu nate, the foreigner and the native, and even the criminal, are not neglected. Inducements are offered to the vicious to re form ; and to the reformed, to persevere in their course. Vigorous efforts are continually in progress to promote that \" righteousness which exalteth a nation ; \" and to suppress vice, which has been justly denominated ': a disgrace to any people.\" And may each successive investigation show that Boston has made an onward and upward advancement in everything re lating to the health and physical welfare of its citizens, to their prosperity and increase of wealth, to their social enjoyments, and to their intellectual and moral greatness.
