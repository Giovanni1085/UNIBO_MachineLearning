My Mary, When the day comes, you shall be richly dowered ; Richer than half your noble ladies are, Whose fathers wear their acres on their backs, And starve for sake of show. Where's the lad Roy ? No signs of him again ? Mar. No, father, none. From early morning he has been abroad. Ful. Out on the puppy ! He outstays my patience. Had I not loved his dear dead father well, And owed him my first rise, by this good hand Which thrives upon the work so fairly learned, I would not house this idler for a day. Mar. Have patience, father ; he is fair and young, And all his youth pleads warmly in his blood For space and freedom. Be not hard with him, But rather turn your anger upon me, Who have not power to keep him at his desk, As, maybe, I should have. FUL. On you, my girl ! My blessing and my crown ; Look up at me !

How stands the ledger ? (to TlM) TlM. Master Fuller, well. Ful. That's right ; stick well to work, 'twill stick to you. I must go out.

There is always some thing between me and them, which makes wild work with the units and tens. Oh, Mistress Mary, why havn't I Roy's luck ? I wouldn't waste it as he does. Mar. Hush, Tim.
