When my father, the late Captain William Siborne, Unattached, was engaged in the construction of his Model of the Battle of Waterloo, he was authorised by the General Commanding-in-Chief \u2014 Lord Hill \u2014 to issue a Circular Letter to the several surviving Officers of the Battle who might be in a position to afford him the in formation necessary for the completion of his undertaking. Copies of this letter, and of the plan which accompanied it (on one half the original scale), are annexed. A great number of letters were sent to him in reply, and subsequently, when writing his History of the Campaign, he received many additional letters and memoranda relating, not only to the precise period of the Battle represented on the Model, but also to the opera tions and incidents of the Campaign generally. These letters were written to Captain Siborne with the knowledge that the information contained in them would be conveyed to the public. The greater number of the letters, amounting to several hundreds, are still in my possession, and as the 75th anniversary of the Battle occurred last year, and general attention has been redirected to that great event, I have thought that the publication of a selected portion of them might be of interest, not only to the Army, particularly to those Regiments or Corps which took part in the Campaign, but also to the public generally. Many families and individuals will here find re corded the original accounts given by relatives who served in the Waterloo Campaign of what they experienced and of the parts which they played in it."], [14, "VI WATERLOO LETTERS. In some few cases the letters were not sent direct to Captain Siborne, but were forwarded to him for his information by those to whom they were addressed. A great number of the letters or memoranda refer to more than one of the Actions or operations of the Campaign, but as the dividing them into detached portions for the purpose of strictly adhering to the sequence of events would lead to great confusion, I have found it preferable to leave the letters as they stand, and by marginal notes or other references assist the reader in recognising the situation described in the text. Where practicable also, portions of the plan on which the writers laid down the positions of their Regiments or Corps are reproduced, or else the latter are otherwise indicated. The publication of some information at the moment intended to be private cannot, so far as it relates to the incidents of the war, be looked upon, after the lapse of half a century, as a breach of confidence. As a rule, however, statements of a purely private or irrelevant nature, repetitions in subsequent letters by the same writer, and information regarding the state of the crops on the Field of Waterloo (necessary for the construc tion of the Model), are omitted. Where single or isolated statements may seem to be at variance with the descriptions of events given in Captain Siborne's History of the War, it should be remembered that those descriptions were ouly finally decided on, either after further correspondence with the same writers, or from the careful comparison of a number of various and often conflicting accounts. The following may be considered as the order of the different operations of the Campaign, and principal phases of the Battle of Waterloo, to which the letters chiefly refer : \u2014 The receipt of intelligence from the Allied outposts (or rather want of it, previous to the 15th of June), and consequent hasty concentration of the troops towards the line of advance of the French Army."], [15, "PREFaIOE.

There was a small river in the rear, with a bridge over it at Genappe, and my Staff had discovered two fords at half-a-mile distance on the right and left of it. The centre Column, which was to pass by the bridge along the chaussee, consisted of the Artillery and two Brigades of Heavy Cavalry, with the 7th Hussars and 23rd Light Dragoons as a Rear-guard. Two Brigades of Light Cavalry retired by the ford on the left, and (I think) three by that on the right. We had Ney's Corps, which had fought the Battle of Quatre Bras, still in our front, but making no signs of moving. About 1 o'clock p.m., however, very large masses of Cavalry began to show upon our left, and upon the road from Namur. It was obvious they were coming on, and I therefore withdrew, and sent back the Infantry and the 11th Light Dragoons that had been in front ; and, shortly after this, the Enemy's Artillery and Cavalry advanced with rapidity and opened a smart fire.

On quitting Sir Hussey Vivian, Lord Anglesey joined the Duke of Wellington, and it was about this time that the last attack by the Enemy took place. The Infantry had then formed into line four deep.

It was now that Lord Anglesey directed me to go with verbal instruc tions to General Officers commanding Cavalry Brigades, authorising them to act discretionally under certain limita tions it were needless to mention here.

I shall be glad to give you all the information my memory retains of the circumstances to which your note refers. In reply to the first question, as to the conduct of the Dutch Brigade of Heavy Cavalry, the impression still on my mind is that they did show a lamentable want of spirit, and that Lord Anglesey tried all in his power to lead them on, and while he was advancing, I believe I called his attention to the fact of his not being followed. The Household Brigade at this time were very much reduced. Conduct of the Dutch Cavalry, To your second queiy, I should prefer referring you to the minutes of the General Court-martial, which took place on Colonel , of the Cumberland Hussars, near Paris, about the month of August, 1815. My evidence went to the effect that Lord Anglesey, seeing that Regi ment moving to the rear (about five o'clock), desired me immediately to halt it. On delivering the order to the Colonel, he told me that he had no confidence in his men, that they were Volunteers, and the horses their own property. All this time the Regiment continued moving to the rear, in spite of my repeating the order to halt, and asking the Second in command to save the character of the Regiment by taking the command and fronting them. I wras unsuccessful, and in the exigence of the moment I laid hold of the bridle of the Colonel's horse, and remarked what I thought of his conduct : but all to no purpose. and of the Cumberland Hanoverian Hussars.

Thev did not"], [45, "GENERAL STAFF. 10 Sir Horace Seymour. even obey this order, but went, as was reported, altogether to the rear. I have endeavoured to simplify this statement as much as possible, and should you wish for any further explana tion, I shall be happy to give it. I add two or three anecdotes connected with the three days which fell under my own observation which may assist the work on which you are engaged, and which, it appears to me, no one has ever undertaken the subject with such prospect of success. On the 1 6th, as A.D.C. to Lord Anglesey, with his Lordship I joined, and found the troops engaged. \\ery shortly afterwards we found the Duke of Wellington, with the Headquarter Staff, in front of the Farm House of Quatre Bras. The French were in force formed on the road, the service of their Artillery beautiful, supported by Cuirassiers, who frequently charged up the road, dis comforting the Duke and the Staff on each occasion, until Lord Fitzroy Somerset lined a ditch parallel with the road with some Infantry, unseen to the Enemy, who the next time they moved forward were received with such a volley that scarcely a man of the Squadron escaped, after which there was no forward movement on their part on that part of the position.

I was then ordered to with draw the 2Sth, and on returning to Quatre Bras they certainly must have turned to the right, and rejoined their own Brigade. I had taken them at the moment of their reaching the point of Quatre Bras, having myself just returned from riding through the Bois de Bossu by direction of Sir Thomas Picton. The 95th ought to have been moved down in the first instance to Gemioncourt. They were, however, sent to occupy the strip of wood on the left of the Namur road, opposite Piermont.

My placing it so, hastily, in my journal was most probably an inference of the moment. To my eye, the 92nd with its left flank brought up, formed our extreme left when dealing with the Enemy's right Column of attack ; the 44th must have been beyond, but not so prominently engaged at the moment. I see the 92nd now, lining a gentle ascent, opposed \"to the Enemy's right flank ; but I recollect nothing to its left.

Sir Andrew Barnard, perhaps, could satisfy you on this point. I am surprised that your Artillery reports make no mention of it. The Brigade of Netherlanders were certainly in line before the French Columns advanced, and considerably down the slope, so that Rogers' Guns fired over them, first in reply to the French cannonade, and afterwards at the advancing Columns as they broke from the wood [?], and till they reached the bottom, and began to ascend our own hill.

Our first visit was to Maitland, who would not permit me to remain with him. A boy of fifteen, with a maimed arm and weak frame of body, would not have proved a very available A.D.C. We then rode up to the hero of the day, and remained some time with him. During this period the musketry was so sharp that one of the Duke's Staff urged him to retire a little. My father and myself then proceeded to the left of our line, accompanied part of the way by the late Sir J. Elley. We reached Picton's Division, and after some little time, while my father was talking to that or some other distinguished Officer, the right of the French Line advanced. We were then urged to retire, but my father remained, and, turning to me, said, \" I'm glad to see you stand fire so well.\" This was more than my horse did, for I expected every moment to be run away with, probably into the French fire. After a certain period, there were several charges of Heavy Dragoons, and I have no doubt whatever but that my father was the person alluded to by you as addressing the Inniskilling Dragoons, for no one else in plain clothes was near the spot. The whole of the morning he talked to his friends, and made his remarks as if he was on service, not an amateur. I perfectly remember a very heavy Officer of some Heavy Dragoon Regiment being dis mounted, and being carried to the rear, which must have been after Ponsonby's charge. We then again proceeded to the right, but at this time the firing was so heavy, and the ground so strewed with the slain, that we retired, and returned leisurely to Brussels.

In making the charge to which I have alluded, the right of the Brigade was thrown forward in order to sweep the high road, along which the Enemy's Columns were advancing against La Haye Sainte, and by my dotted lines I wish to give some notion of the direction it took. As I was posted on the left, I can speak to that dotted line with more confidence than the other, both as to its direction and length. In our rear I saw posted for our support the Duke of Cumberland's Hanoverian Hussars. According to the printed accounts, this Regiment ran away into Brussels as we advanced to the charge. I saw Ponsonby's Heavy Brigade also charging along with us, in a nearly parallel line on the other side of the road. Soon after our left had crossed the high road, it became mingled with Ponsonby's right.

A short struggle enabled us to break through them, notwith standing the great disadvantage arising from our swords, which were full six inches shorter than those of the Cuirassiers, besides its being the custom of our Service to carry the swords in a very bad position whilst charging, the French carrying theirs in a manner much less fatiguing, and also much better for either attack or defence.

Moreover, I always understood that it was down the slope of the position to the right of La Haye Sainte that Major Packe of the Blues was killed.

I find him very oblivious of all the circumstances con nected with the Brigade on the 18th excepting one, which I think is satisfactory \u2014 viz., the advance of the Brigade to the first charge. He distinctly remembers that he com manded the centre Squadron of the King's, which, as the Blues were in second line for support, there being two Squadrons of each Regiment of Life Guards, and three of the King's, was consequently the centre Squadron of the Brigade. He remembers that on advancing, Colonel Fuller placed himself by him, and that the first obstacle they encountered was the road which runs along the top of the"], [75, "SOMERSET'S CAVALRY BRIGADE. 17 2nd Life Guards. ridge, that it was too wide to leap, and the banks too deep to be easily passed, and that having crossed it, the next obstacle was the enclosure of the farm of La Haye Sainte. Now this seems to agree perfectly with the appearance of that road as laid down upon the plan you sent me.

Meantime Colonel Fuller must, on arriving at the farm of La Haye Sainte, have turned to his right, for I believe there is no doubt of his having been killed down the slope of our position, to the right of La Haye Sainte.

I therefore think it very probable that, when the struggle immediately following the shock of the two lines began to turn in our favour, the Cuirassiers in front line, finding their escape to the rear obstructed by the dense crowd of their comrades, they should endeavour to get away by their right, which must have still been com paratively open, our left Squadron being not yet in line ; and this will account for their rushing down that hollow way as described by Capt. Kincaid. For you will observe that after returning from the movement to the left by Threes, which took a part of our Brigade across the chaussee, the right and centre Regiments formed line by wheeling up Threes to the left, and immediately ad vanced to the attack. There being no time to be lost they were not allowed to wait till the whole was in line, conse quently our extreme left being still moving by Threes to its right after the preceding portion of the Brigade had formed its line and commenced a forward movement, the left was obliged to scramble into line as it could, whilst that Line was every moment getting away from it towards the front, so that our right and centre may have met the Cuirassiers, and the latter begun to fly along the hollow way, whilst the left Squadron, 2nd Life Guards, was getting into the still advancing Line. You will under stand by this what I mean by the Cuirassiers finding an escape open to them by their right, as well as the possibility of their having been just before that moment fired upon from the hollow way by the Germans, without the circumstance having been noted (in the hurry and bustle) by our Brigade or any one else. Some of the Cuirassiers escaped by the hollow way in rear of La Haye Sainte, as seen by Captain Kin caid, 95th Pities, sta- tioned on the other side of the main road. Very truly, &c, S.

Squadron and fell dead immediately, but that was much later in the afternoon. Upon thinking the matter over I very much incline to adopt your opinion of the Blues having been placed in support on the primary arrangement of the first charge, and then finding themselves in front line before they almost knew where they were. The impetuosity with which the front line swept over the Enemy must have left behind quite a sufficient number for the Blues to deal with when they came up, and even to lead them to imagine them selves quite in front. The Blues in support at first, after- wards joining the front Une. On the other hand, I do not think your argument of Lord Anglesey's general tactics, nor what he wanted to do with the Greys in Ponsonby's Brigade, a conclusive argu ment. For I remember that, at the time, I often heard him blamed for having thrown away our Brigade, by making it charge without an adequate support. You may also remember that I told you in my first letter that before the first charge, when we were all lying on the ground, by order of Lord Edward, in order to avoid as much as possible the effect of the Enemy's cannonade, I saw a certain Hanoverian Regiment, which we knew as \" The Duke of Cumberland's Hussars,\" in line in our rear. They were in rear of the 2nd Life Guards, their left not far from the chaussee, and immediately in front of the hedge or skirt of the forest that was between the field of battle and the village of Waterloo. My thoughts at the time were what could possess them to sit upon their horses to be knocked over by cannon balls when they saw our Brigade upon the ground. I always have understood that this Regiment was ordered to charge in our support, but that when we attacked they ran away. I remember seeing the Regiment afterwards doing duty in Paris as Waggon Train, assisting the Commissariat, and understood that to be their punishment, whilst their Colonel was cashiered.

The 2nd (Heavy) Cavalry Brigade was com posed of the 1st or Boyal Dragoons, the 2nd or Boyal North British Dragoons, Scots Greys, and the 6th or Inniskiliing Dragoons, hence also known as the \" Union Brigade,\" and was commanded by Major- General Sir William Ponsonby, K.C.B., who was killed in the first charge at Waterloo. The Brigade, together with the Household Brigade, formed the main portion of the Centre Cavalry Column in the Betreat on the 17th June. After passing through the town of Genappe, it was deploj'ed on the right of the Brussels-Charleroi Boad, and engaged for some time in skirmishing with the Enemy's Cavalry, and checking their advances, until gradually withdrawn by the road to the Position at Waterloo.

The left wing of the 23th Begiment fired into the Column at the moment the Boyals charged it, and afterwards assisted them in securing great numbers of Prisoners. The Inniskillings in the centre advanced further so as to charge two Columns which were moving up in support of the others, and similarly over threw them, and captured an immense number of Prisoners.

As the Enemy advanced up to the crest of the position on their side, the Heavy Brigade was also moved up on ours. Our Brigade came up to one hundred yards in rear of the little sunken road and hedge.

We waited there for a few minutes till the head of the Enemy's Column had just crossed the sunken road \u2014 as I understood \u2014 to allow our Infantry to pass round the flanks of Squadrons, and also that the Enemy should be a little deranged in passing the road, instead of our being so, had we charged across the road.

This is the notion or recollection that I have of the affair. I saw nothing of the Belgian Light Dragoons in the melee. The Dutch Belgian Infantry yielded with slight or no resistance to the advancing Columns, and got quickly to the rear ; and not in the stubborn, reluctant, deliberate way of our Infantry. I don't recollect anything of the Dutch Artillery at that moment. Our Artillerymen, as well as Infantry, kept firing into the Columns as long as The Gun^ as possible.

You are rightly informed that Sir William Ponsonby did his best to prevent the further advance up the opposite ridge and towards the left of the French cannon, and so did all the Officers of any discretion about him ; but finding that we were not successful in stopping the troops, we were forced to continue on with them in order to continue our exclamations to halt, as we all, except I suppose the Cornets, saw what would happen.

Until within about a quarter of an hour of the charge of General Ponsonby's Brigade on the Count D'Erlon's Corps, the Brigade had been standing in line in the hollow behind La Haye Sainte, with their right about 250 yards on the left of the Brussels road. The cannon shot that passed over the crest of the ridge beginning to fall pretty fast, the Brigade was advanced slowly towards the ridge by the Troops wheeling to the left, and taking ground to the right by the flank march of Threes.

Royals and Inniskillings in front line, Greys in sup port.

The Infantry that, I pre sume, 'had previously lined the hedges, were wheeled by Sections to their left, and were firing on the left fiank of the French Column, the head of which had at this time passed both hedges unchecked, as far as I could perceive, and were advancing rapidly. From the nature of the ground we did not see each other until we were very close, perhaps eighty or ninety yards. The head of the Column appeared to be seized with a panic, gave us a fire which brought down about twenty men, went instantly about and en deavoured to regain the opposite side of the hedges ; but The left wing of the 28th fired on the Column, the head of which had passed both hedges of the Wavre road."], [99, "PONSONBY'S CAVALRY BRIGADE. 71 Royal Dragoons^ we were upon and amongst them before this could be Th*3 Royals effected, the whole Column getting into one dense mass, the Column is the men between the advancing and retiring parts getting thrown into & ora o confusion. so jammed together that the men could not bring down their arms, or use them effectively, and we had nothing to do but to continue to press them down the slope, the right Squadron of the Royals naturally outflanking them, as the centre one (which I commanded) also did to a certain degree.

But to reply to your questions as well as, at this dis tance of time, I can.

On reaching it, I ran my sword into the Officer's right side a little above the Lip joint. He was a little to my left side, and he fell to that side with the Eagle across my horse's head. I tried to catch it with my left hand, but could only touch the fringe of the flag, and it is probable it would have fallen to the ground, had it not been prevented- by the neck of Corporal Styles' horse, who came up close on my left at the instant, and against which it fell.

His recollections are that the 2nd Brigade Heavy Cavalry, composed of Royals, Greys, and Inniskillings, were in column, and wheeled into line; that Sir William Ponsonby, about mid-day (we were on the slope of a hill), rode to the crest (La Haye Sainte), called to me to come to him ; that I returned to the Brigade, that Sir W. Ponsonby shortly afterwards touched or moved his hat ; and that I advanced the Brigade in line. Sir W.

Hankin of the Greys having fallen from his horse, the circumstance having been reported to me; my looking round, &c, a Trumpeter being killed, and I am almost in clined to think the Greys were formed in a second line for a time ; but whether afterwards brought up into line with the other two Regiments, or whether the Greys continued in support, I can hardly take upon me to say. Certain it is that the Royals and Inniskillings were in line, and in the first, if there was a second. With deference, I should say that the military maxim of a support was more applicable to partial Cavalry charges than to the operations of a general Action, and therefore I should not be much swayed by the maxim in deciding whether the Greys were in support or in the first line. I have since seen Col. Madox, but he, being on the right, can fix nothing as to the Greys, who were on the left. He recollects the Artillery bearing on us before we advanced.

The Inniskillings came in contact with the French Columns of Infantry almost immediately after clearing the hedge and (I should call it) chemin creux. We all agree in thinking that the French Columns had nearly gained the crest \u2014 perhaps twenty to thirty yards down the slope. We think there were three French Columns. The French Column did not attempt to form square, nor was it, so far as we could judge, well prepared to repel an attack of Cavalry. Our impression is that, from the formation of the ground, the Cavalry was not aware what they were to attack, nor the Infantry aware of what was coming upon them. Sir William Ponsonby knew, and I knew, he having called me to the front ; other individuals The Cavalry came unex pectedly on the French Infantry."], [114, "WATERLOO LETTERS. 86 Inniskillings. may also have known, but not the mass. I have always considered it a splendid illustration of the maxim that the attacks of Cavalry against Columns of Infantry should be unforeseen and unexpected.* I could give an example, in the Peninsular War, of a similar result from the formation of the ground, as also of opposite results where the Infantry saw, and prepared accordingly. Our recollections are that the French skirmishers must have rejoined their Columns before, or at the moment of our clearing the hedge. We do not recollect seeing them. The French Infantry had no time to throw them selves into The right and centre Squadrons of the Inniskillings certainly came in contact with a French Column. The left Squadron may have had to bring up its left shoulders to come on the flank of the Column, but I rather think the French Column extended as far as our left. square Our left Squadron cut off (if I recollect) about 2,000 Prisoners. I shall send your query to Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, and let you know. I am inclined to think that the Artillery by which our left was annoyed must have been placed on the opposite heights.

The French Guns were on the opposite height, not with the We cannot say that the Inniskillings were checked by any body of Cavalry in line, but rather think that, flushed by extraordinary success, they went on with so attacking Columns. * The Cavalry, on reaching the crest, or a moment before that, saw, from being a little raised on horseback, the solid Columns, and increasing their speed, attacked with great impetuosity, cheering by the three countries, England, Scotland, and Ireland. The French Infantry made good use of their musquets and fire, but had no time to throw themselves into square ; any attempt to do so would, I think, have been frustrated by the momentum which the Cavalry had [gained] by plunging over the hedges, and their increased ardour by this time acquired."], [115, "POXSOXBY'S CAVALRY BRIGADE. 87 Inniskillings. much impetuosity, and suffered severely, both in pursuit and return, from Pelotons, Clouds, or small bodies of French Lancers.

The road sides close to Quatre Bras were covered with the slain, and a vast number of gallant fellows in their last moments of agony. The British Cavalry having a long march from their Cavalry reach cantonments did not reach Quatre Bras until near six about six^m o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th June, about the close of the Action. The 23rd Light Dragoons was one of the first Regiments that arrived ; it took up its position on the rising ground to the right of the Namur road at the entrance to the Field of Action from Nivelles. Almost im mediately on the 23rd entering the field, a reconnoitring party, under the charge of an Officer, was despatched across a large plain of high standing corn close to the edge of an See plan No. 2 extensive wood to watch and ascertain the movements jjrag le of the main body of the Enemy, which was lying behind it. From six o'clock (the hour about which the Cavalry joined or came up) the firing gradually diminished until nine o'clock, when it altogether ceased at Quatre Bras, but towards Ligny, where the Prussians were engaged, the cannonading continued until 10 o'clock. The 23rd Light Dragoons furnished a strong picquet that night, under the command of Lieut. Banner, which was posted on the slop ing ground to the right of the Namur road, opposite to and not far distant from the wood near the entrance of the Field of Battle. Colonel the Earl of Portarlington was the Field Officer on duty, and Captain Dance was the Captain of the day.

The Cavalry began its march The Cavalry about two o'clock in the afternoon, when the Enemy pbmUttW\u00b0 immediately afterwards emerged from the woods and pursued the Allied rear guard with the greatest enthu- siasm. The rear guard had not marched half a mile from Quatre Bras when it was overtaken by a storm of thunder and rain, the latter falling in such abundance that it rendered the roads and ground over which the troops retreated scarcely passable. Defile of There being only one street by which the Army could nappe gg through Genappe, the progress of the troops was consequently retarded at that village, and during this stoppage some of the Cavalry Regiments moved a short distance to the right of the entrance to Genappe to be ready to form and meet any attack that the French advance guard, which was rapidly approaching, might make upon our Columns while the}' were delayed at this defile, but all our troops entered Genappe before the French came up. The Artillery which accompanied the French advance guard to Genappe was immediately planted at the left side of the town on the bank of the river which passes through it, from which station the Enemy opened a heavy and incessant fire upon our Cavalry when ascending from Genappe, by which they were exceedingly galled and sustained some loss ; our Artillery being all at the period considerably in front, we were without a cannon to return a shot. The Enemy's Cavalry, having entered Genappe,"], [123, "DORXBERG'S CAVALRY BRIGADE. 95 23rd Light Dragoons. began to press upon our rear guard, the last division of which had scarcely quitted the town when the Earl of Uxbridge came to the rear to reconnoitre, and placing himself upon the elevated ground on the right of the road leading from Genappe, perceiving the boldness of the French, directed the 7th Hussars to charge in order to check their advance ; the 7th Hussars, being animated by the presence of their Colonel, rushed on the Enemy with the greatest spirit and intrepidity, and drove the French advanced divisions back into the street of Genappe upon the main body of their Cavalry which occupied the town, where a most obstinate conflict commenced, each party fighting with the utmost desperation. The French, being backed by a long dense Column of Cavalry flanked by the houses on each side of the street, were enabled to make a most formidable resistance ; notwithstanding this numerical superiority, it was only when menaced by such a heavy force pressing forward that the 7th Hussars were obliged to retire, but although they fell back the fault did not lie with them, nor was it in consequence of the lightness of their horses, as has been insinuated. The conduct of this Corps on this occasion was heroic in the extreme ; their spirit and ardour was universally admired and acknow ledged by all who witnessed the gallant affair.

It was drawn up in rear of Vivian's Brigade, and, on the latter being pressed by the Enemy, it crossed the Genappe river at the bridge of Thuy, so as to leave the passage open for Vivian. Nos. 5.2 and 55 formed part of a correspondence in which exception was taken by some Officers of the Brigade to the description given in the first edition of Captain Siborne's History (Vol. I. p. 2G1 and following), to the effect that Vivian expected that Vandeleur was to support him until pressed by the Enemy, and then let him retire through his (Vandeleur's) Brigade, the latter taking the rear guard in its turn. The pursuit of the Enemy being checked at the river, the two Brigades retired without further molestation to the position at Waterloo. On the 18th, Vandeleur's Brigade was posted in the morning on the left of the position behind the Wavre road, and in rear of the farms of Pape lotte and Ter la Haye. See General Plan, No. 1. At the time of the first attack on Picton's Division, and of the charge of Ponsonby's Brigade, Vandeleur's was moved to the right to support the latter, but was delayed by the nature of the ground it had to pass over in coining up. The 12th Light Dragoons, the leading Regiment, charged down into the valley, and broke the only French Column remaining intact after Ponsonby's charge. It then took in flank the French Lancers who were pursuing the remains of the Heavy Brigade. See Plan, p. 38"], [132, "104 WATERLOO LETTERS. The 16th, led by Vandeleur, also charged the Lancers, but more in their front, the two Regi ments driving them back to the foot of the valley. The 1 2th sustained heavy losses, and the Command ing Officers of both Regiments were very severely wounded. The 11th had been kept in reserve on the brow of the hill. Later in the day, on the advance of the Prus sians being ascertained, the Light Cavalry was moved from the left to the other side of the main road. Vandeleur's Brigade was drawn up in rear of the Infantry Brigade of General Chasse's Dutch- Belgian Division, and by its attitude prevented the latter from quitting the field at the time of the final attack of the Imperial Guard.

On the morning of June ISth, Vandeleur's Brigade, consisting of the 11th, 12th, and 16th Light Dragoons, was formed on the extreme left of the Infantry (Picton's Division), being separated from the Infantry by a ravine, and having the village or hamlet of La Haj-e Sainte [La Haye] two hundred or three hundred yards in its front, occurned by Germans. Vivian's Brigade was formed on the left of Vandeleur's Brigade. Observing that the Enemy's shot reached us, Vandeleur's and (I believe) Vivian's Brigades were ordered to retire behind the brow of the hill and dismount. About the time of commencing the Action, an order arrived from Lord Anglesey to Generals Vandeleur and Vivian to engage the Enemy whenever they could do so with advantage without waiting for orders, and sub sequently'an order came from the Duke or Lord Anglesey to close to the Infantry, which had left a vacancy by closing to its right. These two orders were the only orders received previous to the first charge made by Vandeleur's Brigade. This Brigade, upon receiving the order to close to the Infantry, passed the ravine in column with a small front. It was then seen that Sir William Ponsonby's Brigade, after their most gallant charge, had been repulsed, and was retiring precipitately and in disorder upon the left of Picton's Division, of which it masked the fire. Vandeleur's Brigade was brought forward as quickly as was consistent with order.

The Brigade was formed that day, the 16tb Dragoons on the right, 11th in the centre, the 12th on the left. When Sir John Vandeleur ordered it to advance I was directed to remain on the brow of the position as a support, the 12th being the left Regiment of the whole line advanced by itself under Sir Frederick Ponsonby; the 16th with Sir John Vandeleur at their head proceeded rather to the right, but in going down closed on the 12th, and I am pretty sure some of the 16th charged with the 12th.

On the evening of the 16th June I was ordered on Picket to Quatre Bras in command of a Squadron of the 11th Dragoons, and remained there till about one o'clock p.m. on the 17th, when I received an order to retire, forming the rear-guard. This I did at a foot's pace without theleast molestation fromthe Enemy's Cavalry. On arriving within about two miles (as near as I can recollect) of the town of Genappe, I was directed to leave the high road to make room for the 7th Hussars, I think by Lord Anglesey himself. On proceeding a short distance I discovered the 7th Hussars formed in close column of Divisions on the Chausse'e. Having passed them I resumed my position on the high road, and retired quietly through the town of Genappe.

There can be no question that it was well timed, and it must have been, if not by the order, at all events with the sanction of Sir J. Vandeleur. What part of the 16th charged I canuot say, but some certainly did. If I may venture an opinion it would be that the 12th and a Squadron of the 16th charged, and that the remainder of the Brigade acted as a support to the charge. My personal adventures have nothing to do with the narrative, except as establishing the fact that some of the Royals, some of the 12th, and some of the 16th were cut down close to some Guns on the French position.

We had elevated ground in our front, from which the shot directed on the Guards ricocheted, passed over our heads, and took effect on the other Regiments of our Brigade; we were at this time so I 2"], [144, "116 WATERLOO LETTERS. 12th Light Dragoons. close to the Enemy that some of our men were wounded by grape. On the failure of the Enemy's last attack the Brigade advanced, passing over the ground on which the struggle had taken place between the French and English Guards. The scene here was terrific from the great number of killed and wounded. Bodies were lying so close to each other that our horses could scarcely advance without trampling on them, and a great many were wounded in the fetlocks from the bayonets and other weapons that were scattered about on the field. The Brigade advanced over the scene of the struggle between the French and British Guards. It is impossible for me at this moment to state posi tively on which side of Hougoumont the Regiment passed during its advance, indeed, I do not think any individual of the Regiment could at this day, or even the day after the Battle, decide the fact ; such a scene of devastation and rout had never before been witnessed by any of us, but I am disposed to think, from our inclining towards our left during the Advance, that we must have left Hougoumont to our right.

The only attempt to make anything like a stand against us or interrupt our pursuit, was made by a weak Regiment of Infantry which halted and fired a few shots at us, after which some of the men threw themselves down on their faces in the standing corn, and others effected their escape into the wood on our right. At this time we saw to our left front, at no great distance, a strong Regiment of Cavalry, which we soon ascertained to he the Grenadiers a Cheval of the Imperial Guard ; they were formed in a dense close column, and appeared to take but little notice of our advance, when opposite their flank they fired a few Meeting the Grenadiers a Cheval who retire in per fect order. pistol or carbine shots.

French Officer that this Regiment, as well as the Red Lancers of the Guard, was not in action during the day. I can only account for their steadiness in such a perilous situation, by ascribing it to a wish to cover their Infantry and Cavalry that were retreating in such great disorder, and by their perceiving that we had outmarched our Guns. The Brigade continued its pursuit of the Enemy still further, and when we were ordered to retire a short distance for the purpose of taking up our bivouac, rather an extra ordinary circumstance occurred.

It was commanded by Major-General Sir Colquhoun Grant, K.C.B. In the retreat on the 17th the Brigade, with the exception of the 7th Hussars, formed part of the right Cavalry Column. The 7th furnished at first the rear guard to the centre Column, which held the Enemy in check until the other troops of the Column had passed the bridge and town of Genappe, when it also retired through the same. On the Enemy's advanced guard of Lancers appearing at the other entrance of the town, the 7th charged it, and an obstinate conflict ensued, with great loss on both sides. At length the 7th were withdrawn, and the Enemy's Column, the rear of which was already beerinninp- to retire from the town, was driven through it by a charge of the 1st Life Guards. A brilliant charge was made in the evening by a Troop of the 7th Hussars, as the two Armies were taking up their respective positions at Waterloo. On the morning of the 18th, Grant's Brigade was posted to the right of all the other Cavalry, and in front of the Nivelles Road, near the junction of the latter with the Wavre Road.

I must, however, here remark that the relative situation of the three Regiments was not the same throughout the day, the 13th being for a great part of the conflict on the left of the 15th. The Squadrons at this time did not probably amount to 30 files each. I should also perhaps explain here that the 13th Light Dragoons had joined the Brigade that morning in consequence of the 2nd Hussars of the Legion not having returned from the frontier, that the 15th Hussars had a squadron in a ravine at al, and a picket at a%, from the beginning to the end of the Battle, which detachments suffered some loss by cannon fire aud skirmishing ; and that the 7th Hussars were very weak, having suffered most severely on [the] debouch of the French Cavalry from Genappe the preceding afternoon.

Facts are, however, what I apprehend you want, and I will give them as shortly as I can. Commanded a Troop sup- porting the skirmishers. Early in the morning of the 17th the Army was drawn up to show a front, and soon afterwards the Infantry began to move to the rear. When they moved off, leaving the Cavalry, Sir C. Grant called the Field Officers together, and spoke to them for some time. When Major Hodge (who was in command of the right Squadron, to which I belonged) returned, he called me aside, and told me that the Prussians had been beaten and obliged to fall back, and that we must make a similar movement to prevent the two Armies from being disunited ; that our Brigade was to retire by Regiments from the left, and that the 7th had the post of honour, the main road to cover and protect; that Sir William Dornberg was to take charge of the skirmishers of the Brigade, and that our Squadron was to skirmish. There was at this time no appearance on the part of the Enemy of an advance, and we were to hold our ground until driven from it. The 7th was to have the post of honour in the Retreat. We did so and (though I cannot pretend to accuracy in point of time) I think it was twelve before their advance put us in motion. We threw out the right Troop to skirmish, and Major Hodge went with them. I held the high road with the left Troop, and had from time to time to send them assistance, and frequently to advance to enable them to hold their ground, as their movements were difficult through ploughed fields so soft that the horses were sunk up to their knees always, and sometimes to their girths.

Here Sir William Dornberg told me that he must leave me ; that it was of the utmost importance to face the Enemy boldly at this spot, as the bridge in the town of Genappe was so narrow we must pass it in file ; that I should endeavour if possible to obtain time for the skirmishers to come in, but that I was not to compromise my Troop too much.

The troops opposed to me went about, and as I followed them they did not stop as soon as I did. I continued advancing and retiring alternately, until I saw all my right Troop safe on the road in my rear, and then I began to retire at a walk, occasionally halting and fronting until I turned the corner of the town of Genappe. I then filed the men from the left and passed through the town at a gallop, no enemy in sight.

As well as I can guess, the Cavalry Column by which we were pursued, and which moved slowly, but shouting loudly along the high road, were about fourteen Squadrons.

When I saw the ground upon which we had charged it was strewed with men and horses, but I saw very few fighting men of the Enemy.

It then joined the right Squadron of the Regiment, but owing to the im petuous attack of the French Cavalry on the right centre of the British position, the intended attack of the Lancers was given up, and the Regiment, leaving the right Squadron where it was originally posted, retraced its steps to the vicinity of the position A, and was immediately engaged in the attack, by charge and skirmishing, of Cuirassiers and other Cavalry, and this lasted until the Enemy's Cavalry found it could make no lasting impression on this part of the position.

The 6th (Light) Cavalry Brigade was composed of the 10th or Prince of Wales's Hussars, the 18th Hussars, and the 1st Hussars of the King's German Legion. It was under the command of Major- General Sir Hussey Vivian, K.C.B. In the retreat on June 1 7th, the Brigade formed the rear portion of the left Cavalry Column. It had some skirmishing with the French Cavalry previous to crossing the Genappe, or Dyle, River at the bridge of Thuy, where the advance of the latter was checked, and the Brigade then marched to the position at Waterloo without further molestation. On the 18th it was posted on the extreme left of the Line, where it remained until the advance of the Prussians rendered its presence there no longer necessary. See General Plan, No. 1 The Brigade was then moved to the immediate right of the Brussels-Genappe road, and was drawn up in support of some German Infantry which was being greatly harassed. Here it was exposed for some time to a tremendous fire of artillery and musketry. On the repulse of the Imperial Guard, the Brigade moved round by the right of Maitland's Guards, and advanced towards the French position. On arriving about half-way, the Regiments were ordered by Vivian to form line on their leading half-Squadrons, the 10th in front, the 18th and 1st Hussars in support.

Some French Horse Artillery attempted to gallop away across the front of the Regiment, but were over taken, the gunners and drivers cut down, and the Guns secured. The 18th then charged the Cavalry and completely dispersed them, and also drove some more Artillerymen from their Guns, the whole flying in disorder. Meanwhile, the 10th on the right had gone on in pursuit of the Enemy's Cavalry, excepting about a weak Squadron collected by Major Howard. Vivian, calculating upon the support of some Infantry which was approaching, ordered this Squadron to attack a French Square of Infantry. This was carried out with great gallantry, but also with great loss, amongst the killed being Major Howard, as our Infantry had gone in pursuit of a separate Column. The Hussars, however, kept pressing the Square, and forced it back for some distance, until it finally broke up, and its ranks joined the other fugitives. The remaining portion of the 10th, after re turning from the pursuit of the French Cavalry, came upon about half a Battalion of the Imperial Guard which had been rallied, and was supported by Cavalry.

Tournay, where there had been a picket of French Cavalry, they were replaced by Douaniers. I spoke to them, and they did not hesitate to say that their Army was concentrating, and that if they did not attack us they expected we should attack them, and this, on my return to my quarters, I communicated both to Lord Anglesey and Lord Hill. On the 15th I went to Brussels and dined with Lord Anglesey. After dinner Sir Pultney Malcomb came to us from the Duke, where he had dined, and said that the French had advanced, and I think he said had taken Charleroi. At night we all went to the Duchess of Rich mond's ball. It was only during the ball that the Duke called several of those who commanded Divisions or Brigades together, and told us to be prepared to move in the morning, and it was during the night only that orders were issued for the actual march of the British troops from the right towards Nivelles, and it was on the march that we received orders to continue our march on Quatre Bras. That the Duke must have been aware, therefore, that the French were concentrating there can be no doubt. That the uncertainty of the front on which they would make their attack prevented his concentrating his force sooner I think is equally clear, and that he did not expect the attack quite so soon I am very much disposed to believe. And he was probably led to this from the fact of information having only about the 14th, I think, reached him of the Imperial Guard having left Paris, and from his not calculating that they could have so soon arrived with the Army, and been in a state of readiness to advance. loth June.

That the tardy arrival of the Prussians rendered the victory more complete is, I feel confident, quite correct. Had the French been engaged earlier in the day with them, the last body that attacked us would not have been so committed. So far the delay of the arrival was most fortunate. Still, however, had they arrived earlier we might have beaten the Enemy sooner, and had more day light to take advantage of our victory. Their tardy arrival ren dered the victory more complete. 3rd. That the position of Waterloo is by no means a strong one cannot for a moment be disputed.

He said \" he knew it to be a fact that the Duke had himself halted some Regiments in position on the Brussels side of Genappe, meaning to have halted his Army there, having that town and the small river that runs through it in his front, but that Delancey, his Quartermaster-General, who had been sent to the rear, came to him and described to him the position of Waterloo, and that the Duke determined to retire from that on which he was then halted to take up that on which the Battle was fought.\" The position of Waterloo is not a strong one.

The French made a great mistake in attacking the position of Waterloo. They should have masked Hougou mont and penetrated with all their force between us and the Prussians by attacking our left, or else they should have attacked Hougoumont in a different manner than that in which they did attack it, not advancing against the garden and wood, but occupying in force the height above it and driving our troops out with their Artillery, and then turning our right altogether, advancing, getting possession of the road to Brussels at the point of junction with that from Nivelles and that from Genappe. They might thus have bothered us terribly."], [185, "VIVIAN'S CAVALRY BRIGADE. 153 Sir H. Vivian. Meeting of 4th. With respect to the meeting of Wellington and Blucher I see a note refers to what I said in the Gawler controversy. I cannot turn to that correspondence, but I have no doubt in my own mind that when I saw the Duke he had met Blucher. I think his words were, on my telling him (after congratulating him on his victory) that my Brigade was in perfect order, reformed after their attack, and ready to pursue : \" Our troops have had a hard day's work ; the Prussians will pursue the Enemy ; do you bivouac your Brigade.\" I am not quite certain, but I believe he said he had settled it with Blucher the Prussians were to pursue. Certain I am that what he said conveyed that conviction to my mind that he had seen Blucher. Wellington and Blucher. Arrangement that the Prus sians were to pursue the French. The morning after the Battle, at or soon after daybreak, I proceeded from the hamlet of Hilaincourt over the Field of Battle to Waterloo to see Lord Anglesey. I called on the Duke, it must have been about or soon after four o'clock; he had just got his breakfast. He asked me many questions about the field, which I had just passed [over] , and was very much surprised, indeed, when I assured him of the very large number of the Enemy's Guns that I had seen on the ground. He told me no Returns he had received had at all amounted to what I had described, and I am quite certain he was not at that time aware of the full extent of his Victory. He told me, I recollect full well, that as far as he had then heard, the Prisoners sent to the rear were about 1,200. 19th June. Called on the Duke.who was surprised at the extent of his victory. I believe you have my Journal of the proceedings of my Brigade, but I am not certain if I have gone into all the detail, or mentioned some interesting anecdotes of what occurred in front of Quatre Bras before our retreat. On the morning of the 17th at daybreak, or soon after, the Duke came to Quatre Bras. I helieve he had slept at Genappe. I was on horseback near the house at Quatre Bras, looking about. Some few of the Enemy's vedettes only were to be seen, and my Brigade being on the left, I had two strong pickets out, 17th June. Vivian's Brigade on she left"], [186, "154 WATERLOO LETTERS. Sir H. Vivian one of the 18th on the Namur road and one of the 10th Hussars in front. The 1st Hussars had only joined me from Tournay in the night after an immense march. The Duke asked me what account I could give of the Enemy. I told him all I knew, which was not in fact much, for they had been very quiet. He then desired that I should send half a Squadron with an A.D.C. of his (Col. Gordon) on the Namur road. I did so and in about an hour, or rather more, they returned, reporting that the Enemy was to be seen on the right of the road about two miles distant, where they had been engaged with the Prussians the preceding day, but that they could not learn that they had crossed the road. This patrol, how ever, seeing the Enemy on the right, had not ventured to push on very far, from a fear of being cut off. Soon after the patrol was sent off the Duke received some despatches from England, and shortly after that I think he gave orders for the retreat, having satisfied himself that although the Enemy were not in motion, still they were preparing to move. He then lay himself down on the ground, covered his head with one of the newspapers he had been reading, and appeared to fall asleep, and in this way he remained some time ; when he again rose and mounted his horse and rode down the field in front of Quatre Bras a little distance, and looked about through his glass, and I perfectly well remember his expressing his astonishment at the perfect quiet of the Enemy and his saying it was \" not at all impossible that they also might be retreating.\" Lieut.-Col. Sir A.Gordon sent with a patrol along the Namur road. Owing to the extreme quiet of the Enemy in front, the Duke thinks their retreat ing possible. He remained for some time longer anxiously looking out, when on a sudden on the road to Namur at a con siderable distance, I should say about three miles, we saw something glittering in the sun, which was rising bril liantly. The Duke at first said they were the French bayonets, but on looking through my glass I saw they were Cuirassiers, moving on the road and forming in the field by the side of it.

My Brigade with their Guns formed on the left of the house of Quatre Bras, Vandeleur's in their rear and on their right somewhat. Presently the_18th picket came galloping in, followed by two or three Squadrons of French Cavalry, on which my Glins opened a fire, and if I am not mistaken, some Guns of another Brigade on the right did the same. This checked the advance of the French, but we presently saw them very active in bringing up Guns, and soon a fire was opened on us. Vivian's Brigade formed on left of Quatre Bras, Vande leur's in their rear. Pickets driven in. French advance checked by Artillery fire, which the Enemy replied to. The Duke had by this time left us to go more to the right. Lord Anglesey, who remained, told me we were to retire, and that Vandeleur's Brigade would support mine, and he then left me. I saw the Enemy pressing on in vast numbers, not only ou my front, but left flank. I therefore ordered off the Guns at once. Fortunately, I had early in the morning sent an Officer of the Artillery, Lieut. Swabey, to reconnoitre the passages of the little river Dyle, and he had discovered a bridge to which a road parallel to the high road led from the rear of Quatre Bras, and which was a little higher up [lower down] the river than Genappe. To this bridge, then, he at once moved at a trot with his Guns, and passed without interruption from the Enemy. I put my Brigade about and retreated in line, covered by skirmishers. Across a small dip in the ground, and stand ing rather on a commanding position, Vandeleur's Brigade was drawn up distant from me about six hundred or seven hundred yards. I fully calculated on his allowing me to pass through and his taking the rear.

I told him I had enough upon my hands, but that I hoped to get my people all well off, and I sent an A.D.C. to Sir J. Vandeleur to desire he would as fast as possible get his Brigade over the bridge, in order that I might have no interruption in my retreat in case I was hard pressed. About this time the most tremendous storm I almost ever witnessed came on, in a very short time rendering the ground so deep that the horses had some difficulty in moving quick through it. To this I am persuaded I am in a very great degree indebted for the little loss I experienced in the retreat to the bridge. The Enemy began to relax in their preparations for enveloping me, which considerable bodies assembling on my left appeared preparing to do ; those in my front were contented with simply skirmishing. The thunder storm came on, rendering the ground very difficult for movement. I sent off the 18th Hussars and 10th, ordering both Regiments to form on the other side of the bridge, and the 10th to dismount some of their men who were armed with rifles to defend it, and prevent the French from pursuing our rear guard over it should they press us hard, and I remained with the 1st Hussars (K.G.L.).

After some time I sent off a Squadron of the 1st Hussars towards the bridge, and when we began to do this the French again pressed on so much as to interpose between the left Squadron and the body of the Regiment, and oblige that Squadron to pass the little river (Dyle) higher up [lower down] than the bridge over which we passed. 1st Hussars cross the river.

The French followed us cheering, and took a Sergeant whose horse was wounded. On our passing the bridge and the Enemy's arriving at it, some of the dis mounted men fired, and from that moment no attempt was made to molest us. I halted my Brigade some little time on the ground beyond the bridge, and then moved quietly on the narrow lane which runs parallel to the high road by an old Abbey, I think called the Abbey of [?

I assert positively that, when I advanced I left Vandeleur's Brigade standing on the position, and they cheered me as I passed.

Vandeleur's Brigade did not attack any of the French Cavalry, nor indeed until they had been all driven from the field, is proved by their having taken no horses, whilst a very large number, nearly two hundred, were captured by Sir H. Vivian's Brigade. The principal loss sustained by Sir J. Vandeleur's Brigade occurred whilst- formed on the left of the road, and in support of Sir William Ponsonby's Brigade. There, indeed, its loss had been great, and especially in the 12th Light Dragoons. The attack that was made at night on the body of French Infantry that had collected, was made by the 11th and part of the 16th Light Dragoons. The time between the attack of the first, 6th, Brigade and the advance of Sir J. Vandeleur's must have been at least twenty minutes, if not thirty. It may be judged of from the following facts : the 10th had charged and rallied ; the 18th had charged after the order to halt was"], [192, "160 WATERLOO LETTERS. Sir H. Vivian given to the 10th ; the order to halt had been given to the 18th; the rallied body of the 10th had charged, and it was after this that Captain Keane was sent by Sir H. Vivian to Sir J. Vandeleur to beg him to move on in his support ; and Sir H. Vivian was in the act of moving on with two Squadrons of the 1st Hussars when Sir J. Vandeleur, with his Brigade, passed by his right flank, and a conversation took place between them. I have been thus particular in stating these facts, because it will be seen by some of the following extracts that the confusion occasioned by the attack of the Cavalry from the left is attributed to an attack of both these Brigades, whereas in fact it was one only that made the most impor tant impression.

The French at once advanced against them (their left flank rather), and drove them back. They then occupied the village of Smohain or Papelotte, I forget exactly the name. This must have been somewhere between five and six o'clock. I should say nearer five. It was a consider able time after this that the Prussians appeared in force. They [we] remained long enough for me to see the French reserve and right form line en potence in order to meet the attack on Planchenoit, and I was surprised to see the tremendous fire the French were able to direct against the Prussians. It was just as this took place that I moved to the right. Nearer to 5 than 6 o'clock. Considerable time after that they appeared in force. Is anyone can tell you exactly about the time we advanced it will give you the time of the Prussians being generally engaged, but I should certainly say that they were before Planchenoit very soon after half-past seven, if not as early. This I saw then, when with the 18th Hussars I got into the high road beyond La Belle Alliance. Some Prussians also had reached it, and I have no doubt some were cut down by the 18th for French, for I myself saw two or three who were wounded with the sabre on the road the next morning.

In the details of what took place under such circum- stances as the advance of my Brigade at the end of the day of Waterloo, it would be a miracle if all parties in the same See No. 75, Regiment [? Brigade] ever agreed. It is very possible that both Colonel Taylor and I may be right, and yet not exactly agree. Indeed it is extraordinary that we all (I mean all the Officers of my Brigade) agree so generally. That I ordered the advance at a trot, and that the leading Squadron moved off at a trot, and went down the hill into the flat at a trot, / cannot have the slightest doubt. That Taylor, who commanded the centre Squadron of the 10th, might have galloped in order to pre serve his distance, perhaps from not having moved off the"], [195, "VIVRiN'S cavalry brigade. 163 Lord Vivian position at the same moment is very possible. There is one circumstance to which I have I think to you before adverted, that proves the advance was at a trot and not a hurried one. The leading half-Squadron as we were moving off the position, on approaching some of our Guns wheeled to the right instead of to the left, and was consequently moving to the rear. I was on the flank of the Squadron. I imme diately (I recollect perfectly well), with a considerable degree of emphasis, 8sC., and a good hearty damn, galloped to the flank of the second half- Squadron, and said that it was towards the Enemy and not from the Enemy they were to wheel. I then took the flank Officer's place and I led the Column down the hill in the direction I wished it to move until the leading half-Squadron was brought back into its place, when I went to the flauk of that half-Squadron, and in this way conducted the Column some little distance. Now had our advance been at any very rapid pace the half-Squadron which had wheeled from us and been left behind, somewhat perhaps confused and entangled with the Guns, would never have returned to its place in so short a time. Then as to what happened when we arrived in the plain at the bottom of the hill. That there was a pause, and I may say a halt in the front I can positively affirm; the very circumstance of Sir Colin Campbell coming to me from the Duke and desiring me to halt, and the conversa tion which took place (the affair of a minute, or perhaps moment only, I admit), proves it. When I moved on again, and ordered the formation on the leading half- Squadron, and the advance and attack, the order was to form line on the front half-Squadron ; but that the forma tion was rather en echelon of Squadrons than in line 1 think is much more than probable, and if any halt occurred in the next Squadron it was [illegible] at once, for I well recollect the instant it was in line giving the order to charge, and the others no doubt took it up in succession. I sent orders to the 18th to remain steady in support. I charged with the 10th, and as l 2"], [196, "WATERLOO LETTERS. 164 10th Hussars. soon as we were well into the Enemy and mixed up, the French making off, I gave the word \" halt,\" and galloped off to the 18th.

I then went to the 18th, and what happened afterwards I have before described to you. The circumstance of the Squadron of the 2nd Light Dragoons, K.G.L., having been attacked by some Lancers when passing across our front you will recollect I have before described to you.

Many of my opinions may be erroneous ; I have never seen the ground since we galloped over it, but I fancy that if I was there I could point out the exact course we took, in spite of Belgic Lions and Tombs, &c, with which they say the ground is now encumbered. If I use the vowel of which Lord Erskine was accused of being so fond, it is only because I relate what I saw or thought, aud it must be excused. On the 15th June I rode home from Brussels to Vivorde by myself in the evening, and found that there were orders for a field day next morning. On the Kith, at about half-past four a.m., my servant called me and said the Regiment was ordered to turn out in full marching order to change quarters. The Brigade assembled on the road from Vivorde to Grammont. We waited some time for the 18th Hussars. When assembled we commenced our march (I think) about seven. We proceeded through Grammont and Enghien, falling in with other Corps of Cavalry on the march. At Enghien Lieut. Parsons of my Troop joined, having come across from Brussels, where I had left him the day before; he informed me of the advance of the French, that the troops had turned out from Brussels, and that there would probably be an action in the course of the day. loth June. 16th June.

I heard the Duke say, \" Well I suppose we shall fight them here,\" and I understood Lord Uxbridge to answer that he did not think it a favourable situation, as there were defiles in our rear, &c. The Duke then said, stretching himself and yawn ing, \" Then I suppose we must retreat.\" Just after the Cavalry forming two lines along the brow of the rising ground to the left of the road (to Namur I believe) the Heavy Cavalry in second line, we were ordered to retire and form in our place in Brigade.

Just then commenced a thunderstorm worthy of the tropics for the loudness of the thunder and violence of the ram. This with the sort of ballet of war of the retiring and advancing Cavalry, and the French Guns firing, altogether made a picturesque and grand scene.

I heard that their rear was attacked by the Enemy just as we entered the narrow roads, but the French soon left us for the main road. On issuing from the village there was a hollow way with an ascent commanded by high banks. Here Sir H. Vivian formed a division of the 10th on the bank, in rank entire with carbines advanced and ready to fire into the hollow way and check pursuit, had the Enemy come on, but as they did not, the division resumed its place, and the Brigade marched quite unmolested through narrow roads, hearing occasional cannonade on the main road, and the shouts of the attacks that took place. Lieutenant Smith of the 10th was sent across to the main road, and was present at the affair between the 7th Hussars and the French Lancers ; during which, at considerable risk to himself, he saved Lieutenant Gordon of the 7th, who was wounded, from capture or death, by dismounting and lending him his horse to carry him to the rear till he could meet his own led horses. Lieutenant Smith escaped being taken by leaping over the ditch off the chaussee, till the Lancers being driven back he got his horse again. After passing the hollow way (? bridge over the Genappe), the Brigade retires unmo lested. Lieut. Smith saves Lieut. Gordon of the 7th on the main road. Towards evening we reached a coppice near some cottages to the left of Waterloo with reference to the position. Here we halted and bivouacked in the coppice, it still raining hard. Some of the Officers made a fire and lay down round it, some got into cottages. I was warned by the Adjutant for picket with my Squadron. After some time I found Lord Robert Manners and some of the Officers in a cottage drying their clothes and picking and broiling fowls. Finding shelter I lay down and got a good sleep, after which went to see when my picket was to turn out. Towards morning I received the order, and at daylight marched with my Squadron to the brow of the hill over a village (Ohain* I believe, from inquiries I made of an inhabitant), where I relieved a Squadron of the 18th commanded by Captain Grant ; they had an advanced post the other side of the village, and their chain of vedettes on the rising ground beyond it.

We were to communicate with the 1st Hussars picket round to the left, and (I think) Infantry on the right. In going round my vedettes I saw two Corps of French Cavalry in close column dismounted within carbine shot of them, and looking from the ridge of the hill into a hollow beyond, I saw a strong patrol of French Heavy Cavalry winding up a road that led away to our left, probably going to feel for the Prussians. Saw a patrol of French Cavalry pro ceeding in the direction of the Prussians. Having seen the chain secure I moved the Squadron into a road of the village in the bottom, when a Prussian Officer with a patrol arrived at my post and desired me to inform the Duke of Wellington that General Bulow with his Corps d' Armee was advancing to join us, and that he was trois quarts de lieue distant. Having communicated with our Army the Officer was to return directly. I sent Lieutenant Lindsay to Headquarters with this intelligence.

Some French Guns opened on the village, and the troops on the hill to our right (Belgic* I believe), whose Guns returned the fire. I think this was about 11 o'clock. Just then we heard a tremendous fire distant on the right, which I suppose was the first grand attack.

The Horse Artillery were advanced to the brow of the hill, but did not fire, though some Belgic Guns there (or Hanoverian) did. Some French Guns were either attracted by their fire or our position, as for several rounds they constantly struck the ground in front of mine and Major Howard's Squadrons, or fired just over our heads. A cannon shot had struck one Squadron and caused some casualties ; here Lieut. Hardman, the Adjutant, who had gone forward to look, received a severe contusion from a musket shot. See General Plan, No. 1. While in this position we saw movements of Cavalry at a distance to our right and a good deal to the rear, as if some of ours which had attacked were retiring and rallying. We next moved through the hedge into the low ground behind the ridge, and advanced in line to the top of the hill to support an attack of the Light Brigade, General Vandeleur's. While on the ridge of the hill there were a good many shells sent over us or pitched near us ; the latter did no harm, as they buried in the mud and burst upwards.

Some Staff Officers came occasionally to the left, to see if there was any appearance of them. I remember seeing Captain [Lieut. -Colonel] Percy, the Duke's A. D. C. At last we remarked the French vedettes in some com motion, and some Prussian tirailleurs began skirmishing with their right to the village in the bottom, and after a considerable time the Prussians began to come up and form with their right to the village, Corps after Corps, extending to the left in a line at right angles with the French Line. They established Batteries which opened, and the French reserves formed to oppose them opening their Guns also. The Prussians kept their right stationary, but pushed on their left getting round the Enemy, so that before we moved to the right, their right formed an acute angle [? with our Line]. I do not think the Prussians commenced seriously till about four o'clock, or later. The Prussians begin to come up and form at right angles with the French Line.

Here we saw the Infantry warmly engaged, and took open column after a little time, and, bringing up left shoulders, moved along the rear of the Infantry, and the Infantry being rather pushed by the Enemy, who kept up a heavy fire, we wheeled into line and supported, about fifty yards in rear of them ; they rather fell back upon us, and one Battalion of Brunswick Oels in close column, retiring, being [in] want of ammunition, I believe, but in good order, was near passing through us between my Squadron and Major Howard's. Just then two or three Battalions to the left of it advauced at double quick, their drums rolling, and drove back the Enemy. The Brunswick Oels faced about and advanced at the charge also, Sir H.

A cloud of tirailleurs being close up to our Infantry, behind which we were, and keeping up a heavy fire, we had many casualties here, particularly numbers of horses hit, some in two or three places. Captain Gurwood, of my right half-Squadron, was struck in the knee, the shot wounding his horse, which was killed as he was going to the rear.

We either went Threes left from column or wheeled into line, and when we had come close up to the rear of a Battery, were ordered to pass through it by Threes, and when through to wheel up. This brought my right half-Squadron with its right flank to the muzzle of a Gun ; either the Officer of Artillery had not ordered them to cease firing, or it was not attended to, for I saw the man with the portfire apparently about to fire, and roared out to him not to blow my half-Squadron away ; he answered, \" Out of the way, then, and let me have my shot.\" I gave the word to rein back, and as soon as my horse's nose was clear of the line of fire he fired, the shock shaking all the horses, and the shot must have all but grazed some of the horses' noses ; luckily it was round shot. Lieut. Arnold had been in the same predicament with his half-Squadron, I heard, and when the Gun fired the flannel of the cartridge struck on the neck of his horse.

Before we passed the Guns I remembered [saying] to Lord R. Manners that there was no Squadron Officer to the right Squadron. Sir G. Quentin having been wounded, Lord R.

The charge of this Brigade so little noticed in English accounts, whereas French writers say it was owing to it that Napo leon left the field.

Coming down upon luxuriant crops, the Brigade took up its position, the 10th being on the right of the 18th in line. Beginning of the Battle. The Action soon commenced, and General Vivian rode forward to observe its progress. The Brigade stood under cannonade frequently, but not attended with serious casualty. To us on our regimental posts the prevailing fire seemed towards the centre of the Armies, and to our right, very heavy and continued. It is impossible at this distance of time that I can trace step by step the progress of the Brigade from the left to the right, but I will mention as consecutively as I can the chain of events which constitute my recollection of it. A Prussian Officer came with the intelligence of the advance of that army. Intelligence of the advance of the Prussians. After some time, Major [Lieut.-Col.] the Honourable Henry Percy, one of the Duke of Wellington's Aides-de- Camp, came to ascertain how soon the Prussians might be expected. Major Percy told us of the fall of Sir William Ponsonby, and the severe wound (or supposed death) of Colonel Frederick Ponsonby. After a time we joined General Vandeleur's Brigade again to our right. I may here mention that when we were thus moving to our right the day had improved, and whilst ourselves"], [211, "VIVIAN'S CAVALRY BRIGADE. 179 18th Hussars, were less exposed to fire, we had a better view of the Action. When with General Vandeleur's Brigade, we heard of the wound (then supposed mortal) of Colonel Hay of the 16th Light Dragoons. Afterwards the 6th Brigade quitted General Vandeleur's and proceeded right in front, and passing a little to the rear, went on again more towards the right. Brigade moved to the right. About this time I believe Colonel Quentin, of the 10th, was wounded. About the time we crossed the Genappe road there was a wonderful Column of French pouring down from their position. But that Column could not have been engaged with the right of the British forces so soon as the period when we first replaced the Household Brigade in our position. I mention this because I have been told that it was seven o'clock when we passed Lord Edward Somerset's Brigade, but I have no idea that it could be seven till some time afterwards. The Brigade now began to tread the ground of devastation ; the pavement of the Genappe road was torn up and scattered. Lord Edward Somerset's Brigade, strengthened by the addition of what had been Ponsonby's, was dwindled to two various Squadrons. Reduced state of Somerset's and Ponson by's Brigades. General Vivian asked, \"Lord Edward, where is your Brigade?\" \"Here,\" said Lord Edward. The ground was strewed with wounded, over whom it was hardly possible sometimes to avoid moving.

Advance of the Brigade at the Crisis. In the first part of this movement wounded British Infantry were lying on the ground, when we changed into the new direction ; General Vandeleur's Brigade (I believe) on our right cheered. We were cannonaded upon our right flank, and some casualty I think took place amongst the 10th, who were leading. I have an uncertain recollection, but believe it must have been somewhere about this time I saw Sir Colin See No. 74, p. 163. Campbell. As the fire, by which we were inconvenienced when about to form to our front, proceeded partly from our own Artillery's mistaking us when thus advanced, it was understood General Vivian had sent to remedy this mistake. I cannot determine the time, nor exactly what we were doing, when some Nassau troops with white caps fell back upon us, and were forced forward, in which I remember my Adjutant instrumental ; nor can I state when it was that I either heard myself, or was told at the moment, the Infantry was advancing. Perhaps it is not irrelevant to mention that when we were proceeding in column of half-Squadrons to the front, the earth thrown up by a cannon-shot falling under my horse struck me hard in the face and breast.

Ordering the 18th to remain where we were, the General went on with the 10th to direct their charge.

Where we stood in line there were (as I have reason to think) in our front French Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry near us. General Vivian himself accompanied me to give me the original direction, and in that direction when put into it the Regiment proceeded onwards. That direction diverged to the left (as the 10th charge had to the right), bringing our right shoulders forward. See General Plan, No. 3.

The charge then ceased to be compact, for the assail ants and those who were in retreat were intermingled pell-mell, and that as hard as they could ride. The Cavalry, in trying to escape, rather bore to their right hand, than went quite straight to the rear. So that the original direction of the 18th having been to the left, and that direction (leaning down to intercept the French Artillery coming from the left) having been still further increased, was altered by a sudden swerve to the right hand to attack the Cavalry formed to our right, and that alteration more or less increased in pursuit. As this wras a chase, compactness was out of the question. Diverging nature of the charge. The 18th come upon French Infantry retreating. But soon we came into ground entirely covered with French Infantry retreating, not in a body, but individually, yet with none of that hurry and confusion that might be imagined when thus suddenly ridden in upon, and es pecially some of the Ancienne Garde might be remarked for their coolness and bold countenance (one nearly bayonetted me as I passed).

There was a dip or hollow in the ground between the party of the 18th and the Squares, perhaps a fence, but quite close. The Squares so posted were inaccessible with any prospect of making impression upon them by even a much larger force of Cavalry than the party I have mentioned, especially with troop horses after so hard a gallop. French Squares too favourably posted to be attacked by unformed Cavalry. I moved them a little to the left, where the ground favoured them more, and others joined us.

I am not aware of having seen any British Infantry whilst we were employed in the pursuit. Where our pursuit ended I do not imagine that any of our Infantry could be in our front, that front being occupied by French Squares. Did not observe any British In fantry in the pursuit, being too far advanced. But not having been subsequently over the ground on which the Battle was fought, I cannot give any guess at the place where the charge which I was concerned in terminated, but that it was far from the place whence we had started for the charge there can be no doubt. The various little occurrences I can call to mind would occupy some minutes, and the rate of going, taking diver gence and check into calculation, must have been at the rate of ten miles an hour at the least, probably more.

To avoid confusion, therefore, the letters from the Troops and Batteries of Artillery have all been placed together in one series, instead of being included with those of the Brigades or Divisions to which they belonged. At Quatre Bras only two British Batteries were engaged, Lloyd's and Bogers's, the latter with Picton's Division near the left of the position, while the former at a critical period succeeded, with great loss, in silencing two French Batteries in the Bois de Bossu, and in forcing back into it a strong Column of French Infantry.

The whole of our Infantry at this time were moving off to a position we understood to be a few miles to our rear. The Cavalry formed in three lines : the Hussars in the Retreat on first line, the Light Cavalry in the second, and in the third line the Heavy Cavalry. It suddenly became insufferably hot and close, and the sun became absolutely darkened by a very black cloud, while at the same time a heavy cloud of dust rising, showed the advance of a very large body of Cavalry coming to reinforce the Enemy ; they came from a direction on the right of the Enemy.

At this instant the heavy black cloud broke with a tremendous clap of thunder and torrent of rain. We formed the left Column in retreat. The road and ground became so quickly deluged with the heavy rain that was falling, that it became impracticable for the French Cavalry to press our Column in any force. In fact, out of the road in the track of our own Cavalry, the ground was poached into a complete puddle. Seeing this, and having lost the shoe from off a Gun horse, I halted and had it put on in spite of some skirmishers who began to press on us, but were kept at bay by our own skirmishers forming as if to charge them. This will show how impracticable it was for them to press us on this cross road. But at this moment I could see the centre Column on the main road on my right, and they apparently charging, accompanied with much cheering.

For some while we could see nothing whatever from behind the Infantry (which ad vanced slowly, step by step) on account of the dense smoke from their musketry. The advance of this Infantry was admirable. By-and bye they ceased to fire, broke from line into open column, and Sir H. Vivian's Brigade quickly passed through the intervals.

However, as the Prussians had never probably seen British troops before, it was not extraordinary that they should take us to be the Enemy in the pile-mile sort of confusion that was presented to their view at first com- ing up. Previous to this and as we first emerged from behind the Infantry, we could perceive another fire of The Prussians Artillery in the direction of Planchenoit, which had opened of PlaricllS noit. upon the right rear of the French. These were Prussians also, so that there appeared three Corps or bodies of Prussians on the Field at this time. The first had been easily kept in check, and the two last appeared too late to be actually aiding in the Battle, but as their approach when perceived (requiring to be provided against) at a critical juncture added to the difficulties of the French, it probably deprived them of every hope of withstanding the attack we had already commenced.

Or it may not have been parallel originally to the position. I do not at all know where the Dutch Battery had been placed, or the relative position of other Batteries ; events passed rapidly, and we did and occupied what seemed most advantageous and eligible. The high growing corn through which we fired the rockets gave no indication, that I am aware of, of Cavalry having passed through it, and I never heard that the rockets went amongst the English Dragoons, which I think I should have done had the case been so. The above relation will perhaps answer in some way the points inquired about, and remarks on them; but to speak more specifically to Mr. Siborne's inquiries (which are about six), I should say, in regard to his first paragraph and question, \" Whether some little interval of time did not elapse between the charge of Cavalry and discharge of rockets ? \" that time did elapse and must have been The Troop did occupied in forming the Sections and moving clown the n? . advancc Jr & *= at the same slopes, and that the Cavalry must have been well engaged moment as the before any rockets were fired, but I cannot say that the J **\" Dragoons were then retiring as Mr. Siborne suggests ; indeed from the quickness with which everything was per formed I am led to think they were not, though they might have been.

It was on our left, but whether so far from us as to create the impression of its being a separate party from us, I cannot say ; perhaps it might.

During this anxious period the only individuals we saw were the Duke of Richmond and his sons, who, arriving from Brussels, crossed our front, and galloped away towards the Right. The Duke of Bichmond arrived from Brussels. I think it must have been past noon when the Adjutant of the Horse Artillery came to conduct us to the Position B, on the extreme right of the 2nd Line, or what I then considered as such. Here we formed up facing towards Nivelles, en potence as it were to the 1st Line, having a Ravine (if I mayv so call it) in our front, running from Troop moved to the right.

There were none of any description on our right. In rear of us was the 14th Regiment of Infantry lying down in square. Beyond the Ravine the ground ascended at first rather abruptly, and then continued in a gentle slope for a con siderable distance. Up this ran the great road to Nivelles, having extensive corn-fields on either side of it, interspersed (if I recollect right) with a few clumps of wood ; and, on what appeared from our position, the summit of the slope, was drawn up a large body of Cavalry, consisting princi pally, if not entirely of Lancers, as marked in the Plan. On The Cavalry their right were several Batteries of both heavy and light the jwch Guns, the latter of which kept up a constant fire on us ; left. but the former seemed held in reserve, since they only opened once, and then but for a short time, ceasing immediately with the cause that had drawn forth their fire. Our orders were to observe this line of Lancers, and not to fire unless they attempted to cross the ravine, but as they never did this we had ample leisure to remark all that was passing around us, which I much regret not having noted down at the time instead of trusting to a treacherous memory. A continued skirmish was kept up amongst the corn near the Nivelles road by the riflemen, &c, whilst the Cavalry in the bottom sent from time to time small detachments up the opposite bank, which, after advancing a short distance towards the line of Lancers, retreated again, and rejoined their main body.

One of those bodies, however, came over in more com pact order, and was holding its course directly towards us, when a Regiment of Cavalry (I think of the German Legion), debouching from the ravine at D, formed up to attack them.

Several avalanches of this sort had already occurred, when (perhaps about 2 p.m.) such a burst took place that the whole right of the first line appieared to have been overwhelmed by it. I can compare it to nothing better than a heavy surf breaking on a coast beset with isolated rocks, against which the mountainous wave dashes with furious uproar, breaks, divides, and runs, hissing and boiling, far beyond up the adjacent beach. In a moment such shoals of Lancers and others came sweeping down the slope that the whole interval between the lines was covered with them, a mixed and various multitude, all scattered and riding in different directions.

Whilst anxiously watching the movements of the con- fused melee that thronged the plain, our attention was suddenly called to the direction of Merbe Braine by loud The Belgians and reiterated shouts, that we found proceeding from from Merle several Columns of Infantry, which, debouching from that Braine- place, were rapidly crossing the fields towards us. Still, however, the line of Lancers remained immovable, which seemed inexplicable. The advancing Columns had all the appearance of being French, and we prepared to give the best reception in our power to the double attack which we expected, when to our no small joy a mounted Officer of the 14th, who had on the first alarm gone down the hill to reconnoitre, returned with the intelligence that they were Belgians who had been ordered up into line. In the meantime the scattered bands of horsemen had, like all those that preceded them, begun to evaporate, and things were reassuming the same appearance as before their irrupition, when Lieut.-Colonel Sir Augustus Fraser, who commanded the Horse Artillery, came in great haste to conduct us to a position in the first line ; accordingly, limbering up to the left, we moved off at a gallop in column of sub-divisions, taking the route indicated in your plan. On the way Sir Augustus informed me that a serious attack was meditated against that part of the line to which he was leading us ; that in all probability we should be immediately engaged with the Enemy's Cavalry, in which case should they charge home, it was the Duke's positive order that the men should be withdrawn from their Guns into the nearest Infantry Squares.

Mercer's Troop. tolerably level surface for about 40 or 50 yards ; and thence the ground descended rapidly towards the plain that divided the two Armies. Our leading sub-division had scarcely arrived on the position, ere it became evident that the Duke's order could not be complied with, for a heavy Column of Cavalry com posed of Grenadiers a Cheval and Cuirassiers, had just ascended the Plateau and was advancing upon us at a rapid pace, so that there scarcely appeared time even to get into action, and, if caught in column, of course we were lost. Hardly time to get into action before the French Cavalry was close upon it. However, the order was given to deploy, and each Gun as it came up immediately opened its fire ; the two In fantry Squares at the same time commencing a feeble and desultory fire ; for they were in such a state that I momentarily expected to see them disband. Disordered state of the Brunswick troops, who were mere boys. Their ranks, loose and disjointed, presented gaps of several file in breadth, which the Officers and Sergeants were busily employed filling up by pushing and even thumping their men together ; whilst these, standing like so many logs, with their arms at the recover, were ap parently completely stupefied and bewildered. I should add that they were all perfect children. None of the privates, perhaps, were above 18 years of age. In spite of our fire the Column of Cavalry continued advancing at a trot until separated from us by scarcely more than the breadth of the little road, but at the very moment when we expected to be overwhelmed, those of the leading Squadrons suddenly turning, and endeavouring to make way to the rear, confusion took place, and the whole broke into a disorderly crowd. The scene that ensued is scarcely to be described. Several minutes elapsed ere they suc ceeded in quitting the Plateau, during which our fire was incessant, and the consequent carnage frightful, for each Gun (9 Prs.) was loaded with a round and case shot ; all of which, from the shortness of the distance, size of the object, and elevation of the ground on which they stood, must have taken effect.

Mercer's Troop dashed through the intervals between our Guns, and made their way as we had seen others do ; but the greater part, rendered desperate at finding themselves held, as it were, in front of the Battery, actually fought their way through their own ranks, and in the struggle we saw blows ex changed on all sides.

At length the Column being re-formed, again ascended the Plateau, and advanced to attack us, but this time their pace scarcely exceeded a walk, or at most a gentle trot, too many obstacles lying in their way to admit of more rapid movement without confusion. This was in our favour. Experience having shown us the unerring and destructive effects of a close fire, we allowed the leading Squadrons to attain about half the distance between the brow of the slope and the road in our front before we commenced. It is scarcely necessary to say that the result was precisely similar to what has been already detailed.

Be that as it may, the last had just"], [256, "220 WATERLOO LETTERS.

Arrived on the summit, these disorders were rectified, although the fire that now opened upon us from the General Enemy's Batteries caused considerable loss, and the whole the Line. (our neighbours of Brunswick included) descended the hill towards the plain. I suppose this movement must have been general ; for, at the moment it took place the cannonade slackened all along the line, and the smoke clearing away in a great measure, enabled me for the first time to get an extended view over the field. The summit and declivity of the opposite position were covered with dark masses of troops, and others were in movement on the plain, but my recollection is too confused to admit of attempting to particularise. The Line having descended sufficiently to permit of it, we had just commenced firing over them at the masses in the plain, when under cover of the smoke a Battery came (we could not conjecture whence) and established itself a little in advance of our left flank, from which it could not have enfi7aded\u00b0by a been uistant more than four hundred yards (marked E in Battery on its the Plan), and thus almost enfilading our line, besides being' left front, and , . , \u201e \u00b0 a a most de- on higher ground ; the fire it poured in upon us was the stmctive fire. most destructive we had yet experienced, and could not supportedby have failed to annihilate us, had we not been saved by a a Belgian \" Battery of Belgic Horse Artillery which came up soon after which drove on our left (F), and thus taking them almost in flank, soon the former drove them from their position. from its 1 position. Before the arrival of these Belgians, however, we had"], [257, "ROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY. 221 Mercer's Troop. turned two Guns against our adversaries in the hope, if not of silencing them, at least of rendering their fire less deadly. Hardly had this been done, when an Officer in a black Hussar uniform came to inform us that we were The hostile killing our friends the Prussians. It was useless repeating J^g^ to^be to this man that in such a melee we could only know the Prussian. tree by its fruit, and that our friends the Prussians had already treated us very scurvily, of which abundant testi monials lay around. We even ceased firing altogether to convince him, but to no effect, although during the interval he witnessed the continued and dreadful fire kept up by his countrymen. At last we persuaded him to ride round and endeavour to stop the fire of the other Battery, but we heard no more of him, and, as I said before, were only saved from annihilation by the Belgians, who, by the bye, were all drunk, and would have fired upon us, too, had we not taken some pains to put them straight. My recollections of this period of the Battle are rather confused, but I think that soon after, our Infantry appear ing in the plain, all firing from the Batteries ceased, and about the same time we saw the Enemy's masses dissolving and streamings from the field in confused multitudes. Just then an Aide-de-Camp galloped up, shouting to us with all his might, \" Forward, Sir ! Forward !

D'Erlon's During the attack on our left, by the Count D'Erlon's Picton n Columns, the position of the 5th Division under Sir Thomas D'Erlon's Picton, to which my Battery was attached, must be too well known to you to need repetition.

In reply to your inquiry as to the manner in which Manner in that attack was met and repulsed, I have to state, by the repulsed. fire of the Artillery of the Division, as long as it was possible to continue it ; and on the Enemy coming into close contact with us, by the Infantry of the Division passing between the Guns, and receiving them at the points of their bayonets. These were almost immediately sup ported by a body of our Heavy Cavalry, advancing in Probably the column, as it appeared to us, parallel to and along the j;nd road from the right, but the smoke became so dense and the mclie so complete, that it is impossible, at this distant period of time, to describe with sufficient accuracy the movements of any particular body of the parties en gaged.

See General Plan of Waterloo, No. 1. Here the latter sustained such a severe and continued contest with the French troops, that about two o'clock there were hardly any of them remaining. During the day the Brigade was exposed to an incessant cannonade, and to the attacks of the French Cavalry.

In this position we received the last attack of Cavalry I saw that day, who, refusing us, passed between us and the inward rear angle of the orchard, receiving our fire ; did not charge between us and the 52nd, where the Rifles were, but rode along the front of the 52nd with a view of turning their right flank, and were completely destroyed by the fire of that Regiment.

On the evening of 17th of June about six o'clock, four Light Companies of the Guards, one of which I commanded, were suddenly ordered from our bivouac to take possession of the farmhouse, garden, orchard, and wood of Hougoumont. Evening of the 17th four Light Com panies of the Guards sent to occupy Hougoumont. The two Light Companies of the 1st Brigade occupied the orchard, the two Light Companies of the 2nd Brigade the farmhouse and garden.

The French brought up their advanced posts close to ours, but gave us no molestation. .... Those of the 1st Brigade occupied the orchard, those of the 2nd the garden and house. In looking on the Plan, I cannot help thinking that the wood at Hougoumont is represented as much thicker and closer than it actually was. It had no underwood, and was easily traversed in all parts by Light Infantry, and the communication of files kept up with the greatest facility. See Plan of Hougoumont, p. 263. I can speak to this point, as I was sent at one time of the day (I believe about two o'clock) from the orchard with some Light Troops to drive the French Tirailleurs back, who had become very annoying to the farm, and were gradually gaining ground, particularly on the right flank of our position.

It was some time after the Action had commenced that a body of troops rushed into the wood from the field by the path leading to the Charleroi road. These came from Foy. They made a desperate attack and attempt to get into the orchard. Most were killed or wounded by the men inside the garden wall. Gallant attempt of the French to get into the orchard. The Division of Guards marched right in front from the place we halted at, about five miles from Quatre Bras. We had proceeded some way by the edge of the wood, when we were halted by the Prince of Orange, who wheeled the first Brigade into the wood. They began firing directly. The French were by this time getting very close to the edge. They never were through or near enough to prevent the Prince of Orange from coming up the road. The first Regiment lost most of their men by shooting each other. Maitland has been much blamed for not clearing the wood with his two Light Companies, which he might have done.

The 3rd (Light) Infantry Brigade consisted of the 52nd Light Infantry, the 71st Light Infantry (Glasgow Highlanders), the 2nd Battalion, and two Companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 9 5th Rifles. It was commanded by Major-Greneral F. Adam. Previous to the commencement of the Battle of Waterloo it was posted between the village of Merbe Braine and the Nivelles road, but on the French moving to attack Hougoumont it was formed behind the Nivelles road in reserve to the See General Troops in the front line. Towards the afternoon it was moved close up to the Nivelles road, and about four o'clock ordered by the Duke of Wellington to form a four-deep line, and attack the crowds of French skirmishers who had driven in the Artillerymen from the Batteries on the crest of the position. The skirmishers were repulsed and the Brigade advanced and took up a diagonal position in the hollow to the left rear of Hougoumont. Here it See Plan, was formed in Squares which successfully resisted p' \" several attacks of the French Cavalry, but during"], [308, "272 WATERLOO LETTERS. the intervals between these attacks, the Squares suffered greatly from the fire of the French Artillery, especially the two flank Battalions, the 2nd Battalion 95th Rifles, and the 71st. The portion of the 3rd Battalion 95th Rifles, attached to the 71st Regiment, most materially contributed, by its effective independent fire, in repulsing a Cavalry attack on the Square of the latter Regi ment. About six o'clock, the right of the Brigade being considered exposed to a flank attack from the enclosures of Hougoumont, the whole were with drawn behind the crest of the main position, so as to be under cover from the Enemy's Artillery. On the approach of the 2nd attacking Column of the Imperial Guard, which threw out a cloud of skirmishers in its front, the 52nd and 2nd Battalion 95th sent out a Company each to check them, but these were driven in by a body of Cuirassiers moved forward to attack the Batteries which fired on the Column. The Brigade, meanwhile, had been formed in line four deep, and brought up to the road running along the ridge of the position, and its appearance induced the Cuirassiers to retire, pursued by a Squadron of the 23rd Light Dragoons. The French Column having diverged from its original direction somewhat to the right, so as to rather lend its left flank to Adam's Brigade, Colonel Sir John Colborne, commanding the 52nd, the centre Regiment, wheeled his left Company to the left, and formed the other Companies on it, so as to bring his front nearly parallel with the left See General Plan, No. 2."], [309, "ADAM'S INFANTRY BRIGADE. 273 flank of the Column. The Imperial Guard halted, wheeled up its left sections into an opposing line to the 52nd, and opened a most destructive fire on that Regiment. The Duke, seeing Colborne's movement, at once ordered the 2nd Battalion 95th, on the left, to conform to it. Col borne, after pouring a deadly fire into the French Column, which was quickly succeeded by that of the 95th, ordered his Regiment to charge the Column, and the 95th hastened to join in the charge. Meanwhile, Adam had galloped to the right to order the 71st Regiment and 3rd Battalion 95th to also conform to Colborne's move- ment, but they had so much ground to get over that they were not in time to fire into the Column before the charge commenced. The French Column (excepting the two rear Battalions, which retired in a considerable degree of order) broke into the wildest confusion, and as the Brigade pursued them, its line became at first nearly perpendicular to the French position, a Hanoverian Battalion under Lieutenant-Colonel Halkett was advanced to give support to its exposed right flank. The French fugitives, meantime, bearing more towards La Belle Alliance, were being followed by the Brigade, when its front was crossed by the returning party of the 23rd Light Dragoons, at which, by mistake, some shots were fired, and immediately afterwards three French Guns on the prolongation of the right of the line of the 52nd began to enfilade it with grape, but were driven away by the right Section, which was wheeled up by Lieutenant Gawler for that purpose. s"], [310, "274 WATERLOO LETTERS. The Brigade next came upon three Squares of the Imperial Guard, which were posted on a height with their right resting on the Genappe road, and the Duke ordered the Brigade to attack them. On the Brigade advancing, the Squares, after firing into it, were faced to the rear and retreated by word of command. Sec General Plan, No. 3. The Brigade, in its pursuit of the Squares, crossed the main road, and was threatened by a body of Cuirassiers, but Adam moved on in four deep formation, and the Cuirassiers declined the contest. On ascending the high ground in rear of La Belle Alliance, it was by mistake fired on by a Prussian Batteiy. Soon after this it dispersed some Infantry, and captured some Artillery, who were unaware of its approach, and the last (as snpj)Osed) French Gun fired that day was turned round by men of the 71st Regiment and fired by Captain Campbell (Adam's Aide-de-Camp) into the retiring Columns of the Imperial Guard. The Brigade bivouacked for the night at or near the Farm of Rossomme. Among the letters of this Brigade I have included that of General William Halkett, who led the Hanoverian Battalion which so effectively co operated with it during the final Advance, and who captured General Cambronne, the Commander of the two rear Battalions of the Imperial Guard above referred to.

I must premise by stating that having kept no notes at the time (in consequence of being wounded, and subse quently employed by orders of the Duke of Wellington while at Brussels), and never from that time to this having put anything on paper relating to the Battle, I have only my memory to trust to, and at this distance of time it is possibly not very accurate. I may add that from the circumstance of my service since 1815, I have been little in the way of hearing the details of the Action discussed, and probably have not ten times during the three-and-twenty years which have elapsed, endeavoured to refresh my impressions for the purpose of stating in conversation the transactions which I witnessed on the 18th June, 1815. I wish these observations to be kept more especially in view as regards the hours of the day at which particular events took place. The relation of these events to others or their sequence, I can probably pretty accurately record, but the exact time of their occurrence must be fixed by the coinciding or pre ponderating testimony as to the hours of occurrence which may best [be] trusted to fix the precise jieriod of the day. The 3rd Brigade was bivouacked on the night of the 17th en potence to the main line of the troops. Merbe Braine was a little in front of its left. The first position taken up by the 3rd Brigade was nearly that marked on the Plan, formed by Battalions in columns of Companies at quarter distance. In this position the Brigade remained in reserve with piled arms until the Enemy's Cavalry gained the crest of the position running from the [rear of] Hougoumont towards La Haye Sainte.

The contrary occurred, and the Brunswickers stood firm, and the Enemy's Cavalry retired. Shortly after this the 3rd Brigade was ordered to advance, which it did in the order in which it was formed, to the Nivelles road, on the edge of which it remained for some time exposed to a fire of Artillery, by which a con siderable number of men were disabled. After crossing the Nivelles road the Duke of Wellington personally directed that the Brigade should form line four deep \" and drive those fellows away,\" meaning some French Infantry. There was not space to form the 52nd in line with the 71st and 95th, and the 52nd consequently was a sort of reserve to the Brigade.

The Enemy's Infantry were very soon disposed of, and the Brigade continued to advance to about where the Cavalry of the Enemy, being prepared to attack, the Brigade was formed in columns aud then in squares. The interval between the 71st and 95th was larger than desirable, and when the Cavalry were just reaching the 71st Sir John Colborne brought down the 52nd to fill up the space, and [threw] in a most effective oblique fire on the Cavalry, which were in the act of attacking the 71st Regiment.

After the Cavalry attacks had been disposed of, and subsequently when the Enemy's Infantry were again about attacking Hougoumont, the right of the Brigade was judged to be too near the enclosures of that place, and had it remained, would have been exposed to being taken in flank from thence.

The first encounter with the Imperial Guard was a very sharp tussle with its Tirailleurs, but this did not extend to our right further than the right of 52nd, and hardly to left of 71st. When their Tirailleurs were disposed of, the 52nd were right shouldered forward by Sir J.

While advancing, the Duke of Wellington being with the Brigade, some Battalions of the Enemy were re-formed, and appeared inclined to stand. The Duke ordered them to be attacked, but it was suggested to his Grace that the Brigade, which from its rapid advance was somewhat loose in its formation, had better be halted and the files closed in. The halt was ordered accordingly, but after a few moments the Duke said, \" They won't stand, better attack them,\" and the 3rd Brigade was accordingly again put in motion, and the Battalions of the Enemy withdrew, and fell into the mass of confusion which existed in our front.

Waterloo A subject so fully discussed leaves little room for addition. Colonel Gawler having acknowledged the error into which he had fallen respecting the 71st Regiment, it appears to me that he has faithfully given the leading features of the position and movements of the Light Brigade, though I am not quite prepared to admit that the 1st Guards, and 2nd and 3rd 95th, may not be said to have co-operated in the repulse of the last attack of the Imperial Guard.

I have been so fully occupied since the year 1815, that I have seldom had time or inclination to read any of the accounts of the Battle of Waterloo. Indeed, it has always"], [317, "ADAM'S INFANTRY BRIGADE. 281 52nd Regiment, been a most unpleasant task to refer to our past military operations, which are connected with many painful recollec tions. I have cautiously abstained from giving opinions on controverted points that would draw me into discussions. I think, however, that it almost becomes my duty to give you every assistance in my power to enable you to compare the facts in my statement with the information which you have received from various sources, and to correct the errors which appear in the accouut you have forwarded to me. We were all so intent in performing our own parts, that we are disposed to imagine that the Brigade or Corps with which we were engaged played a most distinguished part, and attribute more importance to the movements under our own immediate observation than they deserved. I am persuaded that none but mounted Officers can give a correct account of the Battle, and very few of those had an opportunity of seeing much beyond the limited space which they traversed. I have, in great haste, from the impressions which I stronglv retain at this moment, written down the princi pal facts which occurred under my observation, a kind of log-book from eleven o'clock to the close of the Action. With respect to the troops that first entered Paris by the Bridge of Neuilly and the Bois de Boulogne \u2014 the Brigade of General Adam passed the bridge of Neuilly the night before the Duke took up his quarters in Parisj and halted at Neuilly, after having had a sharp discus sion with the French Officer in command of the Squadrons of Cavalry at the bridge, who opposed our passage of the bridge in consequence of his having received no orders to give up his post. Adam's Brigade was the first to enter Paris. The next morning Sir F. Adam's Brigade, unaccom panied by any other, marched by the Barriere de l'Etoile to the Champs-Elysees. The 52nd was posted near the Duke of Wellington's quarters.

It was eleven o'clock when our Batteries (of twenty Guns, I believe), in position on the rising ground to our left of Hougoumont opened their fire on a Column advanc ing on Hougoumont.

On our arriving near the cross road on the summit of the hill, near the Belgian Guns, I halted the 52nd. Many of our wounded were lying a few paces in our front. My anxious attention had been attracted to the dense Columns moving on the Genappe road towards the centre of our position, and observing their rapid advance I ordered our left hand Company to wheel to the left, and formed the remaining Companies on that Company. Colonel Charles Rowan assisted in completing this formation, with whom I had had some conversation on the intended movement, and on the necessity of menacing the flank of the French Columns.

'6 Sir John Byng mentioned to me, at Paris, that he observed our movement in front of his Brigade, and that at this time his Brigade had no ammunition left. Lord Hill mentioned to me also that he was near the Brigade of Guards when he observed the 52nd moving across the plain, that some men of the British Guards were retiring, that he ordered them to advance, waving his hat to them. I think, therefore, that this was the time when a por tion of the Imperial Guards halted to fire on the 52nd, and that immediately after this halt the British Guards charged, and made their forward movement. It appears to me evident, if this statement be correct, the movement of the 52nd took place some time before any forward movement was made by the Guards. I have been particular in stating many unimportant occurrences, because I am persuaded several absurd blunders and stories have originated from the movements of the 52nd, and General Adam's Brigade, having been misrepresented. S. LIEUT.-COLONEL G. GAWLER, K.H., UNATTACHED. Lieutenant 52nd Regiment. Derby, December 22nd, 1834. No. 124.

Nivelles Chaussee and Merbe Braine, 400 or 500 yards East of the latter village, A. After daylight on the morning of the ISth June some Companies of the Brigade were sent to occupy Merbe Braine. The 52nd gave its right Company, to which I belonged. This Company was posted in the garden of a small country-house, of which the westernmost hedge was the limit, on that side, of the enclosures of Merbe Braine. On the summit of the rise towards Braine-la-Leud two or three Battalion Columns were in sight, which proved to be Dutch or Belgic. While in this garden we heard the first cannon-shot of the Battle, fired in the direction of Hougoumont. An Officer near me pulled out his watch, and said it was \"Twenty minutes past 11 o'clock.\" Soon after this, it might be about 12 o'clock, we were ordered to rejoin the Brigade. When we cleared the enclosures of the village it was seen standing in open column in about the posi tion B.

The first and greatest attack on Hougoumont was then going on, and we were evidently supporting what had now become the right wing of the Army in rear of Hougou mont.

In consequence of this annoyance from the cannonade, the 52nd went over the rise to the ground D or *D, I think the former. From near this point the 51st Regi ment was distinctly seen extended at E E.

I do not know positively what became of the other Regiments of the Brigade during this interval, but suppose them to have remained at short distances from the 52nd. The crops about the spot D were very high. I cannot speak with confidence to the precise time, but calculating from other occurrences of which the times are fixed, I think it must have been after four o'clock when Past 4 p.m. the 52nd left the point D.

The point at which the 52nd Squares crossed the first line of the Army, and near which it subsequently formed to receive the attack of the Imperial Guard, was occupied by Brunswickers in squares, front ranks kneeling. On crossing the summit the 2nd Battalion 95th was seen, as if taking up its ground, in square at F, annoyed by skirmishers from the great hollow of La Haye Sainte; and shortly after the 71st was visible in square at F, very near to the easternmost hedge of Hougoumont.

The great hollow about La Haye Sainte, however, was evidently occupied in force, from the boldness with which the French skirmishers pushed out of it, at times almost to the summit of the British position. From this hollow the Square of the 2nd 95th was, / believe, charged by Cavalry.

The other Regiments of the Brigade, I have every reason to believe, made precisely the same formation. The order, I believe, was given by the Duke himself. At this time he passed unattended from the left to beyond our right and shortly after returned to beyond our left. In this position the 52nd right was under good cover \u2014 it was about forty paces directly in rear of the left of a Field Battery, which at intervals fired down the face of the hill. The left of the 52nd was much more thrown back from the summit. A low hedge ran across its front at some distance from it. Individuals of Nos. 3 and 4 Companies remember this hedge distinctly as does the Adjutant, who was generally with Sir John Colborne in front of the left centre (see U.S. Journal, September, 1833, page 15). Sergeant Dolan of No. 4 Company, now a pensioner at Armagh, tore his leg so much in passing it that the Captain of his Company asked if he were wounded. I have good reason to believe that the 2nd Battalion 95th Regiment was near to our left, but, if anything, rather to its rear. The 71st Regiment was certainly close to our right, so close that, as I was very distinctly informed by an"], [329, "ADAM'S INFANTRY BRIGADE. 291 52nd Regiment. Officer of the 3rd Battalion 95th, the two Companies of this Regiment had not room to deploy between us, but remained in column in rear of the 71st. The last great attack of the French commenced about seven o'clock. Judging from the information which I have received from others, and from my own recollections of the direction and duration of the musketry fire, / think that about the first half-hour was occupied in a direct attack of the Enemy, upon the tongue of ground, which projects from the position, two or three hundred yards to the left of the position of the 52nd Regiment. The last great attack of the French began about 7 p.m. Before the attack commenced Sir P. Maitland's and Sir Colin Halkett's Brigades were advanced, upon this very important tongue of ground, to maintain it as long as possible from the possession of the Enemy. This first' part of the attack was made principally (I conclude) by the 1st French Corps. The fighting was very close and desperate. The British made a successful charge, but outflanked and overwhelmed by fresh Columns (perhaps the leading masses of the Guard) were compelled to retire rapidly. Halkett's Brigade, which had suffered most severely, was moved by the Duke in person about 100 yards to the left and rear, and three Battalions of Bruns wickers pushed forward to check the Enemy. This refers to the repulse of the 1st attack ing Column of the Imperial Guard, for an account of which see Maitland's Infantry Brigade. \u2014 Ed. The Brunswickers broke into great confusion, but were rallied by the Duke himself. On the flanks of this attack the Enemy pushed forward swarms of skirmishers. The 2nd 95th, and the 52nd threw out each a Company to check those in their front, but these Companies were immediately driven in by a charge of Cavalry from towards their les t, and the 52nd came 'down to the \"prepare for Cavalry.\" The French Cavalry drive in the skir mishers of the 52nd and 2nd 95th. Thus passed the first half-hour of the attack. I have introduced in the above account of it very much that I know only from the testimony of others, because without it the following account of the second half-hour would be unconnected and somewhat unintelligible. Sir P. Maitland's Brigade had by this time taken up a \u25a0i"], [330, "WATERLOO LETTERS. 292 52nd Regiment, line as much to the rear at the least as the left of the 52nd. I have no reasonable information as to what became of the Brunswickers, or how the immediate left of the Guards was then supported, but have some reason to think that a part of Colonel Ompteda's Brigade was there.

The right of the 52nd grazed the left Gun of the Battery in its front. The Captain of No. 1 Company (now Major Diggle) fell severely wounded close to its wheel. So close was the left Company to the Imperial Column that it was compelled to wheel back on its right, while the rest of the Regiment came forward on their left. The Enemy was pressing on with shouts, which rose above the noise of the firing, and his fire was so intense that, with but half the ordinary length of front, at least, 150 of the 52nd fell in less than four minutes. I almost think in less than three, for there was not the slightest check in the advance of the right flank below the average of the old wheeling time.

In the next ten seconds the Imperial Guard, broken into the wildest con fusion, and scarcely firing a shot to cover its retreat, was rushing towards the hollow road in their rear of La Haye Sainte, near to which, according to La Coste's account, Napoleon himself was then standing. The 52nd charge the French Column (and the 2nd 95th joins in the charge on the left of it. \u2014Ed.). During the charge Sir J.

Lieut.-Colonel Chas. Rowan fell on the left at about the same time that Captain Diggle was wounded on the right. The point at which the left of the 52nd crossed the original line of the left flank of the Imperial Guard was at the highest point of the re-entering angle formed by the projecting tongue of land, and the rise behind which the 52nd had been covered. I convinced myself of this fact the next morning by the manner in which the killed and wounded on both sides were lying."], [332, "291 WATERLOO LETTERS. 52nd Regiment. Although there is reason to believe that the Enemy's second Corps was advanced to cover the left flank of his attack with its own left resting on the hedge of Hougou mont, yet no part of it came near enough to menace seriously the right flank of the 52nd Regiment during the whole of the forward movement and charge. This right flank appeared entirely clear of the enemy for at least 300 yards. Adam's Brigade presses for ward towards the Genappe road. See No. 48, p. 98. The 52nd continued pressing forward at a hurried pace, until its left was so near the hollow road in front of La Haye Sainte, that an Officer of the left Company stepped out to see what the fugitives in it were doing. In its course to this point the coming upon its front of a broken body of Dcirnberg's Cavalry Brigade at g, and the throwing out of its right section to drive in some Guns by which it was enfiladed at about h, occurred, to the best of my recollec tion and judgment, as already described in my narrative of the \" Crisis and Close, &c.\" Three French Guns which enfiladed the 52nd at this point were driven off by the right section under Lieut. Gawler. \u2014Ed. The 71st Regiment moved forward to protect the right flank of the 52nd Regiment as described in that narrative, I now think, however, without firing . The two Companies of the 3rd Battalion 95th formed line on the left flank of the 71st. The 2nd Battalion 95th followed up on the left flank of the 52nd, but, / think, did not get into line with it until it reached near to the hollow road, and then more as a body of skirmishers than as a line. This Battalion of the 95th suffered at some jioint in its advance a heavy loss. This may have been from the French occupying La Haye Sainte. Colonel Halkett's Hanoverian Brigade followed at some distance in support of the ad vance of Adam's Brigade, and some of the 1st Battalion 95th may have mixed with the 2nd 95th when passing La Haye Sainte. Besides these, I have strong reasons for believing that no other portion of the Buke of Wellington' s Army left the British position for a full quarter of an hour after the advance of the b%nd. It was hardly so long before Vivian's Cavalry Bri gade passed to the front. \u2014Ed.

For the movements and formations of the 52nd Regiment during the subsequent pursuit I must refer you to the narrative of the \" Crisis and Close,\" with the following corrections and additional notices. The position in which Adam's Brigade found and at tacked the three squares of the Old Guard covering the retreat was at H H H, instead of being as inserted in the Plan accompanying my printed narrative ; and I have now reason to think that, at this time, the two Companies of the 3rd 95th were between the 71st and 52nd, and that a considerable body of the 2nd 95th were to the left of the 52nd. The whole Brigade were in one line. \u2014Ed. See General Plan, No. 3. I have some reason to think that the 71st formed a tivo-deep line before this attack. The 52nd certainly con tinued four deep to the close of the day. I very confidently believe that the 52nd crossed the chaussee at K K, and the 71st very soon after it. I have not traced the routes of the 52nd and 71st on the East side of the chaussee, because I feel some doubts as to the depth of the sweep which the two Regiments described.

When Adam's Brigade ad vanced, lost no time in The moment General Adam's Brigade advanced I lost no time to follow with the Osnabruck Battalion (2nd Battalion, Duke of York), then on the left of Hougou mont, of which post I was in command, one of the Battalions of my Brigade occupying the wood and two others in the ditches in the rear, other troops occupying the enclosures, &c. following with the Osnabruck Battalion, taking it from the post of Hougoumont. Sent his During the advance I sent my Brigade Major, Captain v. Saffe, to bring up the two Battalions posted in rear of Hougoumont, but neither he nor the Battalions showed themselves. Next day I found that Captain Saffe was killed before having delivered the message. The Osnabruck Battalion soon got in line and on the right of Adam's Brigade. During the advance we were much annoyed by the Enemy's Artillery. The first Company of the Osna bruck Battalion broke into platoons, and supported by the sharpshooters of the Battalion, made a dash at the Artil lery on our right and captured six Guns with their horses. Brigade-Ma j. for two more Battalions, but he was killed before delivering the message. Got in line with Adam's Brigade. The Battalion captured six Guns with their horses. Some hundred yards to our right were some Troops of Hussars (I believe the 10th). I rode up to them and got them to charge the head of a Column of Infantry, which was drawing to their left in rear of the French Guards. The charge succeeded admirably and the Column dispersed behind some enclosures, after which 1 saw no more of the Cavalry. Witnessed a successful charge of Cavalry on French Infantry. During our advance we were in constant contact with the French Guards, and I often called to them to surrender."], [347, "GENERAL WILLIAM HALKETT. 309 General W. Halkett. For some time I had my eye upon, as I supposed, the General Officer in command of the Guards (being in full uniform) trying to animate his men to stand. After having received our fire with much effect, the Column left their General with two Officers behind, when I ordered the sharpshooters to dash on, and I made a gallop for the General. When about cutting him down he called out he would surrender, upon which he preceded me [to the rear] , but I had not gone many paces before my horse got a shot through his body and fell to the ground. In a few seconds I got him on his legs again, and found my friend, Cambronne, had taken French leave in the direction from where he came. I instantly overtook him, laid hold of him Capture of by the aiguillette, and brought him in safety and gave him Jamhronne in charge to a sergeant of the Osnabruckers to deliver to the Duke ; I could not spare an Officer for the purpose, many being wounded. After this I kept in advance of Adam's Brigade ; we soon pushed the two French Squares upon the mass of their Cavalry of all descriptions, who at one moment threatened us in a most vociferous manner. However, after receiving our fire they went off in all directions. About this time, Officers were flying in all directions, seemingly with orders from a superior. Some French Officers, prisoners, said it was Napoleon. We had the good fortune to take twelve or fourteen more Guns of the Guards, in full play on us. On our advance the sharpshooters, supported by a Company, were sent among a mass of Guns, and by their fire increased the confusion, made many prisoners, and cut the horses from the leading Guns. Next morning I found marked on these Guns 52nd, 71st, &c, for I had followed the Enemy on the Genappe road, where I met the Prussians, and moved on with them to some houses on the left of the road near Genappe, which houses I occupied during the nio-ht, the Battalion being much knocked up, and not seeing any red-coats in the rear. Got in ad vance of Adam's Bri gade [See General Plan, No. 3), and drove on two French Squares. The Battalion threatened by Cavalry, who made off on receiving its fire. Captured twelve or fourteen more Guns. Met the Prussians on the Genappe road, and advanced with them to near Genappe. Soon after we halted, I sent the Major of the"], [348, "310 , WATERLOO LETTERS.

I hope the above short account of what I recollect of the proceedings of the Osnabruck Battalion during the latter part of the ever-memorable Battle of Waterloo may prove of service to Mr. Siborne.

The 4th Infantry Brigade consisted of the 14th Regiment (3rd Battalion), the 23rd Boyal Welsh Fusiliers, and the 51st Light Infantry, and was under the command of Lieut.-Colonel and Brevet-Colonel H. H. Mitchell of the latter Begi ment. At the commencement of the Battle of Waterloo the Brigade was posted as follows : \u2014 Along the portion of the Avenue leading to Hougoumont from the Nivelles road, and next to the latter, was extended the Light Company of the 23rd. On its right was an abatis across that road, and a Company of the 51st was sta tioned close to it.

The 14th Regiment was posted still further to the rear as a Reserve to the Light Infantry of the Brigade, which was thus opposed to the extreme left of the French Line. These troops more or less occupied the same positions throughout the day. The 23rd Regiment was stationed on the left of the Nivelles road, under the crest of the main ridge, and in rear of the 2nd Brigade of Cfuards. The latter having been gradually moved down as reinforcements to Hougoumont, their ground was occupied by Brunswick troops, and the 23rd was advanced to an interval between the Bruns wick Squares. Here it was suddenly ordered to prepare to receive Cavalry, instead of which the Chasseurs of the Guard appeared before it, where upon the front face of the 23rd Square precipitately opened an ineffectual fire, but instantly recovering itself, the Regiment and the Brunswickers made good their defence. The 23rd remained in square until the final advance, repelling several attacks of Cavalry. After one of these attacks, a body of Cuirassiers which had surrendered to the British Cavalry, breaking away from a weak escort, galloped down the Nivelles road in the endeavour to regain their own lines in that direction. They were fired upon by the 51st, and after suffering great loss, were for the most part taken prisoners by the Company at the abatis.

The Infantry having given way a charge of Cavalry immediately followed. The Regiment in line ran into square to our right, a little in advance and nearer to the garden of Hougoumont.

On the morning of the 18th, the Brigade took up a position at about ten o'clock in rear of Hougoumont until the Enemy made their appearance on the rising ground of La Belle Alliance, when, on their Columns advancing, a Company of the Regiment was ordered to extend and cover the right of Hougoumont to meet the Enemy's skirmishers, who were moving forward at the head of their Columns. From the undulating nature of the ground and the high standing corn, this Company (Captain Phelps') did not come in contact with the Enemy until within about seventy paces of each other, when a firing commenced. The Enemy's Cavalry were supporting their advance, but our Infantry at this time were not so supported. The Enemy retired slowly towards the enclosures of Hougoumont ; their Columns were then halted upon the slope of the hill. About this period of the affair a small body of Light Cavalry came to support our skirmishers, and at the same time a Staff Officer arrived with a verbal order from Lord Hill to retire, and the Company retired in the usual way, A Company of the 51st skirmished with the Enemy on the opposite rising ground It was retired by order of Lord Hill."], [356, "WATERLOO LETTERS. 316 5 1st Regiment. skirmishing upon and near the Nivelles road, and halted on joining four Companies of the 51st under Major Keyt, and posted with their left on the road, and a few hundred yards to the right of Hougoumont supported by the remainder of the Regiment, which position the Regiment maintained during the day.

They were commanded by an Officer who surrendered to Captain Ross, although he was closely jiursued by some English Light Dragoons, to whom he would not again surrender, as he had formerly been their prisoner. There were twelve horses and eight Cuirassiers killed on this occasion, and the remainder, about sixty, were dismounted, taken, or dispersed.

The 5th Infantry Brigade was composed of the 30th Kegiment (2nd Batt.), the 33rd Begiment, the 69th Begiment (2nd Batt.), and the 73rd Begi ment (2nd Batt.), and was under the command of Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B., who was twice wounded at the Battle of Waterloo. The Brigade reached Quatre Bras a little before 5 p.m. on the 16th June by the Nivelles road. It was at once moved up to the right between the Bois de Bossu and the Charleroi road, in support of the Brunswickers, and of Back's advanced Battalions. The latter having nearly expended all their ammunition, the 69th Begiment was pushed forward to their assistance. See Plan of Quatre Bras. Halkett, who had perceived the French Cavalry preparing to attack, sent word to the 69th to form square. They were in the act of doing so, when the Brince of Orange ordered them to form line, and the Cavalry approaching unseen, owing to the high-standing corn, suddenly charged the Begi ment in this situation, completely rolled it up, and in the confusion captured one of its Colours. The 30th Begiment, on the other hand, received the Cavalry in square, and repulsed them in such a manner as to call forth the commendations of Sir Thomas Ficton. \"When the Cavalry retired, the Square of the 33rd, which had been formed on rising ground, suffered so severely from the French Artillery fire, that it was found necessary to form it into line. The Begiment was advancing in that formation to"], [359, "HALKETT'S INFANTRY BRIGADE. 319 the support of some Brunswickers, when a report was spread along the line that the French Cavalry was in its rear, upon which it rushed into the wood in disorder. Sir C. Halkett then came up, and, seizing one of the Colours, made the Begiment re-form upon it, and order was thus restored. As the Guards gradually advanced through the Bois de Bossu, Halkett's Brigade moved forward up to the little rivulet, behind which it rested for the night. At Waterloo the Brigade was posted to the left of Maitland's Guards, and thus formed the left portion of all the British Infantry on the right of the Brussels Charleroi road. Sec General Plan, No. 1. Nearly the whole of the day it was formed in squares to resist the repeated attacks of the French Cavalry. Owing to the reduced state of the Begi ments, the 30th and 73rd together formed one Square, the 33rd and 69th another. The Light Infantry of the Brigade was extended on the exterior slope of the position during the intervals between the Cavalry attacks. In the evening, General Halkett being wounded for the second time, the command of the Brigade devolved upon Colonel Elphinstone, of the 33rd Begiment. When the British Guards advanced to drive hack the first attacking Column of the Imperial Guard, the 33rd and 69th were pushed forward by Halkett to cover their flank, which became exposed, as the attack of the Imperial Guard was accompanied by a corresponding advance of D'Erlon's Corps.

The fire of some of these Guns on the Square of the 30th and 73rd was at one time so destructive, that it was thrown into some confusion, but the Enemy retiring at the moment, it was brought into order again. The Brigade was then formed into line, and on the next and last advance of the French Infantry, received them with so well directed a volley, that after a little interval of musketry, they turned and fled.

I know nothing further of their transac tions on that day). My order from Sir Thomas was to move through the wood, and if possible to fall upon the left of the French Army, and further to act as I thought most advantageous. In proceeding with the view to follow the directions I received, an A.D.C. of General Pack came up to me, stat ing that Pack's Brigade had expended nearly the whole of their ammunition, and that if I did not support him he would be obliged almost immediately to abandon the post he held, which was of great advantage to our position, &c. &c.

On my further advance to accomplish what I had been instructed to do, I found the Brunswick Corps, who had lost their Duke, retiring rather precipitately. I immediately communicated with the Officer then commanding them (Olferman) and expressed my opinion as to the mode of their retrograde movement, and brought them up under cover in a ditch running nearly parallel to the line of the Enemy, and I considered it my duty to remain in support of the Bruns wickers until further communication could be made with headquarters.

I im mediately, however, made my mind up as to their intention of moving forward almost immediately. I had hardly returned to my Brigade when a heavy Artillery lire com menced upon the road, and having sent Lieut. [?

Unfortunately, in the act of forming square an Officer high in rank came up to the 69th Regiment, and asked what they were about. The reply was the directions they received from me, on which he said [there was] no chance of the Cavalry appearing, and ordered them to form column and to deploy into line, which of course was complied with, and during this very movement the Cavalry did attack, rode through the 69th Regiment, but situated as they were, the Enemy suffered a heavy loss.

This answer relieved me from the duty I was first sent upon by Sir Thomas Picton, and there I remained and was partially engaged on two or three occasions. When the Action ceased, I expected to be ordered to join my Division, instead of which, I think it was the Adjutant-General, Sir E. Barnes, came to me and wished to speak to me in private.

The only part that really did retreat was one Regiment (the 33rd), and which I was not all satisfied with. The Regi ment with me, or near where I teas, did not make the least movement, only one wing thrown back. The Brunswickers in my front took up my attention too much.

The 33rd I rode to the moment I could absent myself from the front, and I recollect I had some difficulty in getting them to the order they ought to have remained in, and I took one of their Colours and advanced to the front with it, which I think had the desired effect, and soon got them into the order they ought never to have lost. They then appeared steady and I left them. At this period, however, the Cavalry were in, or had effected their, retreat, and I think they lost a great number of men and horses.

Having been wounded and obliged to leave the Field about six p.m., I am unable to give specific replies to your most important questions, which relate to a subsequent period, and I think you will readily agree with me that a young Subaltern Officer,such as I was at that period, harassed and fatigued after two days' previous marching, fighting, and starving (for by some mismanagement our Division was not provisioned), was not likely to take particular notice of the features of the ground over which he was moving, or to direct his observations much beyond the range of what was likely to affect himself and the few soldiers immediately about him.

These Regiments did not at that period average more than 450, or at the utmost 500 effective men each. After this formation the Squares lay down, and the crest of the position interposed between them and the Enemy. The Artillery was advanced in about the same proportion on the exterior slope, and the Light Troops of the Division moved to the front to cover and support it. This force consisted, to the best of my recollection, in the following details : Four British Light Companies formed into a Battalion under Lieutenant-Colonel Vigoureux, 30th Regiment ; 1st and 2nd Light Battalions, K.G.L. They oecuptied the farmhouse and garden of La Haye Sainte \u2014 a Light Hanoverian Battalion and the Jagers von Kilmansegge (Rifles).

In the interval we experienced more than one charge of Cavalry, and the Light Infantry, in their occasional advances, now encountered the same description of force, usually engaging and sustaining a desultory fire near the foot of the respective positions. These charges repeated. In the intervals the skir- mishers are opposed by skirmishers. The Enemy's Batteries, too, had gained considerably in advance, and the Light Troops were now invariably assailed by grape as well as musketry, when they showed them selves at the foot of the position, endeavouring to offer a feeble resistance to the encroachments of the Enemy's Infantry, now establishing itself well in advance, and evidently preparing for the final attack. The Enemy's Infantry es tablishes itself well in advance, pre paring for the final attack.

A heavy Column of Brunswickers came up to our left (30th and 73rd Regiments) in the evening of June 18th. A remark upon them in my Journal states that \"they fell back at first bodily, but were rallied and afterwards stood their ground.\" If I am not deceived, Captain Hughes, 1st West India Regiment (then a Lieutenant of the 30th, and, if I may be permitted to say so, a most gallant officer), received a wound while assisting to rally them. But I do not think that these Brunswickers were engaged with the Guard. I saw no troops of the Guard to the French right of that Column which advanced on us (30th and 73rd), and which, though it came over the hill in beautiful order, was an inconceivable short time before us, turning and flying to a man at the single volley we fired, and the hurrah that followed it. Having expected great things from them, we were astonished at their conduct, and we young soldiers almost fancied there was some \" ruse \" in it. The men I spoke to as they lay wounded were all of the \" Moyenne Garde.\" They were sent by the Duke to fill up a gap in the line on the left of Hal kett'sBrigade. Repulse of a French Column by 30th and 73rd. The attacking Column of the Guard advanced against the British Guards, who were right of 33rd and 69th, who were again right of 30th and 73rd.

But I believe you must consider what follows to a certain extent as private, for I should be loth to offend any of my old friends by causing a public allusion to an awkward circumstance, of which I really know nothing but its alarming con sequences. Late in the day the French had brought up two Guns on the crest of our position, which fired grape into our Square (30th and 73rd) with very deadly effect. Someone in authority must have thought that the bank of a hedge Perilous con fusion into which the 30th and 73rd were thrown."], [371, "HALKETT'S INFANTRY BRIGADE. 331 30th Regiment. which ran a very short distance in our rear would afford us some cover, and in an evil moment we received the com mands to face about and march down to it. You may readily conceive that fire would not slacken on a body effecting such a movement ; but though suffering sadly, and disordered by our poor wounded fellows clinging to their comrades thinking they were being abandoned, our little Square retained its formation, and we had all but reached the hedge, when a body of men (British) rushed in amongst us, turned us altogether into a mere mob, and created a scene of frightful confusion. Fortunately the Enemy took no advantage of it. Nothing could be more gratifying than the conduct of our people at this disastrous period. While men and Officers were jammed together and carried along by the pressure from without, many of the latter, some cursing, others literally crying with rage and shame, were seizing the soldiers and calling on them to halt, while these admirable fellows, good-humouredly laughing at their excitement, were struggling to get out of the melee, or exclaiming \" By G\u2014 d, I'll stop, Sir, but I'm off my legs.\" Gratifying conduct of the men. I know nothing that remedied this terrible disorder but a shout which some one raised, and in which all joining the mass halted as if by word of command. An Officer was immediately desired by Major Chambers (who fell some minutes later) to take such men as he could get in addi tion to the Light Company, then reduced to fourteen rank and file, and to push up the hill as far as he dare to cover the re-formation. This was effected without difficulty, and all afterwards went right. And re-estab. lishment of order.

My Dear John, \u2014 I think the best way I possibly can answer Captain Siborne's query about the 33rd Regiment is by giving him a short sketch of what came under my Quatre Bras, notice at the Battle of Quatre Bras. In doing so it must ee be recollected that I took no notes, and that since then twenty-seven years have elapsed, and therefore my state ment is dependent entirely upon memory, may not be absolutely right in every particular, but will be found substantially correct. Halkett's As far as I remember, I think it must have been arrived be- between four and five o'clock in the evening that Sir tween 4 and Colin Halkett's Brigade advanced to that spot which is intersected by four roads, and from which fact the Battle derives its name, being Quatre Bras, or four arms. At this period the Scotch Division under Sir Thomas Picton was actively engaged a little in advance on the great road which leads to Charleroi. Immediately on getting there, Ordered to orders were given for the Brigade to move forward to the thei^Baisde r'ght, and support the right of Picton's Division. Bossu to the A movement agreeably to this order took place, each support the Regiment advancing in open column of Companies, pre \"S^* , _. . serving their respective distances, so as to deploy into Picton s Divi- o j. > i j sion, which line when necessary. The ground through which we had towards *\u00b0 auvance was much undulated, and in full crop of rye, Gemioncourt. which in that rich and luxuriant country grows excessively high, and on this account obstructed observation. As we advanced, the leading Company of our Regiment Cavalry being reached a prominent part of the field and observed the 33rd formed \u00b0 French Cavalry advancing to the charge. Orders were square. then given to form square to receive the Enemy. The Enemy, perceiving we were prepared for them, instead of advancing, made a movement to the left, broke in upon"], [375, "HALKETT'S INFANTRY BRIGADE. 335 33rd Regiment. the open Columns of the 69th Regiment, which, being on a low part of the field, had not observed them. The havoc that then took place was very great, and one of their Colours, I think the Regimental Colour, was carried off in triumph. All this took place with amazing rapidity and despatch, and the 33rd was not left long to contemplate objects with indifference. As I have already observed, we were made aware of the approach of the Cavalry, and that by the Grenadier Company, it having reached rising ground, and having formed square upon that Company, the whole Regiment were placed as a beacon in presence of the Enemy. Immediately a park of Artillery was opened at point blank distance upon our Column. The destruction consequent upon this was fearful. At this time Captain Hay, having moved from the head of his Company to encourage the face of the Square fronting the Enemy, was cut in two by a cannon ball, and poor Arthur Gore's brains were scattered upon my shako and face. \u25a0It was soon found necessary to deliver the Regiment from this untoward situation, which was done by deploying into line in an angular position. Upon getting into this new position, we were supported on the right by a Regi ment of Brunswick Cavalry, which behaved with great intrepidity. In advance, near the corner of the wood, a Regiment or Brigade of Brunswick Infantry were fiercely engaged. At this time the 33rd moved towards them ; but upon getting near the wood, a report being spread that the Cavalry were in the rear, the Regiment entered it and dispersed. It was at this time that Colonel Parkinson was wounded. He, with Captain Knight, Lieutenant Thane, and myself, went into the wood near the same place. Captain Knight formed the men near us, and advanced some distance towards the place where we thought the Enemy were ; but soon being at a loss to know where we were The Cavalry did not attack it, but took the 69th un awares. Broke it up, and captured one of its Colours. The 33rd being in square on rising ground, formed a mark for the Enemy's Ar tillery, and incurred great loss. It was there fore deployed into line. Advancing to support some Brunswick Infantry, on getting near the wood a report being spread that the Cavalry were in the ' rear, the Regiment rushed into the wood in own\"- in the wood, we retrograded, and came out of it disorder. upon one of the intersecting roads, as already alluded to."], [376, "336 WATERLOO LETTERS. 33rd Regiment. Upon getting there we found a Brigade of the Guards, which were immediately advanced. Having gone in another direction, did not see Hal kett seize the Colour and re-form the Regiment. The report of Sir Colin Halkett having seized one of our Colours and re-formed the Regiment may be true, and upon reflecting, a vague impression of that kind fleets over my mind ; but as the party with which I was connected, consisting of the above-mentioned Officers and about fifty or sixty men, found the Regiment upon returning formed on the outside of the wood, if such a circumstance took place, none of us saw it. By this time, the Guards having advanced and forced the Enemy from the field, no other active movement took place with Sir Colin Halkett's Brigade that evening, but we, with the rest of the Army, slept on the Field of Battle all night. The Retreat on 17th June The retreat. Early on the morning of the 17th the Brigade, being under arms, was ordered to move from its position, and from the direction it took we were all of the opinion that an attack was to be made upon the right wing of the French, which rested upon a wood on a hill a considerable distance from our left. Our conjectures, however, were fallacious, and I believe our apparent advance towards the Enemy was intended as a feint to deceive them, as we no sooner crossed the road, which was contended for by Picton's Division the previous evening, and had got between the wood and the Enemy so as to intercept from their view our movements, than we entered into a bye-road and retreated. We continued to retreat without any pause until we reached the well-known town of Genappe, where the Brigade halted to get refreshment, no provision having been given out since it left the cantonments before- day break on the 16th. However, from the cowardice of the Commissariat \u2014 whose duty it was to make provision for the troops, but who, in a panic, fled \u2014 no refreshment could be obtained there, except what was got by the men in dividually here and there.

I rode up to the Brigade, and while addressing myself to Sir Colin Halkett, he at the instant received a wound in the face, the ball passing through his mouth, and he was consequently obliged to retire to the rear. Colonel Elphinstone, commanding the 33rd Regiment, then ran up and asked if I had any orders. I replied none beyond inquiring into the cause of the confusion ; he stated that they were much pressed, and the men exhausted. Colonel Sir C.

With respect to your present inquiry, it is fully within my memory that the fog and smoke lay so heavy upon the ground that we could only ascertain the approach of the Enemy by the noise and clashing of arms which the French usually make in their advance to attack, and it has often occurred to me from the above circumstance (the heavy fog), that the accuracy and the particulars with which the Crisis has been so frequently and so minutely discussed, must have had a good deal of fancy in the narrative.

I can therefore only say that when the last attacking Column emerged from the smoke in our front the French Officers were in the front cheering on their men, but whether they were of the Imperial Guard, or of D'Erlon's Corps we had no oppor- tunity of judging. I should rather think the latter, for after some firing between us the Enemy retreated without any very apparent cause. I presume it might have been about this time that some of our troops had got to the rear or flank of the Enemy, which caused their sudden retreat ; but as I have already said, from the heaviness of the atmosphere we could see but little of what was going on in our front.

The 8th* Infantry Brigade was composed of the 28th and 32nd Regiments, the 79th Begiment, Cameron Highlanders, and the 1st Battalion of the 95th Bines. It was under the command of Major General Sir James Kempt, K.C.B., and formed part of the 5th Division commanded by Lieutenant- General Sir Thomas Bicton, G.C.B. The Division arrived at Quatre Bras about a * The 6th and 7th Eritish Brigades of the Army in Belgium were not at Waterloo."], [384, "344 WATERLOO LETTERS. quarter to three p.m. on the 16th June, and was at once posted along the Namur road, Kempt's Brigade being on the left of the line. See Plan of Quatre Bras, No. 1. The 28th Beffiment was soon marched down to occupy the Farm of Gemioncourt, but it was already in the possession of the Enemy, and the 2Sth rejoined the Brigade. The 95th Bines were similarly detached to endeavour to occupy the village of Biermont, but that was also strongly held by the French. The Battalion, however, in conjunction with some of the Allied Troops, suc cessfully resisted all the efforts of the French during the day to turn the left flank of the Arm} by the Namur road. The skirmishers of the Division were thrown out in front, and after suffering severely for some time from the French cannonade, it was ordered to advance against the Infantry in front of the road. Kempt's Brigade charged, and drove the Enemy down the hill to the fences at the bottom, and was then recalled. The 28th, together with the 1st Boyals, were afterwards marched in column to the relief of the 42nd and 44th Begiments, which were very hardly pressed by the French Cavalry near Gemioncourt. At the last moment the 28th and Boyals suddenly formed a single square in a position so as to combine a flanking fire with that of the 42nd and 44th, and although constantly assailed, it always beat off the Cavalry. The 32nd and 79th were also formed in flanking squares, and sustained re peated attacks of the Cavalry with similar results. See General Plan, No. 1. At Waterloo the Brigade was posted on the"], [385, "KEMPT'S INFANTRY BRIGADE.. 345 See Plan p. 38. right of Bicton's Division, and was drawn up a little in rear of the Wavre road, with its right resting on the Brussels or main road, the 95th occupying the sandpit further down the main road, the knoll on the left of the sandpit, and the hedge row in rear of both, with some advanced Com panies. This hedgerow furnished the materials for forming an abatis on the main road below. At the time of D'Erlon's first attack on the Division, the other Regiments of the Brigade were formed in line about fifty yards in rear of the hedge along the Wavre road, 3.2nd on the right, 28th on the left, and 79th in the centre, their Light Com panies being extended in advance of the position. The Column which attacked this Brigade was diverted by the fire of the 95fh more to its right, so as to lead it on to the left of the 79th and right of the 28th. The advanced Companies of the 95th on being outflanked by the Column, retired on their reserves, as did also the Light Infantry of the Brigade on their respective Begiments. The Column arrived within forty yards of the Wavre road, when it halted and began to deploy to its right. At this favourable instant Bicton ordered the Brigade to fire a volley into it and charge. Having delivered its fire, and after a momentary confusion in getting through the hedge, it re-formed and dashed at the Column. At this moment Bicton was killed by a musket ball, which struck him on the right temple. The Enemy fled in confusion down the slope, followed by the Brigade, which, however, was soon recalled. In advancing, the left wing of the 28th"], [386, "346 WATERLOO LETTERS. Sir J. Kempt, became engaged with a separate Column, into which it fired at the moment the Column was being charged by the Boyal Dragoons, which Regiment it followed down the hill, and assisted in securing a great number of prisoners. The 95th, on returning from the charge, re sumed their advanced positions as before held. These positions, however, they were obliged to abandon on the capture of La Haye Sainte by the French, who immediately occupied them, and from thence, as well as from their advanced parties on the right of the main road, kept up an unremitting and most destructive fire on Kempt's Brigade and other troops, which was vigorously replied to, not withstanding the exposed position of the latter. This continued until the repulse of the Imperial Guard, upon which the French in and near La Haye Sainte hastily retreated, and the Brigade joined in the General Advance.

On the 18th, the 95th Regiment was in front of the other Regiments of my Brigade, occupying a knoll and some broken ground as Light Troops, and in a line with a considerable Corps of Belgian and Nassau Infantry. All these retired as the head of the Enemy's mass of Infantry approached them, at which critical moment, and just as the French Infantry were gaining the road and hedgerow which runs all along the crest of the position, I met it at the charge with the 28th, 32nd, and 79th Regiments in line, and completely repulsed the Enemy's Column, driving it in a state of the greatest confusion down the slope of the position. 1st 9oth Kifles occupied a knoll in front of Brigade.

I have already thought the Battle of Quatre Bras one of the most splendid achievements of the war, reflecting the greatest credit on the British troops engaged, sustaining and repelling one of the most determined attacks (of all arms) [that], in my little experience, I can remember, and had it not been so closely followed by the very decisive and important, but all-absorbing Victory of Waterloo, perhaps the gallant exploits and unexampled bravery that marked that day would, under other circumstances, have excited even more admiration than was actually associated with it. The corn was so high that it was nearly impossible to see beyond the ranks. The French Cavalry used to plant a flag in front of the Square as a mart to The rye in the field was so high, that to see anything beyond our own ranks was almost impossible. The Enemy, even, in attacking our Squares, were obliged to make a daring person desperately ride forward to plant a flag, as a mark, at the very point of our bayonets. On this they charged, but were invariably repulsed. It fell to the lot of the 28th to bear a leading share in this Action, and I may say they lost there none of their former reputation. charge on.

My impression is that it was some of the beaten Column, as the Dragoons passed on to engage a large reserve Column which was coming on, but still lower down the hill, leaving the left wing of the 28th closely engaged with the Column in its own immediate [front].

When we had proceeded a of 28th little way we perceived through the smoke another body of theTadrance troops in column immediately in our front, which we mis took for some Corps of the Allies, and many of the Officers (I amongst the rest) cried out to the men, \" Don't fire, they are Belgians.\" This caused a momentary check of the wing, when we quickly discovered our mistake by the Enemy making off with all speed in the direction of the French position. Immediately after this, when all the force that was originally opposed to the 28th had been driven back in con fusion, the Regiment was ordered to halt and re-form, and almost at the same instant, as well as I can recollect, I saw a Regiment of Dragoons charge a Column or Square \u2014 for which it was I really cannot tell\u2014 and instantly break it. I well remember the intense anxiety we felt when we saw some of the gallant, but over-rash fellows, without stopping to form again, ride on headlong at what appeared to me an immensely strong Corps of support in perfect order, but which I do not see marked down in the Plan. On this Column they, of course, made no impression, but suffered some loss, although as far as I could see, a fire was opened upon them from only a small portion of it. The charge on the Square which was broken took place some distance in our front, but a little to the left, from which it is evident Sir William Ponsonby's Brigade must have passed our flanks whilst we had been too busy for me to observe them, and probably the Officer of the Royal Dragoons might have seen our wings disunited as he passed, and fancied it had been caused by the attack of the French instead of the pursuit of them. However, as to \" the right wing being wheeled by sections to the left, &c,\" I can assure you nothing half so regular came within my notice.

At ten o'clock on the. night of the loth June the troops at Brussels received orders to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice. About twelve o'clock the bugles were sounding throughout the town for the troops to assemble, rations were issued for three days, and the Division began its march about four o'clock on the follow- March to ing morning on the road leading to Charleroi. Quatre Bras Soon after the Division halted in the Foret de Soignies, near the village of Waterloo, three leagues from Brussels, the Duke of Wellington, accompanied by some of his Staff, was observed passing to the front. The soldiers began to cook provisions, and an idea pretty generally prevailed that we should return to Brussels, from a supposed probability of wrong information regarding the Enemy's force, or that his intention had been frustrated by the Prussian and Belgian Armies of observation. Before the cooking was completed orders were received for the Division instantly to resume its march. We now for the first time distinctly heard cannonading in front, and as we proceeded on our march, under an excess of heat and dust through Genappe to Quatre Bras, we met on the road a wounded Belgian soldier. Quatre Bras is a"], [398, "358 79th Highlanders. WATERLOO LETTERS. farm or hamlet, seven leagues from Brussels, consisting of a few scattered houses, deriving its name from the inter section here (nearly at right angles) of the Brussels road by that leading from Nivelles to Namur. The Column (left in front) halted in the road and piled arms in the then order of march for about a quarter of an hour. From a rising ground at the head of the Column, adjoining the above houses, wre had a full view of the Enemy, who appeared obliquely to our left at the distance of about half a mile, in movement to his front. A brisk and extended line of cannonading was at the same time perceived in the direction of the Prussian Army on the left. A Battalion of Belgians was observed at some distance in our front, which had begun to exchange a few shots with the Enemy, and to retire slowly on his nearer approach. In support of this Battalion the Companies of the Rifle Brigade attached to the Division were sent out. The 8th and 9th British Brigades then broke off to their left, lining the Namur road, the banks of which were here on either side considerably elevated. The 79th Regiment formed the extreme left of the British Army, and the 92nd Regiment the right of the two Brigades in question, being posted immediately in front of Quatre Bras. Our ground had scarcely been thus occupied when the Enemy's advance appeared. The Light Companies of the 8th Brigade, to which were added the 8th Company and marksmen of the 79th Regiment, were immediately thrown out, when \u25a0 the Action commenced. This movement was ordered by the Duke of Wellington in person, who was here present with his Staff. It was then a quarter to three o'clock. These troops maintained their situation for an hour against the constantly increasing numbers of the Enemy, who had by this time displayed a force which ren dered it necessary for the Brigade (28th, 32nd, and 79th Regiments) to charge. His advanced troops were compelled to retire. But to them succeeded fresh Columns of Infantry, with whom the Action was renewed. About this time many casualties were Arrival at Quatre Bras.

The Brigade was ordered to retire some distance towards its former position on the road, where it could with more advantage meet the Enemy's approach, a movement which was performed with regularity. In the meantime the right of the Division was warmly engaged. The Royals, 28th, and 42nd Regiments were repeatedly charged by the Enemy's Cuirassiers, who were constantly repulsed. To a body of these the 92nd Regiment opposed a destructive fire, and against a Column of Infantry made a gallant and successful charge. The 79th Regiment had received orders to form in column on the road, and to act as circumstances might re quire. Being afterwards threatened by Cavalry, it formed and moved forward in square, but without being attacked. In short every Regiment, from the sudden and peculiar nature of the attack, seemed to act independently for its own immediate defence, a measure rendered still more necessary by the Enemy's superiority in Cavalry, and the Regiments being now posted, not at prescribed intervals of alignment, but conformably to the exigency of the moment, by which each of them was exposed to be separately assailed. The Enemy's Column suffered much from the well directed fire of some field-pieces which had by this time been brought up, and which greatly aided in checking his further advance. He had now failed in every attack, and it growing dark, the troops of the Division began to occupy their bivouac for the night on a space of ground in advance of the Namur road and of our original position, within the angle formed by the same road and that leading from Brussels to Charleroi. At 9 o'clock all firing ceased, and the 79th bivouacked in front of their original position.

When the 79th were deploying into line at the com mencement of the Action (they having been previously in column) the Light Company, to which I then belonged, were ordered out and extended. On our reaching the hedge (or nearly so), where the Guns (I think Rogers's Brigade) were stationed, we passed through the Belgian Infantry, who were retiring, and pushed down the shqie in front of the hedge into the valley, where we were for some time engaged with the French skirmishers ; but a strong Column of the Enemy appearing on the top of the opposite ridge immediately in our front, and a second Column was at that moment seen advancing along the valley to our left, which must have come in contact with the 28th Regiment, we were consequently obliged to retire, and joined the Regiment on its reaching the hedge, when a tremendous conHict ensued between our Line and the opposing Columns, which, it has been said, pushed themselves so far forward as to reach the hedge ; but I can positively assert that the French did not reach that point, if I except indeed some few of their sharpshooters which came up the hill with the Light Infantry, but were quickly driven back.

The 9th Infantry Brigade consisted of the 1st Begiment Boyal Scots, 3rd Battalion, the 42nd Begiment, Boyal Highlanders, the 41th Begiment, 2nd Battalion, and the 92nd Begiment, High landers. It was commanded by Major-General Sir Denis Pack, K.C.B., and belonged also to Sir Thomas Picton's Division. On the arrival of the Division at Quatre Bras, Pack's Brigade was posted along the Namur road, with its right adjacent to the houses of Quatre Bras. See Flan of Quatre Bras. No. 1. When the Division advanced against the Enemy, as stated on page 344, the 92nd Highlanders were ordered to continue to line the portion of the road next to Quatre Bras. The 42nd Highlanders and 44th Begiment moved forward across the cornfields in front of the road to within a very short distance of Gemioncourt, and to the left of the Charleroi road. Here they were suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by a portion of the French Cavalry which were pursuing the Brunswick Hussars along the chaussee, and so closely as to be mistaken by the two Begiments for Allies. The 42nd nearly y"], [410, "WATERLOO LETTERS. 370 succeeded in forming square, but the two Com panies of the rear face had not time to complete it, and a body of Lancers penetrated with them into the Square. Although they caused some loss, par ticularly in Officers, the Lancers were quickly hemmed inside the Square, and either bayoneted or taken prisoners. The attack on the 44th was still more un expected. The Lancers advanced against the rear of that Begiment still in line, whereupon the rear rank was faced about, and it gave the Cavalry such a volley, that they fled in confusion. Meanwhile, the remainder of the Cavalry which. pursued the Hussars came under the fire of the 92nd, which obliged it to take to a precipitate flight, The 42nd and 44th, in their advanced and exposed positions, became the objects of repeated assaults by the French Cavalry, and of a heavy cannonade during the intervals of these attacks, but, though with greatly diminished numbers, they suc cessfully repelled the former. At length Sir Thomas Picton brought up the 1st Boyals and 2Sth to their relief, as described in page 344.

See General Plan, No. 1 When D'Erlon first advanced against Picton, the Brigade, excepting the 44th, was lining the Wavre road, and the right French Column was directed against it, principally against the 92nd. The Column pushed on in such a bold and deter mined manner as to cross the hedge of the road and throw the Highlanders into some temporary confusion. Here the French began to reply to the fire of the latter, which, however, was now most destructive, and the Brigade received the order to charge. See Plan, p. 38. At this moment the Scots Greys came up, and, passing through and mingling with the 92nd, charged the Column, both Begiments mutually cheering and shouting, \" Scotland for ever ! \" The Highlanders joined in the charge, and assisted in the capture of great numbers of prisoners. After D'Erlon's attack had been repulsed, Pack's Brigade was closed to the right on Kempt, so as to fill up the gap made by the retreat of the Dutch-Belgians.

The 3rd Battalion was in close column, and I, being Captain of the Light Infantry Company, was with it at my post in the rear, the Column being right in front, therefore could not distinctly see whether the Regiment was at all covered in its front ; but 1 believe it was the Royal Dragoons and the Scotch Greys who passed us (I think) by the left of our Column to charge the French Infantry, which they did most gallantly, and on their return, with a large number of prisoners, we cheered them.

They were soon called in, the Battalion formed into open column, and moved to its right, under a heavy fire of cannon, to the position I mentioned to you in my letter of December 29th. I do not know where the other Regiments of Pack's Brigade were moved, but a considerable time afterwards, seeing Sir Denis Pack approach, I, being in command, at the request of the Officers, and seeing we were so much reduced, went to him to ask our being relieved for a short time, but he gave me no answer. Upon looking round I saw the 42nd in column considerably in our rear in reserve. I recognised them by their bonnets and red feathers, but the other Regiments near or with them I could not. The Battalion suffered severely. About the time we discerned the Prussians coming on from the left, part of the 92nd Highlanders came up to our right ; the 28th were then on our immediate left.

I deemed it proper to call the attention of the General, Sir Denis Pack, to the awkward situation my men and I were in ; his orders were to close my men to the centre and join my Regiment. I did so in so far, but ere this time a number of Squadrons of French Cuirassiers and Lancers were sweep ing the field in the rear, round and round every Square, showing no mercy, dashing at and sticking the helpless wounded Officers and men that unfortunately lay without the protection of the Square. I could compare them to nothing but a swarm of bees. At this time I and my men were cut off from the Regiment.

Somehow or other, the 92nd was the last Regiment of the Division which reached Quatre Bras, and consequently must have been out of its natural order in Brigade ; but why it happened to be so I cannot explain, but I have heard it said that it was ordered by the express desire of the Duke of Wellington to take up its station at Quatre Bras. The Division marched on this place left in front. On the arrival of the 92nd at Quatre Bras, Lord Wellington then desired Colonel Cameron to form line upon the road, with his right resting on the houses at Quatre Bras. His Grace took his station on foot, with his Staff, at the left of the Regiment. By this time the whole of the rest of our troops were warmly engaged with the Enemy. They then opened a cannonade on his Grace, his Staff, and the 92nd from several Guns posted upon the heights at the side of the road leading to Charleroi. The Duke ordered the Regiment to lie down under cover in the ditch, which was in our front at the edge of the road, which he and his Staff did also close to our left. The French Cuirassiers soon after this, under cover of their Guns, came charging up the fields in front of the Regiment, which still remained in line. Lord Wellington, who was by this time in rear of the centre of the Regiment, said, \" 92nd, don't fire until I tell you,\" and when they came within twenty or thirty paces of us, his Grace gave the order to fire, which killed and wounded an immense number of men and horses, on which they immediately faced about and galloped off. Shortly afterwards they formed again, and, accompanied by a body of Light Dragoons, charged up again in our front. They were all allowed to come within about the same distance as before, when we fired as formerly, and the same result was effected, causing great loss to them in killed and wounded. At this time a French Officer of Light Dragoons, thinking his men were still following him, got too far to be able to retire by the way he had advanced, galloped down the road in the rear of our Regiment. The Duke of Wellington observing him, called out, \"Damn it, and engaged with the Enemy. See Plan of Quatre Bras. The Duke ordered the 9'2nd to form line on the Namur road, with its right on the Quatre Bras houses. In conse quence of the French cannonade, the Duke ordered the 92nd to lie down in the ditch of the road, and did the same with his Staff. The Cuirassiers charge the 92nd still in line.

I was afterwards billeted with him in the same house at Brussels for six months, and then went with him to Paris, where I received much kind attention from him \u2014 Monsieur Burgoine \u2014 and his family. their attention to him. The Regiment was soon again charged by two other Columns of Cavalry, supported by two Columns of Infantry. We fired on the Cavalry when they came within the usual distance, and dispersed them with great loss. The Duke then said, \" Now 92nd, you must charge these two Columns of Infantry.\" We instantly leaped over the ditch, headed by Sir Edward Barnes and other Officers of the Duke's Staff, and Colonel Cameron. We drove them in an instant behind some houses and garden walls, where they ran for shelter, from which we also speedily drove them. Here Colonel Cameron received his mortal wound, on which he lost the power of managing his horse. The animal turned round and galloped with all his speed along the road until he reached Quatre Bras, where Colonel Cameron's groom was standing with his led horse. The horse then suddenly stopping, pitched the Colonel on his head on the road. The 92nd charged again by Cavalry, supported by Infantry.

As the Enemy was making a disposition to charge us with Cavalry, we maintained our position there until we were relieved by the Guards in the evening. We were then ordered to retire through the wood, and form behind the houses at Quatre Bras, where we remained all night, and cooked our provisions in the cuirasses which had belonged to the French Cuirassiers whom we had killed only a few hours before. 92nd drive the Infantry a considerable distance along skirts of Bois de Bossu.

But so far from this being the case, I observed on going over the Field of Battle on the morning of the 17th, that our musket balls had not only gone through the front plate, but the man's body and also the plate of armoury behind. I understood, after Bliicher had been defeated at Ligny on June 16th, that it was so arranged that he was to take up a position at Sombref, where he would have been in communication with the left of the Duke of Wellington's Army. But on the morning of the 17th, when the Duke sent a patrol of Cavalry to communicate there with Bliicher, it was found to be occupied by the Enemy, and no one then in our Army had the most distant idea what had become of Bliicher and his Army.

About three in the afternoon it was brought up to the front line, and stationed with Kempt's Brigade in rear of the Wavre road, and to the left of the Brussels chaussee. Upon the capture of La Haye Sainte by the French, and their consequent occupation of the knoll and high ground in front of the Wavre road, and the advanced position of their troops on the other side of the chaussee, the Brigade, like Kempt's, became exposed to a most destructive fire.

At the moment when the French Imperial Guards advanced to attack the British position, the 40th Regiment, which had previously, and mostly throughout the day, been in square against Cavalry, were formed in line, and thus quickly advanced to the brow of the hill, where there was a low and somewhat broken down hedge, short of which we halted and over which we fired.

The 40th was formed rather facing the house, the latter being a little to the right of the Regiment, but more in front of us.

On the left of the 40th at the commencement of the Action, were a Rocket Brigade, and one of Artillery ; the tumbril of the latter was blown up by a shell from the Enemy, and both were silenced before the close of the Action, by the numerous Artillery of the French.

When the British line moved forward, the 40th drove the Tirailleurs from the rising ground in its front, and occupied it; at the same time the 27th, with Grenadiers of the 40th, took possession of the farm of La Haye Sainte, in which they made prisoners of a General Officer and a party of the Enemy.

There was a passage right through the dwelling house, leading from the farmyard into the kitchen garden. An abatis had been formed across the A a 2"], [444, "WATERLOO LETTERS. 404 high road at the south end of the boundary wall. The great barn door had been broken up for firewood the previous evening, and means for put ting the Buildings in a proper state of defence were utterly wanting. The post was held by- Major Baring with six Companies of the 2nd Light Battalion of the King's German Legion, of which he placed three in the orchard, two in the buildings, and one in the garden. At the time of D'Erlon's first advance on Picton's Division, one Brigade was moved to attack La Haye Sainte. The Companies in the orchard retired before superior forces into the barn. The garden in rear of the house was also surrounded by the Enemy, and the Company stationed in it retired into the buildings, which w7ere successfully defended against the assaults of the French, who retired on the repulse of D'Erlon's attack, and that of the Cavalry combined with it. The post was now reinforced by two more Companies, and the defence was limited to that of the buildings and garden, the orchard being aban doned. After some time it was again furiously attacked by the French, who made the greatest efforts to push through by the open door of the barn, but the fire of the Germans was so destructive that the French left seventeen dead on the spot. Meantime, the ammunition of the defenders was becoming very much exhausted, and Major Baring sent repeated messages for a fresh supply, but he only obtained reinforcements."], [445, "LA HaYE SAINTE. 405 The Enemy again attacked with the same deter mination as before, and finding they could not effect an entrance into the barn, set fire to it.

They succeeded, however, in putting out the fire, and the French once more withdrew. Towards evening the ammunition of the de fenders began to fail utterly. The Enemy again advanced to the attack, in two Columns. They again set fire to the barn, and the flames were extinguished as before. Major Baring now sent to the rear urgently requesting a supply of ammuni tion, failing which he must necessarily abandon his post. The French forced their way through the gate into the stables, but the door from thence into the yard being barricaded, few could enter at a time, and were instantly bayoneted.
