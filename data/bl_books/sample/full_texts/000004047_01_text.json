Though we can add nothing; to the existing records of Greek History, the estimate placed upon their value, and the conclusions drawn from them are constantly changing, and for this reason the story which has been told so often will be told anew from time to time, so long as it continues to have an interest for mankind \u2014 that is, let us hope, so long as mankind continue to exist. The present work is intended for readers who are acquainted with the outlines of the subject, and have some knowledge of the Greek language.

Though the Hellenes delighted to distinguish themselves from the \" barbarians \" who were their neighbours on the north, they never fixed with precision the limits Limits of Heiias of the country which they called Hellas. Until variable. a late period that name was used as an ethnological rather than a geographical term, and included any country in which the Hellenes were settled. In this sense the islands of the Aegean were a part of Hellas, but Macedonia was not, in spite of the claim which the Macedonian kings put for ward to Hellenic descent.1 Nor was Epirus included in the true Hellas, nor by some authorities Thessaly, in which lay the district originally called Hellas. These distinctions did not, however, rest on any solid ground ; Aristotle was aware that in early times the Greeks dwelt near Dodona in Epirus, and Thessaly was known to be the home of many tribes, which afterwards migrated to the south.2 We may therefore place the northern limit of Hellas at the fortieth degree of latitude, and, keeping clear of the wider use of the word, which would carry us wherever Greek colonists went \u2014 to Italy, Sicily, and Africa, as well as to Crete and Asia Minor \u2014 restrict the name to the peninsula and the adjacent islands.3 1 And which was allowed, Herod, v. 22. 2 Meteor, i. 14, 22 ; Bursian, Geographie von Griechenland, i. 3. 3 This limitation is, of course, purely geographical. The history of Hellas is spread over a far wider area. If we knew that the Homeric poems were composed in Asia Minor, we might even say that the first traces of the spirit of Hellenism are found in Asia. But the Asiatic Greeks always looked to the peninsula as their home. VOL. I. A"], [20, "LAND AND SEA IN GREECE. [L 2, 3. 2 Hellas, then, or Greece, to use the more familiar name, may be roughly described as an inverted triangle, of which the base extends from the Acroceraunian promontory to Mount Olympus, and the apex is formed by the promontory of Taenarum. The extreme length is about 250 miles; the extreme breadth 180 miles. 2. The characteristic features of the country have often been described. Greece is pre-eminently a land of mountain and coast. Within the area described no point can be fixed which is more than ten miles from the hills, or more than forty miles from the sea. These features become more strongly marked as we proceed to the south, the proportion of land to seaboard being less in the Peloponnesus than in Northern Greece. The formation of the coast on the istic Features east is also widely different from that on the of Greece. -west. When the long ridge of Pelion and Ossa is passed, the eastern shore offers a succession of bays from Pagasae to Nauplia ; for, though Euboea presents an inhospitable front to the sea, the island is merely a barrier which protects the harbour of the Euripus. On the west, with the exception of the bays of Corinth and Ambracia, there are few places where a ship can find shelter. Hence Hellas turns naturally to the east ; the islands, which were within sight of the land and of each other, tempted the mariner to the coast of Asia Minor, where he found a shore abounding in harbours. On the other hand, the eastern coast of Italy is as inhospitable as the western coast of Greece. The two peninsulas lie, as it were, back to back ; and this position had the greatest influence on their history and development. 3. Greece is divided by the Gulf of Corinth into two halves, of which the northern was known as \"continental Hellas,\" or \" the parts beyond Peloponnesus,\" the southern as Pelopon- Mountain Sys- nesus- These are connected by a low flat tems of North- isthmus, something less than four miles in em Greece. breadth. The mountain systems in the two halves are quite distinct in their configuration. In the northern a \" spine \" runs from north to south and terminates in the"], [21, "I. 4-] MOUNTAIN SYSTEMS. 3 conical height of Typhrestus. The southern part of this spine, from Mount Lacmon onwards, is known as Pindus ; this is the central range of Greece, from which chains run out on either side. On the east, beginning from the north, we have the Cambunian range, which terminates in Olympus, and forms the northern boundary of Hellas in that direction. Next is the range of Othrys, the \" brow,\" which overlooks the Maliac Bay. Yet further to the south the range of Oeta runs nearly parallel to Othrys. On the west, the most northern offshoot from the spine is the chain of mountains which runs from Mount Lacmon to the Acro ceraunian headland, and bounds Epirus on the north. A second range, proceeding from the same centre, but further to the south and parallel to Pindus, separates the Arachthus from the Achelous. From Typhrestus the mountain ranges take a south-easterly direction. Under the names of Par nassus, Helicon, Cithaeron, Parnes and Brilessus, they pass down to the sea at Sunium, whence they are continued in the islands of the Cyclades (Ceos, Cythnus, Seriphus, Siphnus). On the extreme east, Pelion and Ossa run along the sea-coast from Olympus to the south ; after a slight interruption the range passes through Euboea, and, like the loftier range to the west, ends in a succession of islands (Andros, Tenos, Myconus). Finally, at the western end of the range of Oeta rises Mount Corax, the lofty centre from which a number of spurs branch off to the south-west, and form the mountains of Aetolia. 4. The arrangement of the mountains in Peloponnesus is entirely different. Here the base-line is not drawn from north to south, but from west to east. The mighty range which divides Achaea from Arcadia presents \u201e. .. r The Mountain three commanding summits : Cyllene on the Systems of east, Aroanius in the centre, Erymanthus on Pel\u00b0P\u00b0nnesus the west. From these summits ranges run out to the south and south-east. Beginning from the east, we have the mountains of Argolis (Euboea, Arachnaeum), ending in the promontory of Scyllaeum. Next in order is the range which divides Argolis from Arcadia (Artemisium, Parthenium),"], [22, "[I. S. \u00b0- 4 MOUNTAINS OF GREECE. and is continued in the long chain of Parnon to Malea. From Aroanius proceeds the range of Maenalus, which, like its eastern neighbours, advances in a long line to the south (Mount Taygetus), and touches the sea at Taenarum. On the west, the mountains are broken by the rivers Alpheus and Ladon, but we can follow the heights from Erymanthus to Cotylium above Phigalea, and from thence to Ithome and Mathia. 5. To the modern traveller the mountains are one of the chief attractions of Greece. Consisting chiefly of hard lime stone, and being bare of trees, they present sharp and varied outlines, which are clearly seen through the fine atmosphere. This beauty of form is enhanced by the exquisite hues which the almost naked stone assumes.1 Though wild and difficult _. to cross, the mountains of Greece are not, like Character- ' ' istics of the the Alps in Switzerland, so vast that they Mountains. dominate the whole country and excite a sense of overpowering awe. Olympus indeed attains an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet; but no other mountain, with the possible exception of Parnassus, rises above 8,000 feet. On the other hand, no less than seven summits exceed the level of 7,000 feet, so that even in its mountains Hellas presents the Hellenic characteristics of \" measure \" and equality. No single peak is the \"monarch of mountains,\" no range has a claim to be called the central and dominant chain of the country.2 6. Descending to the valleys, we find that though none of the rivers in Greece are of great length or volume, they present remarkable characteristics, which did not fail Rivers of Greece. . . to impress the inhabitants. In a dry and sunny country a perennial supply of water is the most precious of commodities, and in Greece this is peculiarly the case, owing to the bare and rocky nature of the mountains, and the lightness of the soil, which offers no storage for the 1 Neumann and Partsch, Physikalische Geographic, p. 37. 2 Tozer, Geography of Greece, p. 42."], [23, "1.6.] RIVERS OF GREECE. 5 rain or melting snow. Many streams, which in autumn or spring are impassable torrents, become in summer a mere succession of pools, if they are not dried up altogether. Such is the Ilissus at Athens, which draws its waters from the limited area of Hymettus. The Cephisus, on the other hand, which carries the rainfall of Mount Parnes, is never entirely without water, though it fails to reach the sea, the whole volume being consumed in irrigating the olive gardens in the neighbourhood of Colonus.1 These variations in the amount of water naturally gave rise to the floods, which are such a common source of similes in Greek poetry ; and they were the more frequent owing to the \" Swallows \" or Katavo thras, which, though found in other countries where lime stone abounds,2 are a characteristic of Greece. In many of the upland valleys there is no external outlet for the water ; the streams which flow down from the neighbouring mountains pass into chasms and are carried underground, to reappear in neighbouring valleys or rivers. This is the case in the Arcadian valleys of Pheneus and Stymphalus ; in the first the katavothras, which are frequently choked, seem to be connected with the rivers Alpheus and 1 Nothing illustrates the varying quantity of the water in the upland districts of Greece better than an incident which gave rise to a lawsuit at Athens in the time of Demosthenes (Against Collides, Orat. 55). In this case the water had overflowed from one property into the next, and the plaintiff, whose property was injured, sought to prove that the proper course for the water was over his neighbour's land. But the neighbour will not allow this ; no man in his senses, he pleads, would suffer the water to flow over his land, when it could be diverted into the road. What served for a road in summer, was useful as a watercourse in winter. In the movements which pre ceded the battle of Mantinea (Thuc. v. 65), Agis, the Spartan king, attempted to draw the Argives from their strong position by turning the course of the river from Tegea into the territory of the Manti neans, the water being a constant source of strife between the two cities, owing to the damage which it did to one or other according to the course which it took. 2 See the account of the country in the neighbourhood of Trieste, in Hamilton's Asia Minor, vol. i. c. i.j Strabo, p. 214; also Herod. vii. 30."], [24, "[1.6. 6 KATAVOTHRAS. Ladon; in the second they pass under Mount Apelaurum, and the water reappears in the Argolid as the river Erasinus.1 In the upper course of the Alpheus there are two of these \"swallows.\" The river rises in Tegeatis, and flows under Mount Boreum to Asea ;2 after a short course it again passes out of sight to reappear once more at Pegae, whence, without further interruption, it flows to the sea. In Northern Greece the most famous katavothras are in Boeotia. Lake Copais has been formed by the stoppage or insufficiency of the underground channels, which connect the depression in which it lies with the sea or the lower river. In very early times the water was removed by the construction of two gigantic tunnels; \"the larger of the two, which runs towards the sea, is cut through the rock for the distance of nearly four miles, with fifteen vertical shafts let down to it, at intervals, from above ; some of these reach to a depth of more than 100 feet.\" When these channels became filled up, the water col lected as before, to the detriment of the country and climate.3 The streams of Greece are also remarkable for the amount of the deposit which they carry down with them. The lower Alluvial valley of a Greek river is generally an alluvial Deposits. plain. The line of the shore at the mouth of the Eurotas has been carried out to a considerable extent. 1 Herod, vi. 76. In 1S06 Colonel Leake found the valley of the Pheneus, in Arcadia, planted with wheat and barley ; before both katavothras, more especially the western, lay stagnant pools of water. Fifteen years iater the passages were stopped up. Water covered the whole plain, and the \"dam of Heracles \" disappeared. In 1S28, the surface of the lake was 2315 feet above the level of the sea, and five miles in breadth. Continually rising, the waters at last passed over the ridge into the plain of Orchomenus. Subsequently the passages were again opened (owing to an earthquake) ; the Ladon and Alpheus rose, the plains of Olympia were flooded, and in Pheneus some square miles were restored to agriculture. At present the passages have once more become choked, and the lake is sufficiently large to be compared with Derwent Water. Curtius, Pelop. i. 189; Tozer, l.c. p. 108. See Strabo, pp. 275, 389. 2 Strabo, ll.cc. ; Paus. viii. 44, 4 ; 54, 2. 3 The area of the lake is now eighty or ninety square miles. See Sergeant's Greece, p. 20 ; Tozer, l.c. p. 114."], [25, "I. 6.] ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS. 7 In the days of Pausanias, Helos was a seaport, but the ruins of the city are now situated on a lagune.1 Even in antiquity it was known that the Achelous had united the islands lying off the shore with the mainland.2 When the Acheron leaves its deep and gloomy gorge, it passes over a.n alluvial plain, and forms the Acherusian lake. The Peneus, in Thessaly, wanders through a similar expanse. The areas thus formed are naturally fertile, and, when properly pro tected from the water, richly repay cultivation.3 In other districts, owing to the difference in geological forma tion, the rivers die, as it were, of inanition, in the soil which they have created. This is especially the case in the Argolid. The bed of the Inachus is dry, roug *' the water, when there is any, filtering out of sight through the gravel, and before it reaches the sea the stream is entirely lost in the marshes of the coast. The rivers of Eastern Argolis are swallowed up almost as soon as they reach the foot of the mountains from which they descend. On the other hand, in the south, where the hills are nearer the coast, water is more abundant ; it gushes from the foot of the mountains in copious springs, which are supposed to be the outlet of the waters of Arcadian valleys, and hurries in streams to the shore, or spreads out in the marshes of Lerna. In one instance the stream is carried under the shore for about 1000 feet from the land, when it reappears, a bubbling spring of fresh water in the sea (Dine).* The largest river in Greece is the Achelous. The sources of the stream are to be sought on the southern declivities of Mount Lacmon, from whence it flows almost due south through a long and narrow valley bounded on the east by Pindus, and on the west by the range of hills which separates the valleys of the Arachthus and 1 Curt. l.c. ii. 289 ; Paus. iii. 2, y. 2 See the remarks on Herodotus of the formation of the Delta, ii. 10. 3 Neumann and Partsch, l.c. p. 348. 4 A similar spring is found in the Gulf of La Spezzia, and in the great harbour of Syracuse.

This upper reach of the stream was sometimes known as the Inachus.1 Entering Aetolia, it turns a little to the east and south, and, forming the boundary between Acarnania and Aetolia, empties into the sea between the Ambracian and Corinthian Gulfs. From Mount Lacmon to the mouth of the river is a distance of 120- miles, without allowing for the windings of the stream. The country round the mouth is a flat alluvial plain, covered to a considerable extent with marshes, out of which rise rocky hills, which once formed a part of the Echinades.2 The Peneus (Thessalian) is remark- able among the rivers of Greece for being the outlet of the drainage of a large plain. The river rises on the eastern slopes of Lacmon, which is, indeed, the head of all the larger rivers of Northern Greece. Flowing at first to the south-east, round the hills of Hesti\u00e6otis, it then passes away directly to the east. The chief tributaries are the Pamisus, the Phoenix, the Apidanus, and the Euripus. The famous Vale of Tempe, through which the Peneus flows into the sea, is a gorge about four miles and a half in length, \" flanked by lofty rocks of grey limestone, finely tinted with red; these are highest towards the middle of the pass, where the precipices in the direction of Olympus descend so steeply as completely to bar the passage in that direction, while those which descend from Ossa, though less steep, are loftier, and rise in many places not less than 1500 feet from the valley.\" 3 One of the most rapid of Greek rivers is the Sper- cheus, which carries the waters of Mount Oeta to the sea, in the neighbourhood of Thermopylae. In one sense that famous \" pass \" exists no longer, for the alluvial deposit has spread out into a plain of such an extent as to furnish room for an entire army ; but even now, in winter, the path immedi ately under the hills is alone sufficiently firm to bear a horse.4 1 For the recurrence of the same names in Greece, see infra, pp. 29 38 2 Herod, ii. 10 ; Thuc. ii. 102. 3 Tozer, I.e. p. 122 ; Cp. Aelian, Var. Hist. iii. 1. 4 Leake, Northern Greece, ii. 40. In antiquity there was barely room for a cart track between the sea and the mountains (Herod, vii. 1 76j."], [27, "I.7.] LEGENDS OF RIVERS. 9 7. The peculiar nature of Greek rivers gave rise to many beautiful legends about them. We have seen that the Alpheus twice disappears in the mountains of Legends of Arcadia, and that a river in Southern Argolis Rivers. has its outlet in the sea 1000 feet from the shore. Hence, to the imagination of the Greeks it was not impossible that the Alpheus should pass under the sea from Elis to Sicily, and there rise up again in the fountain of Arethusa.1 The rapid Achelous, spreading devastation over the cultivated land at its mouth, is transformed by fancy into a monster, half-bull and half-man, with which Heracles contended. The river which waters a plain is often changed into the earliest king of the country. Inachus is king of Argos, Cephisus of Boeotia, and Peneus of Thessaly. In some legends rivers even gained the love of women. Tyro was enamoured of the river Enipeus, and \" was wont to linger beside his lovely stream.\" So deeply was their personal nature felt that rivers were not crossed without invocations,2 and at the building of bridges propi tiatory sacrifices were offered, that the deity of the stream might not resent the constraint imposed upon him. In many districts it was necessary to control the course of the streams by artificial means, for the protection of the fields and crops. These works, which seem The Works to have been carried out at a very early period, of Heracles. are associated with the name of Heracles. When Heracles slays the Hydra of Lerna, we may perhaps connect the legend with some attempt to drain the marsh of Lerna in Argolis, and remove the pestilential miasma. The story of the slaying of the birds of Stymphalus has possibly grown up out of an attempt to control the sudden rush of waters, which flooded the deep, land-locked Arcadian valley. There 1 See Strabo, pp. 270, 271, where supposed parallels are given. 2 Even Cleomenes of Sparta had not the hardihood to cross the Erasinus when the sacrifices were unpropitious (Herod, vi. _76) : a7riK(iuf i/oc hv 6 KXeoueVns ori rbv norapbv tovtov eoepayia^ero avru, Kai oi yap eKaXXipee ovSapws biafiaLveiv piv, ciyaoBai pev e<pg roy 'Epao-iVou oi TrpoSi&ovTOs roiis Trokirjras, 'Apyeiovs p-evrot oio\u00b0 is x.aipr]0-eiv."], [28, "in LEGENDS OF RIVERS. 10 was a dam of Heracles at Pheneus in Arcadia, and similar works at the mouth of the Achelous, in Boeotia, and else where, are ascribed to him.1 8. The rivers Achelous, Acheron, Cocytus and Styx occupy a position in Greek mythology which deserves more parti- cular notice. The Achelous is the type of all Mythical * x Account of rivers, the source of sweet water and cause of Rivers. increase, the oldest and most honoured of all the three thousand sons of Oceanus.2 In religious and poetical language, Achelous was a name for rivers and river water ; the cultus of the Achelous existed in Italy and Sicily, and in various forms the name occurs in Asia Minor and Greece. The horn of Amalthea, the symbol of abundance, was said in Aetolian legend to have passed from Achelous to Heracles. This legendary position of the Achelous has been explained by the identification of the river with the heavenly stream of Oriental mythology.3 More evidence than we possess is needed to support so fanciful an explanation. It was natural for the early inhabitants of Greece, while deifying all the rivers which fertilised their fields, to ascribe a peculiar sanctity to a stream in the neighbourhood of their earliest shrine. The greater size of the Achelous probably attracted attention to it in preference to the Arachthus, which lies nearer Dodona. The Acheron and Cocytus Acheron. . - rrl . . . are rivers ot Inesprotia, which fall into the sea a little to the south of Chimerium. The former passes through a gorge, which is described as the darkest and deepest ravine in Greece, and between its precipitous rocks, for the distance of two or three miles, \"the white waters of the stream roar along through chasms and cliffs which they have worn away in the course of ages, leaving no room even for the path, which has to be carried along the sides of the cliffs far 1 Curtius, I.e. ii. 519, i. 186, etc. See the paper of the tame author, Zur Geschichte des Griechischen Wegebaues, in the \"Trans actions of the Berlin Academy,\" 1855.

On the north the Acheron is joined, three miles above the sea, by the Cocytus,2 the \"moan ing river,\" a name which is possibly similar to the \"Greta \" of northern England. Both the names naturally lent themselves to a description of the infernal regions. The water also of the Cocytus is called by Pausanias \" most dis tasteful,\"3 and Colonel Leake remarks that the water of the Vuvo (Cocytus) is reported to be bad ; the villagers on the slopes of the hills near it either make use of wells, or fetch water from the Suliotiko.4 But of all the streams of Greece the most noted was the Styx, the only waterfall 1 i . i Styx. of any importance m the country, which seems from the earliest times to have exercised a strong fascination over the minds of the Greeks. \" Beneath one of the highest summits of the snowy Aroanius, near a place where two ranges of rocks meet and form a chasm, there is a perpendicular cliff of great height, the face of which is deeply tinged with an iron hue. From the top of this there drops a thin stream of water, which in one or two places is slightly broken by the rock, against the side of which it falls, and half way it is joined by another still narrower stream, which descends parallel to it from above. Its full height is calculated at 500 feet.\"5 The Greeks, of whom doubtless very few had seen the Styx, 1 Tozer, l.c. 121 ; Herod, v. 92 ; Bursian, l.c. i. 27. 2 Leake, Northern Greece, iv. 52. 3 Paus. i. 17, 5. 4 Leake, I.e. iv. 53. Whatever be the etymology of Cocytus, it is certain that Acheron has nothing to do with oyoc (woe.)

The stream was used as a sanction in adjurations. In a famous passage in the Iliad,1 Here is challenged by Sleep to swear by the \" baneful water of Styx.\" In Hesiod Styx is the eldest daughter of Oceanus. She joined Zeus against the Titans, and received as her reward the privilege of being the oath of the gods. She dwells near^the place where night and day approach each other, far from the gods, in a palace \"roofed with lofty rocks, and stablished with silver pillars up to heaven.\" Whenever one of the dwellers in Olympus has uttered a lie, Zeus sends Iris to bring the great oath of the gods from afar in a golden pitcher, the famous water, which falls from the steep lofty rock.2 The water was regarded as deadly to animal and vegetable life, a superstition which clings to it still. \" The inhabitants of the neighbour ing villages warn the travellers against it, and regard every one as lost who drinks.\" 3 9. The lakes of Greece are land-locked basins, into which the waters from the neighbouring hills collect, nearly always without any visible outlet for the supply. Hence the level of the lake is constantly chang ing according to the amount of water flowing into it. Some times the underground channel is blocked, and the water can not escape ; the lake then rises and spreads far and wide over the adjacent fields and pastures (supra, p. 6). The largest lake in Greece is the lake of Joannina (Lacus Pambotis), in the neighbourhood of which lay Dodona. The lake\u2014 or lakes, for there are two basins, separated by a marshy tract of ground \u2014is about eighteen miles in length and four in breadth.4 1 II. viii. 369, xv. 37. 2 Hesiod, Theog. 389 ft\"., 775 ff.

Every reader of Greek history or legend has heard of Castalia, Aganippe, and Hippocrene, Pirene and Callirrhoe, and other fountains. These perennial streams springs and sometimes break out from under the roots of Fountains. large plane-trees,1 or from clefts in the rocks, or they even pour their waters from the mountains. Pirene rises on the summit of Acrocorinthus ; Aganippe on the heights of Helicon. The frequent failure of water in the rivers made these foun tains unusually precious. As the home of nymphs, they wrere sacred, and became the centre of a number of legends. They were adorned with flowers and garlands ; their waters were used in lustrations. The spring of Callirrhoe falls into the Ilissus a little to the south-east of the Acropolis of Athens ; the water, we are told by Thucydides, \"was used by the ancient Athenians on great occasions ; and at marriage rites and other ceremonies the custom is still retained.\"2 10. Greece was not a very productive country. Except in the alluvial plains, the soil was thin, and the acreage under cultivation was comparatively small. products of Corn, wine, and oil were the chief products; but Greece. the amount of corn was quite insufficient for the needs of the jiopulation, and even as early as the time of Xerxes, corn was imported from the Euxine.3 It is said that oil was the only product which Solon permitted to be exported from Attica. Figs and honey were produced in considerable quantities ; in Elis flax was grown, and a small quantity of cotton. Wine was abundant. The pastures on the mountains supported a large number of cattle, and from their milk cheese was made, a pastoral life being at all times the occupation of a 1 Mure, Tour in Greece, ii. 258. 2 Thuc. ii. 15. 3 Herod, vii. 147."], [32, "PRODUCTS OF GREECE\u2014 MINERALS.

Gold was found only in Siphnus, and it is probable thft the accounts of the mines GoId' there, which we have in Herodotus and Pausanias (Herod, iii. 57 ; Paus. xi. 2), are exaggerated. At present no gold is found on the island, and though there are traces of the eagerness with which the ancient inhabitants sought for it, their search does not appear to have been very successful.1 In the range of Pangaeum, in Thrace, gold was of course abundant ; when these mines passed into the hands of Philip a gold coinage appeared for the first time in Greece. Silver was more plentiful. The most important mines were those at Laurium, in Attica, which appear to have become a considerable source of revenue to the Athenians in the time of Themistocles. For about a century they were really productive ; in the time of Xenophon the returns were greatly diminished, and, by the beginning of the third cen- tury B.C., mines were an extremely hazardous \u00b0pper' speculation. Copper was found in Euboea, but in Strabo's time the mines had been abandoned for other sources. Iron ore is abundant in Greece, though the ancients made comparatively little use of their stores. They had, doubtless, many difficulties in regard to fuel ; at the present time it is impossible to work the rich ore of Seriphus, owing to the want of coal or wood. The chief seats of the iron manufacture were the Perioecic towns of Laconia. The helmets, swords, axes, files, knives, and awls of Laconia were the best in Greece. If the precious metals were somewhat scarce, the Greeks were compensated by the abundance of excellent stone. Marble was found everywhere on the eastern side of Greece. The Pentelic marble obtained in the quarries of Brilessus in Attica was among the best. It was not, 1 Neumann and Partsch, l.c. p. 224 ; but see Bent, Cyclarles, p. 38.

Hymettus supplied a coloured marble, which the Romans esteemed more than the Greeks. From Euboea came the famous Carystian marble. Taygetus supplied marble of a beautiful red colour. Porphyry, basalt, and granite are also found. The abundance of marble is characteristic of Greece, and gave a direction to her art, which would have been impossible without such a supply of matt. id. II. The flora of Greece is more varied than that of any other country. In the south of Messenia the oriental palm grows. At Patras, on the co st of Achaea, are groves of oranges, and Attica is the land of olives and figs, which are not found in the plains of Thessaly. In ancient times the country was rich in wood, and even now, in spite of neglect and destruction, there are fine forests \u00b0 Wood. in Thessaly and Epirus, Acarnania and Arcadia. Beeches in Northern Greece, oaks of various kinds \u2014 one of which, the Quercus aegilops, or valonea oak, furnishes in its acorns a valuable article for exportation \u2014 chestnuts and planes, are the most common trees. The planes often grow to a large size, measuring as much as thirty feet in the cir cumference of the trunk. \"Pelion,\" we are told, \"is still distinguished by the abundance and beauty of its forests, in which the beech predominates in the higher parts, and further down the chestnut and plane, while the pines, which were numerous here in antiquity, have now entirely dis appeared. In the gardens of the villages, which are thickly scattered over the slopes of the range, the orchards present a rich selection of excellent fruits.\" 1 Some of the trees now com mon in Greece are known to be importations. The chestnut was introduced late in the classical period from Asia Minor. The beech is rarely mentioned in ancient authors. The 1 Eursian, l.c. i. 43."], [34, "TREES AND FRUITS\u2014 ANIMALS. [I. 12. 16 palm certainly, and probably the vine, was imported by the Phoenicians. The fig, also, was not indigenous, nor even the cypress.1 Oranges and lemons, peaches and apricots, were either unknown in Greece, or very rare until post-classical times. Quinces and pomegranates, though known, Frults' were little used as articles of food ; pears and apples did not thrive, and were not cultivated with care.2 Trees which add to the beauty of the landscape of Greece are the myrtle and tamarisk on the shore, the cytisus and the judas tree, and, above all, the oleanders, which fringe the rivers. Flowers are still abundant : anemones, violets and crocuses, roses, balsams, geraniums, helio tropes, jasmine, and many more. But Athens is no longer \" violet Crowned.\" \" They call it Anthena (flowery), but it has no flowers,\" was the answer given to Ulrichs when he inquired from a peasant the name of the city. The Greeks appear to have had a great admiration for flowers. They loved to con nect them with their deities, and assigned to some, such as the narcissus and hyacinth, a remarkable place in their myths. 12. The larger wild animals of Greece were wolves, bears, boars, and stags. The two former were confined to the dis- tricts of Arcadia, the \"bear-land,\" and Taygetus in Laconia, an excellent hunting ground, ou which the Spartan youths were trained to endurance. The Nemean lion is purely mythological; in all probability it is borrowed from the Oriental legend in which the sun-god contends with a lion; and the lions of the Acropolis of Mycenae are an imitation of Phrygian art. But Herodotus tells us that lions infested the region between the Nestus and Achelous, though none were ever found to the east of the first river or to the west of the second.3 1 Tozer, l.c. p. 160. 2 Neumann and Partsch, l.c. p. 410. 3 Herod, vii. 125. The statement of Herodotus is confirmed by Aristotle and Pausanias. The latter represents Polydamas as slaying a lion on Olympus without an}' weapon ! (vi. 5, 5). There is also the legend of Cyrene and the lion (Pindar, Pyth. ix. 2S ff. )."], [35, "I- I3-] CLIMA TE. 17 13. The climate necessarily varies with the nature of the country, the hills differing from the plains, the interior from the sea-coast. Even in adjacent territories, like Attica and Boeotia, we find most striking contrasts. Attica is shel tered from the north by the ridge of Parnes; it is for the most part hilly, with a dry soil, incapable of retaining moisture. On the south and east it lies open to the sea, the breezes from which temper the heat of the summer sun. Hence the climate is generally mild without being enervating; the atmosphere is exceedingly clear and light.1 Boeotia, on the other hand, is shut in on three sides by lofty mountains, and on the fourth is only divided from Euboea by the narrow channel of the Euripus. The water from the hills, checked in its natural passage to the sea, falls into Lake Copais and the adjacent marshes, which give rise to damp exhala tions. In Boeotia, therefore, the climate is thick and heavy ; the heat in summer is not softened by marine breezes, while the winter cold is increased by the proximity of the mountains. Hesiod speaks of it as \" bad in winter, oppressive in summer, and never good.\"2 The great seclusion of some mountain valleys, such as Pheneus and Stymphalus, causes excessive heat in summer, and the atmosphere is rendered even more intolerable by the exhalations from the land left uncovered 1 At Athens, where accurate observations have been taken, the following characteristics of the climate are recorded : \u2014 (] .) The variation in the temperature is very great, hardly less than at Leipzig or Berlin. The heat is not only great but continuous ; there are times when the thermometer never falls below 68\u00b0 F. for a month. (2.) The amount of the rainfall is very slight, and is almost entirely confined to the winter months. Seventy-eight per cent, of the rain falls between October and March ; and only seven per cent, in June, July, and August. This combination of drought and heat withers and destroys vecetation, and makes Athens somewhat unhealthy for the time. (3.) The atmosphere is extremeiy free from fogs and clouds. This is largely due to the warmth of the soil. The moisture brought by N.E. or S.W. winds is not condensed but dissipated, and it is only on the cool heights of Parnes that clouds are formed. \u2014 Neumann and Partsch, le. p. 16 ff. 2 Works and Days, 640.

Another source of discomfort for those who journey from one place to another is the great variety of the climate. Summer has commenced at the mouth of the Pamisus while the snow is still lying in Arcadia. The tra veller within a short distance passes from summer to winter, as in climbing Mount Athos he may see almost the whole flora of the country.1 In certain parts of Greece thunder storms were peculiarly frequent; at Delphi, for instance, where more than once they contributed to the safety of the sacred place, and at Dodona, which appears to have been an appropriate home for the \" Cloud gatherer.\" On the other hand, the rainfall in some districts is extremely small. In 1859 there were only twenty-five days in the year on which sufficient rain fell at Athens to be measured by the gauge. Earthquakes of greater or less severity are frequent in Greece. Delos was said to have been \" shaken \" before the outbreak of the Persian war, and again before the Peloponnesian war, an occur rence which only the curious seem to have observed ; for the first earthquake is unknown to Thucydides and the second to Herodotus. A great earthquake which occurred before the siege of Ithome led to the revolt of the Helots. We hear of them in the history of Thucydides as \"unparalleled in their extent and fury \" during the Peloponnesian war. The fifth year of the war was the time \"when the frequent earthquakes occurred at Athens, in Euboea, and in Boeotia, especially at Orchomenos,\" and put a stop to the invasion of Attica.2 But the greatest disaster which occurred in Greece from this cause was the destruction of Helice and Bura, on the coast of Achaea, in 373 B.C.3 In modern times earth quakes are frequent and disastrous; to them in a great measure is due the ruined condition of the temples in the country.

The latter is still active, \" a crater in the midst of the sea.\" 1 14.

Athenian thanked the gods that he was not heavy and stupid, like his northern neighbour, the \"Hog of Boeotia,\" and in Arcadia music was universally cultivated as an antidote to the harsh influence of the climate of the hills. The effect was the greater because the Hellenes never overcame, or even attempted to overcome, the natural difficulties of their home, which indeed are still unconquered. Their houses were not adapted to reduce the variation in the temperature to a minimum ; there were no careful appliances for storing water when needed, and for preventing the overflow when super abundant. The inhabitants accepted the circumstances and conditions around them, regarding the natural arrangement as divine, and therefore excellent.2 In Greece one of two features of scenery, if not both, is always present to the eye, the mountains and the sea. With the first we identify the love of home, with the second the love of change, both qualities eminently characteristic of the Greeks in the best period of their history. The inhabitants of the hilly districts which were not in contact The inhabitants with the sea remained for the most part peasants \u00b0f the Hills and tillers of the soil.

The Dorians of Sparta, though greatly superior to their northern neighbours, were intel lectually slow and unenterprising. On the other hand, the Ionians of the coast were volatile and fond of adventure, ever eager for some new thing.

The former distrusted everything that was new or strange ; The Dorians but the Corinthians and Corcyraeans, at an on the Sea. early period, were the ablest and most adven turous seamen of antiquity, though unequal to the Athenians in intellectual capacity and force. The Greeks enjoyed their climate and their country. They loved an out-door life ; every man on his own farm, watching the growth of his vines or fig-trees, or \"resting on the Climate and violets by the spring.\" It was with much country Life. vexation of spirit that the Athenians in the country broke up their homes and transferred themselves to the city to escape the invasion of the Peloponnesians, nor did the city ever recover from the ruin of a vigorous peasantry. The peculiarities of the climate left traces on the religion and character of the inhabitants. In Attica, Athena was wor shipped as Aglaurus, the bright, and as Erse, the dew. She was the goddess of the air whose power withered the vegeta tion, and who also gave the dew which refreshed the parched and exhausted earth. Moreover, the warm climate, which made comparatively little demands on physical endurance joined with the poorness of the soil, tended to create among the Greeks a degree of frugality such as we can hardly realise. A few olives, bread and wine, were enough for the support of life. Luxury was not indeed unknown among them, but it rarely took the grosser shapes which were common at Pome. And in most parts of the country the bright air and perpetual change of scenery saved the inhabitants from the depression which seeks relief in excess. Living in a beautiful country, the appreciation of beauty"], [39, "I. 14.] INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE\u2014 GODS ON EARTH. 21 became to the Greeks a second nature. In their temples and statues they quickly passed beyond the first rude stages of architecture and sculpture ; they adopted the style of building peculiarly suited to their land, and carried it out with exquisite finish. Though they were not all equally gifted, it is a signifi cant fact that the Arcadians of the remote village of Phigalea commemorated their deliverance from the plague by the erec tion of a beautiful temple. This was the highest form their devo tion could take; it was the gift, in their judgment, most pleasing to the god.1 The same feeling for beauty shows itself in the Greek rendering of the human or animal form. Disregarding conventionality, they recognise the truth that life is the source of beauty. Every object re presented in art must be full of life and power, and the grace which arises from the perfect use of power. Without attempt ing to connect too closely the Greek sense of artistic beauty with the scenery amid which the Greeks lived, it is not unsafe to draw the conclusion that, in a country where all delight in out-door life was entirely repressed, such a sense, even if present, would have quickly perished. Nor would it have been possible in a moister climate to expose statuary to the open air, and make the noblest works of the sculptor a possession of the whole people. In the imagination of the Greeks, the land in which they lived had once been the dwelling-place of the gods, or had been visited by them in the likeness of men. On every hand they found traces of these divine inhabi- sacredness of tants. From one end to the other the land was the Earth. filled with temples, shrines, and sacred groves (aAcrr/), where the deities might dwell in undisturbed possession and receive the offerings of their worshippers. Even the lonely hills, the forests, and the springs had their deities ; the very trees and flowers were sacred. Over the olive watched the eye of Athena and Zeus Morios ; the bay was sacred to Apollo, the white poplar to Heracles.

Persephone was gathering a narcissus, a flower which was henceforth consecrated to her and Demeter ; the lily was the flower of Aphrodite ; the rose of Dionysus. The earth was no mere inanimate thing, but a joyful mother of children, a just and liberal housewife, who restored manifold the riches in trusted to her. Through these ideas the human and external worlds were brought into close relation, and upon the actions of men depended the increase of flock and field. \" To those who pronounce just judgments famine never comes, nor calamity, but joy and abundance wait on the fields which are theirs. The earth brings forth food in plenty ; on the hills the oaks bear acorns at the summit, and honey in the trunk ; their sheep are heavy with fleeces ; their wives are true mothers ; blessing and prosperity are theirs for ever, and they go not in ships on the sea, for the bounteous earth gives them her fruit in season.\"1 15.

No doubt these communities were small, and the desire to maintain _. . their independence was from one point of view a Disadvantages \u2022 i i and advantages source of national weakness. Hellas was never arising from a united nation, the healthy spirit of indepen- dence degenerated into jealousy and selfishness. War might break out at any moment between neighbouring cities, and almost within the lifetime of one man every leading State had been the friend and enemy of every other. On the other hand, it was only by this minute subdivision that the Greeks became conscious of the true meaning of civic life. 1 Hesiod, Works and Days, 230 ff."], [41, "I- iS-1 GREEK POLITICS. 23 Every man was of some importance in so small a number ; he was needed for defence or counsel ; it was his duty to leave behind him a citizen to take his place ; he was not lost in a crowd, or the mere instrument of another's will. In Greece, therefore, for the first time in antiquity, we find liberty and self-restraint forming the conditions of political life. This is the great gift of Hellas to the world. Previously there had been nothing but monarchs, armies, subjects, slaves. Even in Greece, the attempt was often made to substitute the rule of one for the rule of many ; but with the progress of political life, \"tyranny,\" as it was called, became more and more repugnant to the Greek mind. If we compare Greek and Roman history, we cannot fail to be struck with the limited size of the cities of Greece, and the comparative pettiness of the interests at stake, but the advantage is not wholly on the side of Rome. Rome presents us with the spectacle of one great city endeavouring to rule the world. The study of Greek history Lessons of brings before us the difficulties which attend Greek Politics. the early stages of civic government; and, if we cannot apply the lessons which it offers directly to modern politics, we can learn much from the spirit in which the Greeks at tempted to meet the problems presented to them \u2014 from their efforts to combine steadiness with progress, authority with liberty, subjection to the State with personal freedom."], [42, "24 CHAPTER II. THE EARLIEST INHABITANTS. I. We may gather information about the earliest inhabi tants of a country from three sources : the traditions of the people, their language and religious rites, and the monuments The sources of \u00b0r relics of the past. Of these, it is obvious Early History, that tradition, while promising most, gives us the least. Even if we could eliminate the mythical element in legends, we should find them to be full of incon sistencies and contradictions. In Greece, at any rate, epic and local traditions are constantly at variance, and the history of the earliest times will differ widely, according to the legends upon which it is constructed. It is common to Homeric and speak of Homeric tradition as the oldest and Local Tradition, most trustworthy tradition of Greece. For this assertion there is, however, no convincing evidence. The date at which a legend first appears in literature proves little in regard to its antiquity, and the poets had as much interest in altering or inventing stories as the local cicerone or priest. On the other hand, if we follow local legends, we cannot determine the extent to which they have been altered under the influence of epic poetry. When the two were at variance there was a natural tendency to bring them into agreement, and the weight of authority lay with the poets. The evidence of language is open to the obvious objection that nations have often changed their speech. If it were true that Greek is a homogeneous language, it' Language o o ' would not follow that all the tribes which spoke it were of the same origin, still less that they were the earliest inhabitants of Greece. What should we know of"], [43, "II. u SOURCES OF EARLY HISTORY. 25 the presence of the Etruscans in Italy if we were without the evidence of written inscriptions and Roman historians? Languages have their history no less than nations, and nothing is so delusive as facts founded upon etymologies. In regard to religious rites and customs, it is necessary to bear in mind the tenacity of Rel'eion' traditional modes of worship. If we find barbarous rites among the humane and civilised Greeks, we need not assume that they are importations from the East; they may be survivals from a pre-Hellenic population, or they may carry us back to that remote age when the Greeks were still savages, with beliefs and rites such as savages entertain and practise. At the best, they are of little value as evidence of the civilisation of the people among whom they are found.1 The evidence of monuments, unless illustrated or confirmed by written documents, is of small service to the historian. It comes to us from a past of which we know nothing. The excavations at Hissarlik, Mycenae and Tiryns prove that opulent and powerful tribes once inhabited those sites, but they tell us nothing of the time at which the cities were built, or of the men who built them. In conjunction with the epic poetry of Greece, they carry us back to a period when a high degree of civilisation existed in the Aegean. Whether that civilisation was Oriental or Hellenic they do not enable us to decide, nor do they explain how it passed away before the dawn of Greek history. They teach us how recent and imperfect our historical knowledge is, and how little we know of the long period which preceded it. We may even go a step further. They make it probable that the civilisation of \" the Homeric age \" is an idealised picture, not of the Greeks whom we know, but of a nation which 1 Arist.

With him Pelasgia is the ancient name of the land now called Hellas. The Athenians, the Ionians, the Aeolians, and the Arcadians were all originally Pelasgians.

Thucydides identifies the Pelasgians and Tyrrhenians, a view which was set forth by Hellanicus,1 but which Hero- Thucydides- dotus does not share.2 In the epic poet Asius Asius. (c. 700 B.C.), Pelasgus is the first of mortal men ; Arcadian legend claimed him as the first king of that people, from whom they had learned the rudiments of civilisa- tion.3 Aeschylus speaks of Pelasgus as a king of Argos, whose dominion extended to the Stry mon ; Sophocles calls the Argives Tyrrhenian Pelasgians, and Ephorus asserts that Arcadia was the original home of the tribe, from whence, being a warlike race, they spread to other parts of Greece.4 Finally, the Tyrrhenians were identified with the Lydian Torrhebians, and when these were in turn identified with the Etruscans, it was natural that Pelasgi should be found in Italy.5 We see, then, that the tradition of the Pelasgi, as the earliest inhabitants of Greece, was being constantly enlarged a Criticism of poets and historians. All that we really the tradition of know about the nation is that Pelasgians \u2014 the Pelasgi. whom Herodotus and Thucydides regarded as barbarians, and speaking a barbarian tongue \u2014 existed in his torical times in the neighbourhood of the Hellespont, and in the islands of Lemnos and Scyros.

The name Larissa, which is thought to be a characteristic mark of the Pelasgi, is found in Aeolis and in Thessaly, at Argos, on the borders of Elis and Achaea, at Mytilene, at Ephesus, and in Crete.1 The exist ence of these fortresses proves the presence of the people, from whom the name was derived, in many different places. If, then, the theory (for it is no more than a theory) which connects Larissae with Pelasgi is correct, we must assume that the Pelasgi did once inhabit various parts of Hellas, the islands of the Aegean, and the coast of Asia Minor. It is inevitable that modern historians should take widely divergent views of a nation concerning which tradition is so un certain. Some writers, among whom is Kiepert, think that the Pelasgi were a Semitic tribe, who immigrated into Greece. This theory, though it explains their presence on the coast, fails to account for their position at Dodona and in Thessaly. Yet these are places to which, even in the Homeric form of the legend, the title Pelasgic clings. That the Pelasgi are said by Herodotus and Thucy dides to have spoken a barbarous language is, of course, no proof that their language was not Indo-Germanic. In another view, which has received the assent of Thirlwall and Duncker, Pelasgian is nothing more than the name of the ancient inhabitants of the country, which subsequently gave way to the title Achaean, as this in its turn was supplanted by the term Hellenes. In support of this view the evidence of Herodotus and Thucydides may be cited. Both authors regarded the Pelasgi as the ancient inhabitants of the country, and Herodotus combines them with the Ionians.

It is not impossible that the Hellenes con nected the ancient fortresses found in Greece, the Islands, and Asia Minor with the Pelasgi, and presupposed their existence wherever such fortresses or their ruins were found. When in this manner the Pelasgi had become established as an ancient tribe, those nations which laid claim to great antiquity, as the Athenians and Arcadians, became Pelasgians. The Pelasgic But we have no evidence to support the idea of Age. a Pelasgic Age as a period of simple habits and a Pelasgic Age as a period of simple habits and agricultural occupations, which slowly gave way before the more martial age of the Achaeans.3 The civilisation of the \" Achaean Age \" exists only in the epic poems, and the \" Pelasgic Age \" is but another name for the prehistoric Greeks,4 of whose agriculture we know nothing. 4. The traditions which we have of the Lelegians, like those of the Pelasgians, differ greatly in different authors. The Lelegians *ne eP*c Poems the Lelegians are an Asiatic \u2014Traditional tribe, which supports the Trojans.5 Herodotus closely connects them with the Carians, who, while they dwelt in the Islands and were subject to Minos, were called Leleges.6 In these accounts we hear nothing of the Leleges in Greece. Strabo, on the other hand, supported by the authority of Aristotle, not only finds Leleges in Asia, where they are united with Carians, but places them in Acarnania, Locris, Boeotia, Megaris and/ Leucas ; and Pausanias, who also combines the Carians and Leleges, places them in Pylus and Laconia. We hear of an aboriginal Lelex, who, like Pelasgus, is either the first man 1 Herod, ii. 171. 2 Ibid. ii. 51. 3 See Duncker, Hist.

In \" Homer \" both appear as Asiatic nations. Both are carried by later writers into Greece, which is indeed divided between them. There is one important difference. While the Pelasgi were supposed to have remained in Greece, and to have become by some unexplained change a part of the Greek people, the Lelegians di=appeared entirely. Even in Asia the only traces of them are deserted forts which bear their name, and Strabo speaks of them as entirely extinct. The Leleges are merely a name in history.

We can hardly over-estimate the irreparable confusion which these writers introduced into Greek legends by their attempts to formulate and arrange them. A resemblance in names, how ever distant \u2014 an etymology, however false, was quite suf ficient foundation to support a historical connection. From these sources, doubtless, Aristotle drew his information when placing the Leleges in the west and the centre of Greece. At 1 Strabo, p. 321.

As we have seen, the Carians are closely connected with the Leleges. The Carian historian Philippus asserted that the Leleges were the slaves of the Carians.2 In opposition to the Cretan story that the Carians were Leleges driven from the islands to the mainland of Asia Minor, the Carians maintained that Asia was their original home. They considered themselves to be nearly akin to the Mysians and Lydians, who shared with them in the worship of Carian Zeus at Mylasa.3 In the Homeric Catalogue the Carians are said to be f3apf3ap6<pwvoi, an epithet applied to the Carians only, and in Strabo's opinion very remarkable, owing to the large number of Greek words existing in the Carian language.4 In Greece Proper the Carians were supposed to have settled at Megara, where one of the two citadels was known as Caria, at Epidaurus and Hermione. That the islands of the Aegean were inhabited by them, was proved to Thucydides by an examination of the tombs. Whether they settled in Attica or not was more doubtful, but the family of Isagoras, the opponent of Clisthenes, worshipped the Carian Zeus.5 In historical times the Carians existed as a nation in Asia Minor, where they were distinguished from all their neighbours by the worship of Zeus Stratius.6 1 For the Leleges, see Busolt, l.c. p. 32 flf. ; aud Holm, l.c. ch. vii. 2 Athenaeus, p. 271.

He adopts the Cretan version of the Carian history. 5 From the Carians the Greeks borrowed the custom of wearing plumes in their helmets, of fixing handles in their shields, and placing devices upon them (Herod, i. 171). For Carians in Megara, cf. Paus. i. 40, 6 ; in Epidaurus and Hermione, Strabo, p. 374. For Isagoras, cf. Herod, v. 66. Thucydides' statement concerning the islands is given in i. 8.

The Cauconians were inhabitants of Elis, the Curetes of Acarnania. The Temmices, Abantes and Hyantes appear in Euboea and Boeotia.1 8. The conclusion to be drawn from the legendary ac count of the early population of Greece is negative rather than positive. We cannot distinguish between Resuitofth the tribes which inhabited both sides of the examination of Aegean. Pelasgi, Leleges, Carians, Thracians Greek Lesends are found on either shore. It is only when we come to the Achaeans and Hellenes that wre have names which are re stricted to the peninsula ;2 and it is; not difficult to show that even these names are too closely connected with the Pelasgians for us to suppose that they denote an entirely different population. The three nations are neighbours in the south of Thessaly. The Achaeans no less than the Hellenes follow Achilles from Phthiotis to Troy, Hellenes,' and with Achilles also came those \" who dwell Pelasgians, not in Pelasgic Argos.\" On the occasion of a solemn oath the Hellenic Achilles appeals to the Pelasgic Zeus. There is an Achaean Argos and a Pelasgic Argos, and we have no reason for separating the Larissa in Argos from the Larissa in Thessaly. Strabo tells us that the Achaeans of Phthiotis invaded Peloponnesus, and became so distinguished there that they gave their name to the Achaean Argos.3 It is at the Pelasgic sanctuary of Dodona that we first hear of the Helli or Selli, men who slept on the ground and never washed their feet. The district called Hellopia lay in the neighbourhood of Dodona. Against this evidence of connection, the distinction of Greek and barbarian is of very little weight, for the Greeks themselves were conscious that their ancestors were barbarians. The evidence of legend therefore tends to show that in the earliest times a number of tribes, more or less homogeneous, 1 From the Hyantes was derived the term Is, hog, for a Boeotian. 2 With the exception of the Achaeans in Crete.

The tribes were known by different names, and sometimes one, sometimes another, gained the predominance ; but there is no reason to suppose that the change from Pelasgians to Hellenes was brought about by the introduction of any new or alien element into the population. What were the causes which led to the adoption of the name Hellenes, as the general title of the nation, cannot be determined with certainty. IL\u2014 (A.) EVIDENCE OF LANGUAGE. 9. This conclusion would, of course, be entirely overthrown if it could be proved that any of these primitive tribes spoke a Semitic language. For there is no doubt that the Greeks were an Indo-Germanic race, whatever may be the position which they occupy in the circle of Indo-Germanic nations.1 The Peiasgian It is true that Herodotus and Thucydides, as Language. we have seen, speak of the Peiasgian language as a \" barbarous \" tongue, but we may reasonably doubt whether this view was correct. If the Peiasgian language was radically different from Greek, and the Pelasgians were the ancient inhabitants of the greater part of the country, the spread of the Hellenic language would be inexplicable. When two nations of unequal numbers come into contact, the language of the majority will, as a rule, prevail, unless the minority are more highly civilised.2 Since, therefore, the Hellenes were neither a majority nor more highly civilised, in comparison with the Pelasgi, we should expect that the Pelasgic language would have prevailed over the Hellenic, if the two had been distinct. And if we consider how little we know of the value of the word \" barbarous \" when applied by 1 The theory of a Graeco-Italic period, in which the Greeks and Italians lived together, separate from the rest of the Indo-Germanic stock, is untenable. If there is a large number of words found only in Greek and Latin, there are many words found only in Greek and Indo-Persian, and the grammar of Greek and Latin differs more than the grammar of Greek and Old Persian.

In the vocabulary of the Greek language there is a consider able residuum which cannot be recognised as Indo-Germanic in origin.1 These words may be solitary sur- Evidence of the vivors from lost Indo-Germanic roots, but it is Greek Language. also possible that they have been borrowed by the Greeks from some earlier inhabitants of the country. Unfor tunately, we know little of the Greek dialects, which, for ethnographical purposes, are of far greater value than the written or literary language, and that little is of uncertain antiquity. Of the Thracian and Illyrian languages, the links between the Greeks and their neighbours on the north, nothing remains upon which we can found a judgment. If they were connected with the Phrygians, the Thracians were of Indo-Germanic race.2 On the other hand, the IUyrians may have been the ancestors of the modern Albanians, whose language is certainly very unlike anything that can be called Greek. In the names of places also, it is obvious that, while many can be explained at once from the Greek language, others can only be derived by tortuous processes from Greek originals. Many names in this second class are, perhaps, not Greek words at all. They may be in part Semitic, especially those of places on the sea-coast, but the greater number wall always remain inexplicable. Though local names are singularly tenacious of life, they often become changed, in pronunciation or form, by those who preserve them orally, owing partly to convenience in pronouncing them, and partly to false etymo logies.3 Another striking fact is the constant repetition in 1 Wharton, Etyma Graeca, p. 165.

Some of these names, such as Pamisus, Peneus and Asopus are not readily explained as Greek.

In Thrace there was a river Arisbus, in Lesbos and the Troad there were towns called Arisba. At Troy there was a Scaean gate, in Thrace there was a Scaean fort, and a river Scaeus.2 Of the route by which these tribes came into Asia Minor \u2014 whether it was by the Bosphorus, as Herodotus relates in regard to the Phrygians, or through Armenia, we cannot tell. Nor is it worth while to speculate on the subject until the ori ginal home of the Indo-Germanic race is more definitely fixed. The evidence of language, then, however imperfect, confirms the evidence of tradition in so far as it testifies to the pre sence of Indo-Germanic nations on both sides of the Aegean. It also carries us further, and points to a remote past, when Greece may have been inhabited or visited by nations which did not speak the Greek language.3 1 E.

Even if we could go as far as some modern mytholo gists would take us, we should still fail to establish any great resemblance between the religion of Greece and India. The religion of the Greeks, when it becomes Hellenic, is distinguished by its anthropomorphic and ethical character ; but there seems to have been a time when it was neither one nor the other. Many survivals of primitive and barbarous forms of faith and worship con tinued to exist till the latest times. Proofs of this will be found in abundance in the writings of early Christian authors, who naturally found a peculiar pleasure in taunting the civilised and intellectual Greeks with the stupidity and indecency of their religious doctrines and rites. Without appealing to the evidence of professed opponents, it is quite clear, from the statements of the Greeks themselves, that stones, and trees and shapeless wooden idols were worshipped even in the best period of Greek civilisation. Deities were conceived in degrading shapes, and actions of the grossest immorality and indecency were ascribed to them.

The mere comparison of a few deities which happen to bear similar names in the Indo-Germanic nations can give us no idea of the Indo-Germanic religion. The Vedas are probably as mis leading in regard to the religion of the ancient Indians as the Homeric poems are in regard to the religion of the ancient Greeks. They tell us nothing of the beliefs of the people, unchanged by poet or priest. On the other hand, indecency and cruelty are such universal characteristics of primitive religion, that we are not justified in ascribing every human sacrifice in Greece, every Corinthian or Cyprian orgy, to the influence of Semitic immigrants. The evidence of religion confirms the evidence of tradition in pointing to an age of barbarism, from which the Hellenes emerged as the Israelites emerged from the sensuality of Canaanitish worship.

Of such inhabitants we have some traces, however scanty, in relics of the Stone Age, and lacustrine habitations. A few axes and hammers of the Neolithic period have been found, chiefly in the south of Euboea, and arrow-heads of flint are said to be not uncommon in the neighbourhood of Cephisia in Attica. There is no reason to doubt the genuineness of these relics, and the rarity of them may perhaps be explained by the superstitious reverence with which the larger stones are regarded by the peasants who find them.1 In the time of Herodotus Ancient Lacus lacustrine dwellings existed on the shores of trine Dwellings.

The ruins excavated at Hissarlik (Troy) are those of a city comparatively small in extent. The walls of the citadel The Ruins of were built of stone, but neither in the art Hissariik. 0f construction nor in the size of the stones will they bear comparison with the ruins of Mycenae. The houses, with one exception, which may have been the residence of the chief, were built of unburned bricks or of wood, and seem to have perished by fire. In their construction they may be compared with the prehistoric houses discovered on Santorin 1 (infra, p. 44). From the relics found in the city, it appears that metal and stone implements were both in use, though stone implements are the more numerous. In shape, the armour is not different from that found in Greece. Silver and gold were also discovered, though not in such abundance or in such beautiful forms as at Mycenae. Ivory was found, and an immense number of objects in terra-cotta. The art displayed in these is of the same kind, but more primitive than the art of Santorin and Mycenae, and leads us to the conclusion that we have at Hissarlik the earliest specimens of those vases which seem to have been manufactured in Greece before the appearance of the Phoenicians.2 The remains discovered at Hissarlik are, in fact, the most primitive which have yet been found in the Mediterranean. Th rimitiv P0tterv we see the first attempts at de nature of the corative art. Beginning with the rudest strokes Hissarlik relics. an(j p0rntSj we progress by degrees to circles and waving lines, drawn with a firm and skilful hand.

A symbolic meaning has been attributed to some of the subjects repre sented on the vases, such as the zigzag lines, the swastika, 1 Compare also the account of Sardis in Herod, v. 101, and the de scription of the Mosynoeci in Pauly, Real-Encycl., s.v. 2 Dumont, Cirarniques, p. 5 ; Schliemann, Ilium, Troja, etc."], [61, "II. 12.] PRIMITIVE RELICS: HISSARLIK. 43 and the rude outlines of trees ; but as these designs are found elsewhere in localities widely remote from each other, we may doubt whether they have any special meaning in this case. Of the vases, many are made in the shape of animals, such as bears and pigs. Others, even more numerous, present a rude imitation of the upper parts of a woman's body. There is no reason to suppose that these grotesque imitations are due to any religious feeling ; they pleased the taste of those who used them, and were the works of art of the time. They are probably of native manufacture, for there does not appear to be anything in the pottery which can certainly be distinguished as Oriental in origin. The ornaments of gold, Are the rencs on the other hand, display considerable skill, Oriental ? and for this reason are probably works of Phoenician artists or manufactured under Phoenician influence. The Phoenicians were certainly in possession of Thasos at a very early period, and it is possible that this island was the source of much of the gold which was so common in the Aegean in prehistorical times. From this point they could very easily carry on a trade with the tribe which possessed the citadel in the Troad.1 Lesbos may have been the intermediate station. The first king of that island is known in Greek tradition as Makar, a name which clearly betrays its Phoenician origin. 1 The extent to which the vases, ornaments, etc., discovered at Hissarlik can be called Phoenician is still an unsettled question, and is likely to remain so till the distinctive features of Phoenician or Oriental art can be more precisely fixed. At present it seems best to put the question thus : Is there anything at Hissarlik which distinctly recalls the types of Babylonian or Egyptian art ? On the whole, we are justified in saying \"No.\" It is true that we find Phoenicians on the walls of Rekhmara's tomb, in the reign of Thothmes III., \"bringing, as tribute, vases with animals' heads, similar to those found at Rhodes and Hissarlik \" (Sayce, Ancient Empires, p. 1S6). But such vases are not peculiar to Hissarlik and Rhodes, nor can it be proved that they were manufactured under Phoenician influence. On the other hand, the gold work at Hissarlik is so delicate that we can hardly believe it to be of native manufacture. Cf. Helbig, Das Horn. Epos, p. 36 ; E.

[II. 12. 44 Next in point of antiquity to the remains at Hissarlik come the prehistoric dwellings which have been discovered in San isiands of Thera torin. As is well kno wn, Thera and Therasia, the and Therasia. larger islands of the Santorin group, are portions of the extinct rim of a volcano, the centre of which has fallen into the sea. Beneath the crust of \" puzzolan,\" which erup tions have thrown over the surface of the islands, the remains of a number of houses have been found, consisting of several chambers, which vary in size, and present considerable differ ences in structure. Some are rudely built, and plastered with earth on the inner surface of the walls; others are more carefully finished, and even decorated with painting. The foundations of all rest upon the lava, which formed the soil of the island before the puzzolan was deposited. The chambers in the houses are provided with windows in which are traces of wood work ; layers of wood are worked into the masonry of the walls, and the roofs were formed of wood covered with earth. On Therasia the remains of a skeleton were found, but it was too Relics found in mutilated to be of value. Metal of any kind these islands. appears to have been almost unknown. With the single exception of a copper saw, all the implements yet discovered are of stone. In the production of pottery con siderable skill had been attained. Not only did the inhabi tants manufacture small vases for use or sale, but they also stored their cereals in jars of immense size. These vases are among the oldest known to us, and present distinct peculiarities both in material and design. From the remains found in the larger jars, we see that pease and barley were already in culti vation. Flocks and herds were also kept, and cheese was made. The dog was known as a domestic animal. The in habitants of these dwellings were destroyed by a calamity even more appalling than that which overtook Pompeii. The crater, which had been thrown up in the centre of the island, increased in weight with every successive eruption, and at the same time the subterranean cavity was constantly being enlarged. At length a great eruption not only covered the island with a layer of puzzolan sufficient to overwhelm and"], [63, "II. 12.] PREHISTORIC RELICS: IALYSUS. 45 destroy all the inhabitants and their houses, but at the same time caused the entire centre of the volcano to disappear in the sea. Nothing remained above the waters but those in considerable fragments of the edge which form the present group of islands. Who this primitive people were we cannot even conjecture. The pottery which they manufactured presents resemblances to that found at Hissarlik on the one hand, and on the other to that found in Rhodes, Cyprus and various parts of Greece. But it is unlike that of Egypt and Phoenicia. It is probable, then, that it was manufactured at a time when Oriental types did not yet prevail in the Aegean. M. Fouque, whose mono graph on Santorin gives the fullest account of everything connected with the island, is of opinion that the catastrophe in which the central cone disappeared may be placed about 2000 B.C. But there appear to be no adequate grounds for this assumption.1 At Ialysus, in Rhodes, a number of vases have been found which exhibit the Santorin type carried to a state of greater perfection, and largely influenced by Oriental r ' \u00b0 J J Ialysus, Rhodes. models. The ornamentation is more delicate and more certain, but it has not yet become fantastic. This pottery appears to occupy a position between the vases discovered at Santorin and those which are distinctive of Mycenae. Dumont ascribes it to the 16th century B.C.2 Far more important are the monuments and relics which have been found on the continent of Greece. At Phar salus in Thessaly, at Orchomenus in Boeotia, at Spata and 1 Fouque, Santorin et ses Eruptions. See also Bent's Cyclades, pp. 149, 150.

Mr. Bent assigns the remains on Therasia, which he considers to be older than those on Thera, to an age anterior to Hissarlik.

Recent excava tions at Mycenae have shown that the gateway opened upon a place of sepulture, where, if we may judge from the costly ornaments wdiich have been discovered in the tombs, a royal race was buried. Though Greek legends spoke of Mycenae as the burial-place of the Atridae, no Greek can possibly have been aware of the existence of real sepulchres, containing bodies and treasure. Nothing more clearly proves the chasm between the historical Greeks and their past than the fact that so large an amount of treasure should have been left un touched in the citadel of Mycenae. The tombs must have been opened repeatedly for the interment of fresh corpses ; the funerals must have been celebrated with great pomp and ceremony ; but every trace or hint of the sepulchres opened by Dr. Schliemann had disappeared in historical times. The natural inference is, that a wide interval separated the age when the sepulchres were made, and the princes who were buried in them, from the Mycenae of later times \u2014 an interval in which, owing perhaps to some great change of population, the memory of the past entirely perished. Shrines may become desolate and ruined through a change of faith, as has been the case at Stonehenge, but the treasure buried at Mycenae would have been valuable at any time.

Though it Asia Minor is true that we can find nothing in Asia Minor quite similar to the conical chambers of Mycenae or Orchomenus, sculptures have been found which, in spite of some differences, exhibit striking resemblances to the figures over the Lions' Gate. \" At least eight tombs exist in the two Phrygian necropoleis, in which recurs the same device of lions as guardians over the doorway.\"1 Whether these structures were the work of native princes wdio hired or copied the skill of Oriental artists ; or whether they were raised by Oriental dynasties, which in prehistorical times established powerful monarchies in the more fertile districts of eastern Greece, we cannot yet determine.

[II. 12. 48 No trace of iron occurs in these tombs. The swords and helmets are of bronze, the arrow-heads of obsidian. Yet the work upon the swords, which are intended for the thrust rather than the stroke, shows great skill. The gold orna ments exhibit various devices ; they are partly moulded, and partly in the style known as repousse'. The decoration of the vases consists of spirals, geometric figures, plants and animals. Ornaments similar in kind have been found at Nauplia, and at Spata on the eastern slope of Hymettus. Scholars do not yet appear to be agreed upon the precise nature of these objects. No traces of distinctly Hellenic art occur among them.

The amber beads, the ostrich egg, and the ivory are Phoenician importations. On the other hand, the ornamentation of the swords is Egyptian, both in pattern and mode of execution. The spiral, which occurs so frequently, is by some authorities referred to Phrygia. The vases are similar to those which have been found in Crete and Rhodes (Ialysus). The gems fall into two classes, \" island stones,\" as they are called \u2014 i.e. those which belong to the class of stones found in the islands of the Archipelago, and in certain localities on the mainland of Greece, but not, as yet, on the mainland of Asia Minor \u2014 and others of a more Oriental design.1 Though these relics leave no doubt that Mycenae must have been inhabited by princes who could draw to themselves all the wares of the Aegean known in their time, they do not enable us to ascertain who these princes were, whether they were of Hellenic or Oriental race, and how Conclusion. . .

The only safe conclusion to be drawn is, that in early times the Aegean and the eastern coast of Greece were the seat of a lively and 1 The authorities are : Schliemann, Mykenae, Tiryns ; Milchoefer, Anfdnge der Kunst j Helbig, Das Homerische Epos."], [67, "II. i3.] JA VAN: IONIANS. 49 lucrative traffic, which had almost entirely passed away at the period when the history of the Greece that we know begins. It is extremely improbable that the Dorians were the builders of the fortresses of Mycenae and Tiryns, or that they possessed the riches which were found in the tombs. The conquest of an ancient but decaying civilisation by a ruder people is an almost unavoidable hypothesis for the explanation of these monuments. IV.\u2014 GREECE AND PHOENICIA. 13. In the genealogical table which we find in Genesis, Javan is said to be the father of Rodanim, Chittim, Elishah and Tarshish, a statement which is supposed to mean that Javan is the generic name given to the in habitants of Rhodes, Cyprus, the islands of the Aegean, and Tartessus at the mouth of the Guadalquivir \u2014 the inhabitants of the West with whom the Hebrews were acquainted at the time when the genealogy was written down.1 Whatever the value of this explanation, Javan is very probably the same word as Ion, which thus appears to be a name known to the Phoeni cian traders from the East at a tolerably early date. The use of the word in the early history of Greece cannot be precisely fixed. The Ionians are barely mentioned in Homer, but at an early time the name was given to the inhabitants of the north-east of Peloponnesus (Troezen, etc.) and the district on the north coast, subsequently known as Achaea. The inhabi tants of Attica and Euboea were also claimed as Ionians, and in any case the Ionians must have been inhabitants of the coasts and acquainted with the sea. Poseidon was a deity zealously worshipped by them. At a later time, owing to the development of Athens and the Ionian colonies in Asia Minor, they became the most adventurous and the most civilised part of the Hellenic nation. Yet the name was regarded with dislike. Great families at Athens like the Alcmaeonidae 1 See Duncker, Hist. Greece, i. 35. The name Javanu is found in Assyrian inscriptions (Sargon) ; cf. 'laovav in Aristoph. Achar. 104. VOL. I. D"], [68, "EARL Y FOREIGN SETTLERS. [II. 14, 50 claimed to be Athenian rather than Ionian, and many Ionians wished to be rid of the title altogether.1 The faults of the Ionian nature were apparent, and at all times the possessors and cultivators of the soil are inclined to disparage those who are engaged in maritime adventure. 14. Greek legends speak of foreigners who settled in their land. Of these the chief were the Phoenician Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, and Danaus of Egypt, whose Foreigners ' mi_ settled in posterity became kings of Argos. I hat the Greece. Phoenicians established themselves in various parts of Greece, and continued there for a considerable period, seems beyond a doubt. Traces of their settle ments remained in names, deities, religious rites, legends, monuments and arts ; if they exercised no influence on the political development of the Greeks, the reason is that they were pirates and traders in search of gain rather than colonists. The islands, more especially Cyprus, Crete, Bhodes and Thasos, and the shore extending from Cythera to Boeotia were the scene of Phoenician activity. In Cyprus, Thasos and Euboea, they found the ores of gold and copper, which they knew how to manufacture into armour or works of art ; the mussels, from which they extracted the dye needed for the famous Tyrian purple, abounded off the coast of Cythera and Argolis, and in the straits of the Euripus. To protect their factories they built forts ; altars and shrines were raised for the performance of their national rites and the \u201e . ... worship of their national deities. At Thasos, Their Mines. r \u2022 . , TT tor instance, where Herodotus saw \"a whole mountain overturned \" by their mining operations, they built a temple to Baal Moloch, the sun-god of the Phoenicians, who, perhaps through the epithet Archal, became the Their Deities Heracles of the Greeks. In Cythera there was a temple of the \" armed Aphrodite,\" the most ancient shrine of the goddess in Greece. As this deity is said to have been brought from Syria, we may with reason 1 Herod, v. 69."], [69, "II. i4.] PHOENICIAN RITES IN GREECE. 51 identify her with the Syrian goddess of love and war, of birth and destruction. From the worship of this or a similar goddess by maidens in armour may have been derived the legends of the Amazons, which occupy so The Amazons. large a place in Greek mythology.1 The rites Meikart. which made the temple of Aphrodite at Corinth notorious in Greece \u2014 rites wholly opposed to Hellenic feeling about the sanctity of temples2 \u2014 find a parallel in the worship of Mylitta at Babylon. In the Melicertes, whom legend connects with the isthmus of Corinth, we can hardly mistake the Greek form of Meikart. In Attica the deme of Melite reminds us of Miletus and Mylitta, a coincidence proved to be something more than fortuitous, not only by the worship of Heracles, which was prevalent in the deme, but also by the remains of sepulchres, either of Phoenician construction, or made after Phoenician models, in the rocky ground.3 The mention of a cannibal bull at Marathon (where also Heracles was worshipped) reminds us that the Syrians represented their god Moloch in the form of a bull, and offered human sacrifices to him. With this clue to guide us, we can hardly refuse to connect the fountain of Macaria at Marathon with Makar, a second form of Meikart. The cannibal bull was slain by Theseus, who also expelled the Amazons. These legendary contests are perhaps an echo of the struggle which was necessary before the Greeks could expel the foreign settlers and their inhuman rites from the land. In Euboea, it is true, the traces of the Phoenicians are less distinct ; but the ores of copper and iron which abounded in the island, and the purple fish which swarmed in the adjacent sea, were not likely to escape the keen eye of the trader. 1 It is, however, doubtful whether that mode of worship came direct from Syria. - Herod, ii. 64, i. 199. The Corinthian deity on the Acropolis was clad in armour, like the Cytheraean (Paus. ii. 4, 7). For the Hierodules, see Strabo, 378 ff., 559 ; Athenaeus, p. 573 ff. ; Pind. Frag. 99, Bergk, iii. 3 For an account of these sepulchres, see Curtius and Kaupert, Atlas von Athen, vi., vii."], [70, "PHOENICIAN SETTLEMENTS: THEBES. [II. 14. 52 From the Phoenicians the Euboeans at an early age learned the working of metal ; they are said to have been the first in Greece to manufacture bronze armour, and the name of the .city Chalcis is a proof of the importance of copper in early Euboean history. If the island was once called Porphyra, that name, like the Porphyrion of Attic legend, must be connected with the production of purple dye.1 Thebes in Boeotia was probably the most important and the most lasting settlement of the Phoenicians on the mainland Thebes a Phoeni- \u00b0f Greece. Here they left the sea-coast, and cian settlement, built, not a fortress only, but a city. In Greek legend Thebes is founded by Cadmus, and through historical times the Acropolis was known as the Cadmea. Here Cadmus had celebrated his marriage with Harmonia, a legend which has been explained by comparison with Semitic mythology. Here, it was said, Heracles was born, who, as we have seen, often represents the Baal of Syria. The gates of Thebes were seven \u2014 a number sacred among Semitic nations. The ruins or remains of Thebes yield but few results to exploration, for the subsequent fortunes of the city tended to obliterate the traces of the founders and the earliest inhabitants. But the Greeks believed that Cadmus brought the use of letters to Thebes, and in the days of Herodotus there were ancient inscriptions in that city, which, in his opinion, represented the original form of the letters. Whether the existence of writing in Greece can be carried back to the Phoenician immigrants is yet unproved. The earliest forms of the Greek letters with which we are acquainted are not found in Boeotia. There is, however, no reason to doubt that in this instance the feeling which gave rise to the legend is founded on a fact. The names Cadmus, Cadmea, Cadmeans cling to Thebes from the earliest times ; and we seem to be justified in connecting the words with the Phoenician Cadmon, \" the aged one,\" or \"the Oriental.\"2 1 For Chalcis, see Strabo, p. 445 ff. ; Duncker, Hist. Greece, i. p. 69. 2 Duncker, l.c. i. 70 ; Busolt, Griech. Geschich. i. p. 51, takes another view. Cf. E.

In Cyprus and Crete the oriental names of the Phoenicians in cities are but slightly disguised in their Greek the islands. dress. Thus in Cyprus we find Cittium (Chittim), Amathus (Hamath), Paphos (Paphia), Salamis (Sillumi), and the an tiquity of the settlements is shown by the Isles of cyPrus peculiar alphabet in use on the island. In aud Crete. Crete we find Coerate (Karath), Itanus (Ethanath), Libena (Leben). The highest mountain summit in Rhodes was Atabyris, in which we recognise the Syrian word Tabor. This evidence is confirmed by what we know of the religious rites practised in the islands, and the deities worshipped in them. Cyprus, even in Homer, is a favourite abode of Aphrodite ; at Paphos she had \" a precinct and an altar of incense.\" The women of Cyprus wor shipped the goddess by sensual practices such as prevailed at Corinth and Babylon. Crete is the home of the Minotaur, the fire-breathing bull, which devours children (in Hebrew history children are made to pass through the fire to Moloch) ; the same island is also the home of Daedalus, in whom we seem to have a personification of the artistic skill of the Phoenicians. Minos, in the eyes of Greek historians and philosophers, was a great conqueror and lawgiver ; he drove out the Carians from the islands of the Aegean, and gave the Cretans their political institutions. But the name cannot be separated from the similar word Minoa, which occurs on the peninsula of Greece and in Sicily, and appears to be of Semitic origin. From Rhodes and Crete the Phoenicians spread to Thera and Melos, where we find indubitable evidence of their existence, in tombs and in pottery. In Thera they doubtless found the native population which has already been mentioned. Other islands of the Cyclades in which we have traces of the Phoenicians are Oliarus, Cimolus and Ceos.1 1 For the islands, see Duncker, Hist. Ant. ii. 60; Busolt, I.e.; Bent, Cyclades; Maspero, Hist. Anc. p. 250."], [72, "PHOENICIANS IN THE WEST OF GREECE. [II. 14. 54 Even in the west of Greece, and Peloponnesus, there are traces of an Oriental population which was probably Phoenician. On the Acarnanian coast we meet with the name Phoenicians in i \u2022 r tt i -1 the west of Phoenice, and with the worship ot Heracles.1 Greece, and _^_t in Achaea, we find the worship of Peloponnesus. \u00b0 \u2022 -n 1 \u2022 1 Aphrodite Urania. At Patrae, which was the chief seat of the manufacture of byssus or cotton, a rare and valuable article among the Greeks, the women, as we are told by Pausanias, were more than double the number of the men, and were \" devoted to the worship of Aphrodite.\"2 At Patrae also burnt sacrifices were offered each year to Artemis Laphria, and in the neighbourhood there was a temple of Artemis Triclaria, at which, according to the legend, human sacrifices had once been the custom. The whipping of boys before the altar of Artemis Orthia at Sparta may be the last relic of human sacrifices such as the Phoenicians offered. The youthful Hyacinthus, in whose honour the Hyacinthia were celebrated at Amyclae, was the Greek counterpart of the Syrian Adonis. At Olympia we find a Zeus Apomyius \u2014 a lord of flies ; 3 and Macariae, in the neighbourhood of Megalopolis, reminds us of Makar. As the worship of Aphrodite and the offering of human sacrifices are known to have been practised by the Semitic nations, it is possible, though by no means certain, that these customs have been brought into Greece, at least in some instances, by a nation of Semitic race. The conclusion becomes more pro bable when we find such rites connected with places or names which can be explained as Phoenician. On the other hand, every student of anthropology is aware that human sacrifices and sensual rites are not confined to the Semitic races, and that we may have in them a relic of some yet older races once domiciled in Greece, or of a barbaric age in the life of the Greek nation. 1 Eugen Oberhummer, Die Phoenizien in Acarnania ; Munchen, 1SS2. 2 Paus. vii. 21, 14. 3 Ibid. vii. 18, 8 ; vii. 19, I ; v. 14, 1."], [73, "II. IS-] ANCIENT CONNECTION WITH EGYPT. 55 Whatever may have been the extent of their settlements on the mainland of Greece, the Phoenicians did not succeed in obtaining a permanent hold of the country. How the Greeks were enabled to resist amalgamation with these aliens, who in material civilisation were far their superiors, we do not know; but what evidence we have seems to warrant the con clusion that, in a period before the dawn of Western history, the Phoenicians were expelled from the peninsula of Greece and the northern islands of the Aegean, by the nation to whom we owe the gift of Hellenic civilisation, poetry and thought. V.\u2014 GREECE AND EGYPT. 15. In the legends of Argos we find traces of an ancient connection between Greece and Egypt. Io, the daughter of Inachus, the Argive river and king, is driven from her home to seek shelter in Egypt, where she brings Egypt and forth her son Epaphus. From Epaphus were Argos. descended two brothers \u2014 Danaus, the father of fifty daughters, and Aegyptus, the father of fifty sons. When the sons of Aegyptus desire their cousins in marriage, Danaus, with his daughters, crosses the sea and takes refuge in Argos, his ancestral home. In one version of the legend, the sons overtake the daughters and marry them, but all, save one, perish on the marriage night by the hands of their brides ; in another version, Pelasgus, the king of Argos, takes the Danaids under his protection, and saves them from their pursuers. This legendary contact is sometimes thought to be confirmed by certain names which occur in Egyptian monuments : Uinim = Ionians, in the lists of Thothmes III. (1450 B.C.) and Sethos 1.; Akaiwasha= Achaeans, in the lists of Menephtah (1320 B.C.); Danau=Danai, Pulishta\u2014 Pelasgians, in the list of Rameses ill. (11 SO B.C.) ; and by the style of the ornaments discovered at Mycenae and Orchomenus.

Herodotus is never weary of identifying Greek and Egyptian deities. Even Plato finds a simi- larity between the earliest forms of society in Greece and the Egyptian castes, and, while preserving the \" autochthony \" of the Athenians, identifies Athena with the Saitic Neith.1 The question is one of chronology. That the Greeks settled in Egypt after the time of Psammetichus is a historical fact beyond all dispute.

With regard to the evidence which the monuments are supposed to furnish in the names previously quoted, it is urged, on the other side, that \" Uinim \" means \"islands,\" not \"Ionians,\" and that the nations which are identified with Achaeans, Danaans and Pelasgians are included among the circumcised nations in the Egyptian lists, so that it is no longer possible to think of them as Hellenic.2 Greek ships may have been driven to the shore of the Delta, and Ionian mercenaries may have taken service in the Egyptian army in very early times, but it is highly im probable that any Egyptian colonists settled in Greece.

MIGRATIONS AND LEGENDARY HISTORY. I. Thucydides, whose brief preface contains the best account which we possess of the early history of his country, Movements in tells us that for a long time Hellas was in Early Greece. a state of disturbance, the population of the various districts paying little attention to the tillage of the soil, and preferring to live by plunder, or to migrate, when opportunity offered, into a territory more fruitful than their own. The best parts of the country were overrun by succes sive waves of invaders, and it was only in the more inacces sible or the less productive regions that the inhabitants remained in secure possession of their lands. In Attica, at least, owing to the poverty of the soil, the population remained unchanged from all antiquity \u2014 a state of security and peace which attracted thither a large number of those who had been driven out of other parts of Hellas. In this manner the number of the inhabitants of Attica rapidly increased until an outlet was found in the colonisation of Asia.1 About the details of these migrations we have little infor mation which can be called historical. The general direction in which they moved was from north to south, and it is possible that the first impulse may have proceeded from the pressure of hordes beyond the northern limits of Greece. Herodotus speaks of a great incursion of Mysians and Teucrians into Europe in times anterior to the Trojan war. These tribes crossed the Bosphorus, reduced all the Thracians to subjection, and penetrated to the south as far as the Peneus. 1 Thuc. i. 2."], [77, "III. i.] EARLY MIGRATIONS: THESPROTIANS, cVc. 59 But the movement which led to the greatest changes of the population in the peninsula, was the irruption of the Thespro tians over Mount Pindus into Thessaly.1 At this T . Irruption of the time, we are told, Ihessaly was known as Aeolis, Thesprotians and the country was inhabited by a number lnt0 Thessaly of different tribes. Arnaeans dwelt on the Curalius, Hes tiaeans on the upper Peneus ; Pelasgians and Lapithae on the lower river. Perrhaebians were settled under Mount Olympus ; Magnetes on Mount Pelion ; Achaeans and Aenians on Mount Othrys ; Dorians and Dolopians dwelt on Mount Pindus. A large proportion of these tribes was expelled by the invaders. The Arnaeans, passing to the south, succeeded in conquering Boeotia.2 The Hestiaeans found a refuge in the north of Euboea. The Pelasgi and Lapithae retired to Attica, where at a later time some of the leading families claimed to be of Lapithan descent. The Minyae, who had long been established in the south of Thessaly at Iolcus, and at Orchomenus in Boeotia, were compelled to give way before the invaders. Their power had already suffered from the growth of Thebes, and they had lost their position as the leading race in Boeotia. Now they were entirely expelled. Some colonised Lemnos and Imbros ; others migrated to the lower Eurotas, where they aided the Achaeans in their resistance to the Spartans. The inhabitants of the more mountainous districts (Perrhaebians, Magnetes, and Achaeans), whatever their loss of territory may have been, were not entirely expelled from their homes, with one exception. The Dorians, who dwelt in Hestiaeotis, on the slopes The Return of of Pindus, were driven to the south, and thus the Heraclids. entered on the series of migrations, which the Greeks embodied in the story of \" The Return of the Heraclids.\" 1 Herod, vii. 176. This is equivalent to an invasion from Dodona, for in the time of Herodotus the Thesprotians dwelt round Dodona. Strabo, p. 328 ; Busolt, l.c. p. 46, n. 5. 2 This at least is the account which Thucydides (i. 12) has preserved, though it is at variance with epic legends, and unconfirmed by the local tradition of the country."], [78, "\"RETURN OF THE HERACLIDS.\" [III. 2. 60 2. Heracles, there is reason to believe (see p. 50), is a Grecian counterpart of a Phoenician deity. He was born at Thebes, where the Phoenicians established themselves in the north of Greece. When mythology had transformed him into a beneficent hero, by whose labours Hellas was rescued from monsters and tyrants, the chiefs of the Dorian conquerors of Peloponnesus attempted to give him a place in their genealogy. Thus Heracles, though born at Thebes, is of Argive parentage ; though the legitimate heir of the throne of Argos, he is kept from his inheritance, and his descendants also, until, after the lapse of generations, they are enabled by the assistance of the Dorians, to regain it. The whole legend of the \" Return,\" which is not mentioned in Homeric poetry, is an invention designed to justify the conquest of Peloponnesus and confirm the Dorians in the possessions which they had won by the sword. Even Laconia and Messenia, regions of Peloponnesus which do not form a part of the inheritance of Heracles, are spoken of in the legend as con quests which the hero had \" deposited \" with Tyndareus and Nestor.1 Amphitryon, the son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns,slew his uncle and father-in-law Electryon, in a quarrel about oxen, and, hav ing thus fallen under the pollution of blood, he was compelled to leave the country. The vacant throne passed to Sthenelus, king of Argos, who by the death of Electryon also received the throne of Mycenae.2 At Thebes, whither Amphitryon retired, Heracles and his wife Alcmena brought forth Heracles. On Eurystheus. the same day a son, Eurystheus, was born to Sthenelus; and as Zeus had promised sovereignty to the child which should first see the light on that day, Hera in subtlety hastened the birth of Eurystheus. Thus Heracles was, from the beginning, destined to be the servant of Eurystheus. 1 Paus. ii. 18, 7; Apollodorus ii. 7, 3. 2 This is a device to account for the position of Agamemnon in the Homeric poems, and of Argos in the Dorian tradition. What the real relation between Argos, Mycenae, and Tiryns was, it seems impossible to ascertain."], [79, "III. 3d \"RETURN OF THE HERACLIDS.\" 61 When he was dead, Eurystheus, not content with imposing ceaseless labours upon the father, sought to persecute and slay the children. They fled for refuge to Attica, where Eurystheus was killed in the effort to take them. He was succeeded on the throne of Mycenae (Argos) by Atreus, of the race of Pelops. Hyllus, the eldest of the sons of Heracles, who had been adopted by Aegimius, the Dorian chief, attempted to regain his dominions by force, but he was slain in single combat by Echemus of Tegea. His descendants were Cleodaeus and Aristomachus, both of whom made unsuccess ful endeavours to return to Peloponnesus. But in the fourth generation Temenus, Cresphontes and Aristodemus, the three sons of Aristomachus, with the aid of the Aetolian Oxylus, succeeded in crossing the Corinthian Gulf at \u201e \u201e . ~ , The Dorian Rhium.

Argos was ceded to Temenus, as the eldest son; for Messenia lots were cast, and by an act of treachery the country was secured for Cresphontes. Sparta fell to Aristo demus, who almost immediately died, leaving twin sons, from whom were descended the two lines of the Spartan kings. 3. The nucleus of this legend, down to the time when the Dorians entered Peloponnesus, is given in a sentence of Herodotus, who tells us that the Hellenic race had under gone many wanderings; in the time of Deucalion The Account it dwelt in Phthiotis; in the time of Dorus, the of Herodotus. son of Hellen, in the region called Hestiaeotis, under Ossa and Olympus.- When driven out of Hestiaeotis by the Cadmeans, it dwelt in Pindus, and was called Macednian; from thence it removed into Dryopis, and finally into Pelo ponnesus, where it received the name Dorian.1 What we can accept as historical is the fact that the Dorians removed from Hestiaeotis into the territory lying between Oeta and Parnassus, to which, after expelling the Dryopian inhabitants, they gave their own name. Here they founded four cities or 1 Herod, i. 56 ; viii. 43, with Stein's notes."], [80, "62 THE ACCOUNT OF HERODOTUS. [III. 3- communities \u2014 Pindus, Erineus, Boeum and Cytinium, from which they issued forth to join the Aetolians in an invasion of Peloponnesus. The identification of the Dorians with the Hellenes made it necessary to carry them back to Phthiotis, the home of Deucalion. In placing Hestiaeotis under Ossa and Olympus, Herodotus appears to have con founded Hestiaeotis with Pelasgiotis. Hestiaeotis is not in the north-east, but in the north-west of Thessaly, on the eastern slopes of Mount Pindus. The Cadmeans, of whom the historian speaks, are merely the Illyrian tribe of the Encheleis, who claimed descent from Cadmus, and had offered a refuge to the Cadmeans (Phoenicians) when expelled from Thebes by the Epigoni. The settlement of the Dorians in Pindus is difficult to explain. We must suppose that this, as the most important city of the four Dorian communities, is alone mentioned. In another passage, when speaking of the same migration, Herodotus unites Pindus and Erineus. Of the name Macednian no explanation can be given. The legend of the Return of the Heraclids attempts to disguise the fact that the conquest of Peloponnesus by the The robabie Dorians was due in a large measure to the course of these co-operation of the Aetolians. Oxylus, the Aetolian, is indeed the guide who conducts the Dorians into their new home, but the possession of the most fertile portion of the peninsula by the Aetolians is explained as the result of fraud, the invading army being led through Elis in the night to prevent them from perceiving the excellence of the soil. We can hardly doubt that the Aetolians formed the main body of the immigrants, who by their superior numbers were able to secure for themselves the fertile plain of the Peneus. It was by their assistance that the Dorians were able to enter Peloponnesus at the outlet of the Corinthian Gulf, after failing in their attempts to penetrate it by way of the isthmus. The Dorians, on the other hand, so far as we can follow their movements, seem to have established themselves at Stenyclarus, among the mountains which command the upper plain of the Pamisus."], [81, "III. 3.] DORIAN CONQUEST OF SPARTA &= ARGOS. 63 The old inhabitants were not driven out, but compelled to submit to the authority of Cresphontes, and to divide the land with the Dorians. From Steny- The Dorians clarus, the Dorians spread in a south-westerly in Messenia. direction to Pylus, which, under Nestor and his descendants, had become the capital of Messenia. Passing from Messenia to the east, the Dorians next descended into the valley of the Eurotas, and settled at Sparta. Their success here is said to have been due to the treachery of Philonomus, who received Amyclae in return for his services. Here, also, we are told, the inhabitants of the country were for a time admitted to equal rights with the Dorian conquerors. Unable to force their way further down the river, the Dorians passed over the range of Parnon to the east, and attacked Argos, the oldest and most important city in Peloponnesus. The ancient home of the Pelopids did not succumb without a struggle. The Dorians are said to have established themselves in the so-called Temenium, a fortress on the coast, which enabled them to cut off all communication between Argos and the sea. Legend relates that the wives and children of the Achaeans fell into the hands of the Dorians, who were thus in a position to dictate their own terms. From the existence of a fourth tribe at Argos (the Hyrnethians), and the difficulties with which legend surrounds the reign of Temenus, it is highly probable that at Argos, as in Messenia, the original inhabi tants were able to secure some recognition. Argos was assigned in the legend to Temenus, the eldest of the three brothers who led the invaders, partly owing to the ancient renown of the city, and partly because it was the first to rise to distinction after it had passed into the hands of the Dorians. From Argos, the invaders in the next generation extended their conquests among the Ionian and Achaean cities in the north-east of Peloponnesus. Corinth, which North-eastem was even at this time an important seat of Peloponnesus. commerce, was captured, as Argos had been captured, by means of a fortress established on the sea-coast. Mount"], [82, "[III. 3- 64 DORIANS CONQUER CORINTH, cVc. Solygeus, on the bay of Cenchreae, about nine miles distant from the city, offered a commanding position. The leader of the conquering army was Aletes, a descendant of Heracles. The kings of Corinth, Doridas and Hyanthidas, are said to have made favourable terms for themselves, while the com mon people were expelled from the country. As there were eight tribes at Corinth, of which only three were Dorian, we may assume that the ancient inhabitants of the city formed the larger, if the less influential part of the community, even Epidaurus, after the conquest. In like manner Epidaurus, Troezen, etc. Troezen, Aegina, Sicyon and Phlius fell into the hands of the Dorians. In most cases legend covers the conquests of the cities by some supposed compact between the old rulers and the new. In Sicyon the old inhabitants continued to form a fourth tribe, the Aegialeis. The city of Epidaurus is said to have been ceded to Deiphontes, the husband of Hyrnetho and son-in-law of Temenus, by Pity reus, a descendant of Ion. It was in consequence of the cruel treatment of Deiphontes by his brothers-in-law, the sons of Temenus, who suspected him of aiming at the throne of Argos, that Epidaurus separated from the rest of Argolis 1 (infra, p. 90 ff.). The Achaeans who had been driven out of Argolis retired, under the guidance of Tisamenus, the son of Orestes, to the 1 Such is the legend in its most common, perhaps its Laconian, form. It is highly improbable that the invasion was carried on in an uniform manner with a steady progress to the east. We hear (see infra, ch. vi. ) of the Spartans under Sous at Cleitor, under Eurypon at Mantinea, under Charilaus at Tegea ; if not mere fictions, these legends would prove the presence of the Dorians in the north of Arcadia before they spread to the south. In any case it is highly probable that they came to Argos from their original home by sea, in the same manner as the Dryopians came to Asine and Hermione. There is nothing to prove that they came over the ridge of Parnon to the shore, and from thence to the Temenium. On the other hand, it is difficult to see that the roads which have been discovered between Mycenae and Corinth prove anything for the advance of the Dorians from Corinth to the south. Mycenae is a city of the past, even at the time of the Dorian migration. We cannot suppose that the Dorians built it to break the connection of Argos aud Corinth. See Busolt, l.c. p. 61 ff."], [83, "III. 4.] GREEK MYTHS AND LEGENDS. 65 northern coast of the peninsula, in which, when they had ex pelled the Ionians of the shore (Aegialeis), they established a dodecapolis. The Ionians, in their turn, sought refuge in Attica, which had already become the home of various fugi tives from the north and the west. 4. The early history of the nations over which this stream of conquest passed, was related in a number of legends, of which many have been preserved by Apollo dorus, Pausanias and other writers. We cannot affirm of any of these that they are certainly true, and of many it is evident that they are fictions, invented to explain the events of later history. Others again became the theme of epic story, and the incidents in them have been doubtless \"exaggerated after the manner of poets.\" On the stories, as I relate them, I shall make some criticisms, to which I will prefix a few remarks on the nature of Greek myths and legends. In a people of lively imagination, and fettered by no canons of historical criticism, it is inevitable that a number of legends should spring up, and take the place of any historical account of the early history of the nation. Among the Greeks, every city and every village possessed legends of the past which were accepted with unhesitating confidence ; every family of distinction was connected with a heroic ancestor, whose existence was satisfactorily proved by the descendants whom he had left behind. In the beginning the gods had visited the earth in the likeness of men, and by mortal mothers had become the progenitors of sons whose achievements were more than human. The places which had been rendered sacred by these divine visitors were recorded in local legends ; the deeds of their descendants were extolled by minstrels and cherished by posterity. Later ages turned with delight to the memorials and patterns of a nobler life ; and, though the difficulties and contradictions presented by the legends became more apparent with the growth of historical criticism, it was long before the Greeks lost their belief in the reality of a past so flattering to their pride, and so congenial to their habits of thought. VOL. 1. E"], [84, "LEGENDS AND HISTORY. [III. 4. 66 To the modern historian these legends are a source of great perplexity. If he rejects them entirely, he must renounce Legends and tne attempt to give a picture of the early Greek History, history and civilisation of Hellas. If he accepts them, he is compelled to relate numbers of stories, which have no historical value as a record of incidents. If he attempts to sift them, and distinguish the true from the false, he is in danger of being misled by some theory about the origin of myths, or by want of sufficient information about each story. Or he may confuse the real meaning of a myth with the use which the Greeks made of it. Even if it be true that Achilles is a form of the \" solar deity,\" it is not less true that the Greeks thought of him as a hero who fell in their cause, in a place with which they were acquainted, and at a time which they endeavoured to fix. Amid the uncertainty which prevails about the origin of myths and legends, it seems true that no one mode of explaining them can be safely adopted to the exclusion of others. Greek myths at any rate are com pounded of many elements, inextricably blended together. If we cannot succeed in distinguishing them, we must be content to indicate the sources from which these elements are derived. Many myths arise out of the personification of natural phenomena, the alternations of storm and sunshine, of day Origin of Myths and night, of growth and decay being repre and Legends. sensed as the struggles of contending powers. In an early stage of mental development force and life are always regarded as personal qualities; the dawn, the Partly Solar sun, the night are persons, male or female, or Atmospheric. g00(i or bad, friendly or hostile. Out of the actions of these persons arise stories, which in the first in stance expressed natural phenomena, but in the course of time became stories only, the names being separated from the phenomena out of which they arose. They are some times shocking in their obscenity, because they are en gendered in minds which were without ideas of decency and morality. They are often unintelligible, until we discover a similar story current among a people where it is, as it were,"], [85, "III. 4.] ORIGIN OF MYTHS. 67 at home, and easily explained. An instance of such a story is the myth of Uranus and Cronus, related by Hesiod. As a product of Hellenic civilisation it is unintelligible ; but, when we compare it with other s\"tories of a similar nature current among savage nations, we find that it carries us back to a time when the sky and the earth were regarded as pressing upon each other in close contact, so that the creatures living upon the earth were repressed by the incumbent weight. When Uranus (Heaven) came with Night desiring to embrace Gaea (Earth), Cronus put forth his hand and made the union impossible. Thus Heaven and Earth were sundered, and there was room for their offspring to flourish. The legend of Cronus and the deception practised upon him by Rhea belongs to a similar stage of civilisation.1 When the origin of these stories was forgotten, they were developed in various ways, and often received additions which sprang from quite another source ; or they were localised in particular districts (as the story of the birth of Zeus was localised in Crete), and made to agree with their surroundings. Another source from which myths have arisen is the belief that men were descended from animals, or could be changed by magic into the shape of animals. _. _ ,. . . 0 J o r The Belief in One of the earliest kings of Arcadia was the Connection Lycaon, whom Pausanias ventures to regard as \u00b0f Men, and J \u00b0 Animals. a contemporary of Cecrops. Lycaon taught men to live in cities and to celebrate festivals ; but he was also the first to introduce human sacrifices into Arcadia. On 1 Sir John Lubbock (Origin of Civilisation, p. 329) thinks that we get rid of the unpleasant grossness of myths by referring them to an atmospheric origin. \"As the sun destroys the darkness from which it springs, and at evening disappears in the twilight, so Oedipus was fabled to have killed his father aud then married his mother. In this way the whole of that terrible story may be explained as arising not from the depravity of the human heart, but from a mistaken applica tion of the statements \u2014 that the sun destroys the darkness and ulti mately marries, as it were, the twilight from which it springs.\" But how did men come to make so shocking a story out of such innocent matters as the sunrise and the sunset ?

For this cruel act he was changed into a wolf, and ever afterwards, at this feast of Zeus, men might be changed into wolves. If they ate no human flesh when in that form, they were restored at the end of ten years to their human shape. Callisto, the daughter of Lycaon, was changed into a bear, and was placed in the heavens after her death. By a similar metamorphosis, Cadmus and Harmonia became serpents. A legend related that, when the Arcadians and Eleans were about to engage in battle, a woman presented herself to the Elean commanders with a child at her breast, which she offered to them as an ally. The child was laid naked between the contending armies. Suddenly he became a serpent, which so terrified the Arcadians that they fell back. The Eleans seized the opportunity, and won a com plete victory.1 Other myths have arisen out of purely local circumstances. The story of the Danaids, who were compelled for their Myths: Local misdeeds to pour water through a sieve, is ex circumstances, plained, so far as the punishment is concerned, by the nature of the soil in \" thirsty Argos.\" The streams no sooner reach the porous soil at the foot of the mountains than they disappear in the sand (p. 7). Others, again, owe . , their existence to mistakes in etymology. The Myths arise J &J from mistaken story of the death of Argos at the hands of Etymology. Hermes has probably arisen out of the epithet 'Apywp6vT-i]s applied to Hermes. The similarity between the words AiJkos (wolf), Atwios (Lycian), and the root luc (to shine), seen in lux (light), has caused confusion among deities which were originally distinct. The similarity between the first half of the word Aphrodite and dcbpos (foam), has given rise to the birth of the goddess of love from the sea \u2014 a myth as old as Hesiod. Prometheus, the fire-giver, is probably a personification of the fire-stick used by the ancient Aryans (Pramanthas) ; 2 but Prometheus the \" fore-thinker,\" the 1 Paus. vi. 20, 4. 2 Kelly, Indo-European Tradition, p. 41 ff."], [87, "III. 4.] MYTHS AND ETYMOLOGY. 69 \" inventor of memory,\" the friend of men, who taught them arts and sciences, is a Greek Titan, a great part of whose story is derived from his name. The tendency of the Greeks to represent the deities in human shape co-operated with the worship of ancestors, and possibly with the derivation of descent through females, to provide the famous families of Greece with a divine origin. This was another fertile source of legends. The mortal women who claimed to have been beloved by the gods were a numerous company. That such a parentage should be permitted in epic poetry is not unnatural. Even in historical times we find Greeks who were eager to connect themselves with a divine ancestor, after the lapse of a sufficient interval, and Alexander the Great did not scruple to claim an immediate descent from Zeus. We must also bear in mind that many distinct tribes existed side by side in early Greece. That there were inhabitants in the land before it was occupied by Aryan The influence immigrants is, as we have seen, not improbable, \u00b0f the union and even if the Aryans were the first to enter it, they would not all arrive at the same time. One horde succeeded another, and passed into new valleys separated by high mountains from their neighbours. The Aryan power of inventing stories did not come to an end with the occupation of a new country, however willing the im migrants may have been to identify the new with the old, and localise the deities, which they brought with them, in the conquered territory. Lastly, every new conquest brought with it the desire to range the deities of the conquered people with the gods of the conquerors. And at some early time which we cannot fix definitely, the Greeks came into contact with Semitic races who Semitic inhabited the islands of the Aegean, and Asia Elements. Minor. From these they could borrow and adapt a new stock of myths, working them into their own as suited their purpose, till the whole formed a complicated web which it is now vain to attempt to disentangle. Asiatic deities were identified with Hellenic, or the gods of one tribe became the"], [88, "[III. 4. 70 MYTHS AND LEGENDS. heroes of another. In this manner Greek mythology grew into a tangled mass of stories, which represented the ideas and conceptions of the early Greeks, but which are beyond our powers to explain and analyse. Even now the limits of confusion are not reached. Beside the myths which may be of purely fictitious origin, and Historical facts indissolubly connected with them, are legends in Legends. which probably arose out of historical facts. Some of the stories of which a brief account is here given will be found to contain historical incidents. The Greeks sailed to Colchis, Corcyra and Libya, whatever be the meaning of the myth of the Argonautic expedition. The works of Heracles were in existence, whether Heracles be a god, or a personification of a forgotten tribe. The inhabi tants of Attica were gathered round Athens as a central city, whether Theseus be a god or a man. This historic ele ment was often enlarged as time went on. The more various the voyages of the Greeks, the greater their knowledge of distant lands, the more complicated became the story of the ancient mariners of the Argo. To lay down general rules for the \"interpretation\" of myths is useless. Each story must be considered separately. We may, however, point out that : (1) Stories which are found with little or no alteration of their essential features in widely distant nations can hardly have had a local origin. Some incidents in the story of Jason and Medea are repeated not only in that of Theseus and Ariadne, but also in the mythology of nations wdiich have had no connection with Greece. It is improbable therefore that the legend first arose out of circumstances which occurred at Iolcus. (2) Stories which are merely a reflected image of later historical facts were probably invented to explain those facts. We shall find an instance of this in the early history of Elis. (3) Stories which are supported by later customs and rites probably con tain some element of historical truth.

Among the remarkable legends of Thessaly are those of the Centaurs and Lapithae, whose fierce conflict at the marriage of Pirithous supplied a theme of never-ending interest for artist and poet. The Centaurs are repre sented as wild creatures \u2014 half man, half horse, monsters of furious and unbridled lusts.

These half-human creatures are sometimes explained as personifications of the mountain torrents, which, bursting down from the hills of Thessaly, spread destruction over the rich plains beneath. The horse is regarded as a symbol of the swift course of running water, and the weapons which the Centaurs use, stones and branches, denote the devastation caused by swollen streams.

Not only was their chief Pirithous the friend of the great Attic hero Theseus, but at a later time, when expelled from Thessaly, many Lapithae found a refuge at Athens, and be came the ancestors of Athenian families. By what appears to be a strange inconsistency, the legend does not regard all the Centaurs as barbarous. Chiron, the eldest Centaur Chiron. , ., . . f . . -. of the race, was a pattern of wisdom and temperance, skilled in music and the art of medicine, the teacher of Achilles. To us such a figure recalls the fiction of the \" noble savage,\" but in the Greek legend it may be some echo of a forgotten civilisation. Or, if the explanation of the Centaurs as personifications of the mountain torrents be accepted, the good Centaur may represent the rivers regarded as beneficent fertilising forces. It is remarkable that the Centaur Chiron claimed a different parentage from the rest. They were descended from Ixion and Nephele, but he is the child of Zeus and Philyra. Expelled from Thessaly for their violence, the Centaurs finally perished at the hands of Heracles.1 In the south of Thessaly was the town of Iolcus, whence the Argo sailed to recover the Golden Fleece which had been carried away to Colchis. There is, per- haps, no story which illustrates in a more striking manner the way in which the Greeks enlarged their legends as time went on. In their earliest form some incidents in the voyage of the Argo may perhaps have arisen out of solar phenomena ; it is, at any rate, the Island of the Sun to which the voyage is directed. To the Greeks the myth becomes an event of history, which is localised at a definite place. The island is placed at Colchis, in the furthest east. Jason, the 1 II. i. 263 ff. ; Od. xx. 295 ff.

He is bidden to recover the Golden Fleece from Aeetes, king of Colchis. For this enter prise he summons heroes from all parts of Hellas, but more especially the Minyae, the princely race who were dominant in southern Thessaly and at Orchomenus in Boeotia. After many adventures, the Argonauts return with the prize, which Jason has won with the aid of Medea, the king's daughter. On the way they have colonised Lemnos, which was ever afterwards regarded as a home of the Minyae. But Jason has brought back more than the fleece. He has wedded Medea, a woman skilled in sorcery beyond any other in Greek legend. Pursued by her father, they escaped by a cruel expedient ; when Jason found that the king was near at hand, at Medea's suggestion he cut in pieces her brother, the boy Apsyrtus, and strewed the fragments on the waves, that Aeetes might be delayed in collecting them. Jason does not remain in Iolcus ; he visits Corinth, where he abandons Medea for the king's daughter. Medea, in revenge, slays not only her own children, but also the new bride and her father, after which she escapes in the chariot of the Sun to her own land. Another form of the legend carries Jason and Medea to Corcyra, and in yet another form, they travel to the Tritonian lake in Libya. It is obvious that some of the details of the story could only have been added when the Greeks were acquainted with the Euxine, and could identify the eastern end of it with the island of Aeetes. The con nection of the story with Corinth is perhaps due, in the first instance, to the worship of Helius on Acrocorinthus ; but it was not till Corcyra and Sicily were known to Hellenic mariners that Trinacria could become the Island of the Sun, or Jason and Medea be transplanted to Corcyra. Though the Argo is mentioned in the Homeric poems as the theme of song, and epics were composed on the subject by Eumelus of Corinth and others, the incidents connected with the voyage were not fixed like those of the Trojan wrar. Hence they could develop more freely, until at length, in the"], [92, "74 THESSALIAN LEGENDS: HUMAN SACRIFICES. [III. 6.

It was the custom there to offer human sacri fices to Zeus Laphystius, and Athamas, king of Halus, was induced by Ino to sacrifice Phrixus, his son by a former wife. Before the rite was completed a golden ram appeared, which carried Phrixus away to Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram, and hung up the fleece as a Palladium. Subsequently Athamas was on the point of being sacrificed to Zeus in the place of Phrixus, when he, in turn, was rescued by the son of Phrixus. Thus the sacrifice still remained incomplete, and it became a custom that no one of the race of the Atha mantidae should enter the council-chamber at Halus on pain of being sacrificed to the god.2 Boeotia. 6. Two centres are distinguished in the ancient legends of Boeotia \u2014 Orchomenus and Thebes. Orchomenus stood in Two ancient close connection with the south of Thessaly, and Orchomemis- Athamas, whom we have already mentioned, and Thebes. is said to have been one of the earliest kings of the city. Eteocles, his successor, founded two tribes at Orchomenus, the Cephisiad and the Eteoclid. He was followed by Phlegyas, the eponym of the warlike Phlegyae, and Minyas, the son of Chryses, from whom the Minyae derived their name and their wealth. Pausanias tells us that Minyas was the first of men to build a treasure-house for the reception of his 1 Cf. A. Lang, Introduction to Grimm's Household Tales, p. 55 ff., and Custom and Myth, p. 94. Other views will be found in the article in Pauly's Encyclopaedia. 2 Herod, vii. 197."], [93, "III. 6.] LEGENDARY HISTORY: BOEOTIA. 75 possessions.1 To the Minyae also is ascribed the construc tion of the great tunnels which drain (or would drain if open) the low land round lake Copais (see supra, p. 6). Minyas was succeeded by Orchomenus, from whom the city took its name. A later king was Clymenus, who was slain by the Thebans at the festival of Poseidon. Erginus, his son, compelled the Thebans to pay a tribute as atonement for the death of his father. But Heracles liberated the Thebans, and greatly curtailed the power of Orchomenus. The sons of Erginus were Trophonius and Agamedes, of whom the second lost his life, when stealing the treasures of Hyrieus, in precisely the same manner as the thief who stole the treasures of Rhampsinitus in Egypt, while Trophonius was swallowed up in the earth on the site of his oracular cave. They were followed by Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, who led the Minyae to Troy. In the Homeric poems the Minyae are mentioned separately from the rest of the Boeotians; and Orchomenus is elsewhere mentioned as one of the cities which belonged to the Ionian Amphictyony of Calauria, a proof that it must have been the seat of an extensive maritime trade.2 It is very noticeable that the succession is constantly broken in the list of kings given by Pausanias ; it is the exception for the son to follow the father on the throne. This would seem to indicate constant strife and change of dynasty, unless, indeed, it be merely the result of piecing together families of different stocks which claimed to be ancestors of the Minyae. Thebes was founded by Cadmus, the Phoenician. Arriv ing in Greece in search of his sister Europa, he consulted the oracle of Delphi, by which he was bidden to Legends about abandon the quest, and follow a cow. On the Thebes- spot where the cow lay down he was to found a city. In this manner he was directed to the site of Thebes.

[III. 7. 76 he sacrificed to Athena Onca. When he desired to draw water from the neighbouring spring, in order to pour a libation, he found himself opposed by a serpent, who guarded Cadmus. the fountain This monster, with the aid of Pallas, he slew, and sowed the teeth in the earth. Hence sprang the Sparti, a furious race of armed warriors, who fell to slaying each other until only five remained, the founders of the five most famous families in Thebes. After eight years of purification for the slaughter which he caused, Cadmus became king of Thebes, receiving to wife Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. The wedding, like that of Peleus and Thetis, was honoured with the presence of the gods. From the union were born four daughters, famous in Greek legend for the sorrows and disasters which attended themselves and their offspring \u2014 Autonoe, the mother of Actaeon ; Agave, the mother of Pentheus ; Ino, the wife of Athamas; and Semele, the mother of Dionysus. There was also a son, Polydorus, from whom were descended Laius and Oedipus. The close of the reign of Cadmus was disturbed by troubles arising from the presence of Dionysus at Thebes. Pentheus, who, for some reason, ascended the throne in the lifetime of Cadmus, strongly opposed the rites which were introduced at Thebes by Dionysus, who, in Theban story, was the son of Zeus and Semele. Sus pecting the nature of the sacred orgies which led his mother with other women to the wilds of Cithaeron, he fol lowed the troop and watched them from a pine-tree. He was detected and torn to pieces by the infatuated women, his mother Agave being the first to rend off a limb. In distress at these disasters, Cadmus and Harmonia left Thebes for Illyria, where they were changed into serpents. 7. The citadel of Thebes was known as the Cadmea from its supposed founder. The lower city was traced to a different Zethusand origin. Zethus and Amphion were twin brothers, Amphion. sons 0f Zeus by Antiope, the daughter of Nyc teus, a Theban. When they became kings of Thebes, they"], [95, "III. 71 BOEOTIAN. LEGENDS: CADMUS. 77 fortified the city with a wall, in order to protect themselves from the attacks of the neighbours, \"for strong though they were, they could not without a wall dwell in Thebes. \" l Zethus, who is represented as a man of vast strength, gathered huge stones and ranged them in order, while the minstrel Amphion was able to move the stones by the sound of his lyre, without the need of physical touch. The gates of the city were seven, a number which is thought to indicate the Phoenician origin of the city. However this may be, it is not improbable that the name Neitae, which was given to one of the gates, has been the source of the story of Amphion and his music. Neitae was confused with nete, the lowest in order of the three strings composing the oldest form of the lyre, to which Amphion is said to have added the other four. This pair of twin brothers does not stand alone in Greek mythology; we must place beside them the more famous twins of Sparta, Castor and Pollux, and the Messenian pair, Idas and Lynceus. Counterparts have been found by com parative mythologists in the Acvins of India, the spirits of the morning light, which pierce the darkness and bring back the cheerful day. It is remarkable that the Spartan twins are in close connection with Helen ; the Theban Myths of Helen with Antiope. Both Helen and Antiope have and Antiope. been thought to be forms of the goddess of the moon. Antiope is also the daughter of Nycteus, whose brother is Lycus, names obviously connected with night and day. Even the search of Cadmus for Europa and his union with Harmonia in the west is by some explained as the Greek repetition of a Semitic myth, in which Baal, the sun-god, seeks the moon goddess in the far west, and is there united with her in marriage.2 Here then we seem to have two myths, not altogether dis tinct in origin, but arriving in Boeotia by different routes. 1 Odyssey, xi. 264, 265. 2 Duncker, Hist. Ant. ii. 58."], [96, "BOEOTIAN LEGENDS: LAWS AND 0ED1PUS. [III. 8. 78 The Greeks connected them in the following manner. Poly dorus, the son of Cadmus, left an infant son Labdacus, whom, , together with his throne, he committed at his Connection of \u00b0 , ,T the Theban death to the care of Nycteus. When Nycteus was Legends. mortally wounded in an attempt to recover his daughter Antiope from Epopeus of Sicyon, he transferred his double charge to his brother Lycus, who in due time gave up the throne to Labdacus. Labdacus died young, leaving an infant heir, Laius, of whom Lycus became guardian. At this time Zethus and Amphion appeared at Thebes with an armed force. Laius was removed to a place of safety, but Lycus was slain. Zethus and Amphion became kings of Thebes, and added the lower city to the Cadmea. When they died \u2014 Amphion in a pestilence, and Zethus through grief for his son \u2014 Laius returned to be king over Thebes.1 8. The narrative now takes a new shape, in which myth and legend are blended with ideas of destiny and an inherited curse. It was announced to Laius that if he begot a son he wrould fall by the hand of his child, who would also become the husband of his own mother. Heedless of the warning, he begot Oedipus, whom shortly after his birth he caused to be exposed, with his feet pierced and bound together, in the wilds of Cithaeron. The attempt to escape the ordinance of heaven was fruitless. Oedipus was saved by a shepherd, and conveyed to the court of Corinth. From thence he returned to Thebes, and, meeting Laius on the way, he slew him. On arriving at the city he found it suffer ing from the visitation of the Sphinx, a winged monster, who proposed a riddle to all comers, and ate those who failed to guess it. When Oedipus was successful in solving the riddle, the Sphinx destroyed herself, and the city was delivered. As a reward, he received the hand of the queen Jocasta, who was his own mother. By her, accord ing to one version of the story, he had four children, Polynices and Eteocles, Antigone and Ismene. Then the terrible secret 1 Paus. ix. 5."], [97, "III. 8.] BOEOTIAN LEGENDS: CONQUEST BY ARNAEANS.^ came out. Oedipus blinded himself. Jocasta took her own life. When the sons grew up, Oedipus, enraged at some slight, pronounced his curse upon them. They The Sons of quarrelled, and Polynices, the elder brother, was Oedipus. driven out of Thebes. He repaired to Argos, whence, with the help of Adrastus, he returned with six chieftains to recover the throne. At each of the seven gates the battle raged, Eteocles meeting Polynices in person. The assault failed; all the chieftains, with the exception of Adrastus, were slain, and the twro brothers fell each by the hand of the other. In the next generation the attack was renewed by the Epigoni, or sons of the heroes, who succeeded in restoring Thersander, the son of Polynices, to the throne of Thebes. J 7 Thersander Thersander was succeeded by his son Tisamenus. and his Owing to his 3routh, Tisamenus was unable to descendants. take the command of the Boeotian forces before Troy, which were therefore intrusted to Peneleos.1 Autesion, the son and successor of Tisamenus, was warned by an oracle to join the Dorians, in order to escape the divine wrath, which still pursued the race of Labdacus. In his place Damasichthon, the son of Opheltas and grandson of Peneleos, was chosen king. In the time of Xanthus, the grandson of Damasichthon, the Boeotians invaded Attica ; but their chieftain fell in single combat by the hand of Melanthus, or, in another version, of Andropompus, and the invasion proved fruitless.2 Thucydides states quite definitely that Boeotia was invaded by the Arnaeans from the north, in the sixtieth year after the fall of Troy. But the Homeric Catalogue speaks conquest of of Arnaeans as dwelling in the land at the time Boeotia by when the expedition sailed to Troy.3 This Arnaeans contradiction caused the utmost difficulty to later writers. In 1 Peneleos was an Argonaut, and one of the suitors of Helen, quite unconnected with the royal family of Thebes.

In this manner the conquest of the country by invaders is veiled, and the presence of the Boeotians at Troy under a prince who was not the reigning monarch is explained. Strabo unites the conquerors and Strabo's account. ,. . . ,. T .-, the conquered in another manner. In the earliest times Boeotia was inhabited by a number of barbarian tribes, Aones, Temmices who came from Sunium, Leleges and Hyantes. Subsequently it was acquired by the Phoenicians under Cadmus, who built the citadel and founded the king dom. His descendants added Thebes to the Cadmea, and main tained their power, most of the Boeotians being their subjects, till the war of the Epigoni. Then they were driven out for a time, but afterwards they returned. On a second occasion they were expelled by the Thracians and Pelasgians ; and for a considerable time they lived in Thessaly, where they formed one power with the Arnaeans. About the time when the Aeolian host was gathering at Aulis, under the sons of Orestes, in order to sail to Asia, they returned, united the district of Orchomenus to Boeotia, and, with their combined forces, drove out the Pelasgians to Athens and the Thracians to Parnassus. When these conquests were ended many of the Boeotians took part in the Aeolian colonisation of Asia.1 In this account also, the fact of the conquest of Boeotia by a nation issuing from the north is concealed. The Cadmeans and Arnaeans are a united people who move southwards about the time of the Aeolian migration, the Cadmeans having pre viously joined the Arnaeans in Thessaly.2 Another passage in Strabo enables us to trace more precisely the southward 1 Strabo, 401, who, no doubt, follows Ephorus.

There the invaders established a shrine of Athena Itonia, which always remained the central point of meeting for the Boeotians, the seat of the great festival of the Pam boeotia. Then Orchomenus fell, and in the next generation Thebes was conquered.2 Whatever may be the historical truth concealed in these legends, there is no doubt that it was asserted, on authority wdiich satisfied Thucydides, that Boeotia passed into the hands of the Arnaeans two generations after the Trojan war. Previous to this event the country may have been divided between two powers \u2014 the Minyae at Orchomenus, and the Cadmeans at Thebes, between which there were constant feuds. After the con quest Orchomenus ceased to be a great power. Thebes became the leading city, though she never attained to universal do minion. A further attempt to invade Attica was defeated. With the failure of common enterprises, the Boeotians ceased to act in common, and the leader of the host could no longer claim the authority of a king. Of the territories which separated Boeotia from Thessaly there is little to relate. Four generations before the Trojan war, so ran the legend, the Locrians, who had Locris hitherto been a united nation, were separated into Doris. two parts, an eastern and a western. No reason is pho\u00abs given for the separation, and perhaps we may doubt whether the union is not a fiction. Throughout historical times the Locrians existed in two distinct communities, one of which bordered on the Euripus, the other on the Corinthian gulf. Between the two lay Doris, the country in which the Dorians paused in their way to Peloponnesus from Thessaly and Phocis. Phocis was rendered famous by the worship of 1 Strabo, p. 411. - This legendary history is to some extent confirmed by the evi dence of names ; there was a river Curalius in Thessaly and in Boeotia, and in the neighbourhood of each a shrine of Athena Itonia (Alcaeus, Frag. 3).

Eretria and Chalcis were claimed as Athenian colonies, founded before the Trojan war, and subsequently renewed by Aeclus and Cothus. This legend may have arisen after the concpiest of the island by Pericles, when it was convenient to establish some sort of hereditary claim, and the double colonisation was necessary to smooth over the con tradiction with the Catalogue* There seems no reason to Ionian in doubt that the Ionians were in possession of Euboea.

Of the conquest and change of population, if it ever happened, we have no trustworthy record.1 Attica. 10. In the earlier accounts of the ancient history of Attica we meet with four names of native kings \u2014 Cecrops, Erechtheus, Pandion and Aegeus. The Cata- Ancient Kings logue in the Homeric poems entitles Athens of Attica. the deme of Erechtheus. But in the time of Herodotus, Cecrops had taken the place of Erechtheus as the earliest king of the country ; and Ion was also included in the royal dynasty, though he never occupied the throne. Later logo graphers amplified the list of kings, partly with the intention of combining as many legends as possible, and partly in order to make arrangements which harmonised with their views of chronology. Thus we obtain the following list of early Attic kings: \u2014 Cecrops I., Erysichthon, Cranaus, Amphic tyon, Erichthonius, Pandion I., Erechtheus, Cecrops H., Pandion II. To Pandion II. were born four sons \u2014 Aegeus, Pallas, Nisus and Lycus. With the names many legends were connected. Cecrops is said to have divided the whole tract of Attica into twelve districts : Cecropia, Tetrapolis, Epacria, Decelea, cecrops divides Eleusis, Aphidnae, Thoricus, Brauron, Cythera, the country.

It is, however, remarkable that legend represents the succes sion as constantly broken : Cranaus is not the son of Erysich thon, who died without issue ; Amphictyon expelled Cranaus, and was in turn expelled by Erichthonius. The daughters of Pandion I. were Procne and Philomela, the former of whom became the wife of Tereus of Thrace. The tragic story of Philomela, Procne and Tereus is well known; it is remarkable partly for the credit given to it by Thucydides, and partly for the connection which it presupposes between Thrace and Athens. In the time of Erechtheus, the son of Pandion, a war broke out between Eleusis and Erechtheus. AthenS) in which Eumolpus of Eleusis, himself a Thracian, was greatly aided by allies from Thrace. The contest was severe. Though Athens remained victorious, Erechtheus fell in the battle. It was only by the devotion of his three daughters that success was rendered possible. In resisting the attack of the Thracians, Ion, the sonof Creusa and grandson of Erechtheus, rendered such service to the Athenians that he became general-in-chief of egen s o on. Athenian forces. Under his command they were enabled to pass beyond the limits of Attica, and give their name to the people on the northern shore of Pelopon nesus.2 The festival of the Boedromia was said to have been founded in commemoration of the aid which he rendered to the Athenians. From the four sons of Ion, legend derived the names of the four Attic tribes. Pandion the Second divided his territory between his four sons, Aegeus, Nisus, Lycus and Pallas. Aegeus received Athens and the throne, Lycus \" the garden-land opposite Euboea,\" Nisus the shore of Sciron (the Megarid), and Pallas the land in the south of Attica.3 This division, like the earlier one into twelve townships, assumes that Attica was from the first united under the sway of 1 Herod, viii. 44. 2 Herod, vii. 94. 3 Soph. ap. Strab. p. 392."], [103, "III. II.] ADVENTURES OF THESEUS. 85 Athens. Such an union is extremely improbable in itself, and is contradicted by other legends, which represent Theseus as the author of the union of Attica, inasmuch as he first per suaded or compelled the various townships in Attica to give up their independence and accept Athens as their head. On the other hand, it is highly probable that in the earliest times the Megarid, which is included in the territory of Pandion, was in close connection with Athens, and inhabited by a people of Ionian, or at any rate non-Dorian, race. II. The son of Aegeus was Theseus. He was born at Troezen, the home of his mother Aethra. At sixteen years of age he was able to remove the huge stone under which his father had placed his sword, 'ni and, with the sword as his credentials, he set out on his way to Attica.1 As he wished to make his name famous, he de termined to destroy the robbers who infested the country between Troezen and Athens \u2014 Sinnis, who slew his victims by attaching them to two pine-trees which he bent together, and allowed to fly asunder ; Sciron, who hurled them from the rocks of the isthmus into the sea ; Cercyon, who compelled them to wrestle with him, and then strangled them ; Pro crustes, who stretched them on a bed of iron, cutting off the limbs of those who were too tall and stretching the limbs of those who were too short. All these he slew, and then pre sented himself at Athens before his father. Here also he had enemies to contend with. He overcame the Pallantidae, the race of giants who sought to deprive Aegeus of a part of his kingdom, and cap- siays the Bull tured the bull which laid waste the fields of of Marathon. Marathon.

[III. II. 86 trate the labyrinth of Daedalus, in which the Minotaur was concealed. Theseus slew him, and returned with Ariadne, whom, however, he abandoned on the island of Naxos. It had been agreed that, if successful, he should furl the black sails with wdiich he set out on his mournful errand, and hoist white sails in their place. This he forgot to do, and Aegeus, who was watching on the shore for the return of the ship, on seeing the black sails, concluded that his son was lost, and plunged into the sea. Other adventures carried Theseus far beyond the limits of Attica. He took part in the hunt of the Calydonian boar, and in the recovery of the Golden Fleece. He also fought _. . against the Amazons, whom he expelled from Theseus and o ' v the Amazons, the soil of Attica, and pursued to the banks Helen, etc. of the T/hermodon. When Helen was a child, dancing at Therapne in honour of Artemis Orthia, Theseus, with the help of Pirithous, carried her away and placed her in the keeping of his mother Aethra at Aphidnae, from whence she was recovered by her brothers before Theseus could make her his wife. Then he attempted to carry off Persephone from the under-world, in concert with Pirithous. Pirithous was slain by Cerberus, and Theseus owed his escape to the aid of Heracles. On his return to Athens, he was involved in new troubles by the disastrous passion of his wife Phaedra for her step-son Hippolytus. Finally he was driven out of Attica, and retired to Scyros, where he was treacherously slain. Theseus always remained the great Attic hero, but two distinct views prevailed in legend about him. On the one hand, he is the founder of Athenian greatness \u2014 the noble and chivalrous hero in whom the Athenian type of character reaches its culmination ; on the other, he is little more than a marauding chief, of exceptional strength and power. Both legends agree in his final expulsion from Attica.

From him were descended two famous women, Leda and Althaea. The children of Althaea were Meleager and Deianira, with whom are connected two remark able Aetolian legends. Oeneus, the king of Calydon, and husband of Althaea, neglected to offer sacrifice to Artemis at the vintage festival. In revenge, the goddess sent a huge boar to ravage the lands of Calydon. But Meleager, the son of Oeneus, with the help of a number of the Curetes of Pleuron \u2014 the country is said to have been called Curetis before it was called Aetolia \u2014 succeeded in slaying the monster. A dispute followed concerning the spoils, in which Meleager slew his mother's brother, the king of Pleuron. The Curetes immediately attacked the Aetolians, to revenge the death of their king. So long as Meleager led his people, the attacks of the enemy were beaten off. But his mother Althaea imprecated bitter curses upon him for the slaughter of her brother, and Meleager, enraged at her want of affection, refused to leave his chamber and his wife Cleopatra. Only when the city was in danger of being stormed, could Cleopatra prevail on him to go out and repel the invaders. This is a brief summary of the account given in the Iliad of the famous Calydonian boar-hunt.2 It is related there for a special purpose. Agamemnon has sent envoys to Achilles beseeching him to forego his resentment, and listen to the entreaties of the Achaeans. The aged Phoenix relates the story of Meleager. Though deaf to the entreaties of father and mother, and unmoved by the prospect of ruin impending on his city and people, Meleager allowed himself to be prevailed upon by Cleopatra.

Before the birth of Meleager the Moerae announced to Althaea that her son would perish when the brand then upon the fire was reduced to ashes. Althaea preserved the brand until, in her anger at the death of her brother, she allowed it to be consumed, and Meleager perished. The hunt of the boar The calydonian 1S also extended into a national enterprise. Boar-hunt. The conspicuous figure in it is Atalanta, the Arcadian huntress, who was the first to wound the boar, which was finally slain by Meleager. Meleager assigned the spoils to her, but they were carried off by his uncles, who, as next-of-kin, claimed what Meleager renounced. Meleager slew them, and Althaea in revenge brought about the death of her son. The Greeks believed in this hunt as a historical fact. The hide and tusks of the boar were suspended in the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, where they remained till Augustus took the tusks to Rome. The skin was shown to Pausanias in the second century a.d. Near the town of Methydrium the same traveller saw the racecourse on which Atalanta had contended with her suitors. She would yield herself only to the man who surpassed her in swiftness; if defeated, the suitor must pay for his presumption with his life. With the help of Aphrodite, Milanion was enabled to succeed. She gave him three of the golden apples of the Hesperides, which he allowed to fall one by one near the maiden in the race ; Atalanta stooped to gather them, and meanwhile Milanion was victorious. The sister of Meleager was Deianira. She was sought in marriage by Achelous, the river god, who paid his court to her in various monstrous shapes. At length Heracles appeared as a rival; he defeated Achelous and carried away Deianira. When crossing the Enipeus on his way to Trachis, he allowed Deianira to be con veyed over the river by the centaur Nessus. In mid-stream Nessus offered her some rudeness, and was at once pierced by an arrow from the bank by Heracles. The dying centaur gave"], [107, "III.

After the capture of Oechalia, Heracles sent home Me, the daughter of Eurytus, under circumstances which aroused the jealousy of Deianira. She sent her husband a robe anointed with the philtre, to wear when offering sacrifice to Zeus on the Cenaean headland. Warmed by the flames, the poison ate into his flesh with intolerable pains, which death alone could end. Deianira, on hearing the result, took her own life.1 13. The hero of Acarnania is Alcmaeon. When pursued by the Furies, after the death of his mother Eriphyle, whom he had slain for her treachery to his father Amphiaraus, Alcmaeon was informed by the oracle that all the earth was closed against him except the portion which had come into existence since the murder was committed. This portion consisted of the islands at the mouth of the river Achelous, formed by the alluvial soil deposited by the river.2 Thither Alcmaeon went and found repose. His son was Acarnan, from whom the nation previously called Curetes obtained their name. Acarnania was also said, to have been originally in the possession of the Taphians and Tele boae, but afterwards Laertes of Ithaca and the inhabitants of the island of Cephallenia became masters of the country.3 The historian Ephorus asserted that the town of Argos Amphilochicum was founded by Alcmaeon, but Thucydides considered that it was founded by Amphilochus, the son of Amphiaraus, who, on his return from Troy, being dissatisfied with the position of affairs in Argos, retired with his com panions to Acarnania. Thucydides adds the remarkable statement, that the inhabitants of Argos obtained their knowledge of Greek from the Ambraciots, while the rest of the Amphilochians were barbarians.4 iSeei\u00ab/ra, p. 110. 2 Thuc. ii. 102. 3 Strabo, p. 461. 4 Thuc. ii. 68. The necessary inference is that Amphilochus and his comrades who took part in the Trojan war were themselves barbarians (supra, p. 26 ; Strabo, p. 462)."], [108, "LEGENDARY HISTORY: AETOLIA.

Till the foundation of the Corinthian colonies this part of Greece remained a terra incognita; and even afterwards it was Historical value comparatively of little importance, except for of the Legends, purposes of trade. But the cultivation of the vine by Oeneus, and the appearance of Heracles as a suitor for the hand of Deianira, combined with other mytho logical and geographical evidence, tend to show, as we have already said, that the western coast of Greece was not unknown to the Phoenician mariners. The worship of Aphrodite Aeneas on the island of Leucas and the pro montory of Actium is probably due to Phoenician settlers, and it was doubtless inconsequence of the existence of the worship of the goddess in these localities, that Aeneas is brought into connection with Epirus on his journey to Rome.1 Another point of importance is the connection which the legend presupposes between Aetolia and Elis. The epony mous hero of Aetolia is the son of Endymion, king of Elis. This legendary connection is supported by other evidence. On both sides of the Gulf of Patrae we find the same local names (e.g., Olenus), and the Calydonian Artemis was worshipped at Patrae.2 II.\u2014 LEGENDARY HISTORY OF PELOPONNESUS. Elis. 14.

Besides these tribes, the Cauconians also dwelt in Elis ; some placed them 1 The whole subject is treated at length by Eugcn Oberhummer, Phoenizien in Acarnania, Miinchen, 18S2. 2 Curtius, Pelopon. i. 411 ; infra, p. 106."], [109, "III. 14.] LEGENDS OF PELOPONNESUS: ELIS. 91 in the north near Dyme and Buprasium ; others in the south, towards Messenia; while others considered that the whole land was once known as Cauconia.1 Whether the Cauconians were expelled or absorbed by the victorious invaders, we cannot tell ; they were of no historical import ance ; their territory, which was first taken from them by the Minyae, afterwards became a part of Elis. With the help of Pausanias, we are able to give the follow ing account of the legendary history of Elis down to the time of the Aetolian invasion. The first king of the country was Aethlius, a son of Zeus and Protogenea. The son of Aethlius was Endymion. In one form of the legend, Endymion became by the Moon the father of fifty daughters; but in the version which Pausanias considers more credible, he married Asterodea, by whom he had three sons, Paeon, Aetolus and Epeus, and a daughter Eurycyde. Endymion decided the succession to the throne by a foot-race between his sons, in which Epeus was successful. Paeon retired in chagrin to the distant land known as Paeonia. Epeus took to wife Anaxirrhoe, by whom he had one daugh ter, Hyrmina, but no sons. In his reign Oenomaus, the prince of Pisa, was deposed by Pelops, the Lydian, who not only possessed himself of Pisa and Olympia, but acquired a part of the territory of Epeus. On the death of Epeus, the throne of Elis passed to his brother Aetolus. By an in voluntary act, Aetolus slew Apis, an Arcadian. It became necessary for him to leave Elis, and, as we have seen, he re tired to the region which was subsequently called after him.2 He was succeeded on the throne by Eleus, the J King Eleus. son of his sister Eurycyde, from whom the inhabitants, who were previously called Epeans, received the name of Eleans. The son of Eleus was Augeas, whose stables 1 Strabo, p. 345.

[III. 14. 92 Heracles was bidden to cleanse. Heracles accomplished the task by directing into them the stream of the river Menius, but Augeas refused the stipulated reward, and banished his son Phyleus, who desired to deal more honestly with Heracles. A quarrel now arose between Heracles and Augeas. Both sides prepared for a conflict. Augeas entered into alliance with Amarynceus, a Thessalian settled in Elis, to whom he gave a share of the kingdom, and with the sons of Actor, the grandsons of Epeus, who also had a share in the monarchy, and dwelt in the city of Hyrmina. Against this combination Heracles fought with little success. He then took advantage of the truce of the Isthmian games to lie in wait for the sons of Actor on their way to Corinth, and slay them.1 When the deed was discovered, the Eleans demanded satisfaction from the Argives, Heracles being then resident at Tiryns ; and, on the refusal of the Argives, they pressed the Corinthians to exclude the Argives from the Isthmian games. This request being also refused, the Eleans bound themselves by a solemn oath not to compete in the Isthmian games. Heracles then collected a force from Thebes, Argos and Arcadia, with which he took Augeas captive and laid Elis waste. The Eleans had been assisted by the Pisatans and The Resettle- the Pylians, and Heracles was about to continue mentof Eiis. bis conquests against Pisa, when he was checked by an oracle from Delphi. He gave back Elis to Phyleus, to whom also he restored his father Augeas. Not long after wards, Phyleus retired to Dulichium, leaving the throne of Elis to Augeas. Augeas was succeeded by Agasthenes, his own son, and by Amphimachus and Thalpius, the sons of the Actoridae. Diores also, the son of Amarynceus, continued to 1 The Actoridae are the Siamese twins of antiquity, Eurytus and Cteatus. Apollodorus represents Actor as the brother of Augeas (ii. 7, 2) ; but in Pausanias (v. 1, n) Actor is the son of Phorbas, the son of Lapithes and of Hyrmina, the daughter of Epeus. They were usually known as the Molionidae, from the name of their mother Molione."], [111, "III. 14.] THE ELEAN LEGENDS. 93 hold a share in the government. At this time, therefore, there were four princes in Elis. In the Homeric Catalogue forty ships are assigned to Elis ; twenty under the command of Amphimachus and Thalpius ; ten under Diores ; and ten under Polyxenus, the son of Agasthenes. Polyxenus was succeeded by his son Amphimachus, who was in turn suc ceeded by Eleus II. In the reign of Eleus H., the Aetolian Oxylus and the Dorians invaded Peloponnesus.1 It is of course obvious that much of this history is ficti tious. It has arisen out of the later history of Elis, and is in part an attempt to explain it. Endymion is The Fictitious merely the man of the west. Aethlius, the ath- nature of these lete, is named after the contests which made Legen s- Elis famous. Epeus and Aetolus are eponymous heroes invented by the nations which bore their name. The real condition of Elis appears when we come to Augeas and the Actoridae. If three or four princes ruled side by side, we may assume that Elis was divided into three or four prin cipalities, each governed by a separate monarch. These were to some extent combined at the time of the Dorian invasion, though the old opposition between Elis and Pisatis continued to exist, and Triphylia remained independent. The town of Elis may have been built at the time of the Dorian migration, but the various adjacent villages were not incorporated with it till after the Persian wars. It is true that the Eleans were excluded from the Isthmian games, but for this the jealousy of the Corinthians is a sufficient reason. The elaborate explanations given in antiquity for the exclusion are mere fictions,2 which are proved by their diversity to have no foundation. Moreover, the Isthmian games did not become a national festival till the time of Periander, many centuries after the supposed slaughter of the Actoridae. 1 Paus. v. chaps. 1-3. 2 Ibid. v. 2, 3 ; Duncker, Hist. Greece, ii. 293."], [112, "LEGENDARY HISTORY: MESSENIA. [III. 15. 94 Messenia. 15. Messenia was not a united kingdom at the time of the Dorian invasion. If we may trust the evidence of tradition, there were three cities in the country which had been the seats of regal government \u2014 Andania, Arene and Pylus. Pausanias1 tells us that in the earliest times the land was uninhabited. But Polycaon, the younger son of Lelex, king of Laconia, was impelled by the ambition of his wife Messene, the daughter of Triopas of Argos, to gather settlers from Argos and Lacedaemon, and establish himself as king of the country. He fixed his capital at Andania. It was to Messene at Andania that Caucon brought the mysteries of the Great Goddesses from Eleusis in Attica. Of the posterity of Polycaon, Pausanias could find no trace in any of the authorities which he consulted. About five Neieus settles generations later, Perieres, the son of Aeolus in Pyius. was invited to be king over Messenia. He was succeeded by Aphareus, who built the city of Arene, and invited Neieus to settle in his kingdom, at Pylus. In his reign Lycus brought the knowledge of the rites of the Great Goddesses to Aphareus, conducting him for the purpose of initiation to Andania, where Caucon had previously initiated Messene. The sons of Aphareus were Idas and Lynceus, who left no male children behind them. The house of Aphareus being thus without male descendants, the throne passed to Nestor, the son of Neieus, the king of Pylus. In the third generation after Nestor, the Dorians expelled the Nelidae from Pylus. The dislike which the Messenians cherished towards the Nelidae, who were Minyae from Iolcus, and not native princes, caused them to enter willingly into negotiations with the Dorians, whom they received into their country, and allowed to settle at Stenyclarus. Cresphontes also took to wife Merope, the daughter of Cypselus, the king of the Arcadians, by whom he had a 1 Paus. iv. chaps. 1-3."], [113, "III. 15.] MESSENIAN LEGENDS\u2014 DEDUCTIONS. 95 number of children, Aepytus being the youngest. His government being conducted in the interest of the people, a rebellion broke out among the aristocracy. Cresphontes was slain, and all his children, except Aepytus, who was in the care of Cypselus. When Aepytus grew up, he was restored to his throne by the help of the Arcadians and the other Dorians of Peloponnesus. Aepytus took vengeance on the murderers of his father, and established himself so firmly on the throne that the royal race of Messenia were henceforth known as Aepytidae. From Stenyclarus, the Dorians extended their power over the whole of Messenia. The Nelidae were compelled to quit their citadel at Pylus. They sought refuge at Athens, where for many generations they were the ruling family. Among the most eminent of the exiles, Pausanias mentions Alcmaeon, Melanthus, the sons of Paeon, and Pisistratus.1 It is perhaps uncritical to select one part of this legendary history as more worthy of credit than another. But if we are justified in drawing any conclusions at all A Criticism of from statements o. which the historical truth the Legends. can never be ascertained, it would seem that the Dorians when passing up the Alpheus made terms with the Arcadians. It was with their assistance that they established themselves in the region of Stenyclarus. The Messenians themselves at the time were either divided into one or more principalities, or under the dominion of an immigrant power which had settled at Pylus, on the coast ; and it is not improbable that the Dorians found it possible to take advantage of some divisions among the Messenian people. In the first instance the Dorians received but slight support, and in no long time the opposition was strong enough to drive them out into Arcadia ; but, with the help of the other Dorians in Peloponnesus and their Arcadian allies, the next genera tion succeeded in firmly establishing themselves, and they became masters of the whole of Messenia. 1 Paus. ii. 18, 8, 9.

Sparta was the second settlement of the invaders in the Peloponnesus, and in time it became the most important city of the Dorians in Greece. Just below its confluence with the Oenus, the mountain walls which line the banks of The valley of the Eurotas fall back on either side, and leave the Eurotas. a plain of moderate extent. On the left bank the land is low and marshy ; on the right, spurs run down from Taygetus and form a number of low hills. Upon this higher ground lay the city of Sparta, or rather the group of villages which bore the name of Sparta in antiquity. Below the city the mountains again approach the river, which passes through rocky chasms to the sea. The extent of the plain is about eighteen miles by four.1 Near the middle a spur of Mount Taygetus strikes across it. It was the upper portion which formed the original settlement of Sparta. Secluded from the sea, and easily defended on every side, Sparta was the natural stronghold of Peloponnesus. From the \" Return \" till the time of Epaminondas (370 B.C.), no invader ever set foot in the valley of the Eurotas.

It is through Amyclas that the line of kings is continued to Oebalus, the father of Tyndareus. Tyndareus was expelled from the throne by his brother Hippocoon, and some time elapsed before he was restored, by the aid of Heracles, to his rightful heritage. From Tyndareus, the throne passed through Menelaus to Orestes, whose son Tisamenus was reigning at the time of the Dorian invasion, when apparently Sparta and Argos were regarded as forming one dominion. 1 Tozer, Led. on Geogr. p. 283. Paus. iii. 1."], [115, "III. 17.] LEGENDARY HISTORY: AMYCLAE- ARGOS. 97 It is perhaps reasonable to conclude from these legends that Amyclae was in early times a more powerful city than Sparta. Ephorus, indeed, represents the invaders as masters from the first of the whole of the valley of the Eurotas and of some towns in Arcadia. He adds that the entire territory was divided into six portions, Amyclae being ceded to the traitor who had placed Laconia in the hands of the Dorians. Sparta was the capital, from which kings were sent to the other five districts, and all who submitted enjoyed equal rights with the Dorian conquerors.1 But this account is incredible. The union of Amyclae with Sparta is a mere fiction, invented to cover the failure of the Amyclae and Dorians to capture the town, for it is certain Sparta. that the Amyclaeans retained their independence till the time of Teleclus. For a considerable period after the in vasion the Dorians were unable to penetrate up or down the valley of the Eurotas beyond the limits more immediately commanded by Sparta. Argos. 17. As we have already seen, the ancient legends of Argos carry us beyond the limits of Hellas. Io, the daughter of Inachus, the king of the country, was beloved by Zeus, by whom she was visited in the fruitful Legend of Io meadow of Lerna. The jealous rage of Hera changed her into a cow-headed monster, and drove her out to wander over the earth. At length she arrived in Egypt, where she brought forth her son Epaphus. From Epaphus were descended two brothers\u2014 Aegyptus, the father of fifty sons, and Danaus, the father of fifty daughters. When the sons of Aegyptus desired their cousins in marriage, Danaus fled with his daughters to Argos, to escape the connection. There, according to one account, they were hospitably received, and the maidens were protected from their pursuers. According to another version, the sons of Aegyptus succeeded in their object. 1 Quoted in Strabo, p. 364. VOL. I. G"], [116, "9S ARGOLIC LEGENDS: DANAIDS\u2014 PELOPIDS. [III. 98 But on the marriage-night all the brides, save one, slew their husbands. From Lynceus, the sole survivor, and Hyper mnestra, sprang Danae, who became, by Zeus, the mother of Perseus. Perseus built Mycenae, and, at his death, established his three sons, Alcaeus, Elec tryon and Sthenelus, at Tiryns, Mycenae and Argos. By the death of Electryon, who was slain in a quarrel by Amphi tryon, the son of Alcaeus, and the banishment of Amphitryon as one guilty of bloodshed, Sthenelus became lord of the three cities of the Argolid. His kingdom descended to Eurystheus, who was finally slain in Attica (p. 60). The throne now passed to Atreus, the son of Pelops, whose sister was the mother of Eurystheus. In this manner the legend brings the Pelopids, who are heroes of the Pisatid, where Pelops contended with Oenomaus for the hand of Hippodamea, to Argos. To Atreus were born Agamemnon and Menelaus, under whom the great expedition went forth to Troy for the rescue of Helen. Between Atreus and his brother Thyestes there had been a terrible feud, which descended to their sons. Iii the absence of Agamemnon, Aegisthus, the son of Thyestes, seduced his wife Clytemnestra, with whose aid he slew the king on his return from Troy. But Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, lived to return to Argos and take vengeance on his mother and Aegisthus. For this deed he was tried on the hill of Ares at Athens, and acquitted, as the votes were equal. His posterity did not long remain in the land, being expelled by the descendants of Heracles, whom Eurystheus had unjustly kept from his rights. At the time of the Dorian invasion Tisamenus, the son of Orestes, was on the throne (p. 96). Here, again, we see traces of history.

Perhaps she is to be identified with both, for, in another legend, she is carried away from Argos by Phoenician mariners. The establishment at Argos of the Pelopids, whose"], [117, "III. 17.] LEGENDARY ARGOS, MYCENAE, &\u25a0 TIRYNS. 99 home, before they visit Peloponnesus, is Mount Sipylus, near the river Hermus, points to a connection between Argolis and Asia Minor, which is confirmed by arch\u00e6ological re searches (p. 47). The story of the flight of the fifty daughters of Danaus from their cousins may have arisen from some rule of \" exogamy,\" which made it unlawful for women to marry men of their own family. Guesses such as these may be made in regard to portions of the myth ; but more than guesses they cannot be, till we know precisely the stages in the growth of the legend. What are the earliest traits 1 What have been added later 1 Was there in reality any connection between Egypt and Argos in ancient times, or has the legend which connects them grown up after Egypt was opened to Hellenic commerce 1 These are questions which we have very imperfect means of answering. Argos is the natural capital of the peninsula which runs out to the north-east of Peloponnesus ; and at an early time she became the most important city in the district, to which she gave her name. But here, as everywhere in Greece, the larger unit is formed by a combination of smaller units. Even in the part of Argolis which forms the plain of Argos there were, at least, three cities existing as the capitals of independent principalities \u2014 Argos, Mycenae Turns, on an elevated plateau near the sea ; and Tiryns. Mycenae, in the recesses of Mount Euboea ; and Argos, at the foot of the outlying spurs of Lycone, an offshoot from the range of Parthenium. The early history and relations of these cities are told at length in mythological accounts, but we have no clue to the real condition of affairs. We may reasonably suppose that the temple of Hera, near Mycenae, was common to all the inhabitants of the district. But even this is no more than a conjecture. In historical times the temple is under the control of Argos. l 1 In addition to the three ancient cities in the Argolid, we hear of three kings at Argos (Paus. ii. IS, 4). The desire to reconcile the accounts of Argos in the Theban aud Trojan epics, and the confusion of Argos with Mycenae, led no doubt to numerous difficulties."], [118, "LEGENDARY EPOCH CORINTH. [III. 18. 100 At Argos there was a fourth tribe, in addition to the three Dorian tribes \u2014 the Hyrnethians (supra, p. 63). With out further evidence, this would lead us to suspect that the old inhabitants of the city had a share in the new settlement. Legend also describes the reign of Temenus as one of great disturbance, owing to the favour which he showed to his son-in-law Deiphontes. At length the sons of Temenus, fearing that they would be deprived of the succession to the throne, slew their father. At Argos, as in Messenia, the position of the Dorians would seem to have been, at the first, very precarious.1 The existence of the Orneatae and Gymnesii, who occupy at Argos the place of the Perioeci and Helots at Sparta, shows that the population of the country was reduced to subjection. Corinth. 18. The early history of Corinth was made the subject of an epic poem by Eumelus, the son of Amphilytus, a member of the great family of the Bacchiadae. Pausa- nias speaks of him as the reputed author of poems (\u00abrn) and also of a history of Corinth (<rvyypa<pi] Kopivdla), but he doubts whether the history is a genuine work of Eumelus.2 It appears that the poems of Eumelus were lost before the time of Pausanias, but that an epitome of them, written in prose, was still in existence. This was certainly not the work of Eumelus, for at the date when he flourished (760 B.C.) prose was not yet written. We do not know where, or by whom, it was compiled, or whether it was a faithful representation of the poem upon which it was founded. It is the source from which Pausanias drew his account of the mythical history of Corinth before the Dorian invasion. 1 Paus. ii. 28, 3 ff. 2 Paus. ii. 1, 1. See, by all means, Kinkel, Graec. Epic. Frag., p. 185 ff."], [119, "III. 18.] MYTHICAL CORINTH: PAUSANIAS' ACCOUNT. 101 Ephyre, the daughter of Helius, was the first inhabitant of the territory of Corinth, which then included Sicyon. Afterwards Helius gave Asopia (Sicyon) to Aloeus, and Ephyraea (Corinth) to Aeetes. Aeetes left his portion in charge of Bunus, and retired to Colchis ; and when Bunus died, Epopeus, the son of Aloeus, became king of the whole territory. From Epopeus the throne descended to Marathon. During the lifetime of his father, Marathon, in alarm at his fierce and lawdess actions, had retired to Attica, but at his death he returned to Corinth. After dividing the kingdom between his sons Sicyon and Corin thus, he returned once more to Attica, where he died. As Corinthus left no children, Medea, the daughter of Aeetes, was brought from Colchis to Corinth. By Medea the throne was handed over to Sisyphus.1 The following table gives the succession to the time of the Dorian invasion : \u2014 Sisyphus. J III! Glaucus. Ornytion. Thersander. Alums. r i Phocus. Thoas. I Demophon. I Propodas. I I I Doridas. Hyanthidas.

If we combine Sunatcorinth. with it the story of the children of Medea, which seems to represent some ancient custom of human sacrifice, and the 1 Paus. ii. 3. io. 2 r.-ius. ii. 4, 3 (supra, p. 04)."], [120, "LEGENDARY CORINTH: SUN-WORSHIP.

This conjecture is rendered more probable by the introduction of Marathon into Corinthian legend. Marathon in Attica was the home of a fire-breathing bull in which we may recognise the symbol of Baal-Moloch. From early times Corinth was a wealthy and important city. By crossing the isthmus, the mariner escaped the wealth of the dangers of Malea and shortened the voyage to City of Corinth. Sicily and the west. With a harbour on either side of the isthmus, and at the same time holding the key of communication between Peloponnesus and Northern Greece, the city became a centre of traffic, where strangers from all parts met and traded. There were eight tribes in the city, of which three only could be Dorian. Hence it is probable that in the so-called conquest the Dorians allowed a great portion of the original inhabitants to remain, but retained the monarchy in their own hands.1 Sicyon. 19. The Sicyonian account of the early history of their city is at variance with the Corinthian version. Aegialeus, they said, was their first king, the founder of a city Aegalea. He was succeeded by Europs, Telchis, and Apis \u2014 a powerful king who gave his name to the whole of Peloponnesus. After Apis came Thelxion, Aegyrus, Thurimachus, and Leucippus, who died without male issue. Calchinia, the daughter of Leucippus, became, by Poseidon, the mother of Peratus, who was succeeded by his son Plemnaeus.

Then Laomedon, the grandson of Corax, gave Antiope back to her people. Laomedon found himself at war with his neighbours, the Achaeans, and summoned Sicyon from Attica to aid him. Sicyon received the hand of Zeuxippe, the daughter of Lao medon, and in due time became king of the city, which was now called Sicyon instead of Aegalea. From Sicyon was de scended Polybus, in whose reign Adrastus came to Sicyon from Argos. After a few more reigns, in which the succes sion was broken, Agamemnon appeared with \u201e.

The descendant of Hippolytus was Lacistades, in whose reign Phalces, the son of Temenus, conquered Sicyon, and added it to the kingdom of Argos. The native king was allowed to retain his throne.1 In this account the union of Sicyon and Corinth, if it is a historical fact, is carefully concealed. The Sicyonian terri tory forms a part of the Achaean district of Aegalea, and it is only when it ceases to be Achaean, under Attic influence, that the city receives the name of Sicyon. But while main taining their independence in the west, the Sicyonians lost it in the east ; the Argives under Agamemnon, and the Dorians under Phalces, reduced them to submission. It is worth observing that Phaestus, who held the throne of Sicyon in the second generation after Adrastus, is spoken of in the legends as a Heraclid, and the resistance which the city may have offered to the Dorians \u2014 a resistance so vigorous that the native prince retains his throne in spite of the so-called con quest \u2014 can thus be represented as a friendly compact between the descendants of a Heraclid king and a Heraclid invader. 1 Paus. ii. 6."], [122, "104 MYTHICAL HISTORY: PHLIUS\u2014TROEZEN. [III. 20. Phlius. 20. Of the origin of Phlius various accounts were given. Pausanias, who heard them all, came to the conclusion that the Phliasians were first Argives, and then Dorians. The first king was Aras, a child of the soil, who built his city near the hill Arantinus, at a short distance from the later town. He had a sou Aoris, and a daughter Araethyrea ; and in honour of his sister, who died before him, Aoris called the country Araethyrea. Of Phlias, who gave to the city the name by which it was afterwards known, there were various stories ; some regarded him as the son of Cisus, the son of Temenus, others as a son of Dionysus.

Of Troezen and Epidaurus there is little to relate beyond the forms of worship which prevailed there. Troezen was sacred to Poseidon. It was by Aethra, the daughter of the king of Troezen, that Aegeus, who is thought to be Poseidon, became the father of Theseus.

It was famous for the worship of Asclepius, but we do not know whence the cultus was derived, or when it came into vogue. About the early inhabitants of the country, Pausanias could obtain no information. Epi daurus, the eponymous hero of the land, was variously said to be a son of Pelops, Argus, or Apollo. Of the conquest of the city by the Dorians we have already spoken (p. 64). The Epidaurians always claimed to be independent of Argos, and at some early period they established their authority over the island of Aegina, which, in legend, is the home of Aeacus and the Myrmidons.1 Achaea. 22. The northern coast of Peloponnesus, from the terri tory of Sicyon to the river Larissus, near the mouth of the gulf of Corinth, was known in historical times as Achaea. But this was not the original name of the country. In the earliest times it was known as Aegialea, or \" the shore,\" and the inhabitants were Aegialeis, or shore-men. When Attica became very populous, after the victory of Ion over Eumolpus and the Thracians, a colony was sent across the Corinthian Gulf, and the , . .. , , . .

After the Dorian migration, the Achaeans, who dwelt in Laconia, were led bv Tisamenus against the The Achaeans Ionians. In a succession of battles the Ionians were driven into Helice, and finally forced back into Attica, from whence they had come. The Achaeans established themselves in the country, which was henceforth known as Achaea, and maintained their ground against all attacks.2 After the conquest the Achaeans, following the example of the previous inhabitants, arranged themselves in twelve cities. The Ionian population was absorbed \u2014 where it was not ex- 1 Paus. ii. 26, 2. Strabo, pp. 383, 384."], [124, "ACHAEAN CONSTITUTION AND RITES.

The names of the twelve cities are \u2014 Pellene, Aegira, Aegae, Bura, Helice, Aegium, Ehypes, Patrae, Pharis, Olenus, Dyme and Tritaea. In the period immediately following the conquest, the government of the Achaeans is said to have been monarchical. Tisamenus was the first, and Ogygus the last king of Achaea. In historical times we hear no more of these kings. The Achaeans formed themselves into a league, public affairs being managed by representatives from the twelve cities, who met at Aegium. The unbroken repose which Achaea enjoyed for centuries was favourable to the preservation of old customs and religious rites. We have already observed that the manufacture of byssus at Patrae, and the worship of Aphrodite in that city, may have been a legacy from Phoenician colonists. Other remarkable Achaean rites are the sacrifices offered to Artemis Laphyria (p. 90) and fArtemis Triclaria. Before the temple of Artemis Laphyria at Patrae there stood a great altar of burnt sacrifice. At the festival of the Laphria, a large wooden palisade was erected round the altar, into which were driven a number of animals both wild and tame. The wood was then fired, and the animals were burnt alive in honour of the goddess. About a mile and a half from Patrae, on the banks of the river \" Meilichos,\" was the temple of Artemis Triclaria \u2014 i.e. the Artemis worshipped by three (adjoining) districts. Here it had been the custom to offer yearly sacrifices of boys and girls to the goddess, and an oracle had declared that the cruel rite would only cease when a foreign deity was brought to the temple. It chanced that when a boy and girl were about to be sacrificed, Eurypylus appeared on the shore, on his way from Troy, bringing with him the image of Dionysus. The oracle was supposed to be fulfilled ; the stream, which was hitherto known as Ameilichos (cruel) was now called Meilichos (gentle), and the inhuman rites were discontinued. But the memory of them lingered in certain expiations"], [125, "III. 23.] ARCADIA : ITS LEGENDARY RECORDS. 107 performed by the children of Patrae even down to the time of Pausanias.1 Arcadia. 23. Secure in their mountains, the Arcadians were able to resist the Dorian conquerors. Even if we allow some trans itory and partial conquests, it is clear from the long strife which was necessary to gain Tegea at a later time, that the original invaders were unable to establish themselves either in the west or the north of Arcadia. Hence in . _. The Primitive Arcadia, more than elsewhere, the old legends character must have remained undisturbed ; there, more ofArcadla clearly than in the rest of Greece, they reflected some charac teristic features of early Greek civilisation. Unfortunately, our chief authority on the legends of Arcadia is Pausanias, in whose time many of the ancient villages of the country had become desolate, and with their extinction many an ancient rite and custom had passed out of existence. Pelasgus 2 was the first king of Arcadia ; he taught men to build huts, and to wear the skins of swine as clothing. He pointed out the acorn as the food of men, who had hitherto fed on herbs which were un- ' 6 wholesome, and even poisonous. He was succeeded by Lycaon, who built the city of Lycosura, the oldest of Arcadian cities, and founded the Lycaea in honour of Zeus Lycaeus. This festival continued to be the great national feast of the Arcadians. The sons of Lycaon founded cities throughout Arcadia, Pallas settling at Pallan tium, Orestheus at Oresthasium, and Phigalus at Phigalea, while Nyctimes, the eldest, remained at Lycosura. In fact all the cities of Arcadia are assigned to the sons of Lycaon. His daughter was Callisto, who was beloved by Zeus. The son of Callisto was Areas, from whom the land was called Arcadia \u2014 hitherto the name had been Pelasgia. Areas taught 1 Pans. ii. 19, vii. 18. - Ibid. viii. 1 ff."], [126, "PRIMITIVE ARCADIAN SUPERSTITIONS. [III. 23. 108 his people to grow corn, to make bread, and to weave garments. He divided the land among his three sons, Azan, Apheidas and Elatus, who in their turn became founders of cities (see infra, ch. vii.). Here, as always, a territory which was originally divided into numerous cantons, is given to a single king. The tradition which places Pelasgus at the head of the Arcadian line of kings is probably late. In the earliest legends, so far as we can tell, the Pelasgians were confined to a com paratively small area far removed from Arcadia.1 Even the account of Lycaon would seem to be a pure invention, unless, indeed, it indicates a previous population, whom the later Arcadians expelled. At any rate, his whole male issue \u2014 numerous as it is \u2014 makes room for the son of his daughter, with whom begins a new era and a new name for Arcadia. More interesting than any attempt to make history out of legend, are the stories of Lycaon changing into a wolf, and Callisto, whose son is Areas, becoming the Great uper Bear. Here we seem to have a definite trace of early beliefs \u2014 we are at the point of development when the animal and human world are not yet divided, and a change may take place between them. Elsewhere in Arcadia we hear of a precinct in which a man lost his shadow, another well-known incident in the belief of savages. Unfortunately such superstitions had no attraction for Polybius or Strabo, and but little for Pausanias. In their place we have the fictitious eponyms of Arcadian cities, and genealogies invented to connect what was never connected. The Arcadians maintained that they were the children of the soil. They were the most ancient nation in Greece, and The Foreign re- \" nved before the moon.\"2 They were doubtless lations of primi- right in preferring this claim.

Legend tells us that Agapenor, who was carried out of his course on his return from Troy, went to Cyprus, and this connection is confirmed by the similarity of the Cyprian dialect to the Arcadian. We also hear of Arcadians who emigrated to the west (Evander, etc.). THE LABOURS OF HERACLES. 24. Two groups of legends still remain, which, without being specially connected with any city, mark historical facts of importance in the early civilisation of Hellas \u2014 the labours of Heracles, and the Trojan war. Of these a short outline may be given. In them we shall find, as before, a mixture of myths in the stricter sense, and legend ; phenomena of the natural world, which have been thrown into a personal form, being combined with incidents of a historical character. In Grecian legend, Heracles was the son of Zeus and Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, king of Tiryns. Born in Thebes, where his father had taken refuge after the murder of his uncle and father-in-law Electryon, king of Mycenae, by the jealousy of Hera, Heracles became subject to the commands of Eurystheus, king of Argos, by whom he was compelled to undertake a number of toils. He slew the Nemean lion, and the hydra of Lerna, the Erymanthian boar, the birds of Stymphalus, and the bull of Crete. He caught, after a year's pursuit, the hind with the brazen feet ; cleansed the stables of Augeas by divert ing the course of the Menius through them ; caused Dio med, the Thracian king, who fed his horses on human flesh, to be himself eaten by them ; carried off the golden apples of the Hesperides ; slew the triple Geryon, and enchained Cerberus in order to deliver Theseus. These were his Twelve Labours, but they formed only a small part of his works. He slew the Centaurs, delivered Thebes from Orchomenus, and turned the territory of the Orchomenians into a marsh by blocking the channels through which Lake Copais was"], [128, "HERACLES' LABOURS: ORIGIN OF THE MYTH. [III. 25. 110 drained ; he delivered Alcestis from death, and Prometheus from the eagle which devoured him ; he assisted Atlas in sustaining heaven, and formed the outlet of the sea at the pillars which bear his name. After the murder of Iphitus, whom he slew by treachery, he was sold into slavery to Omphale the queen of Lydia. In her service he wore woman's garments and plied the distaff, while Omphale put on the lion's skin and carried the club. On his return he sacked Oechalia, the city of Eurytus, whom he slew, with all his race, except Iole, whom he brought home as a bride. He had previously wedded Deianira, of Aetolia, whom he won from the Achelous (supra, p. 88). In order to retain her place in his affections against her younger rival, Deianira sent him the robe which she anointed with the blood of the centaur Nessus, believing it to be a love-charm. Heracles put on the robe as he was offering sacrifice on the Cenaean headland, in thanksgiving for his victory. The supposed love-potion proved to be a consuming poison, by which Heracles perished in agony. His body was burned on Mount Oeta, and from the pyre it was thought that Heracles himself ascended to heaven a glorified hero, to dwell with Hebe and become the type of one who, by endurance and toil, had established his claim to immortality. 25. We have already seen (p. 50) that Heracles is the Greek form of a Babylonian or Phoenician sun-god. In the \"Baby- The Semitic Ionian Epic \" he passes through twelve labours, thenGreek1M th as tne sun Passes through the twelve signs of the of Heracles. zodiac.1 In changing him into a national hero, the Greeks have changed his labours into a series of achieve ments, which are exaggerated accounts of what was really done in Hellas by some ancient tribe. We have also seen how Heracles, the Theban god, became the heir to the ancient kingdom of Argos. When it was afterwards discovered that Heracles was the progenitor of the Lydian kings, no less than the Spartan, it became necessary for the Grecian hero to be 1 Sayce, Ancient Empires 0/ the East, p. 190."], [129, "III. 26.] EPIC LEGENDS: THE TALE OF TROY. 111 sold into slavery to the Lydian Omphale. The combination of sex which some of the Semitic races regarded as necessary to make up the full completion of the divine nature, led to the interchange of garments and occupations between Heracles and Omphale. The clearing of the ground from trees, the damming up of water-courses, the slaughter of wild beasts, by which Greece was rendered habitable, were attributed to the hero who represented Phoenician skill and energy. When this tendency had once begun, it went on with increased vivacity. Of the particular acts of Heracles, it would be absurd to attempt any explanation ; but we can hardly doubt that the widespread activity of this hero points to that occupation of Greece by prehistoric nations, mainly of Semitic origin, which is becoming more and more probable on other evidence.

The great story of the expedition to Troy, the long siege and the capture of the city, and the disasters which overtook some of the Greeks on their return , . . . - The Tale of Troy. home, were the theme ot many epic poems, ot which two, the Iliad and the Odyssey, have come down to us. The story which they relate is well known. Paris, the son of Priam, king of Troy, stole away Helen, the lovely wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Then all the chief tains who had ever been suitors for the hand of Helen, ful filling the oath which bound them to punish any injury done to her, set sail to revenge upon Troy the dishonour of Menelaus. Nine years they laboured with varying success. In the tenth, Achilles, the greatest hero of the Greeks, slays Hector, the \" Bulwark of Troy.\" Even then the city remains uncaptured. Achilles is himself slain by Paris. It is not till the famous wooden horse has been built by the Greeks, and received into Troy as a pretended gift at their departure, that the town is taken. The horse was filled with chosen warriors, who, in the dead of night, slew the Trojans when resting in the belief that at length their enemies were"], [130, "[III. 26. LEGEND OF THE TROJAN WAR. 112 gone, and opened the gates to their companions. Then the armament returned home, but many heroes met with disaster. Agamemnon was slain by his wife and Aegisthus ; Menelaus wandered seven years before he was able to regain Sparta ; and Odysseus\u2014 the last to return\u2014 reached Ithaca twenty years after his departure, to find his wife surrounded by suitors who were eating up house and home. The Greeks themselves had no doubts about the reality of these events, though they might allow that Homer had Historical truth treated them in a poetical manner. On more in the Legend, than one occasion, in historical times, public reference was made to the Iliad as an authority for the past. The incidents of the war before Troy are related in the Homeric poems with all the minuteness of an eye-witness. We know what hero slew another ; when and how wounds were given or received. And there have been modern writers who have treated the story of the Trojan war as an incident of early Grecian history for which we have satisfactory evidence. But minuteness does not constitute truth. The epic poets knew their business, and were able to give a most accurate and circumstantial account of conflicts, whether they took place or not. The same minuteness is found in other legends, as, for instance, in early Irish history, which are demonstrably false. The myth of Troy is not made more historical than any other myth of Greece because we happen to have two great epics upon it. On the other hand, there is no reason to have recourse to solar phenomena in order to explain what is quite intelligible without them. That there were conflicts on the shores of the Troad, between the old inhabitants of the country and immigrant Greeks, that there was an ancient city there, which the Greeks succeeded in capturing and destroying, is not at all improbable. Nothing more than this was needed to give the foundation of the epics. The Iliad belongs to the class of poems of which the French Chansons de Geste are more recent examples. In one of these, the Chanson de Roland, we have an instance to show how a great poem, with abundant variety of detail, can arise out"], [131, "III. 26.] TROJAN WAR: FACT AND FICTION. 113 of an insignificant event. That \"vast epic,\" of which \"the roots are indeed French, but the branches reach to Ireland and to the East,\" arose out of a defeat suffered in \u201e Comparison 778 a.d. by Charlemagne, when re-crossing the with the Chan- Pyrenees. The Gascons fell upon the rear of son de Roland his army, and not only brought the whole into confusion, but also slew the greater part of the officers of the palace ; among them Roland, the warden (praefedus) of the marches of Brittany. In the poem the combatants are the French and the Saracens. Roland is now the hero of the story : he perishes by treachery, but his death is severely avenged. The stages through which the epic poem arose out of the historical event appear to be unknown. The development took place with wonderful rapidity. In a hundred years after Charlemagne's disaster the historian of Louis le Debonnaire thought it unnecessary to mention the names of the heroes who fell at Roncevaux (where tradition places the scene of the battle), because they were so universally known.1 Yet there are no ballads or shorter poems in existence on the subject ; nothing bridges the chasm between the historical event and the poem. The parallel in this respect to the Homeric poems is excellent. We may imagine the songs of the bards, out of which the epic poems of Greece have arisen ; and we have reference to such songs in the Homeric poems. But none exist, and there is no external proof that any ever did exist in Greece : we begin with the great epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The tale of Troy, then, is a myth, no less than the tales of Heracles or Theseus. But underneath it may lie a fact, which, if not historical, is yet sufficiently probable to throw doubt on the resolution of the legend into \"Solar Phenomena;\" \"the immemorial story of the storming of the sky by the bright powers of the day, which had been localised in Thebes, where Greeks and Phoenicians had contended for possession, being again localised by Achaean poets in the land of their adoption.\"2 1 Chanson de.

The Aeolians, on the other hand, were a composite tribe, as their name implies. Though they claimed the descendants of Agamemnon as their leaders, they were a mixed multitude, in which Locrians, Magnetes and Boeotians were united with the ancient Achaeans of Peloponnesus. It is possible that they did not receive their distinctive name till gathered together in the common enterprise of colonisation.

Of these three divisions the Aeolians lay farthest to the north. The precise limits of their territory were differently fixed by different authorities. Strabo describes the Aeolian cities as scattered over the whole region between the territory of Cyzicus on the north and the Hcrmus on the south;1 Phocaea marked the boundary of Ionia. Ephorus fixed the limits at Abydus and Cyme respectively.2 But in the stricter sense Aeolis did not extend farther to the north than the promontory of Lectum, the western point of the Troad.

The first was led by Orestes, the son of Traditional Agamemnon, and after his death in Arcadia, by account of his son Penthilus, who advanced as far as Thrace. e 'sratlon \" Then Archelaus, the son of Penthilus, brought the expedi tion to the territory of the Cyzicenes in the neighbourhood of Dascyleum, and finally Gras, after advancing as far as the Granicus, returned with the larger part of the immigrants to Lesbos, and secured the island.\" The second body of emi grants was led by Cleuas and Malaus, who also claimed to be descendants of Agamemnon.

Aegiroessa (Poplar-town) is not mentioned elsewhere, and may be the same city as Elaea (Marsh-town), which subse quently became of importance as the port of Pergamum. Smyrna was, at an early date, conquered by exiles from Colophon, when it ceased to be a member of the Aeolian league. The northern group included the islands of Tenedos and Lesbos. In the latter there were originally six cities : Methymna, Mytilene, Pyrrha, Eresus, Arisba and Antissa, but Arisba was subsequently conquered and enslaved by Myti lene. To this group also belonged the Hecaton-nesi, a number of small islands lying in the immediate neighbourhood of Lesbos, and the settlements on the coast of the Troad, towns or villages chiefly of Lesbian origin, and in possession of the Lesbians. But \"the cities on Ida\" are placed by Herodotus in a separate class.1 In two instances the Aeolians penetrated farther into the interior. The city of Magnesia on the Maeander, though lying far to the south of Aeolis, is distinctly Magnesians stated to have been an Aeolian city, founded ln Asla Mlnor by emigrants from Thessaly and Crete. We can hardly doubt that the town of the same name under Mount Sipylus, though not included among the Aeolian cities, derived its population from the same source. The irruption of the Thesprotians into Thessaly confined the Magnesians to the mountainous tract which bore their name. From hence, owing possibly to the increase of population, a number of emigrants crossed the sea and established themselves in Asia.

The Nelidae of Pylus, more especially, became the dominant family, owing to the services which they rendered in delivering Attica from her enemies.

Codrus, the son of Melanthus, performed an act of still greater devotion. The Dorians, when attacking Attica from the south, were assured by the oracle of Delphi that they would never succeed in taking the city if they slew the Athenian king. On hearing of this response, Codrus left the city in the dress of a peasant, armed with a reaping-hook. He fell in with two of the enemy, of whom he slew one, but was at once slain by the other. The Athenians sent a herald to ask for the body of their king, and when the Lacedaemonians were informed of his death they immediately withdrew from a contest in which they had no longer any hope of success. Between the children of Codrus a quarrel sprang up. Medon, the heir to the throne, was lame, and, owing to this defect, his younger brothers refused to accept him as king.

In some cities the Ionian population formed a minority ; Phocaea, for instance, though considered an Ionian city, was colonised by Phocians, and Clazomenae was mainly inhabited by exiles from Cleonae and Phlius. But in all the sons or descendants of Codrus became the ruling families.

The first was a Carian city previously known as Anactoria.1 The Ionians Ionian cities. were conducted to it by Neleus, the son of Codrus. After slaying the Carian inhabitants, they took their wives and daughters in marriage. In revenge the women pledged themselves by an oath not to eat with their husbands or call them by their names.2 Ephesus was originally in the hands of the Leleges and the Lydians, who were driven out by the Ionians under Androclus. The ancient sanctuary of the tutelary goddess of the place was transformed by the Greeks into a temple of Artemis, who was here worshipped as the goddess of birth and productivity in accordance with Oriental rather than Hellenic ideas.3 At both these cities the Thesmophoria were celebrated ; but the Apaturia, which Herodotus regards as a peculiar mark of Ionic descent, were not celebrated at Ephesus.4 Nor do the five tribes of Ephesus agree with the old Ionic division into four. Of the remaining cities, (3) Myus, and (i) Priene were established on Carian soil. The founder of Myus was Cyaretus or Cydrelus. The name of the city was derived from the mosquitoes which infested it, and which at length became so intolerable a plague that the inhabitants abandoned their city and retired to Miletus. At the founding of Priene, Androclus of Ephesus lost his life in battle against the Carians. But Aepytus, a son of Neleus, and Philotas, who brought a num ber of Thebans to share in the colony, were regarded as the founders.

This may be a Greek explanation of a piece of savage \" etiquette\" which survived among the Carians. 3 According to Strabo, p. 633, the city was originally called Smyrna, after an Amazon of that name.

The Ionian colonists were a band collected by Cnopus (or Cleopus) from the various cities of Ionia, who united with the old inhabitants. (6) Clazomenae was chiefly a colony of Phlius and Cleonae, founded by Parphorus, or Paralus of Colophon. (7) At Teos the settlers were a mixed population, consisting of a remnant of the Minyae under Athamas, Ionians under Nauclus, a son of Codrus, and Boeotians under Geres.

Of the more important islands, Naxos was not included in the Ionian dodecapolis, though it is said to have been colonised by Neleus on his way to Miletus, and subsequently by Arche timus and Teuclus.

Of the islands, Crete is the most important. In legends this island was known as the abode of Minos, who first established a maritime empire in the Aegean, and instituted a system of laws, from which, it was thought, Lycurgus borrowed the institutions of Sparta. The Cretan empire is by some supposed to have been Hellenic, and this was the opinion of Thucydides ; by others Carian, a view with which the evidence of Herodotus is not incompatible ; others consider that the story of Minos is but the Grecised account of the occupation of Crete by Phoenicians. Here, as elsewhere, it is probable that one name became the centre round which many legends gathered. There were, we can- not doubt, Phoenician colonies in Crete, from which the name of Minos may have been derived. But it was not the custom of the Phoenicians to found naval empires, such as that which legend ascribes to Minos. Nor is there any reason for attributing to the Phoenicians or Carians the peculiar institutions found among the Greeks in Crete. They are due, like those of Sparta, to the Dorian immigrants, and arose out of the necessity of holding in check a subject population. The Dorians claimed to have colonised Crete with a band of emigrants from Argos under the command of 1 Paus. vii. 3, 10 ; Strabo, p. 384."], [141, "IV. 7-1 COLONISA TION OF ASIA : B Y DORIANS. 123 Althaemenes, but as Idomeneus, the Cretan, was mentioned in the Homeric poems, and Dorians were there included in the population of Crete, it became necessary to Dorian Coio assume a still earlier settlement. While yet in nists in Crete Hestiaeotis in Thessaly, the Dorians had sent colonists to Crete.1 Even these were not the first inhabitants of the island. Homer speaks of Eteocretes and Cydonians \" who dwell by the stream of Jardanus,\" in addition to Dorians, Achaeans and Pelasgians. The Cydonians were probably Phoenicians, for the name Jardanus is of Phoenician origin ; the Eteocretes are possibly related to the Carians of Asia Minor, though the Cretans themselves regarded the Carians as subjects, and claimed alliance with the Lycians.2 Crete was one of the oldest centres of civilisation in the Aegean. The most important cities of the island were Cnossus, Gortyn and Cydonia. The first was the city of Minos, and therefore, we may presume, a Phoenician settle- , ' . J l , . , . . . .

It is remarkable that the Arcadian Gortyn was adjacent to a place known as Maratha, a name which some trace 1 For Minos see Thuc. i. 4, Herod, i. 171. For Althaemenes, aud the still earlier migration, see Andron and Ephorus in Strabo, pp. 476, 479, 481. We cannot ascribe any real value to Andron's statement, yet it agrees with the view which represents the Dorians as invading Argolis by sea. To Thucydides, Minos is merely a Greek tyrant, like Cypselus or Polycrates. Hoeck's Kreta is still the best book about the island. 2 The epithet Tpix\"\"**\" ap[ilied to the Doriaus of Crete in Homer (Od. xix. 177) was supposed by Andron to refer to the three cities founded by the Dorians in Doris : Erineum, Boeum and Cytinium, but Strabo (p. 476) points out that there were four cities in Doris, and that Tp-xaiK. s was derived by some from the rpiXo^ia, by others a-rrb tov Tpixivovs elvtu tovs \\6<povs. It is difficult to believe that Kap and Kprjc are not variations of the same name, in spite of the additional t in the latter stem.

The oldest Laconian colony in Crete was Lyctus.2 8. The Dorian colony in Rhodes, like that in Crete, was ascribed to the band which left Argos under the command of Althaemenes, and here also, probably to meet the statements in the Homeric poems (the Catalogue), it was assumed that a still earlier colony had been sent out. After the slaughter of Licymnius, Tlepolemus, the son of Heracles, fled to Rhodes, whether from Boeotia or Tiryns was not clear.3 These earlier colonists might indeed claim to be Heraclids, but as they left Greece before the Return of the Heraclids, they could not have been The Earliest Dorians. Legends spoke of still earlier in inhabitants. habitants : the Telchlnes who were skilled in all manner of metal work, and the Heliadae or children of the sun. These stories, like the legends of Minos, may have been derived from the Phoenician occupants of the island. The Dorians founded three cities \u2014 Lindus, Ialysus and Camirus. In Ialysus the Phoenicians appear to have formed a part of the population beside the Greeks. 9. The large and .fertile island of Cyprus, which was known to the authors of the Homeric poems, was never thoroughly Hellenic. It is true that Greek princes reigned in some of the cities, but the island was only for short periods independent of one or other of the great eastern monarchies \u2014 Assyria, Egypt, Persia. Herodotus states that the Greek colonists were emigrants from Athens and Salamis \u2014 Arcadians and Cythnians. He also informs us that Curium was said to be a colony from Argolis. Legends related that Agapenor, the son of Ancaeus, who was king of Arcadia after Echemus, was carried away to Cyprus on his return from Troy, and founded there the city of Paphus, and the temple of Aphrodite. His daughter subsequently 1 Paus. viii. 28, I. - Strabo, p. 481. 3 Strabo, p. 653.

This connection between Arcadia and Cyprus, however it may have arisen, is supported bjr the Arcadia and dialect of the Cyprian inscriptions, which, in some Cyprus. respects, presents a striking resemblance to that of Arcadia.1 Other islands colonised by the Dorians were : Thera, which was a colony from Lacedaemon, and named after Theras, the uncle and guardian of the sons of Aristo. Thera demus (see p. 221) ; Melos, which was also founded from Lacedaemon ; Carpathus, Calydnae, Nisyrus and Cos. Cos was founded from Epidaurus. etc The colony, like the mother city, was distin guished by the worship of Asclepius, a hero-deity, who appears to be of distinctly Greek origin, and derived in the first in stance from the Phlegyae in Thessaly. In Thera and Melos, and no doubt in many other islands, the Dorians found Phoenician settlements (supra, p. 53). 10. From the islands, the Dorians spread to the mainland. The peninsula of Cnidus was perhaps the first settlement ; and as the Cnidians were devoted to the worship of Aphrodite, we may assume that here also there Dorians on the was a previous colony of Phoenicians.

In historical times the Gergithes, who dwelt in the town of the same name (at TepyiOes) near Lampsacus, and also formed the subject population of Miletus, were the only remnants of this once famous nation.3 But their former greatness was attested by the Homeric poems, and the occurrence of the name Gergithians at various places in the Troad.

Whatever the power and civilisation of the ancient stronghold exhumed by Dr. Scbliemann may have been, it was necessary for the epic poet to represent Priam and his nation as a dangerous rival in wealth and arms to the great kings of Mycenae and Sparta. 12.

South of these nations the inhabitants of coast was inhabited byPamphylians andLycians. Asia Mmor- In the first, who, as their name implies, were a union of various nations, the Greeks formed a considerable element. Some had wandered thither after the capture of Troy, others belonged to the later bands of emigrants.2 The Lycians who dwelt on the slopes of Mount Milyas, and by the banks of the Xanthus, appear to have been one of the most highly civilised, as they were the bravest, of the numerous tribes who inhabited Asia Minor. Their native name was Tramilae, but their origin was unknown. The Cretans claimed them as kinsmen. They were doubtless an immigrant race who drove the native Solymi back to the mountains from the shore. The Greeks gave the name of Lycia \u2014 \" land of light \" \u2014 to the beautiful country which the Tramilae inhabited ; and the Athenians claimed connection with them through Lycus, the son of Pandion ! The Lycians dwelt in cities, but the most remarkable monuments in the country are the tombs which are cut in the rocks on each side of the valley of the Xanthus. Not without reason 1 Strabo, p. 584.

Herodotus asserts that the Lycians had a curious custom of deriving descent through the mother, but whether the custom was ancient or not he does not tell us. It may have come into existence at the time when the nation was almost entirely extirpated by the Persians.1 Among the nations of the interior, the Phrygians were the most important. We have seen that Herodotus identifies them with the Thracians (supra, p. 34). He also connects them with the Armenians, and they were undoubtedly of Indo-germanic race. Their civilisation impressed the Greeks deeply, for not only did their legends of Midas and Silenus, of Marsyas and Lityerses, become a part of Greek mythology, but the Greeks borrowed much from them in the cultivation of the art of music, especially the music of the flute. They were a rural people, devoted to agriculture, from which they derived great wealth ; it is said that one of their ancient laws punished with death any man who killed an ox or destroyed an implement.2 Their chief deities were Bagaeus, whom the Greeks identified with their Zeus, and Cybele, the Great Mother by whose bounty the earth gave her fruits ; their wine-god was Sabazius, with whom at a later time were associated Attys and the abominations of Syro-Phoenician worship. The invasion of the Cimmerians inflicted a severe blow upon the country. Midas, who was king at the time, is said to have put an end to his life, and the monarchy ceased at his death (693 B.C.). Subsequently Phrygia became a part of the empire of Croesus, from whom it passed to the Persians. The ancient wealth of the country is attested by the remains 1 Herod, i. 173 ; vii. 92. There is no reason to develop a theory of \"mother-right\" here.

In the valley of the Hermus, where the heights of Mount Tmolus sink towards the river, lay the citadel of Sardis, the capital of the Lydian empire. Even at the time when the Greeks colonised the coast, this city must have been of considerable import ance. It was probably the western out-post of that oriental empire, now supposed to be Hittite, which extended through Asia Minor to Carchemish on the Euphrates, and from thence to Syria. By communication with Sardis and the Lydians the Greeks were able to The Hittite receive the products and manufactures, the EmPire. arts and sciences, of the Mesopotamian kingdoms. One of the Greek standards of coinage \u2014 the lighter or Euboean \u2014 is thought to have been introduced by this route,2 and it is not improbable that the resemblances which have been observed between the art of Assyria and the descriptions of Homer are due to influences conveyed through this channel.3 For a long time the monarchs of Sardis allowed the Hellenic cities to develop unmolested, but with the accession of Gyges at the beginning of the seventh century B.C., the Lydians entered on a career of aggression, which, after a century and a half of warfare, compelled the Asiatic Greeks to recognise the power of the throne of Sardis.4 1 See Leake, Travels in Asia Minor, p. 21 ff.

He is said by Strabo to have been \" brought into notice by recent authority,\" and has no place in the theogony of Hesiod. The name might be new, but the deity had long been known in Attica.2 \u2014 The Carians were zealous worshippers of Zeus. At Mylasa there was a temple of the deity, who was known to the natives by the name of Osogo ; Labranda, distant about seven miles from the city, was the site of the ancient temple of Zeus Stratius, whom the Carians \" alone of men The Temple worship.\"3 A third temple (at Mylasa) was at Labranda. that of the Carian Zeus, common to all the Carians, in which the Mysians and Lydians also had a share \" as brethren.\" At a fourth temple, near Stratonicea, the 1 Strabo, p. 613, regarding Apollo Smintheus as the destroyer of mice, quotes other instances of epithets applied to deities for a simi lar reason : \u2014 Heracles ConopioD, whom the Oeteans worshipped as expelling locusts ; Heracles Ipoctonus, who destroyed the ipes which ruined the vines of the Erythraeans at Mimas ; Apollo Erythibius at Rhodes.

Athena at Ilium, Artemis at Ephesus, Hera in Samos, Rhea in Crete. She is the Great Mother, the mother of the gods, whose Asiatic name was Ma, or Amma, or Cybele. She dwells on the summits of the mountains, Dindymus, Sipylus, or Ida, and is known by their names ; or she is represented by a rude stone, as at Pessinus. She is the mistress of the world and the ruler of its forces. The wild creatures are subject to her, and lions are yoked to her chariot ; for her the Dactyli of Ida ply their craft. She is the mistress of birth and productivity ; the deity of many breasts, the guardian of marriage. She is also the queen of cities, on whose head rests the mural crown. Her worship was a wild mixture of exultation and despair, of asceticism and sensuality. Round her were gathered the stories of Attys and Sabazius, of Cronus and the Corybantes. At Ephesus she was worshipped by maidens, whom the Greeks called Amazons. As similar rites prevailed on the banks of the Thermodon, the story of the Amazons was transferred to that site also, and by degrees the Greek logographers were able to give an account of the nation of Amazons \u2014 women who lived apart from men and trained themselves in warlike exercises. From those parts of Asia Minor which came into the possession of the Greeks the Amazons naturally disappeared, yet many of the Greek cities \u2014 Myrina, Smyrna, etc., were said to have been named after them.2 1 Strabo, p. 659, 660.

In all these colonies the form of government was, in the first instance, monarchical. The chief who led out the victorious band remained at the head of the new city, and was succeeded on the throne by his descendants.

These dates would give us roughly 1150-1050 B.C. for the period of colonisation. In themselves they are of no value. We may suppose that the colonisation of the Aegean and of Asia Minor by the Greeks was coincident with the expulsion of the Phoenicians. The greatest extension of the Phoenician power in the Aegean seems to fall in the fifteenth century B.C. 1 Strabo, p. 663. 2 Id. p. 582."], [154, "[IV. 19. 136 DATE OF THE MIGRATIONS. From the thirteenth it was gradually on the decline, and the Greeks were enabled to secure the trade for them selves \u2014 partly, no doubt, by the skill which they had learned from the foreign seamen. By 1100 B.C. Asia Minor may have been in the hands of the Greeks, though the Phoenicians still maintained themselves in Rhodes and Cyprus. But all attempts at chronology are illusory. It is remarkable that even Greek tradition places Crete, Cyprus and Rhodes, where the Phoenicians remained longest, among the oldest colonies, and that the Cyprian Greeks were acquainted with a peculiar mode of writing, which, as we have seen, must be a survival from a very remote period.1 19. Though the Greeks secured a great part of the trade of the Aegean by their colonies, and, in some instances, only Relations of the established themselves after severe conflicts Greeks and with the natives, their relations to the inhabi- tants of Asia Minor do not seem to have been hostile.

They probably derived advantages from the Greek traders which they were unable to obtain in any other way ; for the \" sons of the Lydians \" had no ships of their own.- The Carians carried on a trade, in rivalry with the Greeks, from their own native ports. The Greeks despised them, but there is no trace of a hatred of races. The Phrygian prince Midas sent gifts to Delphi, and the Greeks borrowed the music of Phrygia. The Lydian Gyges is even said to have gained the throne of Sardis by the help of the Delphic oracle. The alphabets also of the L3-cians and Phrygians were mainly derived from the Greek. 1 Of.

THE HOMERIC POEMS. I.\u2014 NATURE AND HISTORICAL VALUE OF THE POEMS. I. The earliest monuments of Hellenic literature which we possess are the poems known as the works of Homer and Epic Poetry Hesiod. The Iliad and Odyssey, of which of Greece. Homer was the reputed author, are epics in the more elevated style, relating episodes of the Trojan war. The poems of Hesiod (in addition to some minor works) consist of a Theogony and the Works and Days. The Theogony is an attempt to give an account of the origin of the world, of the gods, and of the heroes ; in the Works and Bays we have a poem of humble life, which dwells on the hardships of the Boeotian peasantry, and lays down a number of rules for the arts of agriculture and navigation. It is obvious that we cannot determine the historical value of the pictures which these poems present of social and political life, before we have arrived at some conclusion about the nature and date of the poems themselves. Reserving Hesiod for another chapter, we will speak first of the date of the Homeric poems, and next of their nature and characteristic features, though it is true that the two subjects cannot be entirely separated. 2. The most satisfactory manner of deciding the date of any literary composition is to connect it with some historical Date of the fact or institution of which the date is known. Homeric Poems. With the Homeric poems this simple plan is impossible. On the one hand there is no contemporary history, on the other we do not know that it was not the poet's design to carry his audience back to a time long 138"], [157, "V.3l HOMERIC POEMS : THEIR DA TE. 139 anterior to that in which he was living, and present before their eyes a picture which was ideal rather than real. It is obvious that if the Homeric poems are compositions similar in character to the Idylls of the King, it will be a waste of time to examine them in the hope of finding evidence by which we can ascertain the date of their composition. We may indeed obtain evidence of the kind of civilisation which formed the poet's ideal, but until we have ascertained whether that civilisation existed in the poet's time, we can draw no conclusions whatever from it which will enable us to fix the date of the composition of the poem. We are not left entirely without external evidence enabling us to fix the downward limit before which the Homeric poems must have been composed. The Iliad and Odyssey are the two survivors of a large number of epic poems which related the legend of the Troian war. At some . ,.,... ... \u201e , ...

Though the other poems which treated of the Trojan legend are lost, abstracts of their contents, as they existed in this \"cycle,\" have been preserved, and from poemsoi these, together with the references to the poems the cycle' which occur in writers of antiquity, we are able to form a tolerably clear conception- of the contents of the poems, and their relations to each other. The whole series of the Trojan poems, including the Iliad and Odyssey, is as follows : \u2014 1 For the Cycle see Welcker, Der Epische Cyclus ; Monro, Journal of Hellenic Soc, vols. iv. v. ; Bergk, Griechische Litteratur-Geschichte, ii. 27 ff."], [158, "140 POEMS OF THE ' CYCLE.'

If, then, it is possible to prove that the Cyclic 1 poems, as they are called, appear to have been composed with reference to the Iliad and Odyssey, in order to complete or continue the story of the taking of Troy, we have evidence to show that the Iliad and Odyssey were in existence before the composition of the other poems. And if we can go further and fix some probable date for the composition of the Cyclic poems, we have at least a period below which the composition of the Homeric poems cannot be brought. 4. It is a remarkable fact that, while the Iliad and Odyssey amount to forty-eight \"books,\" the Cyclic poems are com- Comparison of prised in twenty-nine.

On the other hand, the space of time occupied by the action of the Iliad and Odyssey is very short, extend- 1 I use this term for the poems in the cycle (of Troy) exclusive of the Iliad and Odyssey."], [159, "V.S-] THE 'CYCLE' COMPARED WITH 'HOMER' 141 ing over a few days, or weeks at the most.1 For these reasons it is highly improbable that the Homeric poems are a supplement to the Cyclic poems. When the leading events of the Trojan war had been re lated by various authors in comparatively short poems, it is unlikely that two epics, longer than any of the rest, should be composed on the incidents of a very brief period in order to complete the story. The same result follows when we compare the plan and construction of the Cyclic poems, so far as they can be ascer tained, with the Iliad and Odyssey. Aristotle remarks that many tragedies had been constructed out of the Cypria, and \"more than eight \" out of the Little Iliad, though the Iliad and Odyssey supplied material for one or two plays at the most.2 This observation is fully justified by the analyses of the poems which we possess. They contain a number of incidents which may be gathered \"round a single person, or into a definite space of time, or round one action of many parts,\" as Aristotle tells us, but we cannot trace in them the unity of subject or excellence of plan, which, in spite of all criticism, mark the Iliad and Odyssey. It is reasonable to suppose that poems so loose in structure, and deficient in unity, were composed with reference to epics already in existence, and generally received. It is not reasonable to imagine that they were the first, and that the more perfect and independent compositions were a later addition or supplement. For it is obvious that the Cyclic poems could, without injury to their structure, have been enlarged to include the incidents of the Iliad and Odyssey, but the Iliad and Odyssey could not be extended to include the whole Trojan story. It is the peculiar merit of Homer, in the eyes of Aristotle, that he did not choose the entire war for the subject of his poem, but a portion only. 5. The importance of these general arguments will be rendered clearer if we take one of the Cyclic poems and point 1 Iliad, fifty days ; Odyssey, forty days. - Poetics, c. 23, end."], [160, "142 'CYPRIA' AND 'ILIAD' COMPARED.

The abstract of the Cypria l shows not only that the poem ended where the Iliad begins, but that it presupposed and explained many incidents in the Iliad.

The explanation of the presence of Chryseis in Thebe (at a distance from her home), which we find in the Cypria, must also have been inserted in order to explain the situation in the first book of the Biad. The embassy of the Greeks to Troy to demand Helen and her goods is mentioned in 77. iii. 203 ff. ; the sack of Lyrnessus, and the capture of Briseis in ii. 690 ; the sack of Pedasus in xx. 92.

A number of heroes who are mentioned in the Cypria are not found in the Iliad and Odyssey, such as Palamedes, Telephus, Protesilaus, Lycomedes. Nothing is said in the Homeric poems of the sack of Teu thrania by mistake for Troy, or of the sacrifice of Iphigenia at Aulis as a propitiation of Artemis. Nothing again is known of the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles in Tenedos, or of Cycnus, or of the meeting of Helen and Achilles. All these incidents were related in the Cypria. 6. The abstracts of the other Cyclic poems merely con firm the conclusion for which we are prepared. On the one hand, the Cyclic poems do not enter on the , i , .1 T7- 7 i/i7 Differences ground covered by the Iliad and Odyssey; on between the the other, they fill up the interstices in the Homeric and legend. They describe incidents which are mentioned in the Biad or Odyssey in a manner which seems intended to explain or develop the story, and they also con tain many incidents which are not mentioned in either of these poems. From the nature and construction of the Cyclic poems we were inclined to draw the inference that they were composed after the Iliad and Odyssey, and our conclusion is confirmed by what we know of the incidents recorded in them. Once more. The Cyclic poems allude to ideas and customs which seem to be later than the Homeric poems. It is unlike the Homeric poet to make Helen the daughter of Nemesis. The personification of abstract nouns is indeed found in Homer, as we may see from the examples of Ate, Eris and the Litai, but the combination of Helen and Nemesis belongs to a later development of ideas. In other Cyclic poems we find instances of purification from murder, and of the worship"], [162, "144 DATE OF THE CYCLIC POEMS. [V. 7. of ancestors, customs which are never mentioned in the Homeric poems. The weird magical strain which so widely separates the Odyssey from the Iliad becomes more strongly marked in the Cyclic poems, and at the same time the high epic tone is lowered till some of the characters (Odysseus, Menelaus) approach the level at which we find them in Greek tragedy. Whether the interval which separated the Homeric from the Cyclic poems was long or short depends on the difficult question ... \u201e . , whether legends and customs which are \" non- Non-Homenc \u00a9 and 'Post- Homeric \" are \"post-Homeric.\" A long time Homeric. would elapse before such customs as purifica tion from murder and the worship of ancestors could become current in a nation to which they were previously unknown. If, therefore, we could assume that these customs are post- Homeric because they are not mentioned in the Homeric poems, the interval which separates the Cyclic poems, in which they occur, from the Homeric, in which they do not, would be a wide one. But it is impossible to assume this without further inquiry. 7. Unfortunately we have little trustworthy information about the date of the Cyclic poems. We know, of course, Date of the that they were in existence at an early period cyclic poems. jn Greece, but the first traces of them \u2014 the pictures on the chest of Cypselus at Olympia \u2014 cannot be placed before 600 B.C. Tradition, however, carries some of the poems much higher. Arctinus of Miletus is placed in the first Olympiad (776 B.C.) ; Lesches in the thirtieth Olympiad (660 B.C.). For the Cypria it does not seem possible to fix any ' definite date.1 Our downward limit therefore for the Homeric poems is not very high, but it is high enough to prove that at least they were in existence in their present form long before Pisistratus (560 B.C.). If we wish to state the result favourably for the antiquity 1 See Bergk, I.e. p. 44. He places the Cypria between 01. 15 and 20, but on'very slender grounds."], [163, "V. 8, 9-1 ANTIQUITY OF 'HOMER.' 145 of the Homeric poems, it may be said that the Iliad is presupposed by the Aethiopis of Arctinus, a poet whom tradi tion places in the first Olympiad. In a similar manner it may be shown that the Capture of Bium by Arctinus, in which we find the story of the wooden horse, of the sacrilege of Ajax, and the disasters of the return to Greece, forms as it were an introduction to the Odyssey, in which these events are incidentally mentioned. And in the Nosti of Agias \" a large proportion \" of the incidents \" appears to be taken directly from Homer.\"1 The Odyssey therefore seems to be older than either of these two poems, and if Arctinus is rightly placed about the first Olympiad, it is pro bable that the Odyssey, no less than the Iliad, is anterior to that date. 8. We may assume then, so far as we can proceed on this line of evidence, that the Iliad and Odyssey were in existence before the Olympic era. This justifies us in speaking of Homeric poems them as the oldest existing poems in the Greek before the First language. But when we attempt to estimate ymP'a their value as pictures of early Hellenic life and civilisation we are met by difficulties at every step. Are the statements which we find in the Homeric poems facts or fictions 1 Are they copied from contemporary life, or from a supposed past which was never present 1 Are the omissions which we find in these poems due to ignorance and negligence, or may we legitimately infer that customs and legends which are not mentioned in the Homeric poems were unknown at the time when those poems were composed 1 g. The argumentum ex silentio is at all times of little vah e, and it is highly probable that in the Homeric poems it is of no value whatever. There are two events in early omissions in Greek history which admit of no reasonable the Homeric doubt : the invasion of Peloponnesus by the poe Dorians, commonly known as the \" Return of the Heraclids,\" and the migration of the Ionians from the mainland of Greece 1 Monro, Journal of the Hellenic Society, v. 30. VOL. I. K"], [164, "ANTIQUITY OF 'HOMER.' [V. 9. 146 into Asia Minor. These changes are not merely recorded in legends, but they are presupposed by subsequent history ; the arrangement of the population of Greece in historical times arises out of them. In the Homeric poems there is no No reference to reference to either of these events ; not a single the Dorian in- ]ine can be found which betrays any knowledge vasion, etc. of them confronted with such evidence, our first impulse urges us to assume that the poems were composed before the Return of the Heraclids and the Ionian migration. The events are not mentioned because they had not yet occurred. Such a hypothesis would at once carry back the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey to the tenth century B.C. or even earlier. But it is quite needless. The Argumentumex Cyclic poems, which we know to have been siientio of no composed centuries after the state of Greece had been changed by these great movements, appear to have been no less silent about them than Homer.1 We need no second instance to warn us that in the epic com positions of Greece silence cannot be accepted as a proof of ignorance. And this is a fact of the highest importance in regard to the historical value of the Homeric poems. If we cannot infer that the return of the Heraclids was unknown to the epic poets, though they never allude to it, what sort of Worship of right have we to maintain, on the ground of ancestors ; similar silence, that there was a period in the history of Hellas in which purification from bloodshed and the worship of ancestors were not prevalent customs 1 These are institutions of the greatest antiquity, and widely spread among the Aryan nations.2 It is remark- 1 It is true that we have not these poems before us, but so far as the analyses given by Proclus enable us to judge, this statement is correct. Even in Greek tragedy the epic illusion is maintained. - For the worship of ancestors, cf.

We may perhaps conjecture that in the Homeric poems, which are so greatly occupied with warfare and bloodshed, the customs which are connected with domestic life are disre garded. However this may be, considerations such as these compel us to admit that the Homeric poems unhistoricai are at any rate imperfect, if not fictitious, nature of the pictures of civilisation.1 This must be ad- P\u00b0ems- mitted, and we can also add that we have no means of ascertaining the extent to which omission was carried. The desire to distinguish the past from the present would at least incline a poet to give altered accounts of contemporary events or manners if he introduced them into the picture of an earlier generation. 10. On similar grounds we may assume that the geographi cal knowledge or ignorance displayed in the Homeric poems is not a test for determining the date of their Geographical composition, or fixing the geographical limits of knowledge no the \"Homeric\" world. If little or nothing is testofdate said about the Black Sea, that is no reason for supposing that the poems were composed before the Euxine had been pene trated by Greek mariners. The supposition implies that the Greeks were not only unacquainted with the Euxine them selves, but also that they were unable to obtain information from other sources. Nor can the account of Thrinacria, even if we assume that island to be Sicily, furnish proof that the Odyssey is subsequent to the Greek voyages to the west. Phoenician traders could easily have conveyed such a know ledge of Sicily as the Odyssey implies to the ports of Asia Minor or Argos. Arguments such as these rest on two hypotheses. They assume that the poet states all that he knew in his poems, and also that what he knows is knowledge at first hand, and not gathered from the accounts of others. Neither of these two hypotheses can be seriously maintained. ' These customs are mentioned in the Cyclic poems (supra, p. 143)."], [166, "148 'HOMER' UNHISTORICAL. [V. ii. II.

Miletus is still a Carian city, as Herodotus says that it was before the Greeks conquered it ; (3) That the islands of Chios, Samos, Paros, Naxos, Ios, are not mentioned in the Iliad, though Rhodes and Crete are mentioned (Rhodes in the Catalogue only) ; (1) That a number of common names in Greek geography never occur in Homer. Such are Megara, Eleusis, Pisa, Delphi, Peloponnesus. On the other hand, prominence is given in the Catalogue to a number of Boeotian towns of which we hardly hear else- where. (5) A number of heroes are mentioned in the Catalogue as leading contingents to Troy of whom we hear nothing in the action of the Iliad. A glance at the map will show that it is almost incredible that the Greeks could have been unacquainted with the islands of Samos and Chios, at a time when they sailed as far as Rhodes and Crete.1 At any rate, after the examples 1 Chios is in the track of the Greeks when sailing from Argos to the Troad, as is shown in Odyssey, iii. 170."], [167, "V. it] ' HOMER ' UNHISTORICAL. 149 of omission which have been quoted, it is far less incre dible that the authors of the Homeric poems and the Cata logue 1 mentioned those islands, and those only, which it was necessary to mention in connection with the heroes who went to Troy. Any place which in the An untrust. epic or local tradition did not send a contingent worthy to Troy was \" out of the story,\" however well- sketch known its existence might be. This is the reason why we hear nothing of Eleusis or Megara in the poems. In like manner the poetic situation required the presence of a bar barian element in Asia Minor, and therefore the poets re presented the country as still in the hands of the barbarians, quite regardless of any contemporary state of affairs. In this respect even the Catalogue goes back to a period anterior to the colonisation of Asia. Again, if the account of early Greece presented in the Homeric poems were at all accurate we should expect it to be consistent. This is by no means the case, inconsistency The Catalogue cannot be made to agree with of Homeric the Homeric poems, not even with the Iliad, of poe which it is intended to form a part. The Arcadians do not join in the Trojan war, yet in the Catalogue Agapenor, the son of Ancaeus, brings a contingent of Arcadians large enough to fill sixty ships ! As the Arcadians had no seaport, and therefore could not have vessels of their own, the Catalogue tells us that Agamemnon supplied them with ships. In like manner Nireus, the most beautiful hero who went to Troy, except Achilles, is represented as bringing a contingent to the aid of Agamemnon from a small island contiguous to 1 Cf II. ii. 494 ff. with Monro's notes ; Id. English Hist. Review, i. 47.\" Throughout, the Catalogue exhibits glaring contradictions to other (probably local) legends. Unless it did so, it could not be in harmony with Homeric poetry. The natural inference is that the empire of Agamemnon never existed in early Greece, but when, by the creation of the Iliad, the idea of this empire was formed, contra dictions arose between the epic and local legends.

It is in Nature of fact no more than a fanciful enumeration, in the ' Catalogue.' tne style of Boeotian poetry, of the contingents which, according to various legends, went to Troy. Those who assert that it is a picture of some early condition of Greece must explain how it can be at one and the same time a trustworthy account of an age preceding the Doric invasion and a late addition to the Homeric poems ; or, if they refuse to regard it as a late addition to the poems, they must account for the discrepancies between it and the Iliad. They must explain how in the very infancy of Greek navigation, when a three days' voyage precluded all communication between Greece and Troy for ten years, Agamemnon was able to assemble a fleet only surpassed by that of Xerxes.2 1 The reason of these insertions is perhaps the following. In lists of the suitors of Helen, of which we have copies in Apollodorus and Hyginus (Fab. 81), names occur which are not found in Homer. The legend asserted that these suitors were bound by their oath to Tyndareus to revenge the wrong to Helen (Thuc. i. 19). Hence the author of the Catalogue represented those heroes as joining the host with a contingent. This seems to be the reason why Antiphus, Agapenor, Nireus, Gouneus, Prothous, Thalpius, Polyxenus, Phidippus, names unknown to the Iliad and Odyssey, are found in the Catalogue. In the action of the Iliad they bear no part whatever. Later legend used the story of Agapenor's appearance at Troy as the foundation for the colonisation of Cyprus by Arcadians under his command (Paus. viii. 5, 2 ; viii. 53, 7). The story of the colonisation is connected with the temples of Athena Alea, and Aphrodite Paphia at Tegea. The Cyprian dialect and the Arcadian present resemblances, and the legend of the colonisation is as old as Herodotus. The similarity of the dialects proves an early connection between the Arcadians and Cyprus ; but it does not of course prove the presence of the Arcadians at Troy. The legend was probably invented to explain the connection. 2 It is, I think, impossible to prove that cities omitted by the Catalogue are later than the Catalogue, or that cities mentioned in it were necessarily places of prominent importance at any period of history."], [169, "V. 12, 13] HOMERIC GEOGRAPHY. 151 12.

And it requires very little reflection to convince us that a decisive result is not to be expected. In describing the journey of Telemachus and Pisistratus from Pylus to Sparta, the poet omits all mention of the mountain ridge of Taygetus, which it could not be an easy matter to cross. Yet he is aware of the existence of the mountain, for he mentions it elsewhere, and he also describes Sparta, quite accurately, as lying in a hollow. He omits the difficulty from indifference ; and his audience, equally indifferent, were not at all likely to point out the omission.1 13.

A round shield of a diameter large enough to cover a man's height would be an encumbrance rather than a protection, and cannot have existed at any period. The explanation of the contradiction seems to be that epithets are a part of the epic poet's stock. In the first instance the proper epithets were applied to shields according to their shape. One was small and round, the other, whether oval or oblong, was tall and narrow. But afterwards the epithets were applied indifferently to either form of shield without any thought of the inaccuracy involved in the promiscuous use.2 The constant mention of gold in the Homeric poems marks another contrast between Homeric and historical Greece. It is true that gold has been found in the pre historic tombs at Mycenae in quantities which would previously have been thought incredible for such an early date, and the monarchs of Lydia possessed it in abun dance. But in historical times gold was almost unknown to the Greeks of the continent till the time of Croesus.3 To an 1 On the use of the chariot in Egypt and Asia Minor, see Helbig, Das Horn.

But is it safe to conclude from the picture of a war-chariot on a stone slab that the chariot was in use at Mycenae ? The Samians are said to have been the first to build ships for the conveyance of horses (Hullmann, Handelsgeschichte, p. 11). 2 For the shield in Homer see Helbig, I.e. p. 218 ff. He assumes, but merely to avoid the difficulty stated above, that two shields were in use in Homeric times, one round, the other oval (p. 222). See Leaf, Journal of Hellenic Soe. iv. 281 ff. At Mycenae we find pictures of an oval shield, an oval shield with indentations, and an oblong shield. 3 It is, however, possible that gold was plentiful in the Aegean when the Phoenicians worked the mines of Thasos."], [171, "V. i4.l 'HOMER' : POSITION OF WOMEN. 153 epic poet this is a matter of indifference. His chieftains, like his gods, have everything handsome about them; and why should they not, when it is but the expense of words which is needed to provide it 1 In works of art, also, the poet draws upon his imagination. If Hephaestus, the divine craftsman, can fashion statues endowed with life, and depict lifelike scenes on a shield, this proves no more than that statues of some kind, and embossed work, were known to the poet. His imagination is not to be restricted within the limits of what is possible or impossible in art.1 Another difficulty is presented by the position of women in Homer. If we look on the picture as a copy of histori cal facts, we have to explain the long widow- position of hood of Penelope, so contrary to the habits women in of the later Greeks, the custom of the bath necessarily given by women to men, the visit of Nausicaa historical. and her maidens to a solitary part of the sea-coast (she re marks that the island is far from others), in an age when, if we are to believe Thucydides, the sea swarmed with pirates.

We have no better evidence for them than we have for the home of Calypso, or the life in the island of Aeolus. 14. If there is a place where we might expect the Homeric descriptions of customs and arts to apply, it is Mycenae, the centre of the Achaean dominion, Homeric and the home of the Atridae.

There is no trace of iron in any of the tombs ; the heads of the arrows are of obsidian, and the other arms of bronze. In Homer, iron and bronze are both in use. There is in Homer no allusion to the custom of covering the face with a mask of gold, which prevailed at Mycenae, or of burying the body without cremation.1 Nor is any mention made in the Homeric poems of such artistic work in relief as we find upon the slabs of stone at Mycenae.

Even if this is true, it is obvious that an epic poet must assign power and importance to the heroes whom he celebrates, without any regard to the his torical relation of nobles and chief. There is no reason to suppose that his imagination was limited by the facts around him. If we hear of a king, a council and an assembly, we may assume that such institutions were known to the minstrels, without asserting that in every city there was a king, a council and an assembly. If in Ithaca there is neither king nor council, and the assembly has not met for twenty years, this is not evidence that in any period of Greek history a throne might be vacant, or the assembly unsummoned for twenty years. It is equally incredible that the Greeks were ten years at Troy without returning home \u2014 a voyage of three 1 On the mode of burial at Mycenae, see Helbig, toe. cit. p. 39 ff.

And in regard to the much-discussed question of writing, the silence of Homer is not a decisive proof against the existence of the art. The poet, singing under the in spiration of the muse, was not unlikely to disregard a mechanical contrivance which seemed to rob him of half of his pre-eminence over less favoured men. \" Homer,\" then, is of little or no value as evidence of the early civilisation of Hellas, because we have no means of ascertaining that his statements are historically true. We do not know that his silence implies ignorance, or that his asser tions are not largely coloured by his imagination.1 l6.

Though ballads are popular, and must be in harmony with popular feeling, they need not be in nationai poetry harmony with facts. But this view of the \u00b0r a collection origin of the poems is untenable. For not only are ballads short and the Homeric poems long, but the length is attained by inserting episodes into a definite plan, not by stringing one incident on the other. \"Ballads,\" says Mr. Lang, 2 \" are not artistic, while the form of the epic, whether we take the hexameter, or the rougher laisse of the French chansons de geste, is full of conscious and ad mirable art.\" Nor are the Iliad and Odyssey national poems in the sense in which the Kalevala may be called the national poem of Finland.3 Little or nothing is said in them of the common people, their lives and their supersti- 1 It is still convenient to speak of \" Homer,\" but to avoid miscon ception I may remark that I do not believe that the Iliad and Odyssey are the work of one author.

The more they are studied, the more will the Homeric poems be found to be what they truly are, epic in the strictest sense, or poems elevated in style, ideal in matter, elaborate and artistic in construction and language.3 Before such poems could be composed, poetry must have been cultivated as an art for many generations. Of this the Artistic nature language and metre are ample proof. We of the poems. cannot suppose that a metre at once so grand and so plastic as the hexameter was the form in which the early Greeks composed their popular songs.

When we perceive that the rhythm of the hexameter disregards the accent with which Greek words were ordinarily pronounced, we cannot regard it as a simple or spontaneous expression of poetic feeling.

Phrases abound in the poems which were created by the dactylic metre and have been preserved by it. 17.

For Kovpij, though of the same metrical value, is not limited in the same way. Again, different forms of the same word vary in their position : Sios, in the Odyssey, is always last but one in the line, except ii. 27, but this rule is less strictly observed with Sia.

These instances, which might be increased to any extent, are enough to prove that the language of Homer is neither a natural nor an inartistic mode of speech. It does not represent a spoken dialect but a metrical language, created under the influence of the dactylic metre, and adapted for use in poems composed in that metre. 18. If the early Greek poets had attained to such excellence of art in the language, we may reasonably suppose that they had technical and artistic rules about the epic less artificial life and character. They wished to put before than the tan- their audience something ennobling and in- spiriting ; and, doubtless, they had clear con ceptions of what would serve their purpose. There is nothing more characteristic of the Iliad than the firm, unhesitating touch with which the characters are drawn. Such certainty implies a clear and definite ideal in the mind of the poet. If they ascribed to their heroes a number of traits which puzzled the historians and shocked the moralists of later times, the reason is that the epic poets were neither historians nor moralists ; they sought to give the pleasure which epic poetry can give, and were artists enough to know that the impression produced by incidents in works of art is, and must be (if art is to exist), wholly different from the impression produced by incidents in a history of real life.1 The pictures, then, which have been drawn of the Homeric state or family, of Homeric art and civilisation, are not to be accepted as descriptions of what really existed at any definite period.

There is as little reason to suppose that the picture of Nau sicaa, with her maidens, is drawn from the life of Ionian princesses, as that Circe's power of changing men into swine represents a historical fact in ancient Hellas. There were magic arts in those days, which men dreaded, and there were princesses attended by maidens, but the details of the pictures are due to the poet. Nor need we suppose that women came out on the walls of besieged cities, or that old men thought it worth while to ruin their country for the sake of a lovely princess.

For understanding later Greek history such a study is of the first importance, because Homer became the great authority in every depart ment of life. He was the great statesman, general and artist of Hellas. No nation ever owed more to a book than the Greeks owed to Homer. But the influence which these poems exercised on Hellenism is quite a distinct question from the inquiry into the amount of historical truth which they contain. 19.

They never used war chariots in their battles ; they despised the bow and arrow ; they had neither kings nor a governing class of nobles. Yet they delighted in the descriptions of Homer, without ever observing the improbabilities of the poems, or the wide gulf which separated their age from that of the Achaeans. It was the conception of human life and character, it was not any learned pro priety, which attracted them. They could appreciate the irresistible force of Achilles, or the wisdom and resources of Odysseus, or the devotion of Penelope, or the charm of Helen's beauty, without asking whether it was pos sible for a monarch to build his own raft and his own bed, or decorous for a princess to go out with her maidens on the city walls.

And this is the true use of poetry in history. To select doubtful and discon nected facts, and treat them as real incidents in the past, can never be a satisfactory method of writing history. Such a process confuses two entirely different modes of composition : the imaginative and the historical ; and the result is what may naturally be expected from such a confusion. Nevertheless the poetry of every age is to a certain extent the expression of the imagination of the age. It gives us a glimpse into the inward life of the time, its aspirations and ideals, and in this respect it is more valuable than any record of facts. But we must always bear in mind that the Homeric poetry is epic poetry, and that the epic conception of life was not that which prevailed in the home of the peasant, or the fold of the shepherd.1 What the early civilisation of Hellas was we can hardly guess; there were doubtless shepherds and herdmen in the mountains, and tillers of the soil in the plains. It is not improbable that there were feuds between the two, and the peasant may have had to defend the \"labour of his hands \" against his roving neighbour. There were cities ruled by wealthy princes, who purchased pottery, or metals, or slaves from the isles of the Aegean and the coasts of Asia Minor. Beyond these vague assertions we cannot go, without assuming a knowledge which does not rest upon historical evidence.2 1 \" Le peuple ne paralt pas dans les anciemies epopijes, ou s'll y parait, c'est, comme le ch\u0153ur des tragedies antiques, en une troupe indistincte et anonyme. . .

Even if we knew that the Homeric poems were the work of a single author, if we could fix the date of his birth, a poet not a and the place where he lived, we could not historian. expect to find in the poems a complete and accurate account of contemporary political or social institu tions. A poet is not a historian. It is not his duty to record what he knows with precision, and carefully to exclude every fact which is not established on satisfactory evidence. On the contrary, he may invert, combine, omit, or alter as he chooses. He may borrow something from the past and blend it with the present, or enrich the description of his country with details gathered from other sources. It is also obvious that a great artist will always shape his materials to suit the object which he has in view. What ever may have been the early historical condition of Greece \u2014 and what we know of it is often at variance with the testi mony of Homer \u2014 it was necessary for the author of the Iliad to assume the existence of a great armament under a supreme chief, to whom the leaders of the various contingents were more or less subordinate. Not less necessary for the com position of the Odyssey was it that the throne of Ithaca should remain vacant for twenty years. Only on that condition was the return of Odysseus possible. The insuperable difficulties which underlie the story of the Trojan war \u2014 when treated as history \u2014 are nothing to the epic poet, and criticism which treats his work as history is of necessity abortive. The brief sketch, then, which is here given of the arrangements, political and social, portrayed in the Homeric poems, is not to be received as the description of an early age in Greek history. It is merely an outline of the pic ture which the epic poets of Greece present to us. 22. The Homeric State is monarchical. Agamemnon is the king of Argos, and by reason of his pre-eminent power, he is"], [181, "'. 22.] HOMERIC STATE: THE KING. 163 chief-king of the armament at Troy. Among the leaders of the various contingents, some are the kings of the people whom they have brought to the war, as Ido- The Homeric meneus is king of the Cretans. But the title state. of king is not distinctive of the monarch. In the island of Scheria there are thirteen kings, of whom Alcinous is the chief. Nor is the tenure of the office secure. If hereditary, it is so only in the sense that the son can succeed the father if found worthy of the throne. But if a king lived to an extreme old age, the sceptre might pass to a vigorous son even in the father's lifetime. Laertes cedes the throne to Odysseus, in whose absence he is entirely disregarded. Achilles fears that Peleus may be driven from his possessions and office when his son is not there to defend him. The king has a domain set apart for him, apparently from the public land. This The King's goes with the office ; so also do the palace and domain. various gifts from the people. After a successful raid or battle, a special portion of the spoil is set apart for the king as the leader of the forces. But the wealth which the king has acquired by his own arm, and the help of his retainers, or which he has received by inheritance from his father, is his own, and cannot be taken from him, even though he is no longer king. Such at least is the account we receive of the rights of the monarch of Ithaca. The king is the leader of his people in war, and the source of justice. He does not act alone in either capacity. Bound him, as immediate councillors, are the chiefs or nobles of the nation, whom he invites to his palace, or meets at some customary place. They form the Council.1 c unci] When the king and his councillors wish to make their decisions known, or to ascertain the will of the people over whom they preside, an Assembly is summoned. In Ithaca Telemachus summons an assembly in order to 1 At Ithaca, in the absence of the king, we hear nothing of the Council.

In this he acts on the advice of Athena, but no result follows.1 In the camp before ssem y. rpr0y an assembly is summoned to hear the wishes of Agamemnon. In order to test the temper of the Achaeans, he proposes that they shall return home, though his real object is to make an assault on Troy, which he has been told in a dream that he will capture. The assembly, on hearing his proposal, at once breaks up, and the people flock to their ships in haste to depart. By the earnest ness of Odysseus, who tells the leaders 2 the real wishes of Agamemnon, and drives the common sort back to the place of meeting with the sceptre which he has borrowed from Agamemnon, the assembly meets a second time. Odysseus now urges them to remain and carry on the war, and his speech is greeted with such applause that Agamemnon pretends to give way, and exhorts the Greeks to prepare for battle. As a judge, the king gave his sentence in public, with the advice of the gerontes or elders. He is the source of justice The King- hi his nation ; the repository that is of the as judge. customary law \u2022 and on his decisions rests the law of the future. Hence just judgment is of all virtues the greatest, and receives the peculiar blessing of the gods. There is no greater glory than that of \"a blameless king, whose sentences are just, and given in the fear of God ; for him the earth is fertile, the flocks teem, the trees bring forth fruit abundantly, and the sea is full of fish.\" 3 The capacity for pronouncing just judgment seems to be regarded as innate and hereditary. Even the youthful Telemachus, who shrinks from addressing his elders, is spoken of as skilled in justice, and invited to settle the disputes of others. 1 Previous to this convocation, the assembly had not met since the departure of Odysseus. - Agamemnon is represented as having some power to \"harass the sons of the Achaeans,\" II. ii. 195, and the /3amX^f $ are half frightened into submission. 3 Od. xix. 109."], [183, "V. 22.] HOMERIC STATE: ADMINISTRATION OF LAW. 165 On the shield of Achilles we have a poetical description of a trial at law. A man has been slain : two opponents are contending about the price of blood, one assert- _. . , 0 l ' The trial scene ing that all has been paid, the other that he on the shield has received nothing. The king and elders of Achllles are seated in the sacred circle \u2014 such as we might suppose the circle within the Lion's Gate at Mycenae to have been \u2014 and the litigants appear before them. Around are gathered the spectators, who give eager attention to the case, and express approval or dissent. Each litigant produces witnesses. When the pleading is ended the judges rise, staff in hand, in due order, to give sentence. A remarkable feature in the picture is the sum of two talents of gold to be given to him \" who pronounces sentence best.\" If this does not refer to a reward for the best decision, we must strain the text and assume that it represents the sum which in later times litigants deposited before a trial, as a proof that the case was genuine. For such a purpose the amount on the later reckoning of the value of a talent of gold is enormous, but the talent may not be the same, and Homer is always lavish of the precious metals.1 It is more difficult to decide in what sense the Homeric king is also a priest. The monarchy is not a priesthood ; and though monarchs are Zeus-born, and their The King as office enjoys a divine sanction, they are not priest. priests. We have instances of offerings made by kings, as that of Oeneus, King of Calydon, in which he forgot to sacrifice to Athena. Agamemnon also sacrifices on behalf of the host before going to battle.2 In these instances the king represents the community, as the head of the house repre sents the household, and it is in this capacity \u2014 not because he stands in any closer relation to the divinity \u2014 that he offers the public sacrifice. 1 The same sum is given as a fourth prize in the horse race, II. xxiii. 269. Ten talents are also mentioned, II. ix. 122, 264 ; Od. iv. 129 ; seven in Od. ix. 202 ; xxiv. 274. 2 //. ix. 535 ; ii. 402."], [184, "166 HOMERIC SOCIETY: THE PRIESTS. [V. 23, 24.

Yet boi of royalty. even this distinction is not confined to kings. Priests, seers, heralds carry sceptres, and every one while speaking in the assembly bears the sceptre in his hand. 23. Beside the kings and counsellors may be placed the priests as men who enjoyed peculiar honour. The Homeric priests do not form a special caste, nor have The Priests. , ,. . , . . . , they any peculiar power with the king or the army. For the most part they are sacristans, placed in charge of a shrine, and protected by the deity whom they serve. The presence of a priest is not necessary at a sacrifice unless it be offered at the shrine of which he is the custodian. Hymns and incantations, and the power of securing the favour of a deity by special rites known only to a privileged class, are entirely alien to the Homeric world. Nor is the priest a minstrel or singer. Song is sacred, in so far as it is a gift of the Muses, but it is not religious. There is no trace in \" Homer \" of the existence of a body of religious poetry similar to the Veda of India. It is the \"glories of men,\" \u2014 what they have done or suffered in martial enterprises, \u2014 or stories about the personal acts of gods, which supply the bard with a theme, and the newer his song, the greater is the pleasure which he gives. 24. Of divisions of the people in Homer there is little to be said. There were, of course, rich and poor, nobles and corn- Divisions of mons, the StJ/hos and the f3ao-i\\rjes. We hear also the people. 0f tribes (oSCAa) and brotherhoods (4>parplai), words which apparently signify larger or smaller aggregates, without any more special meaning. It is obvious that in the field or the camp names of this kind might have a different signification from that which they bore in the community. Among the poorest of the poor is the Thes, a hired labourer, who is only superior to a slave because he retains his freedom. He cannot be injured in his person at the will of a master, but he can be cast aside and left"], [185, "V. 25.] HOMERIC SOCIETY: THE PEOPLE\u2014 SLAVES. 167 to starve when there is no longer any need of his services. His lot is selected in a famous passage of the Odyssey as an illustration of extreme misery. \" I had rather,\" sa}rs Achilles, \"be the thes of a poor man whose substance is small, than reign supreme over those that are dead.\" Slaves are numerous in Homer. They were bought, or captured in war, or bred in the house of their masters. Many touching instances may be found of the faith- . ~. . . ... Greek slaves. ful and even affectionate relations prevailing between master and slave. When Telemachus returned from Sparta to Ithaca, the handmaids of the house gathered round him in joy : the handmaids of Achilles shared in the grief of their master for the death of Patroclus. Euryclea, the aged nurse, occupied an honourable position in the household of Odysseus, and Eumaeus, the swineherd, who was by birth a king's son, was the trusted friend and counsellor of Odysseus and Penelope. Nevertheless the master has absolute power of life and death over the slave. Penelope, in a moment of just resentment, utters savage threats against Melantho; and Odysseus, without hesitation, hangs all the handmaids who have been faithless to their mistress, and have brought disgrace upon her palace. 25. This sympathy of classes was due, in some measure, to association in common labours. In the epic there is no trace of that contempt for manual work which ideasabout work marks the Greek of later times. Chieftains and labour leave the management of their herds and farms to others, but they supervise the operations, and can, when necessary, take a part in them. In the picture of the harvest on the shield of Achilles, the king is present in the reaping field. Odysseus is skilled in the labour of the farm, and even the suitors seem to engage in tasks of this kind. Handicraft is held in especial honour. It is a proof of the versatile genius of Odysseus that he made his own bed, and built himself a raft. Paris assisted in building his own house, which was remarkable for its beauty.

[V. 26. in fact, professional even at that time \u2014 such as the art of the physician, the seer, the minstrel, were practised by trained persons, who were called Demiurgi, or artisans. If they were not slaves, they generally went from place to place as their assistance was needed, but the greater families had a bard at tached to them, who sang for the amusement of the company after the meal. In some cases such arts were hereditary, as that of healing in the race of Asclepius.1 That mistresses and maids should pursue their tasks of spinning or weaving in common is a practice too widely spread to need any special notice. It is more remarkable to find Nausicaa, a princess, taking a share in the washing of the household linen. This picture of ideal simplicity is reserved for the marvellous island of Scheria. 26. If slaves are merely dependent on the humanity of their masters, aliens and beggars are under the special protection of Zeus. They cannot be ill-treated or slighted without fear of the vengeance of heaven. In what Aliens. \u00b0 way the peculiar regard expressed for beggars and aliens is to be reconciled with the misery of the Thetes and the existence of slaves, many of whom owe their position to piracy and kidnapping, it is useless to inquire. The sympathy with misfortune, though real and genuine, is very imperfect. The same inconsistency is seen elsewhere. We turn from the tender and respectful affection which encompasses Arete and Nausicaa to the description of the widow The Widow. . ; \\ who is torn away from her husband s corpse on the battle-field by the blows of her brutal captors, to endure the lot of a slave in a distant country. We hear of the gentle kindness shown by Odysseus to Eurymachus, and by Phoenix _. _ . to Achilles, in their childhood, but the orphan The Orphan. L boy passes from one chief to another, begging for morsels from the table where his father ate. Everywhere he meets with rejection and rebuke. \"Away from us, 1 The Egyptians, who were remarkable for their knowledge of medicine, were spoken of as the race of Paeon."], [187, "V.27.] HOMERIC SOCIETY: SOCIAL ORDER. 169 thy father is no longer here to share the wine-cup as of old.\"1 27. The Homeric age is not, however, an age of utter law lessness, in which every one is at the mercy of a strange neighbour. The Cyclopes, who live as isolated political and savages, differ from those who are united by social \u00b0rder customs and laws. There are pirates, it is true, in Homer, and men of alien race, like the Phoenicians, have no hesi tation in committing the most horrible crimes. But it is difficult to prove the practice of universal and indiscrimi nate piracy, such as Thucydides implies ; and we have, at least, one instance in which an unprovoked attack on a neighbouring people is deeply resented by the nation of the chief who made it.2 And if blood is shed freely, as is inevitable in a martial epic, human life has its value. A man who takes the life of another in a time of peace has to fly the country, even though there are few who can avenge the murder. This expatriation is not due to any religious feeling about the pollution which murder brings upon . the land \u2014 at least it is impossible, on the evi dence supplied by the Iliad and Odyssey, to attribute it to this feeling. No exiled murderer ever seeks for purification as Adrastus sought for it from Croesus. The custom is due to the feeling that the murderer has broken the law. of his land ; and, though there is no public administration of justice, the sympathy of the people and customary law are on the side of vengeance. The payment of a sum of money is received in atonement for the murder; and when this has been duly paid, the homicide is again permitted to return home. Under what circumstances the kindred of the dead had a right to refuse the sum offered, we do not know, though instances of refusal are not uncommon.3 1 Od. viii. 523 ; //. xxii. 490. 2 Od. xvi. 427. 3 Schomann, Greek Ant. i. 47 E. T. He suggests that the blood price was not accepted when the murderer was a kinsman of the slain person."], [188, "[V.28. 170 HOMERIC SOCIETY: THE FAMILY. There is, of course, no such thing as written law in Homer. The word voyuog does not occur in the poems. Custom and ordinances are the foundation of justice. Nor is there any evidence of written contracts or agreements. In such a state of society everything depends on the truth of spoken evidence. For this reason, perjury is in Homer one of the worst of crimes. Like wrongs done to parents, it awakes the peculiar vengeance of the Erinys, and is punished by Persephone in the depths of Tartarus. \" Hateful to me as the gates of Hades,\" cries Achilles, \" is the man who hides one thing in his heart, and speaks another with his lips.\" 28. The family is already established on a strong and firm basis. This is a point in which we find a real and vital distinction between the Greek and alien nations. The polygamy of Priam, and the host of his sons and daughters, form a striking contrast to the monogamous relations which prevail among the Greeks. AVith them it is a rule not to introduce concubines into the houses of their wedded wives. Menelaus is an exception, for Megapenthes, his son by a slave, was brought up in his house at Sparta with Hermione, his daughter by Helen ; but this deviation from the respect due to a wife is excused by the fact that Helen had no son.1 The same strictness is not observed in the camp or on the voyage. Victorious chiefs make concubines of the women whom they capture, and even Odysseus, in spite of his determination to rejoin Penelope, enters into, relations with Circe and Calypso. From women, on the other hand, the strictest propriety was demanded.2 The Homeric virgin and matron always command respectful reverence. They are conscious of their 1 This was not the case with Theano. Yet Anterior had a son by another woman, and Theano tended him (II. v. 70). Laertes, on the other hand, would not approach Euryclea, for he would not vex his wife. 2 I do not agree with Prof. Mahaffy that the union of women with gods points to a low state of morality. \" I doubt the fact \" of such unions ; they were mere inventions to connect the divine and human."], [189, "V. 29.] SOCIETY: THE FAMILY\u2014 PENELOPE\u2014 HELEN. 171 position, and preserve it with a natural pride.1 In spite of her defenceless condition, and her long widowhood, no at tempt is made to force the wishes of Penelope. . . L Penelope. It is true that we must not ascribe too much importance to the Homeric poems in this respect. Other legends were not equally respectful towards Penelope. But the author of the Odyssey perceived that the noblest form of the legend was the only form suitable for a great epic. Whether others were more in accordance with the habits and facts of the earliest times in Greece, was a matter of little importance. It is obvious, also, that the picture of Helen presented in the Homeric epic is the only account which could be given without a dis- integration of the poems. Helen must be beautiful and attractive ; she must be a prize worth the winning for Paris,, the Trojans and Menelaus. At the cynical touch of Euri pides the whole vision is scattered, and moral questions intrude, which have no place in epic poetry. To inquire into the morality of Helen's character, to excuse or justify the description of her on the walls of Troy and in the palace of Menelaus, to point to it as an instance of the low tone which prevailed in antiquity in regard to sexual relations, is a mistaken application of criticism from which we can expect no result. The poet allows no reproaches to fall upon his heroine save those which come from her own lips ; but he does not hide or palliate the woe which she has brought upon his heroes. 20. In the harmony of wedded life the poet sees the crown ing height of human happiness. Such a union is the delight of friends, the envy of enemies. It forms the social hap centre of a prosperous home where neighbours Piness and kinsfolk are ever welcome to the feast. The Homeric heroes are no strangers to the pleasures of eating and drink ing. There is no lack among them of chines of pork and beef, of baskets laden with bread, and goblets brimming with 1 Very different are the pictures of women in the Teutonic epics, and even in the Morte a\" Arthur."], [190, "HOMERIC SOCIETY: AMUSEMENTS. [V. 30. 172 wine. But excess is unknown. Drunkenness is rarely alluded to in the epics, and always with contempt. The \" crowns \" of the feast are the lays of the minstrel, which he accompanies with the tones of his harp. To sit by the hospitable table and listen to the newest song is the goodliest of all the customs of men. Even the unknown stranger is freely admitted to the chieftain's hall, and allowed to take his fill of food before inquiry is made into his name and lineage, or the errand which has brought him from his home. 30. In the epic poetry of Greece we see the beginning of that delight in trials of strength and agility which became so remarkable and distinctive a feature of the Greek nation. The funeral of Patroclus is celebrated by games. Odysseus is entertained in Scheria by an exhibition of the skill of the Phaeacians, \" for there is no greater glory than that which a man gains with his hands and his feet.\" In answer to the taunt of the Phaeacian that he is unskilled in feats of strength Odysseus sends the quoit whizzing far beyond the utmost limit reached by those famous mariners. In days when a strong arm was needed for the protection of house and goods, great value was naturally ascribed to success in such contests. But other games also \u2014 even games of mere recreation\u2014 were not unknown in Homer. The suitors pass their idle hours in the courtyard of Odysseus's palace in throwing at a mark with spears and javelins, or they play at irea-a-ol, within the house. Dancing also is a favourite amusement, especially at the festivals of the gods. 31. This life of hospitality and enjoyment has of course its darker side. In the Trojan epic the shadow of the great war The sorrows hangs over all. The toils and sufferings of the of life. Achaeans on the windy plains of Troy, the long voyages in dangerous and unknown seas, are a never-failing source of sorrow. Sons or brothers, husbands or fathers, have fallen and left sad memories to those who remain. The uncertainty of life, the delusiveness of hope are deeply felt. There are two jars, the poet tells us, standing at the threshold of Zeus ; one filled with good things, the other with evil. To"], [191, "V. 3I-] HOMERIC SOCIETY: SORROWS OF LIFE. 173 some men Zeus gives unmixed evil, to others mixed good and evil, but unalloyed blessings are the lot of none.1 Achilles, the greatest of the Homeric Greeks, the son of a goddess, is dishonoured by Agamemnon, and pierced with anguish by the death of Patroclus, whom he cannot avenge without slaying Hector, on whose death his own must closely follow. In the bitterness of their sufferings the Homeric heroes do not hesitate to reproach the deities for the miseries of human life, and the gods echo the lamentations of men : \"Father Zeus, thou hast no fellow in doing mischief ; from thee above all gods cometh evil.\" \" Of all creatures that live and breathe upon earth there is none more sorrow-stricken than man.\" Man's life is fleeting as that of the leaves of spring ; for a little time he flourishes in prosperity, and then fades away. Over all his joys there is spread the gloom of death, which comes upon him he knows not when. His best hope is the despair of fatalism. He will not die before his time ; and when the day has come he cannot outlive it. Death, if not annihilation, is at least the extinction of the sensible warm motion of life, and the imprisonment of the delighted spirit in a region where strength and pleasure are no more. \" Speak not comfortably of death, 0 noble Odysseus,\" are the words of Achilles when in the under-world, \" I had rather be a serf on the land of the poorest than reign as king over all the dead.\" But amid these sombre reflections, the Homeric hero is not lost in vain regret or weak complaining. He goes out to do his duty let the cost be what it will. Birds may fly to east or west, but a brave man will fight for home and country, for that is the best of all omens. There is no Stoic attempt to repress natural feeling or underrate the sacrifice which a noble life entails ; the price must be paid, and duty must be done. There is no delegation of dangerous enterprises ; every man takes his allotted share. With sorrow and lamen tation the hero goes forth to achieve the glory which men \" shall hear of in days to come.\" 1 11. xxiv. 527."], [192, "HOMER'S INFLUENCE ON LITERATURE. [V. 32, 33. 174 32. It is thus that the Homeric poems gave the key note to Hellenic literature, and to Hellenism in the highest influence of sense.

The learning which is gathered up in later epics by Virgil or Dante or Milton confuses while it illumines them. Analysis takes the place of sympathy, and criticism dispels the illusion of art. In Homer all is simple, natural, undisguised. In this the Greek epic may be compared to Greek sculpture of the best period. A certain singleness of heart is needed if we would enter into the full meaning of those noble concep tions. We must look on human nature with an eye which can behold it without disguises. We must learn to connect nobility of mind with beauty and strength of body, and see in perfect loveliness and heroic courage, in Helen and Achilles, the ideals which have entranced the imagination of mankind. It has been finely said that Greek history begins with Achilles and ends with Alexander. The Greek epics were recited at festivals and taught in schools ; they influenced the poetic and pictorial art of Greece. They fixed the myths in forms which later thought was always interpreting anew, but never changed. They shaped the characters of great men. Few nations have received a more splendid legacy from the past, and fewer still have shown a deeper sense of their obli gation. III.\u2014 THE HOMERIC DEITIES. 33.

Those poets whom some thought to be earlier than Homer were in the opinion of the historian more recent.1 It is interesting 1 Herod, ii. 53."], [193, "V. 34] HOMERIC THEOGONY. 175 to know that even in the time of Herodotus there were no more ancient literary sources in existence from which he could derive information about the deities of Greece than the poems of Homer or Hesiod. And though we cannot follow him in attributing so great a change in the national religion as the creation of a theogon}' to two poets, however influential, or in joining Hesiod with Homer, there is no reason to doubt that the description of the gods which appears in the Homeric poems is to a very large extent the work of epic poets. Previous to Homer, Herodotus distinguishes two periods in Greek religion. In the first, which we must suppose to have been quite primeval, the gods were with- Gods without out names, attributes, or forms, though sacri- names- fices were constantly offered to them. The Pelasgians worshipped them merely as 6eol or \"arrangers,\" in the belief that those powers which had arranged the scheme of the world, had in their power the distribution of worldly blessings. After the lapse of a long period Names brought the names of the gods were brought from from Ee>'Pt- Egypt to Greece, and the Pelasgians, on consulting their oracle at Dodona, were bidden to adopt them. This account of the early Greek religion which Herodotus heard at Dodona need not detain us. It is not only a This account is fiction invented in order to connect the deities a fici\u00b0n- of Greece with the more ancient deities of Egypt, but a fiction at variance with the view which Herodotus takes of the Pelasgians. If these were a barbarous nation, as he asserts, how can they have given the name \" 6tol \" to their gods 1 Theos, in the sense here given to the word, is connected with the Greek word tilhemi, \"to arrange.\"1 34. We may postpone to another chapter the sources from 1 Herodotus derived his information from Dodona, and what authority had the priests or priestesses of Dodona ?

In the earliest period, when the Combination of country was inhabited by a number of tribes, Local Deities. dwelling apart in their cantons, there would be many local deities, more or less distinct from each other. Pausanias calls attention to the number of the regions in Greece which claimed to be the scene of the infancy of Zeus.1 Every tribe, we cannot doubt, was anxious to identify the tutelary god of the land with the supreme deity of Hellenic mythology. When these tribes became united into larger aggregates, either by conquest or by common expeditions, the srods whom they worshipped were brought Rendered neces- & p J rr o sary by the into contact with each other.

Thus from an early age it must have been the task of epic poetry to arrange in some kind of order the assemblage of deities worshipped by various tribes in different localities. 35. If, on the one hand, the task was rendered difficult by the exuberant imagination of the Greeks, which filled the world with deities, it was on the other hand greatly assisted by the Hellenic tendency to represent the gods in human Family relations f\u00b0rm> W1th human passions and desires.

For this reason poets may have found it necessary to speak of more than one class or description of deities. We shall find this to be the case in Homer. Hesiod, on the other hand, as a professed theogonist, ventures on a resolute attempt to bring all deities, whatever their nature and origin, into connection with each other in a comprehensive system. 36. The Olympic deities, as they are presented to us in the Homeric poems, assembled in the hall of Zeus on the summit of snowy Olympus, are creatures at The Homeric once divine and human. In endowing them Deities. with a divine nature, the poet has not succeeded, and often has not attempted to succeed, in raising them wholly above the limitations of their mortal counterparts, or in adhering consistently to his divine ideal. In bodily form they are of more than human stature.1 They have also the power to assume what shape they choose, Superhuman or to be at once visible and invisible. But and Human. their bodies are not insensible to wounds and pain. They require sleep and food ; and though their food is described as different from that of mortals, and their blood is not such as runs in the veins of men, yet they take part in sacrifices, and delight in the flesh offered to them. They are able to render aid from afar to their favourites when in distress ; yet in their absence their help cannot be obtained. Their powers of sight and hearing are almost without limit, yet Helios, the \" keen of sight,\" cannot see what is done to 1 Ares when felled to earth extends over seven plethra, and Hera is able to lay one hand upon the sea aud the other upon the earth, on the occasion of a solemn oath.

Zeus himself holds up a balance to enable him to determine the decree of destiny. He is deceived by Hera, who on her part is unable to penetrate the secret counsels of her consort. Ares is ignorant of the death of his son Ascalaphus,2 and even Proteus is unable to detect the guile which is practised upon him by Odysseus. In their power also, though omnipotent, the gods differ greatly. Zeus declares that with his single strength he is more than a match for all the other deities of Olympus. Even the happiness of the gods is far from perfect. Not only are there disputes in Olympus which trouble the serenity of the divine life,3 but their connections with mortal women cause the deities to have sorrows for the death of their children ; and their sympathy with human actions brings pain and distress upon them. 37.

But the gods of Homer are not sensual only; they 1 Od. iii. 231 ; xii. 375 ; viii. 280. 2 II. xiii. 521. 3 See the scene in //. xxi. 489 ff. between Hera and Artemis."], [197, "V. 38, 39-1 IMMORTALITY OF THE GODS. 179 are treacherous, envious, and even cowardly. Athena is sent from Olympus to bring about a breach in the truce which has been solemnly concluded between the Trojans and the Greeks ; the cowardly act of Pandarus is directly due to her instiga tion. Odysseus is honoured and beloved by the same goddess for his cunning and falsehood ; and Hermes \" gladly abetted \" Autolycus in all manner of perjury and guile. In their deal ings with each other, and with men, the gods made no scruple of employing whatever trick or falsehood was likely to assist them in their object. It is well known that these features of the Homeric mythology were the first to attract attention when the poems fell under criticism. From Xenophanes downwards they met with the severe reprobation of the philosophers of Greece. Happily we have no evidence to prove that mortal men attempted to shape their conduct after the pattern of the Olympian life.1 38. The only quality which is consistently attributed to gods and denied to men, and which therefore may be called the true mark of the divine nature, is immortality, immortality The gods are d8a.vo.TOi Kai dyqpaoi, \"without of the gods. death and age.\" By the gift of immortality Calypso offers to make Odysseus a god. By their immortality the divine beings are freed from the misery of the human lot. For them there is no death in store ; that black shadow does not lie across their paths to darken the enjoyment of the pre sent. Hence the gods are happy, \"and live at ease,\" while men are subject to weakness and misery. Nor is the languor of disease, or the helplessness of age, which leaves men exposed to the rapacity of their neighbours, felt in Olympus. 39. The deities which make up the Olympic circle are these : \u2014 Zeus, Apollo, Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes, Hera, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, and perhaps Themis and Deities of the Dione.

'When evening comes on they retire to the palaces which Hephaestus has fashioned for them.1 The gods also meet in session, and Zeus brings subjects of discussion before them, in the same way as an earthly king gathers the elders together for consultation.2 Besides this session, or council, we hear of a divine assembly3 to which the gods are summoned, as men were summoned to the agora, to hear the conclusion at which their superiors had arrived. For zeus a Zeus is sovereign among the gods, and though monarch. he may from time to time consider it prudent to avoid quarrels, his will is supreme in Olympus. Before Zeus also, as before an earthly king or SiKao-n-oko's dvi)p, causes are tried and complaints are made,4 and like an earthly king he retains his position in virtue of his superior power. On the other hand, in the Olympic form of government family relations are represented as underlying the tions' combined political arrangements. Zeus, Hera, Poseidon with civic in ancl Hades are related collaterally ; the rest of the gods are the children of Zeus. Hence Hera is a Trpiijfia Bed, a goddess queen, and Poseidon can claim rights against his brother. For when the kingdom of Cronus was divided, the heaven fell to Zeus, the sea to Poseidon, and the under-world to Hades, while Olympus and the earth were common to all. Nevertheless Poseidon owes a duty to Zeus as to an elder brother.

These are his ministers upon earth, for Zeus never allows himself to be visible to the eye of man. They are joined with him in the solemn form of oath : \" Father Zeus, Athene, and Apollo.\" It is remarkable that in the Homeric mythology Apollo by no means occupies the position which was assigned to him at a later period. He is the god of prophecy, but with the ex ception of the plague, which is caused by his resentment, his part in the action in the Iliad is subordinate. In the Odyssey he, like Hera, tends to disappear altogether. There is no trace in Homer of his function as a god of purification or of healing ; Paeon being quite distinct from Apollo even as late as the time of Solon.1 Athena, as a goddess . - Athena. favourable to the Hellenes, comes forward pro minently in the Iliad, and may be called the guiding spirit of the Odyssey. In spite of her opposition she is the favourite child of her father, who finds a quarrel with her \"more hateful \" even than a quarrel with Hera. Of her parentage we are told nothing in Homer ; the well-known myth, that she sprang from the head of Zeus, appears for the first time in Hesiod's Theogony, and the Homeric hymn to Apollo. 40. Though the gods who inhabit Olympus are the pro minent figures of the Homeric mythology, a crowd of divine beings is gathered round them, which may be subordinate arranged in the following groups : \u2014 (a.) The deities. Titans ; (b.) the subordinate or attendant deities in Olympus ; (r.) the deities which are obviously personifications of natural phenomena; (d.) the deities of the sea; (e.) the deities of the earth, and the Chthonian deities, whose home is under the earth. The relation of these subordinate deities to the Otympian family is not always clearly defined ; but in their various spheres they are able to influence both the processes of the physical world and the prosperity of man. 41. (a.) The Titans in the Homeric poems are a dynasty of 1 Buchholtz, Homerische Realien, part iii. 1, p. 19S."], [200, "SUBORDINATE DEITIES: TITANS\u2014 IRIS.

They appear to be a link connecting the mere personification of natural objects, with which Greek mythology begins (Oceanus and Gaea) and the human figures in the Olympic world. In this manner the somewhat shadowy forms of Cronus and Rhea form an antecedent stage to the fair humanities of the Olympic family. 42. (b.) Among the deities which occupy a subordinate place in Olympus, one of the most interesting is Iris, who in the Iliad is the messenger of the gods. The t : name, which is also the Greek word for \" rainbow,\" is a feminine form of Irus, a title given by the suitors in the Odyssey to the beggar at their doors, owing to his willingness to carry messages. That the rainbow should be considered as a connecting link between heaven and earth is not surprising; in the Eddas the rainbow is the bridge which connects earth and heaven. But as no satisfactory etymology of the name has been discovered, it is impossible for us to say whether Iris signified in the first instance a rainbow, and was afterwards used for \" messenger,\" owing to the conception formed of the rainbow, or whether, signifying messenger from the first, it was subsequently applied to the rainbow. It is a remarkable fact that Iris as a goddess is never mentioned in the Odyssey, though, as we have seen, the name Irus is there given to a messenger. Hermes is the divine messenger of the Odyssey. Of this strange discrepancy no satisfactory account can be given. It forms a considerable weapon in the armoury of those who contend that the Iliad and Odyssey are the work of different authors. 1 II. viii. 13, 479."], [201, "V. 43-1 DEITIES AND NATURAL PHENOMENA. 183 At the divine banquets the wine is served by Hebe, who also assists to harness the chariot of Hera, and tends Ares when wounded. The poet even represents her as aiding Ares in his bath, as the daughters of chieftains aid the guests in their father's halls.1 Among the chief delights of the Olympic palace are the responsive songs of the Muses. These deities are the daughters of Zeus, but it is doubtful whether their number was yet fixed. In the Iliad, at least, no distinct number is given ; at one time the \" Muse,\" at another the \" Muses \" are mentioned. They are also the teachers of song, from whom poets receive their gifts of memory and speech. The Hours have in their keeping the gates of heaven, and i i.i i \u25a0 . t,T The Hour are thus at hand to unyoke the chariot ot Hera and Athena when returning from Troy. In a more literal sense they are the goddesses of the seasons, by whose blessing the fruits of the earth flourish. The Graces, The Graces or Charites, are the constant attendants of Aphrodite, for whom they prepare the bath, and weave an \" ambrosial \" robe. It is from them that beauty comes to women. Of the three Graces whom we meet with in later mythology and art, Homer knows nothing. 43. (c.) In regard to the deities which more immediately represent the phenomena of nature, Eos, the goddess of morning, Helios, the sun-god, and the gods of Eos, Helios, the winds, we may observe that there is no the Wlnds complete division between the deities and the phenomena which are supposed to be the result of their operation. In one passage the words \"dawn,\" \"sun,\" \"west wind,\" are used in the same manner in which we use them ; in another, epithets or actions are ascribed to the Dawn or the Sun which compel us to regard them as persons. Thus \"Eos\" is \"rosy-fingered,\" or \"clad in saffron robe.\" Helios is the \" unwearied son of Hyperion.\" When Achilles was burning the body of Patroclus he offered prayers and vows to Boreas 1 II. v. 905."], [202, "184 DEITIES OF THE SEA.

The two winds hastily gather together a mass of clouds, hurry across the waters and blow upon the pyre till the body is consumed, when they retire to their home beyond the Thracian sea.1 To what extent the deity and the phenomena were separated in the poet's mind, it would be useless to inquire. The custom of later poets, who speak of fire as Hephaestus, or wine as Bacchus, must not mislead us into supposing that the Homeric personification is merely a poetical mode of speech. Among savages the changes of the natural world are always regarded as the work of persons, and it is the echo of this primitive mode of speech which causes Eos to be spoken of as a goddess, rising up each morning from the couch of Tithonus, and returning at night to rest by his side. 44. (d.) The sea, as might be expected, furnished the Homeric poet with a crowd of deities. Poseidon and Deities of the Amphitrite are the foremost. Though Posei sea- don is introduced into the Olympic circle as the brother of Zeus, his true home is in the waters. At the bidding of Zeus, Poseidon and Apollo had built walls for Laomedon of Troy, but when the time came for payment, Laomedon refused it.

The more fantastic of these deities, Proteus and his daughter, Ino, the Sirens and Scylla, belong to that \" outer circle \" of the Odyssey, to which the poet, with consummate art, has relegated all that is magical and weird in his story. They are creatures such as naturally live in the tales of mariners, and thus belong to another sphere of mythology than the loftier creations of epic poetry. There is no reason to suppose that they were of later origin than the deities of the Olympic circle. On the contrary, they seem to carry us back to the primitive forms of belief which existed in the minds of the common people. It is remarkable that the deities of the sea are regarded as possessed of superhuman knowledge. Nereus is spoken of as the \"truthful,\" the \"unerring;\" from omniscience of Proteus Menelaus receives information about sea delties his voyage home, and what he will find there. The Sirens know all that has happened at Troy, and all that is done upon the earth. In these weird creatures may be symbo lised the feeling which lures the sailor onward in the hope of discovery, till he meets his death amid the rocks of an unknown sea.1 The vastness and mystery of the ocean were also reflected in the deities which inhabited it. They cannot so easily be brought within the anthropomor limits of human life as the gods which dwell pWc than on earth or in heaven. There is no common link to combine the deities of the sea in Homer. An exception must, however, be made in favour of the Nereids.

There is no trace in Homer of the well-known myth of the rape of Proserpine. Demeter indeed never appears as an actor or speaker in any Homeric scene. In the Iliad she is the goddess of corn, whose gift is the bread of men ; and in the Odyssey we are told how she lay with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed field, thereby bringing upon him the wrath of Zeus. Dionysus was worshipped in Northern Greece. We read in the Iliad1 that \"Lycurgus, the wild son of Dryas, drove the nurses of the maddened Dionysus down divine Nyseion ; they scattered Dionysus. . . * . _ ' , ' , their wands and torches on the ground, struck by the ox-goad of Lycurgus, while Dionysus in terror plunged into the sea, and sought shelter in the bosom of Thetis \" \u2014 a passage of great value, for the evidence which it furnishes that the ecstatic worship of Dionysus was known at that early time. The opposition which Lycurgus here offers to the Dionysiac worship meets us again in the attempt of Pentheus to resist the introduction of such rites at Thebes.2 The nymphs are among the most pleasing of the Homeric divinities. They are the spirits of the mountains (Orestiades), of the woods, and of the springs (Naiads). The Nymphs. \u201e, , ' , , r? , they are also the daughters of Zeus, and re ceive worship from men. In Ithaca there was a grotto 1 II. vi. 130. 2 Without attributing historical value to these legends, there is no good reason for doubting that the worship of Dionysus, like that of the Muses, and even of Apollo, was known in the north of Greece before it became established in the south."], [205, "V. 45] HOMERIC DEITIES AND NA TURE. 187 sacred to the Naid-nymphs, \" where are bowls and jars of stone, and stately looms, whereat the nymphs weave their purple robes, the delight of the eye.\"1 The growth of trees, and sometimes the movements of animals, are due to their operation.

They follow Artemis when hunting ; and even the four attendants of Circe \"are born of the springs and the groves, and the holy rivers which flow down to the sea.\" By creations such as these the life of nature became an animated world ; the trees, the hills, the waters, were the abode of divinities, whose dwellings were sacred. We admire them as beautiful creatures of the imagination, but in the mind of the Greek they awakened feelings of awe and reverence for the world around him. Nothing is more striking in the Homeric conception of the deities than the close relation in which they stand towards external nature. There is no idea of any The relation of fixed, inevitable law in the world, such as we the deities to find, for instance, in the remarkable words of nature- Heraclitus, who tells us that if the \" Sun departs from his appointed path the Avengers will mark it and put him back.\"2 In the Odyssey Helios declares that if he is left without recompence for the loss of his oxen, he will \"go down to Hades and shine among the dead.\" And when Odysseus and Penelope are at length brought together, Athena holds back the night in her course for twice the usual space, that the hero may tell the tale of his wanderings to his wife. The gods are lords of nature, which is in deepest sympathy with them.

Nor are the divine beings insensible to the charms of scenery. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, is entranced with the beauty of Calypso's dwelling, and casts a lingering look on the fair scene before him ere he passes in to deliver the command of Zeus. This characteristic of the Homeric poems requires the greater attention, because in later times, when Greek poetry became lyric and dramatic, descriptions of natural scenery were out of place. 46. The under-ground (Chthonian) deities are by their nature gloomy and awful beings. Hades is the lord of the unseen world, \" the god whom none can soften or subdue ; abhorred and hated above all gods by mortal men.\" Persephone is not the beautiful daughter of Demeter, whom Aidoneus snatched away from \" that fair field of Enna,\" but the female counterpart of Hades, and, apparently (supra, p. 170), the more terrible deity of the two. In her keeping are the spirits of the dead. Nevertheless, gloomy as the under-world may be, it is not, except in the eleventh book of the Odyssey, the place of punishment which is described in later poems. But the elements of the later conception are already present. In the Iliad the Erinyes dwell under the earth, and exact penalties for perjury and ill treatment of parents.1 From that dark abode they can be summoned to do their work upon earth. Perhaps there is no more tragic scene in ancient poetry than that in the ninth book of the Iliad, where Althaea is described as invoking the Erinys to punish her son for the murder of her brother. \"Often did she pray to the gods in her anguish at her brother's death ; often with her hands she beat the earth, and cried unto Hades and dread Persephone, falling on her knees, her bosom wet with tears, to send death upon her son. And the Erinys that walks in darkness, the lady of a pitiless heart, heard her in Erebus.\" 3 Though the Erinyes are in 1 II. xix. 258. 2 Ibid. ix. 565."], [207, "V. 47- 48.] HOMERIC DEITIES: ERINYS, 6\u00bbc. 189 the first instance the ministers of the wrath of the infernal gods, their action is not restricted to the punishment of perjury or the ill-treatment of parents. They are the guardians of order in the world, and as such they check the voice of the horse of Achilles when he is prophesying his master's doom, which only the gods may reveal. The poor man who begs his bread, and the suppliant in need of help, are also under the protection of the Erinyes. Their vengeance is sometimes shown in the fatal blindness which misleads men into doing actions to their own hurt. It was through the act of the Erinyes that Agamemnon was deluded into his quarrel with Achilles. This doctrine, it will be seen, exercised a deep influence on the thoughts of later poets, especially of Aeschylus. 47. This enumeration gives a very imperfect idea of the multitude of divine personages who appear in the Homeric poems. Sleep and Death, Strife and Fear, personification are deities; Prayers, like the nymphs, are of abstractions. the daughters of Zeus ; with weary feet they follow in the steps of Delusion (Ate), to heal the mischief which she works. On the other hand, there are some remarkable omissions. Eros is not yet a deity, nor is he the son of Aphrodite. Nor is the moon personified as a female counter part of the sun. Nemesis is not yet a divine power. To us the personification of abstract words has become merely a poetical fancy ; but among the Greeks such deified abstractions were often worshipped as beings whose anger could be averted by prayer or sacrifice, from which we may infer that they were regarded as having a real existence. 48.

At one time it is Poseidon who summons the clouds, at another Zeus ; and Athena stills the wind which Poseidon has raised. It is obvious that without this freedom of action the divine machinery would be a very serious difficulty to the poet. Yet the freedom is not without limits. The gods do not willingly interfere with each other. Athena shrinks from any open dissension with Poseidon, however great her desire to bring Odysseus home ; and though all the gods are opposed to Poseidon in his bitter anger against Odysseus, they do not attempt to control his actions by force. 49, It was the universal belief of antiquity that, in very early ages, the gods had sojourned upon earth. But even the intercourse of epic poets regard this period as long past ; it gods with men. js oniy among the Phaeacians that the gods deign to sit at the meal, or meet the lonely wayfarer without turning from the path.1 In the heroic world the gods no longer associate with mortal women. They do not reveal themselves to men except on rare occasions, and to especially favoured individuals. The greatest deity, Zeus, never reveals himself at all, Hera and Poseidon but rarely. It is their ministers, Athena, Apollo and Hermes, who form, as it were, the connecting links between the human and divine world. These appear to men sometimes in their own shape, which is recognised, or in the form of men or animals. They are de scribed by Homer with characteristic features ; the eyes of Athena and Hera, the hair of Poseidon, are marked by un changing epithets. At other times the gods are said to be present, though they are invisible ; and it is not till their departure that the traces of their presence are discovered. When they would avoid each other they find it necessary to use some special means of concealment.2 Athena puts on 1 The Phaeacians are \"very near to the gods,\" like the Cyclopians and the wild tribes of the giants.

With these signs no special signification is connected ; thunder may portend hail or snow or war ; the rainbow is the forerunner of war or of a storm.

For \" all birds are not messengers of fate,\" so that it is necessary to have recourse to the \" watcher of omens,\" who can decide what appearance is ominous and what is accidental, or make clear the meaning of the portent. In dreams, also, divine intimations are conveyed ' ' J Dreams. to men, though these, like other omens, are often obscure, and require interpretation from the dream-seer.

They cannot command the appearance of an omen, good or bad ; they can only interpret what is sent without their interference or agency. 51. Sacrifices and prayers are the accepted means of winning and retaining the favour of the gods. The man who neglects either is in danger of bringing o \u201e \u00b0 . \u00b0 Sacrifices. upon himself the divine wrath. Sacrifice is a debt due to the gods, which may not be withheld from them.

[V. 52, 53 anger, sent the boar which ravaged his land. The wall which the Greeks built to defend their ships was raised without the sacrifice of hecatombs; \"built against the will of the gods, it remained unbroken for but a little time.\" Sacrifice, then, is a necessary portion of the Homeric religion, but all sacrifice is not offered by the same persons; we find that it is sometimes presented by priests, sometimes by kings in their political capacity, and sometimes by a father on behalf of his household. Private sacrifices are frequently mentioned; in fact, every action of life is accompanied with some thing which has more or less of the nature of a sacri fice. 52. The simplest form of sacrifice was the libation, which was poured at meals as a kind of grace, and before going to bed Libations and at uight, as well as on more solemn occasions. Prayers. On leaving Ithaca for their journey through the night, Telemachus and his companions poured \" a libation to all the gods, and chiefly to the grey-eyed daughter of Zeus.\" Prayers were, of course, still more frequent than sacrifice. Feeling his dependence on the divine power at every step, the Homeric hero was constantly offering prayer to one or other of the inhabitants of Olympus. The Homeric language distinguishes, though not invariably, the vow (tt'X'j) from the prayer ; and the prayer for the accomplishment of a wish (dpd) from the prayer for pardon (AtVi;.) In the last sense prayers are said to be the daughters of Zeus. Lame and wrinkled, with eyes askance, they walk painfully in the footsteps of Ate. \" If a man honours the daughters of Zeus, when they draw nigh, they hear his petitions, and bestow great blessings upon him ; but if he denies them, saying, ' Depart from me,' they return to Zeus, and entreat that Ate may visit the sinner, so that he may stumble and suffer for his sin.\" 53.

Of the progress of her power of Sparta. we have only the most meagre information, especially in the times which immediately followed the return of the Heraclids. We hear indeed that the Spartan king Sous acquired territory from the Clitorians, in the north of Arcadia, and that Eurypon, his son, conquered Mantinea. But these distant expeditions become extremely improbable when we subsequently find the Spartans defeated, and their king Charilaus captured, under the walls of Tegea, which lay between Sparta and Mantinea. x There is probably more truth in the legend of the attack of King Echestratus on the Cynurians, which led to the first war between Sparta and Argos.2 The internal condition of Sparta at this early period is 1 Plut.

Hero- Dissension and dotus attributes these dissensions, at least in strife. part, to the mutual animosity of the two royal families ; the twin sons of Aristodemus quarrelled all their lives, and their descendants after them did the same. Plutarch, on the other hand, speaks of quarrels between the kings and the people. Eurypon was the first to relax the stringency of the monarchical power, and from his time forward anarchy and confusion prevailed \u2014 the king and the people contending for the upper hand. This appears to have been the opinion of Aristotle, who mentions the \" tyranny of Charilaus,\" as though that king had attempted to emancipate his prerogative from the restrictions placed upon it. Whatever the cause, it is more certain than any other fact in early Spartan history that the condition of the country was for a long time one of internal strife and dissension. It was the great merit of Lycurgus to have put an end to this disastrous state of affairs.1 2. Lycurgus is the foremost name in Spartan history. Tra dition is nearly unanimous in describing this lawgiver as the author of the prosperity of Sparta, and the Lycurgus . un. founder of her peculiar institutions, but about certainty in re the date and the events of his life the greatest gar t0 lm' uncertainty prevailed.2 Herodotus, following the Lacedae monian account, describes him as the guardian of Leobotas, or Labotas, the fourth in the Eurysthenid line of kings.3 In the account usually accepted, he appears as the guardian of Charilaus, the seventh king in the Proclid line.4 Thucydides, 1 Hernd. vi. 52 ; Plut. Lye. 2 ; Arist. Pol. v. 12 = 1316 a. 2 Hellanicus ascribed the foundation of the state to Eurysthenes and Procles, for which he was censured by Ephorus, who pointed out that only Lycurgus had a shrine and yearly offerings, whereas the two kings, though founders of the state, did not even bequeath their names to their descendants. Strabo, p. 366. 3 Herod, i. 65 ; Paus. iii. 2, 3. 4 Ephorus in Strabo, p. 481."], [214, "EARLY SPARTA: LYCURGUS. [VI. 2. 196 though he does not mention Lycurgus, asserts that the form of the government had continued the same in Sparta for more than four hundred years before the end of the Peloponnesian war.1 In his opinion, therefore, the reforms of Lycurgus were introduced shortly before 804 B.C. This date is con siderably later than that usually given to Lycurgus, on the authority of the ancient chronologers, but it agrees with the position of Charilaus in the list of kings. If Theopompus began to reign in 786 B.C., and we allow twenty-four years for his predecessor, we reach 810 B.C. for the death of Charilaus, in whose reign important changes in the constitution of Sparta, without doubt, took place.2 Herodotus tells us that Lycurgus, when visiting the Delphic shrine, was hailed by the priestess as a being more The account of than human, and some authorities asserted Herodotus. that the Spartan institutions were revealed to him there.3 The Lacedaemonians, however, regarded Crete as the source of their peculiar arrangements. They were thus enabled to connect them with the great name of Minos, and derive their authority from Zeus himself. Later legends had much more to tell on the subject.4 Polydectes, the 1 Thuc. i. 18. 2 Plutarch, on the authority of Aristotle, supports the view that Iphitus, the reviver of the Olympian games, and Lycurgus were con temporaries. In the Politics, v. 12 = 131 6 a, Aristotle indicates that the reforms of Lycurgus were introduced in the reign of Charilaus, which must be later than 884, the usual date of the Olympiad of Iphitus and birth of Charilaus. If, however, we accept the later date of the Olympiad of Iphitus, which Callimachus placed 52 years (13 Olym piads) before 776 B.C. (not 108 years = 27 Olympiads), we get 828 B.C. as a possible date for Iphitus and Lycurgus. This agrees with the statement of Thucydides, and allows us to follow Aristotle in con necting Lycurgus with Iphitus and Charilaus. There was a doubt whether the legislation of Lycurgus fell in the time when he was the guardian of Charilaus, or in the reign of Charilaus. In any case, as no Laconians appear in the list of victors for the first fourteen Olympiads, it is improbable that the Spartans had anything to do with the foundation of the festival, or even shared in it for some time after 776 B.C.

As soon as the child was born \u2014 it of plutarch was a son \u2014 Lycurgus placed him in the care of the elders of the city, and not long after left the country to avoid any suspicion of a desire to usurp the royal power. In a series of travels, including visits to Egypt and India \u2014 countries which at that time can hardly have been known to the Greeks \u2014 he arrived at Crete, where the native institutions had already been borrowed by the Laconian colonists at Lyctus.1 Mean while, Sparta had fallen into a miserable state of disorder, which at length became so intolerable that Lycurgus, on his return, ventured to come forward in the market-place, accom panied by twenty-eight of the leading citizens, with proposals of reform. He had obtained certain rhetrae (ordinances) from the Delphian oracle, on which he now proceeded to remodel the constitution. When political order had been restored, he introduced the social institutions and training which he had observed in Crete.2 3. Plutarch confesses that little was known about Lycur gus.

What should we know of the Historians. Athenian constitution if we depended for our information upon Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon? But in the case of Sparta, it is doubtful whether much was known to contemporary historians,3 for even Thucydides remarks on the extreme difficulty of ascertaining the exact number of the Spartans who fought at Mantinea. Or a love of anecdote took the place of a more serious interest in history. Herodotus had been in Sparta, and could have told us about the training, the numbers of the Spartans, the ephors and the senate. He prefers to relate the stories of Ariston and his child, of the wives of Anaxandridas, of the death of Cleomenes, and the precocity of Gorgo. Such narratives were history in his day, when no one thought of describing institutions with which he was facniliar. In the next century there was a change. But we are unable to make much use of the industry of the historians, who, from the time of Aristotle, collected a number of details about the Later writers history of Sparta or Athens. Their works have perished, have perished. The meagre extracts which remain are disconnected and unsupported. The points which they touch are often unimportant, and of the earlier history 1 Plut.

Gilbert regards Lycurgus as a form of Apollo Lyceus ; see Busolt, I.e. p. 133, and ef. Cox, Statesmen, i. 12. Such views can hardly be treated seriously.

Then the people were to be arranged in tribes and 1 Plutarch's most trustworthy authority on Lycurgus is Aristotle. From older writers he quotes nothing of importance. Simonides is said to have stated that Lycurgus was the son of Prytanis and brother of Eunomus, contrary to the usual account. Critias praised the excellence of the Lacedaemonian cup, of which the colour con cealed the muddiness of water, and the shape prevented impurities from entering the mouth. Hippias, the Sophist, stated that Lycur gus was a great general. To the -account given in Herodotus of Spartan customs and of Lycurgus, Plutarch does not refer. Among later authorities are Dieuchidas, who was able to assign different mothers to Polydectes and Lycurgus ; Aristocrates, who takes Lycur gus to India; Hermippus, who gives the names of twenty of the twenty-eight Spartans who appeared in the market-place in sup port of Lycurgus, and Dioscorides, who maintained that Lycurgus did not lose his eye in the fray with Alcander, but was wounded only !

The division into tribes was not a new one ; from the first the Dorians at Sparta, as elsewhere, when free from the admixture of external elements, were divided into three tribes, Hylleis, Dymanes, Pamphyli, but it is possible that some changes were now introduced, regulating the internal arrangement of the tribe. In each tribe were ten Obes, of which we know nothing beyond the name. They appear to have been local divisions. As the Gerousia, including the kings, con tained thirty members, we may conjecture that each Obe was represented in the Senate, and therefore that the two kings were the representatives of two distinct Obes.1 The Archagetae are the kings, or leaders of the people. From time to time the community were to be sum moned to a meeting which was held between certain fixed limits \u2014 the Cnacion, i.e. the river Oenus, which falls into the Eurotas,to the north of Sparta, and Babyca,ie. the bridge over The Apeiia or the Eurotas at Sparta. Before the assembled Assembly. people measures were to be introduced that they might decide upon them, for no measure was valid which had not received the sanction of the whole people.

(3) frequent wars upon the same enemies. He is also said to have forbidden the use of coined money in Sparta. Neither gold nor silver was to be used for pur poses of exchange, but bars of iron, which by their small value and great bulk rendered money dealings on any large scale impossible. The iron of these bars was also made unusually brittle in order that it might be useless for ordinary purposes. Such precepts were doubtless observed at Sparta, though they may not have been derived from Lycurgus. The training which every Spartan underwent was intended to diminish the sphere of positive law as much as possible, and to encourage the utmost simplicity and even rudeness of life. But in the time of Lycurgus there were no written laws in existence.1 Nor was a coinage Probabl later introduced into Greece till after the time of Phidon {infra, chap. vii.). If therefore Lycurgus forbade the use of written laws and coined money, the regulations could only have been framed in a prophetic spirit, to meet a future contingency ! The violation of the third rule by Agesilaus in his frequent invasions of Boeotia was thought to have con tributed largely to the victories of the Thebans over the Spartans ; when the king was wounded, Antalcidas remarked that his wounds were a just retribution for teaching the art of war to those who had neither the skill nor the wish to fight.2 1 The iron coins were either \" spits \" (o/3eXoi) or \"cakes \" (nfKavop). They weighed a mina (605 grammes), and were worth IJd. The rhetrae must have been preserved orally, as seems to have been the case with laws in other states ; but there is no trace of metre in them. 2 Plut. Lye. 13. Plutarch looks on Lycurgus as a reformer, who put an end to anarchy among the rich and destitution among the poor. It is possible that the contrast of rich and poor, which he de scribes, existed in early times at Sparta, but it is also possible that the circumstances of the third century B.C. have been transferred to the eighth or ninth."], [220, "202 SPARTAN POLITICAL CONSTITUTION. [VI. 6. 6. About a century after Lycurgus, in the reign of Theo pompus, two changes of great importance were made in the changes under Spartan constitution. The veto which the Theopompus. earlier rhetra had allowed to the assembled people was cancelled, and a new law was introduced, which gave the ultimate control to the Gerontes and Kings. \"If The people de- tne Pe\u00b0ple decide crookedly, the elders and privedofthe chiefs shall put it back,\" i.e. shall reverse the popular decision. Under what circumstances this ordinance, which is said to have been obtained from Delphi, was passed, we do not know, nor is it quite clear how it consists with what we find recorded of the constitutional history of Sparta in later times. It would seem to render the assembly altogether useless except for the confirmation of measures upon which the kings and the senate were agreed. Yet we find the assembly convened to decide upon the question of the Peloponnesian war, and Thucydides speaks of it on that occasion as the \" customary assembly.\" Herodotus also, though he does not mention the assembly, speaks more than once of the \" Community \" of Sparta, as a body whose authority was decisive in matters of peace and war. Cleo menes was repelled from Aegina by Crius with the taunt that he had come without the authority of the \" Community,\" and the question of a treaty between Sparta and Argos, just before the invasion of Xerxes, was referred to them. In Xenophon the action of the assembly is frequently men tioned.1 The second innovation was even more important. Though Herodotus ascribes the institution of the Ephoralty to Lycurgus, it seems more cor rect to follow Aristotle and others in ascribing it to Theo pompus.2 The Ephors, who were five in number, appear in the first instance to have been of no great importance.3 But as they were intimately connected with the commons, elected 1 Thuc. i.

In time the ephors grew to be the most important officers in the state, both in war and in peace. They were associated with the council, they presided in the assembly, and even the kings were not exempt from their power. To this result the growing dread of \"a tyrannis,\" like that at Corinth or Sicyon, and the increasing importance of the Spartan training, which the ephors superintended, in a great measure contributed.1 It is impossible for us to trace the various steps in the growth of the Spartan constitution. The habitual reserve of the Spartans, and the want of any historical account of the period in which the constitution hittScS ac-a grew up, compels us in speaking of the Spartan count of the state to treat it as a whole, and give an out- tupt^nan cons ' line of the constitution as it existed at the time when it is best known to us. We have reason to believe that great changes, besides those already recorded, were introduced at Sparta long after Lycurgus. Chilon (590-560 B.C.), especially, may have introduced many reforms, and greatly developed the elements already in existence. Such at least is the natural inference to be drawn from the respect in which his name was held at Sparta. In the account which follows chronology is disregarded, and the Spartan state is described without reference to the earlier or later origin of the various parts. I.\u2014 THE KINGS. 7.

The libation also began with them, and the skins of the victims were theirs. Every new month, and on the seventh day of each month, a full-grown victim was given to each king for sacrifice to Apollo, a bushel of barley, and a \" Laconian quart\" of wine. In time of war, when a sacrifice was needed for taking omens, they might use any sheep which they found on the way. Of Offer sacrifice. all that was sacrificed, the skins and chines belonged to them.

In later times, the heir to the throne was excused from the training, but the king was compelled to dine with his fellows.1 In their judicial capacity the kings decided about the marriage of heiresses who represented a family \u2014 i.e. when an orphan heiress was claimed by one or judeeLkTcases more reiatlves on the score of their kinship, relating to heir- the king decided which of the claimants was puSbiicroads!\u00b0nS' to preferred.2 All adoptions took place before them.

The king was succeeded by his eldest son (unless dis qualified by some grave bodily defect), and this rule was observed even when the father had been deposed ; but a son born before the accession of his father to the throne, was passed over in favour of the eldest son born after the acces sion. If an infant, the heir to the throne was placed in the guardianship of the nearest agnate, who also succeeded when the direct line failed. So far as we know, the two lines of kings never intermarried ; and they had separate places of sepulture in differents parts of the city, the Agiads being buried in the \"plot of Theomelidas,\" the Eurypontids near the temple of Dictynna. The origin of the dual monarchy, which from the first was so distinctive a feature of the Spartan government, is very origin of the obscure, and many attempts have been made dual monarchy, to explain it. It may have arisen by a fusion of the native and immigrant races, each of which was allowed to retain its own prince in the new community. In support of such a theory it may be said that the Dorians, according to the legend, were invited to Sparta by Philonomus (p. 63), who, however, we must add, persuaded the reigning sovereign to retire before the immigrants. It is also a fact that one at least of the Spartan kings claimed to be of Achaean descent. On the other hand, it may be urged that an Achaean prince would not come to terms with invaders when he could be received among his own people at Amyclae, an important Achaean city to the south of Sparta, which retained its independence till the reign of Teleclus.1 Another explanation assumes two colonies of Dorians, one planted on the Oenus, the other at Sparta. At first the two settlements were at variance, but after the defeat of Charilaus by the Tegeatae, they agreed to form one city in which each king should retain his authority.2 Such a double settlement, if it ever existed, 1 Legend stated that Philonomus received the throne of Amyclae from the Dorians ; Ephorus in Strabo, p. 364 ; Nie.

It is perhaps more reasonable to assume that the two kings represent two leading families, each of which had a claim to give a chief to the community. That two families holding equal rights should be regarded as descended from the twin sons of the Dorian founder of Sparta is merely one of the fictions which of necessity arose in the period when all political unions and arrangements were expressed in the terms of genealogical connection.1 I I.\u2014 THE GEROUSIA OR SENATE. 9. The Gerontes or Senators were twenty-eight in number, or thirty, with the addition of the two kings. Among other curious explanations of this number given in the Lycurgus of 1 Professor Duncker, loc. cit., regards the double settlement as a demonstrated fact. He appeals to legends which connect Procles closely with the Argives. But if one legend represents Procles (the assumed founder of the colony on the Oenus) as in close connection with Temenus the king of Argos, whose territory lay on his border, another legend represents Echestratus and Labotas, of the Eury sthenid line, as making war upon Cynuria and Argos (Paus. iii. 2, 2), and it is difficult to see how they could have done this if a community friendly to Argos existed on the Oenus. Nor is it credible that a period of disaster such as the capture of Charilaus by the Tegeatae would lead to a union of the two hostile communities, as Duncker assumes. On the contrary, the calamity which overtook the settlement on the Oenus would be the opportunity of Sparta, which could at once advance upon her prostrate rival, and put an end for ever to the dissension. With regard to the difficulties raised by Duncker against the theory that one of the Spartan kings was of Achaean race, the representative of a native dynasty, it may be observed that there is no evidence to show that the relations of Sparta and Amyclae were not in the first instance amicable, as they were between Cresphontes and the chiefs of the Messenians. If this is the case there is nothing improbable in the existence of an Achaean dynasty at Sparta, in spite of the close proximity of Amyclae. It was not till the Spartans found their territory too small for them, that they turned upon their former allies.

As the obes were thirty in number it is probable that each obe furnished a senator, the two kings being the hereditary representatives of two obes.1 The office was tenable for life, but no one could be elected who was less than sixty years of age. The election was by Election of acclamation. Whenever a vacancy occurred the senators. people were assembled, and the candidates passed through the assembly in an order determined by lot. The candidate who was received with the loudest applause was elected. The difference in the applause was decided by certain persons sitting in a building adjacent to the place of meeting, who could hear the noise but could not see the candidates.2 We have no precise information on the duties of the senators. Under the arrangement of Lycurgus they must have prepared matters for the decision of the Apella or General Assembly ; but after the time of Theopompus, they, in conjunction with the kings, could pass a final decision. They appear to have formed a supreme court of law, before which even the kings could be tried, and which was alone competent to decide on the more serious offences, and more esjiccially on homicide.3 In some cases the ephors seem to have been associated with them.4 Demosthenes speaks of the Gerousia as \" controlling the constitution\" of Sparta, and election into it as the supreme reward of civic virtue. Yet we do not find the 1 The senators were not elected by the obes, but by the whole people, but there is nobbing to show that when a vacancy occurred the members of the obe whose representative had died, were not alone qualified to present themselves for election.

They were the supreme executive power in the city, in which capa city they seem to have acted, at times, without consulting the Assembly. Ambassadors from foreign states applied to them.1 The ephors were also the first police magistrates in the city. Under their control was the education and training of the youth, and the conduct of the men. They could fine whom they chose, and exact the fine at once. They were supreme over all other officers, from whom, at the close of the year of office, they received an account. They could interfere with the private life of the kings to such an extent as to order them to repudiate a wife who bore no children. Every month the kings swore before them to rule according to the constitution, and the ephors undertook on their part to maintain the kings in office.2 They could also order the expulsion of foreigners from Lacedaemon.3 Their direct judicial functions were not important, being concerned chiefly with civil suits.4 In these, as in all their functions, they were not limited by any written laws.5 The Lacedaemonian constitution continued without change longer than any other in Hellas.

More important for the development of Sparta than her political constitution was the education and training which her citizens received ; the dyuiy-q, as it The education was called. The Spartan did not exist for him- of the Spartans. self but for his city ; for her service he was trained from birth, and the most intimate relations of his life were brought under her control. In the secluded valley of the Eurotas, where till the time of Epaminondas no invader ever set foot, amid profound peace, he nevertheless led the life of a warrior in the field. His strength and endurance were tested to the utmost; he was not permitted to surrender himself to the charm of family life and domestic affections. Even when allowed to marry, he spent but little time at home ; his children, if thought worthy of life, were taken from him at an early age to go through the same training in which he him self had been brought up. Only when he had reached the age of sixty years, at which he could no longer serve his country in the field, was he permitted to enjoy the feeling of personal freedom. Trade and handicraft \u2014 in fact any occupation which could be either useful or productive \u2014 were absolutely forbidden to him. At his birth, a male child was carried before the elders of the tribe, who decided whether the infant was sufficiently strong to be reared. If not, he was at once disposed of on Mount Taygetus ; if, on the other hand, the child was vigorous and healthy, he was carried back to the house of his parents, there to remain, in the care of the women, till he reached his seventh year. ... , ., , . , , In childhood.

[VI. 13. children were arranged in companies, each with a chief and leader, selected from the Iranes \u2014 i.e. from those who were more than twenty years of age. The whole number of boys and youths was divided into three classes : the iralSes, from the age of seven to eighteen ; the peWipaves, from eighteen to twenty ; and the ipaves, from twenty to thirty. After the age of thirty, a Spartan became one of the Peers (Spotoi). From twelve years of age, or even earlier, the systematic training began. The hair was cut short, the feet were bare, _.. and often the whole body entirely naked. One garment only was allowed in summer and winter ; every one made such a bed as he could out of reeds plucked from the banks of the Eurotas.1 Each year the boys of a certain age underwent a severe whipping before the altar of Artemis Orthia, in which he who endured the longest was adjudged the victor. Plutarch speaks of instances within his own knowledge, in which boys had died under the lash. The food supplied was intentionally stinted in order that the youths might add to it by theft, for which they were only punished when detected in the act. The gymnastic exercises . . were numerous and competitive, but the mental Mental training. x ' culture did not go beyond reading and writing, learning the songs of Tyrtaeus, Terpander and others.

They also had their exercises, separate from the boys, in which they appeared with little or no clothing ; and at stated times boys and girls appear to have contended openly in the presence of each other.

Aristotle tells us that Lycurgus attempted to bring the women of Sparta under control, but failed. For want of proper restrictions they became dis orderly and licentious, and at the same time exercised great influence over the men. About the influence there is no doubt. In Herodotus, Spartan women are represented as the advisers of the men. When Demaratus sent word to Sparta of the intended invasion of Hellas by Xerxes, he wrote the message in a folding tablet on the wood, which he then covered with wax. The tablet was opened at Sparta, and presented a blank surface ; the authori ties were at a loss, till Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes, and wife of Leonidas, suggested that the writing would be found underneath the wax.1 In the time of Aristotle they had become possessed of two-fifths of the landed property of the country ; and the picture which Plutarch has drawn of Sparta in the reigns of Agis and Cleomenes exhibits a con dition of affairs so extraordinary as to be almost incredible.2 The number of Spartans who could afford to pay their con tributions to the Phiditia had sunk to seven hundred, of whom a hundred only had any landed property ; while the women interfered openly in the management of state affairs. The charge of licentiousness has less support. Aristophanes describes the women of Lacedaemon as coarse and indelicate, yet remarkable for their physical vigour and beauty. But it is a significant fact that Cinadon was bidden to bring from Aulon the woman who \" was said to be most beautiful, and seemed to be active in corrupting the Lacedaemonians, young and old, who visited the place.\"3 14. With the training was connected the festival of the 1 Herod, vii. 239 ; Aristotle (Pol. ii. 9 = 1269 6) tells us that in the days of the Empire of Sparta many things were managed by their women. 2 Arist.

The state for the time put off the severity of Spartan manners. Strangers were allowed to be present. Those who had been successful in the training could now show themselves in their beauty, strength and skill. It was the festival at which Sparta \" mewed her mighty youth,\" and in every Spartan it woke feelings of joy, enthusiasm and hope. For this reason the unmarried were not allowed to be spectators of the Gymno paediae. Those who for their part left their country solitary and childless forfeited their right to enjoy the fair spectacle of the youthful bloom and promise of the city.1 15- Every Spartan over twenty years of age was a member of a Phidition or common meal, at which he was compelled to attend, unless absent on a hunting expedition, or offering sacrifice at home. Each Phidition consisted as a rule of fifteen members ; if a vacancy occurred it was filled up by the unanimous vote of the body. The expenses were paid by the members, each of whom furnished monthly a bushel (Aeginaean) of barley meal, eight choes of wine, five minae of cheese, two and a half of figs, and a small sum of money.2 16. Marriage was regarded as the duty of every citizen, the neglect of which was punished in various ways. Unmarried men, as we have seen, were not allowed to be spectators at the Gymnopaediae, nor did they receive from the younger members of the community the marks of respect which were usually given to older men. They were also compelled to go round the marketplace in the severity of winter, clad in an under garment only, and singing 1 Athen. p. 550 ; Plato, Laws, p. 633. 2 Plut. Lye. 12.

I7-] SPARTAN MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. 215 songs to their own discredit. The form of marriage was a simulated abduction, the bridegroom carrying off his bride by force. The hair of the bride was clipped, she was attired in a man's dress and shoes, and in this disguise she came into a darkened room, where she was visited in secret by her husband. This secrecy continued for some time, the husband spending the day with his fellows and returning from these stolen interviews to sleep among them. It sometimes happened that children were born before a man had seen his wife by day. When it came to an end, the husband removed his wife to his own house. In regard to the sanctity of the marriage tie, the Spartans were notoriously indifferent. Their ideas of married life and morality had less reference to domestic virtues than to the requirements of the state and the race. If intrigues were unknown, arrangements were openly made which were quite at variance with tender feeling, in order to secure progeny of a vigorous and healthy strain.1 17. How much of this system of training is due to Lycurgus it is impossible to say with certainty. The authorities from whom we receive our accounts ascribe it with- Was the train_ out hesitation in all its details to him. But as ing due to the rules which forbade the use of written laws Lycureus ? andcoined money can only be ascribed to Lycurgus by assuming that written codes and a coinage were known in the ninth cen tury B.C., we perceive that these statements are not wholly to be trusted. It is obvious that the training of the boys and girls at the public expense could not take place till the state was in a position to provide the means for it ; nor could the Spartans furnish their quota to the Phiditia unless they were in possession of land from which to receive it.

[VI. 18. cise amount of territory belonging to Sparta at the time of Lycurgus was, we cannot say, but if the Achaeans were still at Amyclae and the Messenians were independent, it cannot have been very large. Those arrangements, which required Much of it was a considerable amount of property on which probably later, the Spartans could live in idleness, were prob ably introduced after the Messenian wars.1 After that time also the management and control of the newly acquired territory demanded the utmost vigour on the part of the conquerors, who were numerically a very small minority, and this vigour it was the object of the training to provide. The institution of the choric songs, which formed the lighter side of the Spartan training, was certainly later than Lycurgus ; the accompanying music was due to Terpander, Thaletas, Sa cadas, and others. The Gymnopaediae, which were the crown of the system, were established after the First Olympiad. 18. It is stated by Polybius that the Spartan territory was originally divided into equal portions. Plutarch is more precise. He tells us that Lycurgus made nine thousand Division of lots in Sparta for the Spartans, and thirty the land. thousand in Laconia for the Perioeci. Of this arrangement Herodotus in his account of Sparta, and Aristotle in his criticism of the Spartan constitution, say nothing. On the other hand, each of these authors presupposes that every Spartan had property enough to permit him to devote his whole energies to the state. It is natural to suppose that when the Spartans extended their borders by the conquest of Laconia and Messenia, most of the conquered territory was divided among the conquerors. This is not the same thing as a division of lands by Lycurgus; but as those who might have been contemporaries of Lycurgus possessed plots of land, the least of which was at any rate adequate to maintain a Spartan at the Phiditia, it is not impossible that in an age of great inequality of landed property, and diminution of citizens, men should look back to the more prosperous con- 1 Cf.

It was the boast of the Spartans that there had at no time been a redivision of property in their country.1 The contribution to the Phiditia was a condition of Spartan citizenship.

Another account, preserved by Plutarch, puts the Spartan lots at 6000, and says nothing of the Perioeci. See Busolt, Or. Gesch. i. 100 note 4. That differences in wealth existed in Sparta at an early time is proved by Grote ; and a Spartan can hardly have had any other wealth but land. 2 Of the Spartans who had been taken captive in Pylus, we are told (Thuc. v. 34): \"Fearing (i.e. the Spartans) lest their own citizens who had been taken in the island, and had delivered up their arms, might expect to be slighted in consequence of their misfortune, and if they retained the privileges of citizens, would attempt revolu tion, they took away the right of citizenship from them, although some of them were holding office at the time. By this disqualification they were ineligible for offices, and lost the legal right to buy and sell. In time, however, their privileges were restored to them.\""], [236, "218 SPARTANS, PERIOECI, AND HELOTS.

The former are said to have numbered Perioeci. 30,000. They were the conquered Ionians or Achaeans,2 who, perhaps because they offered no great resist ance, were able to obtain favourable terms from their con querors. They lived in towns in the country managing their own affairs, under the superintendence of Spartan governors, renting landed property for which they paid tribute to Sparta, and engaged in trade. They served in the army as heavy armed soldiers, of which force they constituted the greater part, under the command of Spartan officers. The Helots are said to have derived their name from Helos, the last city subdued by the Spartans. They formed the lowest and most numerous class of sub jects, especially after the conquest of Messenia, but we have no means of fixing their numbers. They were not so much slaves as serfs, the property of the state rather than of individuals, for their masters could not sell them, and a public act was required for their manumission. They lived on plots of land, paying a certain fixed amount of pro duce to the owners. In time of war they accompanied their masters to battle (at the battle of Plataea each Spartan was attended by seven Helots), and even served as light-armed soldiers in the army or as sailors in the fleet. On rare occasions they were allowed to serve as heavy-armed soldiers. Though the Helots do not appear to have been in abject poverty,3 their lot was regarded as a very hard one, and the 1 Herod, (vii. 234) puts the force of Sparta at about 8000, and even this is not higher than that of Naxos.

We are told that whenever mention was made of the Spartans among them they were ready to eat them raw.1 The Spartans were in constant terror of a rising, and took severe measures to prevent it. Among these was the Cryptea, a kind of detec tive service, in which Spartan youths were sent round the country to watch the Helots and remove any who appeared to be plotting against the state. On entering office, the ephors declared war against them. On the other hand, Helots who had shown bravery in the Spartan cause were sometimes allowed their liberty,2 and the children of Helots were at times brought up as Spartans (Mothakes). Helots who had received their liberty were called Neodamodes.3 20.

Youths who, though not of Spartan birth, were sent to Sparta for the training were called Trophimi (Xen. Hell. v. 3. 9) ; among these were Xenophon's two sons. Famous among the Mothakes were Lysander, the son of Aristocritus, the Heraclid, and Gylippus, the son of Cleandridas (but see Busolt, loc. cit. p. 104, note 4). The Neodamodes are first men tioned in the Peloponnesian war : in connection with Helots they were sent, 421 B.C., to occupy Lepreum (Thuc. v. 34). In 413 B.C.

Nicander, the successor of Charilaus, invaded Argos, but without any lasting result (infra, ch. vii. \u00a7 3). He was assisted in his enterprise by the Dryopians of Asine, a town on the Argolic gulf. More important were the successes of Teleclus.

They said that certain descendants of the Argonauts, who had been expelled from Lemnos by the Pelasgi, came to Laconia, and lighted fires on Mount Tay getus. The Lacedaemonians sent to inquire who the strangers were, and whence they came. When they heard that they were Minyae, they sent again and inquired what was their object in coming to the land and lighting a fire. They answered that they had been driven out from Lemnos by the Pelasgi, and had come to their fathers to ask for a home and territory. The Lacedaemonians agreed to receive them, as the Tyndarids had taken part in the voyage of the Argo. Land was allotted to them, and they were embodied in the tribes ; they were also allowed to marry Spartan women.1 In time they assumed a less humble attitude, and made demands with which the Spartans could not comply. It was resolved to put them to death, and they were thrown into prison. Their wives, who were Spartan women, begged to be allowed to visit their husbands, and, when permission was granted, they availed themselves of the opportunity to exchange garments. The women remained in prison, the men escaped, and returned to Taygetus. At this time Theras, the grandson of Tisamenus, and descendant of Polynices, was taking out a colony from Sparta. He was uncle to the sons of Aristodemus, and had been their guardian. Now that they were grown up, he was anxious to be out of the way, that he might not be subject to those whom he had previously governed. His destination was the island of Thera, then called Calliste(\"most beautiful\"), which was governed by the descendants of Membliarus, a Phoenician. In order to avoid bloodshed, Theras offered a share in his enterprise to the Minyae.

This festival the Dorian conquerors took over from the Amyclaeans.2 It was celebrated at the end of the month Hecatombaeus (July), and lasted three days. On the first day the offering of the dead was brought to Hyacinthus. His urn was opened, and the ashes drenched with wine and milk.3 The funeral feast was then eaten in solemn silence. On the next day, which was sacred to Apollo, the rites were more cheerful. The day began with a great procession in which all the Amyclaeans, a large proportion of the Spartans, and many of the neighbouring population, took part. The procession was accompanied by a poem in anapaestic measures, and ended with the presenta tion to the god of the robe woven by the Spartan women.4 The remainder of the day was occupied with a sacrifice and feast and various kinds of amusements. The third day was 1 Herod, iv. 145-149. This account of the Aegidae is at variance with that which derives the family directly from Thebes. Conon, Narr. 36 and 47, connects the fall of Amyclae with the colonisation of Melos. But it is obvious that the Dorians in Peloponnesus would not send out colonies by sea till they had reached the coast. There were Aegidae in Thera (Pind. Pyth. v. 101). 2 Herod, ix. 7 ; Xen.

However unhistorical the conception which Plutarch has formed of Lycurgus, it is clear and intelligible. In his mind Lycurgus was, firstly \u2014 The Great Reformer, who (a) put an end to the contests between the kings and the people by establishing the senate ; and (b) reduced rich and poor to a level : (1) By a redivision of lands. (2) By a common training. (3) By establishing common meals, at which all ate the same fare. (4) By destroying luxury and making money useless. And secondly \u2014 The Great Lawgiver, from whom all the institutions of Sparta, so far as they concerned civic life, were derived. Lycurgus did not, as Aristotle thought, fail with the women ; he included them in his education \u2014 and with success. Plutarch at any rate forms a very different opinion of the Spartan women from Aristotle. The guiding principle of Lycurgus was the rule that virtue is the same in the state and in the individual \u2014 legislation is education. Lastly, Lycurgus was eminently a man of -peace. Plutarch again differs from Aristotle in ascribing the Cryptea to a period far later than Lycurgus. Nor does he mention the peculiar arrangements of the Spartan army, except so far as 1 The worship of Hyacinthus by the Amyclaeans was probably of Oriental (not Aryan) origin.

[VI. 23. they arise out of the training. Among the institutions of Lycurgus, on the other hand, he includes a large part of such mental training as existed at Sparta, and even states that the way for his reforms was smoothed by the influence of Thaletas, the Cretan poet. Plutarch's beautiful narrative is written in the belief that a great man may form the character of a nation ; and in his eyes there is no higher moral virtue than the sacrifice of the individual and the family to the state. Not very different were the thoughts which passed through the mind of Plato when he drew the outlines of his ideal state. Among the Spartans \" obedience was the bond of rule.\" Only the infusion of a nobler spirit, the proposal of a loftier aim, were needed to transform such a constitution into an ideal city. At Sparta also the philosopher saw, or thought that he saw, the foundation of a new order of society in which the evils arising from private property and the family were removed or at least mitigated. Was it possible to go a step further in this direction, and reach a height where avarice would be unknown, and sexual passion become a less absorbing motive in the actions and lives of men? These visions have faded away. Sparta herself perished through the avarice and licentiousness of her citizens, and if we wish to find parallels to her institutions in modern times, we must seek for them not among the governments of civilised men, but in the brutal customs of savages. Yet it is not impossible that a time may come when, owing to the pressure of population or the severe necessities of war, the Spartan constitution may once more be exalted into the position of an ideal polity."], [243, "CHAPTER VII. ARGOS, ELIS, ARCADIA, ACHAEA. ARGOS. I. In the earliest times Argos was the greatest of \" all the cities in the country which is now called Hellas,\" and even in the middle of the sixth century her domain extended along the coast as far as Malea, and included Cy thera.1 Of the manner in which she obtained this extent of territory, whether it was part of the kingdom of the old Achaean city or a subsequent conquest, there is no record. Nor can we say how it was governed. The Cynu rians are called Perioeci ; the Orneatae and Cleonaeans were, at any rate in later times, subject allies of Argos, and we hear of slaves or Gymnetes, who may have been in Argolis what the Helots were in Laconia.2 But of the relation in which Argos stood after the Dorian invasion to the ancient and famous strongholds of Mycenae and Tiryns, we know nothing. These cities continued to exist, for we find them 1 Herod, i. 1. 82. 2 The Cynurians are mentioned in Herod, viii. 73 as Ionians who had become Dorized by the Argives, \" and were Orneatae and the Perioeci.\" If correct, this passage means (1) that the inhabitants of Orneae were Cynurians no less than the inhabitants of Cynuria ; (2) that the Cynurians were Perioeci (of Sparta ?). [It is often said, on the strength of this passage of Herodotus, that the Perioeci at Argos were called Orneatae, but perhaps without sufficient reason. The inhabitants of Orneae are never called Perioeci, but \"subject allies;\" and Pausanias (iii. 2. 3) evidently thinks that the Cynurians (who are called Perioeci) were Perioeci of Sparta, before they were conquered by Argos, infra, p. 227.] For the slaves, see Herod, vi. 83.

We are told by Pausanias that the Messenians, on the outbreak of the first Messenian war, were willing to refer The Argive their quarrel with the Lacedaemonians to the Amphictyony. \" Argive Amphictyony.\" 2 Of the nature and authority of this association the accounts are very meagre. It is asserted by C. 0. Miiller and subsequent writers that Argos was the head of a confederacy, the members of which met in the temple of Apollo Pythaeus, on the Larissa of that city ; Cleonae, Phlius, Sicyon, Epidaurus, Troezen and Aegina are mentioned as the confederates, all Dorian cities which derived their origin, directly or indirectly, from Argos, and formed portions of the \" lot of Temenus.\" The basis of the union was the worship of the common deity, but with the religious duties certain political obligations were connected. It is even stated that the members of the con federacy were expected to supply forces at the request of Argos.3 The evidence for these details is very slender. It is probably true that the Dorian cities of north-eastern Peloponnesus were held together by a loose confederation, which, while allowing independence to the cities, operated as a check to prevent them from making war upon each other. But there is no reason to connect this political league \u2014 so far as it deserves the name \u2014 with the worship of Apollo 1 Herod, vii. 202 ; ix. 28.

The successors of Temenus on the throne were Cisus, Medon, Thestius, Merops, Aristodamidas, Eratus, Phidon. So far as we know, these kings succeeded each other in an unbroken line, but the power of mss c the monarchy was greatly curtailed under Medon. After his reign nothing but the title remained to the king.2 In this period (the ninth century B.C.) began the lasting quarrel between Argos and Sparta for the possession of Cynuria, which formed the border-land between the two states. In the reign of their king Echestratus the Spartans, on the pretext that the Cynurians were making raids upon their kinsmen the Argives, expelled a number of them from the 1 It is clear from Thuc. v. 53 that the Argives had control over a temple of Apollo Pythaeus, to which, as they asserted, the Epidaurians were bound to pay tribute for the use of certain lands. We also know that there was a temple of Apollo Pythaeus at the foot of the Larissa of Argos (Paus. ii. 24. 1). If this temple is meant, why, as Poppo observes, should Thucydides remark that the Argives were KvpioiTaToi of the shrine ? Such an expression would be more naturally applied to the temple of Apollo Pythaeus at Asine or Hermione. It is true, also, that Argos is said to have imposed a fine on Sicyon and Aegina for supplying ships to Cleomenes (Herod, vi. 92). If she regarded these cities as colonies she might claim to do this, without any special authority as a leading state. Aegina, however, refused to pay ; she might reasonably urge that she was not a colony of Argos. Sicyon paid part of the fine ; her connection with Argos was well established in legend. (For nearly a century before Cleomenes, Sicyon could not have been in any political or religious dependence on Argos ; and at the time the fine was imposed, she was a member of the Lacedaemonian confederacy.) The claim advanced against Epidaurus by Argos is treated by Thucydides as a mere pretext. \" Alcibiades and the Argives had determined to attach Epidaurus to their league,\" and therefore raised the question of the tribute. In the Persian war not one of the cities mentioned joined in the neutrality of Argos except Cleonae, which was a subject ally, like Orneae ; c/. Thuc v 67.

In the next reign they accused the Argives of appropriating Cynuria, and alienating the inhabitants, who were now Perioeci of Sparta. It was decided to attack Argos, and the war, thus begun, was renewed under Chari laus, who invaded Argolis.1 In the time of Aristodamidas of Argos, who was a contemporary of Nicander of Sparta (circa 800 B.C.), the Argives aided the Heleans in resisting the Lacedaemonians ; in revenge Nicander invaded Argolis, and the Dryopians of Asine rose to assist him. Though the invasion was severe, it resulted in no lasting gain for Sparta. Not long afterwards the Argives, under their king Eratus, expelled the Asinaeans, who found refuge among the Spar tans, and, in the next generation, aided them in the first Messenian war.2 4. In Phidon, though little is known of his history, we recognise a prince of great vigour and sagacity. He extended the power of Argos on every side, and \" united the lot of Temenus which had become divided.\"3 To the later Greeks he was known for his attack on Elis, and celebration of the eighth Olympiad, an act which, in the eyes of Herodotus, marked him out as the most violent of all Hellenic tyrants, and for the weights, measures and coinage which sometimes bore his name, and were sometimes known as Aeginaean. We can give no account of the way in which he attained his power. One of the earliest acts of his reign was an His relations attempt to make himself master of Corinth. with Corinth.

Abron revealed it to Dexander, who was in charge of the youths. Phidon's design was frustrated, and the Corinthians escaped home in safety. It is possible that Phidon may have observed with jealousy that the trade of Argos was diminish ing, while that of Corinth was increasing, for it was about this time that the Corinthian mariners began to undertake voyages to the west. Yet if he was sufficiently powerful to compel the Corinthians to send 1000 picked men at his bidding to Argos, it is difficult to see what greater proof of submission he required; if, on the other hand, he was on such friendly terms with Corinth that 1000 men were sent to his assistance, his cruel treachery would only have alienated a valuable ally. Whatever Phidon's connection with Corinth may have been, we can hardly accept the story in the form in which Plutarch relates it. Much more credible is the assertion that Phidon celebrated the Olympic festival in 748 B.C.1 The Pisatans, with his help, were able to drive the Eleans away from Phidon at the sanctuary, which had been wrested from olympia. them, and to sacrifice once more at the shrine of Zeus, where their ancestors had long worshipped. The success was transient, for in the next Olympiad the Eleans were again masters of Olympia.2 It is natural to suppose that Phidon died in the interval (748-744 B.C.).

This would make Oypselus and Phidon contem poraries, and Sicyon would break loose from Argos at the very time when the Argive power was extending to Corinth and Aegina ! Besides, even if we place Phidon in 668 B.C., his son would be no suitor for Agariste (570 B.C.). 2 The act of Phidon was, according to Ephorus, an attempt *o establish his claim to preside over the games founded by Heracles (Ephorus, Frag. 15 M.)."], [248, "230 ARGOS: PHIDONIAN 'MEASURES.'

The oldest known Aeginaean coins, the so-called \"tortoises,\" are not older than 700 B.C., i.e. they are half a century later than Phidon. If it cannot be proved, it is at least extremely pro bable, that the Lydians coined money before the Greeks, and that the Greeks borrowed the idea of a coinage in the stricter sense of the word from the Asiatics.2 1 Nicol.

Similar rings may have been current as coins long before this date. \u2014 Two standards of coinage were current in Greece: the Aeginaean (stater=194 grns.) which is apparently Phoenician ; and the Euboean (stater = 130 grns.) which is Babylonian.

That some system had been in use before his time is obvious, and it is probable that his standard did not greatly differ from the old one. The Olympic stadium, which was said to have been fixed by Heracles, was never changed, so far as we know, from the time that the victories were first recorded in the foot race in 776 B.C., a fact which seems to show that in this case the length of the foot was already determined. But as Phidon is distinctly said by the best authorities to have \" made \" measures, and as certain measures were called Phidonian, it is clear that he introduced some change. He may have regulated the subdivisions of the system so as to make them more convenient, or slightly altered the standard. The system became known as Aeginaean perhaps because the coins subsequently issued on Phidon's standard were first struck in the temple of Aphrodite in Aegina. It was current in Peloponnese, \" in most of the island states, such as Ceos, Naxos, Siphnos and Crete ; \" in Thessaly, Phocis and Boeotia, but not at Corinth, Athens, or in Euboea. By the terms of the alliance concluded between Athens, Elis, Argos and Mantinea in the Peloponnesian war, the soldiers were to receive their pay in Aeginaean drachmas and obols.1 6. No satisfactory account can be given of the kings who 1 Thuc. v. 47. 6.

Tombs have been discovered at Melos, which can be measured precisely by the Phoenician cubit, i.e. they are constructed on that measure. It is very improbable that Phidon altered the length of the stadium at Olympia (Duncker). Why should the Eleans accept a new standard from him, when they struck out the Olympiad at which he presided ? Hultsch is of opinion that there were two Aeginaean standards of weight, an older and a later, of which the older was slightly the heavier (Metrol. p. 191 ; cf. p. 521 ff.). Of. Busolt, Or.

About the middle of the century, after the extinction of tyranny in Corinth and Sicyon, she seems to have made an attempt to recover the Thyreatis. The attempt failed, and the power of Argos steadily declined through the century until the final blow was given by the invasion of Cleomenes, who, though he did not succeed in taking the city, slew 6000 Argives, and reduced the state to a condition of helpless insignificance.1 Of the political constitution of Argos down to the Persian war, we know almost nothing.

In the temple of the Muses on Helicon his statue stood beside those of Thamyris, Arion, Hesiod and Orpheus. Pindar composed a proem in his honour. When the contest in flute-music was added to the Pythian games in the 48th Olympiad, Sacadas was victorious\u2014 a position which he maintained in the next two Pythiads. More than two hundred years afterwards, at the building of the walls of Messene, the tunes of Sacadas and Pronomus (of Thebes) were played each against the other. \"That was the day of the great match between them.\" His tomb could be seen at Argos in the time of Pausanias, more than seven hundred years after his death. Sacadas was not a mere flute-player. He composed odes and elegies with musical accompaniments, which were sung and played at the Gymnopaediae at Sparta, in Arcadia, and at Argos. Like Polymnestus of Colophon, he divided musical modes into three types, and he illustrated the difference by composing the \" triple nome,\" consisting of three strophes, the first sung in the Dorian measure, the second in the Phrygian, the third in the Lydian. He is also spoken of as the founder of a school of elegists at Argos, to which, in the second half of the sixth century, the famous Telesilla, the poetess and warrior, may have belonged.2 8.

Tradition ascribed the first establishment of the games to the Seven who left Argos with Adrastus for the attack on Thebes. When passing through the valley, the heroes were oppressed with thirst. A spring was pointed out to them by Hypsipyle, who placed the child she was tending on a grass-grown spot, while she led the way thither. On returning to the child, the heroes found that he had been bitten by a snake and was dead.

It is perhaps reasonable to suppose that the worship of Zeus at Nemea at the time when the sun entered the sign \u201e \u201e , of Leo, standing as it did in close connection Apollo Lyceus. with the fabled conflict between Heracles and the lion, represented some ancient worship of the sun-god. From a similar origin may have been derived the worship of Apollo Lyceus at Argos, but here the animal which repre sented the god (or his opponent ?) was a wolf. The temple was said to have been founded by Danaus himself. At a later time, when the genius of sculptors and architects had embellished the city, it was the most splendid of all the buildings in Argos. Before the eastern front of it, in full view of all who came into the market-place from that direction, was depicted in stone the famous contest of the wolf and the bull, which conferred on Danaus the sovereignty of Argos.2 1 Eusebius, Schbne, ii. p. 94 ; Krause, Die Pythieen, etc., 1841, pp. 127 ff. 2 Paus. ii. 19. 3 ; Curtius, Pelop. ii. 355. Compare the worship of Zeus Lycaeus in Arcadia. As in the case of Apollo Smintheus, so here ; we may have a relic of totemism in the wolf. Danaus may be the wolf-man (the alien, as Pausanias explains the story) who over came Gelanor, the bull-man, who inhabited Argos. But we must allow that in mythology the wolf is usually the symbol of darkness (and in Argos Apollo is called the wolf-slayer, by Sophocles). Of.

About two miles from Mycenae and five from Argos, at the foot of the south-western slope of Mount Euboea, lay the temple of Argive Hera, the national shrine of the Argives who dwelt in the plain of the Inachus. Hera, and A vague tradition connected the origin of the Heraea. the temple with Tiryns, whence, it was said, Piras brought the seated figure, fashioned from wood of the wild pear-tree, which represented the goddess of the older temple. The festival was called the Heraea or the Hecatombaea, a hundred oxen being slain on the great occasion. It was a time of universal rejoicing for the Argives. A sacred procession passed along the road from Argos to the temple ; the priestess was drawn thither in a car by oxen ; the young men marched out in full armour ; the maidens, clad in holiday attire, and decked with ornaments of gold, with garlands of asterion (quasi, Star-wort) on their heads, were formed into choruses, which chanted the lays of their land. Athletic contests were also held, at which the victors received a bronze shield and a crown of myrtle. With these outward and visible forms of worship were connected others of a more mysterious nature. Part of the rites would seem to have resembled the Attic Plynteria. The statue of the goddess was disrobed and bathed in the waters of the neighbouring stream Eleutherius, even as Hera herself was supposed to have renewed her virginity year by year by bathing in the spring of Carathus, near Nauplia. It was then clad in bridal garments, crowned with asterion, which grew around the temple, and mystically wedded to Zeus. As a marriage-feast, we may suppose, the great sacrifice was offered, and the Argives made merry on the flesh of the slaughtered victims.1 clearly decide between symbolism and totemism in regard to these god animals. \u2014 A wolf was stamped on the coins of Argos ; the device on the Argive shield was an eagle ; legend connected Polynices with a lion, Tydeus with a boar, on their arrival at Argos. 1 Strabo, p. 372 ; Paus. ii. 17. 1-2 ; Herod, i. 31 ; Pind.

To what natural causes this supposed presence was due it is difficult to say. There was no medi cinal spring in the Sacred Valley, such as the Anigrus in Elis ; no warm baths, as at Methana. Pure air and water, rest and seclusion, some medicinal herbs, and a good deal of faith were the chief agents in the cure of those who visited the place. The popularity of the shrine was great, and it con tinued down to the time of the Antonines. From every side patients trooped to secure the advice of the priests and the blessing of the god. It is exceedingly probable that many secrets of herbal medicine (such as Dioscorides afterwards collected) were known to the Asclepiadae, who were also aware of the advantages to be derived from change and amusement. The theatre attached to the shrine became one of the largest and finest in Greece. Gardens and groves afforded shady and pleasant retreats. Cool baths were provided in abundance. Everything that could disturb or disgust was kept beyond the precincts of the sacred valley, while hope was flattered by the abundant testimony to the power of the god seen on every hand in the offerings of those who had here found relief from their sufferings. (e.) The worship of Demeter Chthonia at Hermione was due to local peculiarities. Hard by the city was a cleft in The chthonia the earth \u2014 an opening of the infernal regions at Hermione. \u2014 which were, it was thought, reached more quickly by this route than by any other. Here, therefore, the goddess whose daughter was queen of the under-world might fitly take up her abode. The festival of the Chthonia was held every year in the summer. Pausanias thus describes it : \u2014 The priests and the magistrates of the year walk in procession to the temple ;"], [257, "VII. 9-1 HERMIONE: FESTIVAL OF THE CHTHONIA. 239 after them come the men and women, and even the children, who take a part in the festival, clad in white garments, and wearing crowns woven from the flower which the Hermioneans call Cosmosandalon (quasi, Ladies' Slipper). The procession is followed by men leading a full-grown heifer, newly taken from the herd and still struggling, by ropes attached to either side of her head. When they come to the temple-doors the heifer is allowed to run loose into the temple, and as soon as she is in the doors are closed. Four aged priestesses who are left in the temple slay the heifer, the first who can cutting her throat with a hook. Then the doors are opened, and a second heifer is brought, and a third, and yet a fourth. All are slaughtered in the same manner, and, marvellous to relate, on whichever side the first heifer sinks when dying, the rest fall on the same. \u2014 As Hermione was the chief of the Dryopian cities in Argolis, the rites celebrated there became common to all the other Dryopians. Even when expelled from their home and settled in Messenia, the Asinaeaus sent sacrifices to Demeter, and desired to renew in this manner the connec tion with their ancient home.1 For the coinage of Argolis, see Head, Hisloria Numorum, p. 366. In regard to dialect, the Argives resembled the Laconians in changing <t between vowels into h, and the Cretans in using an accusative plural in -vs, e.g. ravs = Tas.

In order to retain The Contest their prize the Eleans seem to have found for Olympia. fo necessary to strengthen their position by entering into close relations with the Spartans, while the Pisatans on their part appealed to Phidon of Argos to assist them in recovering their rights. Thus it came to pass that in the Eighth Olympiad (748 B.C.) the Argive monarch drove away the Eleans and celebrated the festival himself. At the next festival, the old order was re-established, and the celebration thus irregularly conducted was struck out of the list of Olympiads. At this time the Pisatid was under the rule of princes, who acknow ledged the control of Elis. Four names of these monarchs J have been preserved in the following order of succession : \u2014 (1) Omphalion. (2) Pantaleon (01. 34 = 644 B.C.). (3) Damophon (01. 48 = 588 B.C.). (4) Pyrrhus (572 B.C.). In the 28th Olympiad (668 B.C.) the Eleans, being then engaged in a war with Dyme in Achaea, \"allowed the Pisatans to celebrate the festival in their behalf \" \u2014 a fact which, whether the permission was forced from them or not, is evidence of the weakness of the Eleans at the time. Eight years afterwards (01. 30 = 660 B.C.) the Pisatans were able to throw off the yoke of the Eleans and recover Olympia. They remained in possession of the shrine for some time.2 1 A still earlier king of Pisa is Cleosthenes, the son of Cleonicus (Phlegon, Frag. 1, Midler). He is said to have aided Iphitus and Lycurgus in the rearrangement of the games. The name is suspicious, and the Pisatans might very well invent a hero to range with the Elean and Spartan founders of the games. But cf. Duncker, Hist. Greece, ii. 242 ; Busolt, Lak. p. 163. 2 For Pantaleon, cf Paus. vi. 21. I : ITavTaXeoi'Tt tu 'OpcpdXiiovos Tvpavvovvri iv Ti-iay Ka\\ dnoaraoriv fiov\\evovTi airb 'HXei'cov (ibid. 22. 3).

In the second Messenian war the Pisatans, who had reason to resent and fear the growing power of Sparta, took the part of the rebels. The fall of Eira had a Conquest of disastrous effect upon their fortunes, for Sparta Pisatis and Elis, both hostile nations, were now free to unite their forces. By 588 B.C. the Pisatans are again in a position of dependence. Under the pretext of a suspected rebellion the Eleans then invaded the Pisatid, but Damophon, the son of Pantaleon, induced them to retire. In 580 B.C. ( = 01. 50) they had lost all share in the management of the Olympic festival, and were reduced to the condition of .-,, __. . and Triphyha. Perioeci.1 The Eleans were now able to invade Triphylia, where they added Macistus to the list of depen dent cities. But the spirit of the Pisatans was not broken. In 572 B.C. Pyrrhus, the brother of Damophon, assisted by the Dyspontians, Scilluntians and Macistians, rose against the Eleans. The Spartans were summoned to the rescue, and the rising was quelled. The cities of the Pisatans were now Pisatans during this period is uncertain. Pausanias (vi. 22) tells us that the 34th Olympiad, which Pantaleon celebrated, was not rec koned by the Eleans among the Olympiads (Anolympias). On the other hand, the list in Africanus tells us that the Pisatans, revolting from the Eleans, celebrated the 30th and 22 following Olympiads (Jul. Africanus, Rutgers, 01. 30), a statement which is again contradicted by Paus. v. 9. 4, where the Eleans are said to be in possession in 01. 50. Accuracy is not to be expected in such statements, which would naturally differ with the party which made them. The Pisatans and Eleans may have exercised a joint control for some time (the number of the Hellenodicae being doubled), and the attack of Pantaleon in Olympiad 34 may have been an act of aggression on the part of the Pisatans, Busolt, loc. cit. p. 168. The Pisatans numbered eight communities, of which Strabo mentions five : Salmone, Heraclea, Arpina, Cicysium, which was the largest, and Dyspontium, pp. 356, 357. From these and eight Elean cities were doubtless chosen the sixteen women who wove the robe for Hera, and superintended the contests of the maidens held in her honour. 1 Paus. v. 9. 4 ; vi. 22. 4. In 01. 2 an \" Elean of Dyspontium \" was victor, a record which, unless it is a forgery, implies that even then Dyspontium was subject to Elis ; but the Elean records are not to be trusted.

Thus were the Eleans rendered secure in the possession of the coveted sanctuary. Though it is a mistake to speak of their territory as inviolate, except in the sacred month of the festival, they enjoyed for a long time an extraordinary immunity from invasion, owing no doubt to the firm friendship of the Lacedaemonians. The soil of Elis was fertile, and the festival attracted large numbers of merchants. Elis was the garden of Peloponnese, even in the time of Strabo ; and so attached were the inhabitants to a country life of peace and prosperity that for generations some families never visited the city. They were probably the wealthiest community in Greece, but they remained without renown in arms or distinction in literature. Their claim to honour rested solely on the justice with which they adminis tered the Olympic festival.2 In Elis, as at Sparta, women seem to have enjoyed a degree of freedom and influence which was unusual in Greece. worshi of worsnip of Hera at Olympia was superin- Hera at tended by a college or conclave of sixteen Olympia. \\ \u00b0 women, chosen at first from eight towns in Pisatis, and an equal number in Elis, but afterwards, of course, from towns in Elis only. Every fifth year the women wove a robe for the goddess in a house set apart for the purpose in the market-place of Elis. At the presentation of the robe, which took place in the Heraeum at Olympia, sacrifices were offered and games were held, at which the maidens of Elis contended in the foot-race. The course was the Olympic stadium, but the length was shortened by one sixth (i.e. reduced from 630 to 525 feet). The girls were divided into three troops, according to age, and each troop 1 The Dyspontians emigrated to Apollonia and Epidamnus (Paus. vi. 22. 4 ; v. 6. 4 ; Strabo, 356, 357). 2 Strabo, p. 343 ; Polyb. iv. 73 (in the time of Polybius there were even local courts for the administration of justice) ; Herod, ii. 160."], [261, "VII. ii.] ELIS: TEMPLES AND SHRINES. 243 raced separately. When running, the competitors were clad in a short chiton which did not reach to the knee ; the right shoulder was bare to the breast ; the hair fell loose upon the neck. The victorious maidens were crowned with olive, their portraits were painted, and they also received a portion of the heifer which had been sacrificed to the goddess. Legend ascribed the institution of the games to Hippodamea, who, when she wished to return thanks to Hera for her marriage with Pelops, called the sixteen women together, and with them founded the festival. Notwithstanding these athletic exercises, women were forbidden, on pain of death, to be spectators at the great Olympic games ; they might not even cross the river Alpheus within certain interdicted days.1 Strabo tells us that in his time Elis was filled with temples of Artemis, Aphrodite and the nymphs. Shrines of Hermes were to be seen by the wayside, shrines of Worshipof Dio. Poseidon on the sea-shore.2 Especial honour nysus, Hades, was paid to Dionysus, as seems to have been and heroes almost universally the case in a rural population. His festival was known as the Thyia, and was remarkable for a miraculous creation of wine.3 Hades also was worshipped by the Eleans, who with the Triphylians seem to have been peculiar in paying honour to this deity. His temple at Elis was opened once a year only, and none but the priest might enter it.4 Another striking feature in the religious customs of the country was the worship of heroes. Augeas, of the old Epean dynasty, and Aetolus, the son of Oxylus, received offerings as heroes ; and Pausanias remarks that the Eleans pour libations to heroes, \" whether they are heroes of Elis, or 1 Paus. v. 16 ; ib. v. 6, 7. Pausanias gives an instance of a violation of the rule by Callipatira, who, in the disguise of a trainer, witnessed her son's triumph. Her life was spared, but henceforth the trainers, as well as the athletes, were compelled to appear naked. 2 Strabo, p. 343. 3 Paus. vi. 26. 4 Paus. vi. 25. 2.

Nmlium.2 With the exception of Lepreum, these cities were entirely destroyed by the Lacedaemonians and Eleans, and their territory added to Elis. The Lepreatae appear to have owed their exemption from destruction to the assistance which they rendered to the Spartans in the second Messenian war. They maintained their independence \u2014 doubtless under the protection of Sparta \u2014 and in the Persian war were able to send 200 men to Plataea.3 In Triphylia also we meet with interesting and ancient forms of worship. On the shore was a temple of the _.,... Samian Poseidon, at a place where, as some The Deities ... worshipped authorities wished to prove, Telemachus found in Triphylia. Nestor sacrificing to the god of the sea. This appears to have been the national sanctuary of the Triphylians. In the neighbourhood of Macistus there was a precinct of Hades and a grove of Demeter, deities which received especial honour from the Triphylians because their country, though fertile, was afflicted with blight to such a degree of severity that the crops often failed.4 12.

In the Games ; mytni reign of Cronos men of the golden race sacrificed caI hlstory to him at Olympia, but when Zeus was born Rhea intrusted the keeping of the child to the Idaean Dactyli, who came from Crete to Olympia. These were five in number, Heracles and his four brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Jasus and Idas. By way of amusement, Heracles, who was the eldest, set his brothers to race against each other, and crowned the winner with wild olive, which, though trans planted by Heracles from the Hyperboreans, grew luxuriantly at Olympia. These were the first Olympic games. They occurred every fifth year, because there were five brothers, of whom four only contended. About fifty years after the flood which happened in the days of Deucalion, Clymenus, a descendant of the Idaean Heracles, came from Crete to Olympia, and celebrated games there. He was deposed by Endymion, who decided the succession among his sons by a foot-race (supra, p. 91). Then Pelops appeared upon the scene, and caused the games to become more famous than ever before. The Pelops etc Pelopids were soon dispersed over Pelopon nesus, and Amythaon, a cousin of Endymion, celebrated the Olympia. After him Pelias and Neleus joined in the celebra tion ; then followed Augeas, and Heracles, the son of Amphi tryon, who held games in honour of his conquest of Elis. When Oxylus came into Elis he celebrated the games, but from his time down to Iphitus they were discontinued. In the days of Iphitus, who was a descendant of Oxylus, Greece was in a calamitous state of disturb- ance and strife. Tribe was at war with tribe, and domestic sedition was frequent. With a view to the improvement of the country Iphitus consulted the oracle at Delphi. The answer was that the Olympic games must be renewed. Iphitus proceeded to carry out the divine"], [264, "[VII. 12. 246 ELIS: THE OLYMPIC GAMES. command ; he celebrated the games, and arranged that henceforth the celebration should take place every fifth year. By degrees the remembrance of the past was recovered, and as the facts came back into the memory of men, ad ditions were made to the contests at the games. Iphitus also bade the Eleans sacrifice to Heracles, whom they had hitherto regarded as an enemy. But his chief service was the establishment of the Ekecheiria, or sacred truce. The month of the festival was made a sacred month, during which all war was to cease throughout Hellas. It was the duty of the Eleans to proclaim the truce, and disobedience to its terms was sacrilege. In this good work Lycurgus of Sparta is said to have been associated with Iphitus.1 The Olympic lists, in which the victors were recorded, do not begin till 776 B.C. On this occasion Coroebus of Elis was victor in the stadium or foot-race. From that time onward till 221 AD., we can read in the list compiled by Julius Africanus, and preserved to us by Eusebius, the names of the victors in the contests, and the various changes which were made in the games. The g&mes may have originated in the worship of Zeus and Hera by the Pisatans in a sacred place near the junction of _ . , the Cladeus and Alpheus, at the foot of the Gradual exten- r ' sion of the hill of Cronos. With the invasion of the Sames- Aetolians the nossession of the sanctnarv nassed Aetolians the possession of the sanctuary passed from the Pisatans to the Eleans ; and when the Heraclids of Sparta became the allies of the Eleans, Heracles was associ ated with Zeus and Hera in the sacrifices. But it was long before the festival attracted attention. Down to 720 B.C. the competitors were drawn from a limited area in the Peloponnesus : in the next sixty years the fame of the festival spread throughout Greece ; after 620 B.C. the colonies 1 Paus. v. 7. 8. Pausanias saw the quoit of Iphitus, the original symbol of the exe^etpia, in the Heraeum at Olympia (v. 20, I).

As its fame spread the festival was enlarged. At the time of Coroebus there was one contest only, the foot-race or stadium (630 feet), and from the victor in this race the Olympiad was always named. In the 14th Olympiad the double course was added; in the 18th, the Pentathlon and the wrestling ; in the 23rd, the boxing ; in the 25th, the chariot-race ; in the 33rd, the Pancratium and horse-race ; in the 37th, the running and wrestling for boys; in the 41st the boxing for boys; in the 65th, the foot-race in heavy armour. These were the contests which made up the games at the time of Pindar. So large a num ber could not, of course, be included in one day ; but we do not know how many days the festival lasted, nor in what order the contests took place. The history of the Olympia is without a parallel in the records of civilisation. That athletic games should have continued uninterrupted for a thousand years ; Uni ue char that a nation of petty states always at war acterofthe with each other should have agreed to suspend Olympic games. their enmities in order to attend at a foot-race ; that the winner on a course of about 200 yards should be the foremost man in Hellas, the proudest ornament of his home ; that the name of such a victor should be handed down to posterity when poets who had delighted and statesmen who had bene fited mankind were forgotten, would be incredible if it were not true. But it is true, and in attempting to conceive the nature of the Hellenic genius we must always bear the fact in mind. The Olympic games and the Spartan training are the characteristic creations of the Greeks. Science and art, plays and philosophy, have reappeared in later ages, but these unique achievements passed away with the nation which gave them birth. 13. At the time of the invasion the immigrants into Elis coalesced on friendly terms with the Epeans. The reigning king Eleus (or Dius) did not, it is true, give The govern up his dominions without a struggle ; a single ment in Elis combat was arranged between Pyraechmes, the Aetolian"], [266, "248 [VII. 13. ELIS: THE GOVERNMENT. slinger, and Degmenus, the Epean archer, but on the victory of Pyraechmes the throne was ceded to Oxylus. The union was greatly facilitated by the connection of race which existed between the Aetolians and Epeans.1 Oxylus was succeeded by his son Laias, with whom the monarchy appears to have come to an end ; at least Pausanias could not discover the names of any later kings of the race of Oxylus.2 The monarchy was followed by an aristocracy, under which we may suppose that the leading families kept the control of the state, and the possession of the best land, in their own hands. Though these aristocrats lived on their estates in the country, some of their number must have acted as the executive of the state of the Eleans. In the oldest inscriptions the sovereign power seems to have been vested in the community as a whole (ot FaXeloi, Sa^os).

Aristotle describes a senate at Elis consisting of ninety members, probably ten from each of nine tribes. These members held office for life, and all the power lay in their hands. The government was thus an oligarchy within an oligarchy, and exposed to danger for that reason. Even the choice of the senators was in the hands of the great families. At a later time we hear of a democracy, a form of government due no doubt to the opposition between the population of the city and the landed proprietors.1 The Elean dialect is marked by (1) the use of p for s at the end of words (as in Laconian and Latin), and of the soft breathing for the hard, e.g. op = os ; (2) the use of the digamma, written with /3 in later inscriptions (as in Laconian) ; (3) the use of f f or S ; (4) the use of -ais, -01s in the ace. plur. for -as, -ovs ; (5) the change of o- into h between vowels (as in Laconian).

From Aleus, the son of Apheidas, was derived the name of Athena Alea, the tutelary goddess of Tegea, whose shrine formed a common place of meeting for the Arcadians. The sons of Elatus were Cyllen, from whom Mount Cyllene derived its name ; Stymphalus, the eponym of the town of Stymphalus, and Aepytus. As Clitor died without sons, the throne of Lycosura descended to Aepytus, and on his death to Aleus. Thus Tegea becomes the seat of the monarchy. Here, at the time of Hyllus, we find Echemus on the throne. By him Hyllus was slain, and the tide of invasion thrown back for a hundred years. Echemus was succeeded by Agapenor, who led the Arcadians to Troy. On his return Agapenor was carried to Cyprus, where he founded Paphos and the temple of Aphrodite, from whence his daughter Laodice sent a robe to Athena Alea at Tegea. A subsequent king, Hippothous, is said to have transferred the seat of government from Tegea to Trapezus, where we find Cypselus reigning at the time of the Dorian migration. From the union of Cresphontes with the daughter of Cyp selus the Messenian kings were descended. Some generations after Cypselus we hear of Pompus, in whose reign the Aeginetans brought their wares to Cyllene, the port of Elis, and carried them thence on mules to Arcadia. Then followed Polymestor, the contemporary of the Spartan king Charilaus ; Aechmis, in whose reign the first Messenian war broke out ; and Aristocrates 1., who was stoned to death for violating a virgin in the temple of Artemis, near Orchomenus. His grandson was Aristocrates H., who met with a like fate for his treachery to the Messenians. After this there were no more kings in Arcadia.1 1 Paus. viii. 4, 5. With the division of Arcadia among the sons of Areas compare the division of Attica among the sons of Pandion. Azanians go to Phrygia as Lycus in Athenian story migrates to Lycia (Paus. viii. 4. 3).

There is no reason for supposing that Arcadia was ever united under the authority of a single king. The nature of the country prohibited centralisation. In Arcadia : its the north and east Arcadia is a mass of rugged inhabitants. mountains, traversed by few and difficult passes. Towards the south the only inlet is the valley of the Eurotas. On the west the mountains are less abrupt, and the valleys of the Ladon and Alpheus render communication comparatively easy. The political development of the inhabitants was de termined by these external conditions. In the Eastern isolated valleys of the east and north we find Arcadia. a number of independent towns \u2014 Psophis, Clitor, Pheneus, Stymphalus, Orchomenus, Mantinea, Tegea \u2014 of which Man tinea was a combination of five villages, Tegea of nine.

Bound the sources of the Alpheus lay the Maenalians and Eutresians. The Parrhasians and Cynurians dwelt a little lower down the river. Lower still were the Heraeans. The Azanes dwelt on the Ladon. But disunited as the Arcadians were, connecting links were not wanting among them. They had common temples, at which Lmks of they met to worship the national deities. Such Union. was the temple of Lycaean Zeus, on the summit of Mount Lycaeus, near Lycosura, where the Lycaea were celebrated, a festival which, though at first confined to the Parrhasians, became the common festival of all the Arcadian tribes. Almost equally sacred and equally national was the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, where was the \"common hearth\" of the Arcadians.1 A third deity, held in uni versal honour by all the Arcadians, was Artemis Hymnia, 1 Paus. viii. 2. 1 ; viii. 53. 9. The Lycaea were celebrated by Arca dians even when on service in foreign lands (Xen. Anab. i. 2. 10). These shrines were still honoured even after the devastation which overtook Arcadia between the time of Polybius and Strabo (Strabo, p. 38S)."], [270, "252 ARCADIA: WARS WITH SPARTA.

We have seen reason to doubt the truth of the legends which speak of contests between the Spartans and Arcadia and Arcadians at Clitor and Mantinea in the years Sparta, immediately following the Dorian immigration. But at a later time, when the Spartan power increased, it was inevitable that border conflicts should go on. Charilaus is said to have conquered the district of Aegys between the sources of the Eurotas and the Alpheus, and to have made an attempt, which failed, on Tegea. After the first Mes senian war the Spartans made an attack on Phigalea, a distant Arcadian hamlet, on the borders of Messenia, which is now famous for the ruins of a beautiful temple. The Phigaleans were expelled from their territory, but recovered it by the devoted help of the Oresthasians (Olymp., 30.2 = 659 B.C.). At a later time the districts of Caryae and Sciritis, on the upper Oenus, were added to Sparta, but Tegea remained independent till the middle of the sixth century.2 17.

In the hope of counteracting the effects of the harsh climate of their country and their rustic occupations, music was almost universally cultivated among them. Their apologist Polybius tells us that the Arcadian boys were trained from infancy to sing hymns and paeans, in honour of their native heroes and gods ; and the education was continued in after life. It was from neglect of this salutary institution that the Cynaethians fell below the standard of Arcadian morality, and disgraced themselves by acts of savage 1 Paus. viii. 5. II. 2 For Aegys, cf.

Trade was impossible for them, and as in Arcadia the isolation and intensity of civic life which made enemies of neighbouring cities were to a great degree wanting, the Arcadians were not needed for arms at home. They are often compared to the Swiss of modern times, but we have no means of judging whether the resemblance extends beyond a mountainous home and the love of a military life.2 The statements which have come down to us about the forms of political constitution existing among the Arcadians, scanty and imperfect though they are, present much that is full of interest. They illustrate various stages in the change which transformed the tribe (or iOvoi) into the city (or ttoXis). In the West the political unit was the tribe, and this con tinued to be the case till the foundation of Megalopolis in 369 B.C. Of course the members of the tribes TheTribesin resided in hamlets or villages, which differed the west of in extent and importance, and Thucydides even speaks of the \"cities\" of the Parrhasians, but the word is used vaguely, and does not mean a city in the ordinary sense of the word, i.e. an autonomous and local centre of political life. Some of these villages were the meeting-places of the tribe, or the residence of ancient kings, and consecrated by the worship of common deities. Lycosura, Trapezus and no independent Basilis were towns within the territory of the towns- Parrhasians, which so late as 369 B.C. claimed a superior position on these grounds. Yet even Lycosura, the most 1 Polyb. iv. 20 ff. Whether this account is applicable to ancient Arcadia is perhaps doubtful ; but cf. Plut. De Mus. 9, who tells us that the music of Sacadas, Polymnestus, etc., was played at the d-iToSeit-ds in Arcadia. 2 Strabo, p. 388, speaks of the excellent pastures which in his time existed on the site of Megalopolis : (SoaKfipaai S' ela\\ vopdi Sa^ikeis Kai pdXiora Ittitois Kai ovois tois i7T7ro/3arais, 'iaTi Si Kai to yt'i/or rav i-rrmov apioTov to 'ApKaSiKvv.

[VII. 18. ancient of all Arcadian towns, never claimed a political existence apart from the Parrhasian tribe to which it belonged. It was only when a tribe was broken up, or sank into decay, that the towns within it became independent. With the disappearance of the ancient tribe of the Azanians, Clitor, Psophis and Heraea became separate political centres. Of these Heraea retained the old cantonal form of constitution, even down to the middle of the fourth century, when the nine demes, of which the community was composed, were united into a city under Lacedaemonian influence, in order to form a counterpoise to Megalopolis. Of the mode in which the affairs of the tribe were managed we have little infor mation. In the more advanced forms of constitution, as at constitution of Mantinea, we find each of the demes of which the tribes. .^g c[^y was composed represented by a \"demi urgus.\" This may have been the case with the tribe. Each of the villages may have sent a representative to the common assembly, by which the common affairs were managed. 18. In the east of Arcadia the tribe gave way at an early time to the city. Mantinea, Orchomenus and Tegea were the Cities in Eastern chief centres. The nature of the country, Arcadia. mutual animosities, and external relations con duced to this result. Mantinea and Tegea were constantly at variance. The former was a democracy formed under the influence of Argos ; the latter, after ineffectual struggles to maintain its independence, became an oligarchy under the influence of Sparta. Orchomenus, at the time of the second Messenian war, was the abode of Aristocrates II., the last king of Arcadia. After the fall of the monarchy and the dissolution of the tribal association upon which the monarchy rested, it was left the head of a few villages. Its power was quickly surpassed by that of its rivals Mantinea and Tegea. Even in the middle of the sixth century Mantinea attracted attention by the excellence of her political arrangements. By Democracy of the advice of the Delphic oracle the Cyrenaeans Mantinea. requested the Mantineans to send one of their citizens to re-arrange the constitution at Cyrene.

He reserved for the king the sacred domain and offices which belonged to him as the priest of the community, but the rest of his powers were divided among the people.1 The hatred of Sparta on the one hand, and on the other the friendly relations which united Mantinea with Argos and Athens, are a proof that the constitution of Mantinea continued to be democratic. \u2014 We hear of Demiurgi in all the Arcadian states ; of Theori in Mantinea and Tegea ; of Polemarchi or Strategi in Mantinea, Tegea, public officers in Phigalea, and among the Cynaethians.2 But Arcadian towns. we cannot enter into details. We know the titles of the public officers in Arcadian towns, and we know no more about them. From the earliest times down to the end of the second Messenian war there were kings in Arcadia. Lycosura was the abode of the ancient king Lycaon. When The Kings of the Heraclids first attempted the invasion of Ar<=adla- Peloponnesus, Echemus was king of Tegea, and leader of the Arcadians ; at the time of the invasion, Cypselus of Trapezus was the king of the Arcadians. In the Messenian wars Orcho menus was the seat of the monarchy. If we look at the list of ancient Arcadian kings preserved by Pausanias we shall find that the succession is sometimes broken by the substitution of the female line for the male. The sons of Lycaon perish, the line being continued through Callisto to Areas. Clitor, the son of Azan, dies without children, and his throne passes to Aepytus. These interruptions, combined with the change of the seat of the monarchy, point to the prominence of successive tribes whose leaders or generals were the kings of Arcadia at the period. The Azanians were perhaps the most powerful tribe in the earliest times, but they were subsequently sur passed by the Trapezuntians, whose kings, the Cypselidae, continued to occupy the throne till the treachery of Aristo crates II. brought the king into direct collision with the 1 Herod, iv. 161. 2 Busolt, Lak. p. 144."], [274, "256 ARCADIA: 'CLASSES' AND 'MASSES.'

It is quite clear from the accounts of the Messenian war that the kings were the leaders of the Arcadians on their warlike expeditions. The office was hereditary, but with the privileges of the kings in times of peace we are not acquainted. If in one sense the Arcadians were a disunited people, in another they present an instance of a union which was rare M .... ,. in Greece.

Unfortunately we know nothing of the tenure of land in Arcadia. The absence of slaves shows that here, as in Phocis, the owner of the soil worked on his land, but what differences of wealth prevailed in the country, and how the difficulties which elsewhere led to the oppression of the poorer by their richer citizens were avoided, we have no evidence to show.1 The resemblance between the Arcadian inscriptions and the Cyprian, to which allusion has already been made (p. 125), is shown in the common use of Xv for iv, of a genitive in -au from nominatives in -as, in arro for duo, etc. In spite of the occurrence of Arcadian names in Crete, and legends of colonisation, there is no resemblance between the dialects of Arcadia and Crete. The coins of Arcadia imply a kind of federal union of the country notwithstanding the enmities of the various tribes and cities. It is supposed that coins were struck at the periodic meetings at the festival of Zeus Lycaeus which were current through the whole of Arcadia. See Head, I.e. p. 372. ACHAEA. 19.

Polybius informs us that the nation was ruled by kings, of whom Tisamenus was the first, and The Kings Ogyges the last. As we know nothing more of Achaea. of Ogyges, and Tisamenus is said in another form of the legend to have perished before reaching Achaea, this statement is of little value. It is more important to know that the Achaeans, following as we are told the example of the Ionians, who preceded them in the country, formed themselves into a Dodecapolis, of which the common meeting- The cities place was the temple of Zeus Amarius at Aegium of Achaea (supra, p. 106). At a later time the Achaeans were famous for the excellence of their political constitution, which Strabo calls a democracy. The cities of Magna Graecia, some of which were colonies from Achaea, at least in part, are said to have applied to them for aid in the management of their affairs after the troubles arising from the expulsion of the Pythagorean societies. At Crotona, Sybaris and Caulon the Achaean constitution was adopted. These cities combined and selected a site for the altar of Zeus Amarius, at which they met for the discussion of political matters. Excellence of They even adopted the customs and laws of the the Achaean Achaeans, till Crotona and Caulon were com pelled by Dionysius of Syracuse to abandon them.1 In the history of Greece Proper, Achaea is of little importance. The secluded nature of the country, which lay between almost impassable mountains and a harbourless coast, and was far removed from the great roads which connected Peloponnesus and Northern Greece, enabled the inhabitants to preserve a neutrality amid the conflicts which harassed 1 Polyb. ii. 38-41.

In some of the towns we hear of flourishing manufactures ; Patrae was famous for byssus, Pellene for cloaks, which were even given as prizes in the athletic games held in the city. But the bulk of the Achaeans were shepherds, who fed their flocks and cattle on the slopes of the mountains, or husbandmen, who tilled the rich lands between the mountains and the sea. The ancient name of Patrae was Aroa (ploughland) ; and the names of Aegae, Aegira, Aegium have, at any rate, a fanciful resem blance to ou\u00a3, a goat.1 The alphabet in use among the Achaean colonies exhibits peculiar forms, which were probably brought from the parent state.

Finally, when Idas and Lynceus, the sons of Aphareus, were slain, Nestor, the son of Neleus, became king of Messenia, and removed the throne to Pylus (supra, p. 94). 2. At the Dorian immigration the Pylians were expelled, and their kingdom became the spoil of the invaders. Legends Messenia at the told now Cresphontes and the sons of Aristo timeofthe Dorian demus cast lots for the possession of Messenia, and how Cresphontes gained the kingdom by fraudulent collusion with Temenus. The centre of govern ment was now removed from the sea-coast to Stenyclarus. The ancient inhabitants were not driven out, but half their land was taken from them and distributed among the con querors. Ephorus, indeed, tells us that the country was divided by Cresphontes into five cities : Stenyclarus, Bhium, Pylus, Mesola and Hyamea, of which Stenyclarus was the capital. For a time the Messenians and Dorians were on an equal footing in all the five cities, but afterwards the Dorians were collected into Stenyclarus, and the other cities were degraded into an inferior position. This account,1 whatever the authority on which it rests, is merely a variation of the arrangements which the same historian describes as follow ing upon the Dorian conquest of Laconia (p. 97). It seems to be certain that the Messenians did not submit to the rule of the Dorians without a struggle. The Messenian kings are named after Aepytus, not after Cresphontes,2 and it was with the help of the Arcadians that Aepytus regained his land. 3.

Various accounts were given of the matter. Near the sources of the Nedon, on the borders of Messenia, was a temple of Artemis Limnatis, at which Lace daemonians and Messenians worshipped in Teleclus and common.2 The Lacedaemonians alleged that the Messenians. some maidens who were attending a festival at this temple, had been seized and outraged by Messenians, and, in the attempt to rescue them, their king Teleclus had been slain. The Messenians, on the other hand, declared that Teleclus had attacked their envoys when coming to the temple, with the help of young men disguised as women. The Messenians, on discovering the treachery, slew both the men and their king. In support of the truth of their story they appealed to the fact that the Lacedaemonians never demanded repara tion for the death of their king (death of Teleclus, 785 B.C.).3 4. For the present the quarrel went no further, probably because the Spartans were occupied with Phidon. In the next generation, when Antiochus had succeeded Fresh hos his father Phintas, and Alcamenes and Theo- tilities pompus were kings of Sparta, hostilities broke out afresh. The cause was a dispute between Polychares, a Messenian, who was victor in the fourth Olympiad, and a Spartan called Euaeph nus. Not content with stealing the cattle of Polychares, 1 Paus. iv. 4. 1. 2 Strabo, p. 362. 3 Strabo, p. 257; Paus. iv. 4. 3.

Euaephnus, when pressed for payment, slew his son. Poly chares appealed to Sparta for redress, but in vain. Driven Poiychares and to desperation, he took the matter into his Euaephnus. own hands, and wildly slew every Spartan whom he could get into his power. The Lacedaemonians sent to Stenyclarus to demand that Poiychares should be surrendered. The matter was hotly debated in the ecclesia ; Antiochus, the king, opposed the request, but Androcles, his younger brother, who appears to have been of almost equal authority, supported it. The dispute grew into a quarrel, not without bloodshed, in which the party of Androcles as the smaller were defeated. The Messenians were willing to put the case for decision into the hands of the Amphictyony of Argos or the Athenian Council on the Areopagus ; but the Spartans made no answer to this proposal.1 A casus belli was now established, though war had not been openly declared. The Lacedaemonians resolved upon full vengeance ; no length of time, no severity of suffering, was to prevent them from achieving the conquest of Messenia. Outbreak of Without any previous announcement they sent the war. a Dand of men by night under Alcamenes to seize Amphea, a Messenian fortress on the borders of Laconia, strongly placed and abundantly supplied with water, intend ing to make it the base of their operations during the war.

Such was the outbreak of the first Messenian war. Our information of this struggle is derived mainly from Pausanias. who tells us that he obtained it from two sources 1 Diod. viii. 5 ; Paus. iv. 5. 2.

Neither of these compositions could lay any claim to historical accuracy. Not only did Authorities for the authors live centuries after the events the war- which they recorded, but the accounts which they gave were in part contradictory and in part manifestly false. It is obvious that the Spartans with their habits of secrecy would not have permitted any records to survive of their own defeats and difficulties in these wars. What information existed about them, would be gathered from the mouths of the Messenian people, or from popular songs, which celebrated the achievements of Aristodemus and Aristomenes. After the restoration of Messenia by Epaminondas and the building of Messene (369 B.C.), these stories or songs may have been col lected and formed into some kind of legendary history.1 6. When the Messenians heard of the seizure of Amphea, they came together from all their cities to Stenyclarus. They were kept under arms to resist the incursions of the Lacedaemonians, who began by attacking the cities, but, finding their efforts vain, desisted from this mode of war- 1 Rhianus of Bene, in Crete, who was a contemporary of Erato sthenes (third century B.C.), was a voluminous author. He is said to have written five epics, besides other poems, and to have been a com mentator on Homer. Of the date of Myron nothing certain seems to be known. His work (Messeniaca) is quoted by Athenaeus, p. 271 and p. 657. It appears from the first passage that Theopompus, the pupil of Isocrates, had given some account of the Messenian wars. Neither Rhianus nor Myron wrote an account of the whole conflict. Myron narrated the capture of Amphea and what followed, down to the death of Aristodemus. Rhianus, on the other hand, passed over the earlier war in silence, and in his account of the second began with the Battle of the Trench. Aristomenes, the great Messenian hero, was mentioned by Myron in his history, but not much importance was attached to him. In the poem of Rhianus he was what Achilles is in the Iliad. Moreover, Myron was guilty of the gross error of saying that Aristomenes slew Theopompus, the Spartan king, shortly before the death of Aristodemus, whereas it is clear from the verses of Tyrtaeus that Theopompus outlived the war. In the opinion of Paus anias, Aristomenes was the hero of the second war, when Aristodemus was already dead; and Rhianus was a better authority than Myron (Paus. iv. 6. 1-5)."], [282, "264 BATTLE OF THE RAVINE, c>c. sVIII.d. fare, and plundered the country.

The result was indecisive (the Battle of the Eavine). In the next year (738 B.C.) the Lacedaemonians, roused by the taunts of those whom they had left behind as too old for service, took the field under both their kings, Theopompus and Polydorus who had succeeded Alcamenes. A long and obstinate battle was fought, but again without decisive result. From this time the fortunes of the Messenians declined. Their slaves deserted, and they felt the pressure of the expense of keep ing up the garrisons in the towns. Disease also broke out among them.

In this Euphaes elected king. was slain, after a reign of thirteen years. As he left no children, the choice of a successor was left to the people. Besides Aristodemus, the two commanders, Damis and Cleonis, had won popular favour. The soothsayers strongly opposed Aristodemus, as guilty of his daughter's blood, but he was nevertheless elected king. He pursued a popular policy, and at the same time paid the utmost respect to the leading citizens, more especially to Damis and Cleonis. He also attempted to strengthen the Messenian cause by alliances with Arcadia, Argos and Sicyon. Under Aristodemus the war went on for four years (730-726 B.C.) in the same desultory fashion as before. Each nation ravaged the terri tory of the other. In the fifth year (725 B.C.) a great battle was fought, the Corinthians aiding the Lacedaemonians ; the Arcadians in full force, together with some Sicyonians and Argives, joining the Messenians. The battle was fought near Ithome, and after a long and violent contest the Messenians won the day. The next two years passed away without any decisive action. Each side consulted the Delphic oracle, but with little success. At length, in the twentieth year The wooden of the war, it was announced from Delphi to tripods.

In the meantime the oracle had been announced at Sparta, and Oebalus, a man of the middle class, determined to fulfil the condition demanded by the oracle. He prepared a hundred tripods of clay, put them in a wallet, and suc ceeded in entering Ithome, where he placed them in the night round the altar. In the morning the Messenians, to their great dismay, found the altar surrounded by tripods. The end quickly came. Portents of various kinds dis tressed the Messenians. The bronze statue of Artemis dropped her shield ; and when Aristodemus was about to sacrifice to Zeus, the rams leapt on the altar and butted each other to death. Dogs gathered in packs, and, after howling through the night, ran away to the Lacedaemonians. The unfortunate Aristodemus was visited by a dream of evil omen. He was armed for battle, and the sacrificial meat lay before him on the table, when suddenly his daughter appeared clad in black, her bosom open and wounded. She threw down all that was on the table and carried away his arms, leaving in their place a garland and a shroud \u2014 the emblems of death. Aristodemus slew himself in despair at his daughter's tomb.1 On the death of Aristodemus the Messenians lost heart. They chose no king to succeed him, but Damis was elected general. He associated Cleonis and Phyleus with him in the command. Another battle was fought, for famine was be ginning to be felt in Ithome. In spite of their bravery the Messenians were defeated : the three commanders fell in the contest. Ithome was evacuated and razed to the ground. 8. Such is the account which Pausanias gives of the first Messenian war. That it lasted twenty years is clear from Criticism of the ***le l'nes \u00b0**? Tyrtaeus, in which he tells us that account of the the Messenians left Ithome in the twentieth war\" year. Such a statement proves that the struggle was severe and exhausting, but the events of the war, even 1 Paus. iv. 12 ff."], [285, "VIII. 9.] END OF FIRST MESSENIAN WAR. 267 if we put aside all the more mythical details, the oracles, omens, and sacrifices, are vague and unintelligible, and many of the details which Pausanias gives are more than doubtful. Though the Messenians are never worsted in any battle but the last, their cause is always growing more hopeless. The movements in the battles are given with precision and the commanders are named, but, with the exception of the last two, which take place near Ithome, no locality is assigned to them. It is clear that we have here a Messenian account, which, while admitting what it was impossible to deny, that the Messenians were conquered in the war, will not admit their defeat in open battle. The proceedings of the Messenian ecclesia resemble the ar rangements of the fourth century B.C. more than those of the seventh. The choice of a king is left to the populace, who assemble in the ecclesia from the neighbouring cities, as they doubtless did after the restoration of Messenia by Epaminon das. They have it in their power to leave the throne vacant, and elect a \"general,\" an officer of a distinctly democratic type. We know nothing of the condition of Messenia in early times, and it is possible that the Dorian rulers were anxious to conciliate the old population of the country in every way. But the circumstances in which the history of the Messenian war may have been written down make it necessary to draw attention to these apparently later traits in the account of an ancient struggle. The inability of the Lacedaemonians to capture walled cities is a commonplace ; the \"desertion of the slaves,\" the \"pressure of the expense,\" and \" the plague,\" which distressed the Messenians, bear a great resemblance to incidents of the Peloponnesian war. 9.

A home was also assigned on the sea-coast to the Dryopians, who had been recently expelled from Asine by the Argives. 10.

Those whose wives bore sons during the war called the children Partheniae, and excluded them from the rights of citizens. Such degradation was intolerable to those affected by it. They determined to revolt. The festival of the Hyacinthia at Amyclae was fixed upon as the occasion of the outbreak ; the concerted signal was the raising of his cap by Phalan thus, who was the leader of the conspiracy. The plot was discovered, and when the assembly was gathered together at the festival an order was issued that Phalanthus was not to raise his cap. The opposing parties came to terms, and 1 Tyrtaeus, Frag. 6 and 7. 2 Paus. iv. 14. 4. 3 Strabo, p. 278.

He was commanded to colonise Tarentum.1 Ephorus dwells more on the name Partheniae. The Spartans, he tells us, had bound themselves by an oath not to return home till the war with Messenia was ended. But in the tenth year the women sent to their husbands, pointing out that while the Messenians were raising up children during the war, a generation was passing away at Sparta without a new one to take its place. The husbands, being bound by their oaths, could not return to Sparta. They therefore sent the younger men, who being children when they left home were not included in the vow, and bade them unite with the maidens. The offspring of these unions were known as Partheniae. After the war the Partheniae, as born out of wedlock, were disfranchised. Hence arose the revolt. Ephorus does not fix the time or place of the outbreak, nor mention the appeal to Delphi. According to his account the young men were persuaded by their fathers to go out to a colony on the condition that if the colony were a failure they should receive a fifth part of the land of Messenia.2 Neither of these accounts deserves credit. There is no reason given in Ephorus why the young men returning from the army should not have married the maidens. Nor is it at all probable that the Spartans, who remained at home during the war, were reduced to the condition of slaves by those who had taken the field, as Antiochus asserts. Both accounts assume that the Spartans were absent from home for twenty years, when carrying on a war upon the borders of their own country ! Lastly, Aristotle tells us that the Partheniae belonged to the Spartan peers or Homoei, that they revolted because they did not share in certain privileges, and that they were sent to Tarentum.3 1 Strabo, I.e. : Saripiov rot.

The result which we can deduce from these accounts is : (1) That after the end of the first Messenian war some con stitutional changes took place at Sparta to the detriment of the so-called Partheniae ; (2) that these Partheniae belonged to the Spartan peers ; (3) that they entered into a conspiracy which was discovered ; (4) that they founded the colony of Tarentum. It is not impossible that in the division of the conquered territory of Messenia severer regulations were introduced in regard to citizenship, which excluded many of those who were previously considered to be Spartans ; but we have no historical grounds for this assumption.1 II. In spite of the exhaustion of the war and the danger of internal insurrection, the Spartans were able towards the end Development 0I tne eighth century to wrest from the Argives of Sparta. the district of Thyreatis, which formed the border land between the two kingdoms.2 Thus they were secure on the east and west, and at the same time a large amount of territory had been won for division among the citizens. The good-will of the Eleans had also been gained by the assistance rendered in resisting the aggression of Phidon.

Thaletas or Thales was a native of Gortyn in Crete. He is said to have been brought to Sparta at the command of the Delphic oracle, to purify the city after the visitation of a pestilence.1 He introduced at Sparta (perhaps from Crete) the martial dances and orchestral music which formed part of the entertainment at the fes tival of the Gymnopaediae (665 B.C.).2 Alcman was a native of Sardis in Lydia, who had become domiciled at Sparta. He composed paeans and choric songs, but his fame chiefly rested on his Parthenia, or songs sung by the maidens of Sparta to the accompaniment of the flute and cithara \u2014 poems remarkable for the combina tion of religious and secular elements and for the variety of the metres in which they were composed. These Parthenia became among the most popular poems in Greece.3 12. In 669 B.C. the Lacedaemonians suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Argives at Hysiae, on the road from Tegea to Argos. From the situation of Defeatofthe the battle-field we may infer that the Spartans Spartans at had in some way obtained possession of Tegea, Hysiae though the town was certainly independent nearly a cen tury later.4 However this may be, the defeat was so 1 Paus. i. 14. 4.

In 668 B.C. we find the Pisatans again celebrating the Olympic festival (supra, p. 240), and in 659 B.C. the Spartans were compelled to relinquish Phigalea, an outlying village in the south-west of Arcadia.

At this crisis a leader arose who became the hero of Messenia for all time to come \u2014 Aristo menes, the son of Nicomedes and Nicotelea. He is the Achilles of the poem of Bhianus, the life and soul of the rebellion, whose memory and exploits were no doubt revived when Messenia was once more freed from the yoke of her conqueror. After some secret preparations (thirty-eight years after the capture of Ithome, i.e. 688 B.C., according to Pausanias,1 but in all probability more than a generation later, about 645 B.C.), the Messenians revolted, with the aid of the Argives, 1 This date cannot be correct.

Pausanias himself follows the lead of Tyrtaeus in fixing the kings who reigned at Lacedaemon in the second Messenian war, about whom the lists were discreetly silent. He regards Anaxander, the grandson of Polydorus, and Anaxidamus, the great grandson of Theo pompus (Archidamus, the son of Theopompus, had died before his father), as the reigning kings when the second war was fought.

The Arcadians were led by Aris tocrates of Orchomenus ; the Pisatans by Pantaleon.1 13. In the first year a battle was fought at Derae. Though the result was indecisive, Aristomenes distinguished himself so greatly in the conflict that he was at once Progress of the chosen to be king, an honour which he declined rebellion. in favour of the more popular title of general with full powers. After the battle, resolving to achieve some act which would impress the Spartans yet more with the terror of his name, he proceeded by night to Sparta, and suspended his shield in the temple of Athena of the Brazen House, as an offering \" by Aristomenes from the Spartans.\" The Spartans, at the bidding of the oracle, now applied to Athens for some one to lead them in the contest. The Athenians, who neither wished to see Sparta mistress of Messenia, nor to incur the blame of disobe- \u201e Tvrtflcus. dience to Delphi, sent Tyrtaeus thither, a schoolmaster whom they held in very little estimation, and who was moreover lame in one foot. Tyrtaeus, on his first arrival, encouraged the Spartans by his poems, and he continued throughout the war to be their support and stay. Another great battle was now fought at the \" Boar's Monu ment,\" in the neighbourhood of Stenyclarus, in which the allies on either side took part (643 B.C.). The Messenians were aided by the Eleans, Arcadians, Argives and Sicyonians, and by the descendants of Androcles, who had been settled at Hyamea after the first war ; the Spartans by the Corin thians. The Lepreatae also joined the Spartans from hatred of the Eleans.2 The Lacedaemonians were severely beaten, and were only restrained by the entreaties of Tyrtaeus from offering terms to the Messenians. This success allowed Aristo menes to roam freely through the country.

A similar attempt on the priestesses of Demeter at Aegila was defeated, the women defending themselves with the spits and sacrificial knives. Aristomenes was even taken prisoner, but he was released on the same night by the priestess Archedamea, who had long cherished an affection for him. In the following year a third battle was fought, in which, owing to the treachery of the Arca dians who had received money from the Lacedaemonians, the Messenians were defeated.1 This was the battle of the Ditch or Trench. Aristomenes after this disaster determined to aban don Andania, together with all the fortresses in the plain, and retire to Eira, in the extreme north of Messenia, on the borders of Arcadia.2 Here he was able to maintain himself for eleven years longer, making constant raids upon the nearest parts of the Spartan territory, until the Spartans passed a decree not to cultivate Messenia or the part of Laconia adjacent to Messenia.3 1 Pausanias (iv. 16) comments on this as the first instance of bribery. In this battle also (he says) fell Phanas, who had obtained a victory in the long course at Olympia. 2 Paus. iv. 17. According to Paus. viii. 5. 13, the family of Aristo crates were deposed in consequence of his treachery. In Plutarch (De Sera Num. Vind. 2) the treachery is said to have remained undiscovered for twenty years. Pausanias gives the following account of the death of Aristocrates (iv. 22). When the Arcadians heard of the fall of Eira, they were eager to march to the aid of the Messenians, but Aristocrates refused to lead them. The Arcadians then prepared to receive the survivors on Mount Lycaeus, and proposed to divide them among their cities. Aristomenes, however, organised a band of 500 Messenians and 300 Arcadians to attack Sparta in the absence of the Spartans. This plan was betrayed by Aristocrates to the Spartans, but his treachery was discovered owing to the arrest of his envoys by some Arcadians, who suspected him. Aristocrates was stoned to death, his body cast out without burial, aud the record of his treachery engraved upon a pillar of stone. 3 The Spartans suffered so much from their incursions that those who possessed land in Messenia demanded reparation from those whose territory did not suffer equally. A new division of land, or a faction, which might have ended in the destruction of Sparta, seemed the only alternatives. But Tyrtaeus healed the breach by his elegiac poem Eunomia (Arist. Pol. v. 7. 4=1307 a ; Paus. iv. 18. I, 2), of which a few fragments remain."], [293, "VIII. 14.] ARISTOMENES AND THE FOX. 275 On one of these occasions Aristomenes was captured by the Spartans, together with fifty others. The prisoners were thrown into the abyss known as Caiadas, a Aristomenes in punishment inflicted on the worst malefactors. the Caiadas. All the rest were killed by the fall, but Aristomenes reached the bottom unhurt. He crawled to the end of the pit and there drew his robe round him, in expectation of certain death. On the third day, being disturbed by a sound which caused him to remove his garment from his face, he saw a fox gnawing one of the dead bodies. He at once perceived that the fox must have some means of entrance into the pit. Wait ing therefore till it approached him, he seized the animal's tail with one hand, and with the other held out his robe to defend himself from its teeth. In this way he followed it for a considerable distance until the light appeared through a small aperture, large enough to admit the fox. Leaving it to escape, Aristomenes proceeded to enlarge the hole till he could himself pass through it. In this way he escaped, and returned to Eira. 14. The desultory warfare still went on.

From his con cealment he heard the Messenian tell his wife that owing to the violence of the storm, which made it improbable that the Spartans would attempt an attack, the garrison had left the walls. The deserter slipped out undetected, and carried the information to the Spartans, who at once gave orders for an attack. After an obstinate struggle Aristomenes, finding that resistance was useless, requested permission for the remaining Messenians to leave Eira, a request to which the Spartans, who did not wish to waste lives in contending with desperate men, thought it right to accede. The war was now at an end (c. 630 B.C.) ; for though, against the com mands of their king, the Arcadians received some of the Messenians on Mount Lycaeus, Aristomenes was no longer able to organise any resistance to Sparta. 15. Part of the Messenians were conveyed from Eira to Cyllene in Elis, where they were joined after a time by Messenians those who had taken refuge in Arcadia. In at Zancie. the spring following the end of the war, these homeless exiles resolved to found a colony in the west ; some suggested an establishment at Zacynthus, from which they could damage the Laconian sea-board, others wished to sail to Sardinia, which was at that time the largest of all known islands.1 , Meanwhile Anaxilaus, the tyrant of Rhegium, the great grandson of Alcidamas, who had led the Messenians to Bhegium after the first war, requested them to join him in an attack on Zancie, on condition that they should receive the rich territory of the city. To this they assented. They sailed to Sicily, and defeated the Zanclaeans on land, while Anaxilaus defeated them by sea. Anaxilaus urged the Mes senians to cut down the Zanclaeans even at the altars, to 1 The attraction which Sardinia had for the Greeks is remarkable.

They received the suppliants into their protection, and came to terms with them, the name of the city being changed from Zancie to Messene. Those Messenians who remained at home were reduced to the condition of Helots. Aristomenes retired to Rhodes, where he became, through his daughter, the ancestor of the Diagoridae. 16. In addition to the difficulties which attend the account of the first Messenian war, we have in the second the mythical traits in the history of the hero , . TT . , , . , , . Difficulties in Aristomenes. He indulges in the most daring the account of exploits; is captured again and again by the the Messenian enemy, but released ; is miraculously saved when thrown into Caiadas, and finally, when resistance is no longer possible, he retires unscathed to Rhodes to end his days in peace. The details of the battles are given as before with minute accuracy ; but the intrigue between the Spartan and the wife of the Messenian, and the story of the fox in Caiadas, are related with equal precision, and we cannot determine the truth of events by their intrinsic probability. The outline of the facts remains true. After a contest extend ing over some fourteen or fifteen years, the Messenians, who had been driven into Eira, as they had previously been driven into Ithome, were compelled to submit. A number of them settled at Zancie, with the assistance of Anaxilaus. Others who remained at home were compelled to accept the position of Helots. The district of Methone was given to the Naup lians, who had been recently expelled by Damocratidas, king of Argos. The most remarkable feature in the second war, next to the mythical figure of Aristomenes, is the part assigned to the poet Tyrtaeus. There is no doubt that his songs were sung by the Spartans, and they may have helped in bringing 1 There is a striking resemblance between this story and that told of the Samians in Herod, vi. 23.

Greece, ii. 439 ff. The Messenians, not the Spartans, were under the ban of the Dioscuri. Pausanias (iv. 27. l) relates a legend to account for this. Two young Messenians, Gonippus and Panormus, personated the Dioscuri at a festival held in their honour, and in this disguise slew many of the Spartans. 2 Whether Tyrtaeus was an Athenian is doubtful. In a fragment of his Eunomia he appears to speak of himself as a Lacedaemonian. Had Herodotus been aware that an Athenian had been adopted at Sparta he would not have spoken of Tisamenus and Hegias as the only foreigners who ever received the Spartan franchise (Herod, ix. 35)."], [297, "CHAPTER IX.

In the north of Attica a tetrapolis was formed by the combination of the four towns, Marathon, Oenoe, Trikorythus and Pro balinthus, where Apollo Pythius, Heracles and Dionysus were worshipped in common. The four demes of Piraeus, Phalerum, Xypete and Thymoetidae were known as the Tetrakomi; they combined for the worship of Heracles. Similar associations existed in other parts of the country; they were, in fact, common throughout Hellas \u2014 an almost inseparable stage in the history of the growth of the city-state; and, therefore, when Philochorus asserts that Cecrops arranged Attica in twelve communities, it may be true that even in 1 Thuc. ii. 15. The statement of Thucydides is supported by the remains of fortifications found in the neighbourhood of the ridge of Aegialos, which were intended to protect the Eleusinian plain from the incursions of the Athenians. 2 Plut. Thes. 13. 279"], [298, "280 EARL Y A TT1CA : ' A UTOCHTHONY.' [IX. 2. very early times there were at least twelve townships which formed centres of union such as those described. The plain of the Cephisus is the largest and most fertile in Attica. It is also protected by the strongest natural Names of the fortress \u2014 the Acropolis of Athens \u2014 and where communities. ft, touches the sea possesses the best and most convenient harbour. Hence Athens, or Cecropia, as it is called in the list of Philochorus, was the abode of the most important and powerful community in Attica. Next in importance was Eleusis, the capital of the Thriasian plain, the seat of the worship of Demeter, and after Eleusis came the Tetrapolis of the north. The remaining settlements enume rated by Philochorus are Epacria, Decelea, Aphidnaea, Thoricus, Brauron, Cytherus, Sphettus, Cephisia and perhaps Phalerum. The statement that there were precisely twelve towns is of course of no value, but the names probably denote the places which were of most importance in the earliest Attic legends.1 2. The Athenians were proud of the autochthony of their race, though, as we have seen, they also maintained that \u25a0Autochthony' Attica was the common refuge of all who had of the been expelled by conquest from other parts of Athenians. Greece. That the country had never been conquered as Laconia, Argos and Thessaly were conquered, is tolerably certain. We have no trace in Athenian history or legend of a subordinate class like the Helots, or Penestae. Nor were the inhabitants ever driven from their homes to seek refuge elsewhere. On the other hand, the immigrants, whatever their nationality, seem to have readily coalesced with the native population. The settlement at Tetrapolis is said to have been of Dorian origin, and Eumolpus, the king of Eleusis, is represented as a Thracian ; but this did not prevent the inhabitants of Marathon from uniting with their Ionian neighbours, or the Eumolpidae from ranking as a distinguished Athenian family. By what means the inhabi tants of Attica succeeded in solving a problem which else- 1 Philochorus, ap. Strab. p. 397. The last name is lost."], [299, "IX. 3] UNION OF A TTICA. 281 where presented insuperable difficulties, and combining in a union which extended over the whole country, we do not know. Before history begins, Athens had achieved a result which Thebes under Epaminondas was unable to attain. That the change did not take place without long and severe con tests, is highly probable. The legendary conflicts of Erechtheus and Eumolpus, of Theseus and the Pallantidae, are echoes of these struggles. 3. Theseus, to whom the union of Attica is ascribed, is said to have induced the chiefs of the rural townships, partly by force and partly by persuasion, to abandon their separate council chambers, and accept perhaps due Athens as the political centre for the whole of to i<^\u00bban_ the country. The home of Theseus is Troezen, on the eastern coast of Argolis, which appears to have been inhabited by the Ionian race, and he is the son of Aegeus, who may be regarded as identical with Poseidon, the deity worshipped by the Ionians. There is, therefore, reason to think that the union of Attica was due to an incursion of Ionians from the south. These immigrants, who were rather mariners than husbandmen, joined with the old population of the plain of the Cephisus, who worshipped Athena as a goddess of fertility on the Acropolis in connection with Erechtheus or Hephaestus. The combined forces achieved the union of Attica, and when thus united the Athenians were able to expel the foreign settlers who had established themselves at Marathon or in the neighbourhood of Athens. The union of the country was commemorated by the institu tion of the festival of the Synoecia.1 1 It is a confirmation of thi3 view of early Attic history, that Poseidon and Athena continued to be worshipped side by side on the citadel of Athens. Poseidon is also represented as contending with Athena for Troezen, where both deities were worshipped as at Athens (Paus. ii. 30. 6) ; with Helius for Corinth (ib. ii. 1. 6) ; with Hera for Mycenae (ib. ii. 15. 5). For the union of villages to form towns, see Strabo, p. 337, who gives instances from Arcadia and Achaea. Busolt (Griech. Gesch. i. 3S6) observes that Thucydides' view of the union of Attica may have been influenced by the union of Elis in 472 B.C."], [300, "282 EUPATRIDAE, GEOMORI, DEMIURGI. [IX. 4, 5. 4. To Theseus is also ascribed the division of the people into Eupatridae, or nobles ; Geomori, or husbandmen ; and Division Demiurgi, or artisans. The precise meaning into classes. 0f division is very obscure. The concen tration of the nobles at Athens, who must have left their estates in the hands of tenants or retainers, would bring out more strongly the distinction between the owner and the tiller of the soil. The necessities of a town life and the growth of trade would largely increase the numbers of artisans, who, while flocking to the city, naturally collected in a particular place distinct from the quarter occupied by the nobles. In this sense the union of Attica may be said to have given prominence to distinctions which in a greater or less degree are present in any form of society which has emerged from nomadism. But whether the Eupatridae included all the wealthy nobility; whether the classes were rigidly separated from each other, or the poorer members of the noble families fell into the ranks of the Geomori ; whether those who tilled land which they did not own were classed as Geomori or Demiurgi are questions which it is impossible to answer. Another distinction which arose at this time, from similar causes, was that between the inhabitants of the city and those of the country \u2014 the aoroi and a-ypoiKoi.1 5, More important is the arrangement of the Athenians in four tribes : Geleontes, Hopletes, Argadeis and Aegicoreis. Division The origin and nature of these tribes, which into tribes. continued to exist till the time of Clisthenes, when they were replaced by the new ten tribes, are very imperfectly understood. At first sight the names appear to denote occupations : Aegicoreis, at any rate, may mean goat herds, Hopletes, armed warriors. On this ground it was ima gined in antiquity that Ion, who was the traditional author of this division into tribes, had arranged the Athenians in four fitoi, or modes of life,2 and that in fact a system of caste 1 See Busolt, I.e. pp. 387-389. How these distinctions are com patible with the local divisions mentioned on p. 290 we have not the means of ascertaining. They are little more than names to us. 2 Strabo, p. 383."], [301, "IX. S-] TRIBAL DIVISIONS. 283 prevailed in ancient Attica, not unlike that of Egypt.1 Yet even in antiquity the interpretation of the names was doubt ful. Strabo tells us that the four \" lives \" instituted by Ion were the husbandmen, the artisans, the priests and the guardians. These answered to the Aegicoreis, the Argadeis, the Geleontes and the Hopletes. Plutarch gives a different explanation. In his view the Hopletes are the soldiers, the Argadeis are the artisans, the Aegicoreis the shepherds, and the Geleontes the field labourers. It is clear from this that the true signification of the name Geleontes was quite unknown to Strabo and Plutarch. Whatever the meaning of the names may have been, it is improbable that the tribes denoted local divisions of Attica, or distinct occupations in life. In the first place they are not peculiar to Attica. Tradition is so far .... ., . , x ., , ,1 The Tribes not right in ascribing them to Ion, that they are iocai,nordo Ionian rather than Attic, the fourfold division they denote being as characteristic of the Ionian race as the threefold is of the Dorian.2 Moreover, such a division is inconsistent with the existence of a number of independent communities in various parts of Attica. In the combinations which grew up among the villages, before the country was united round Athens, we hear nothing whatever of any four fold division of the whole. In legendary history Pandion divided the country (excluding Megara) into three, not into four sections ; the factions of the time of Pisistratus, which represent distinct sections of the country, are three, not four 1 Plato (Tim. 24) compares the arrangements in ancient Athens with those in Egypt. \" There is the caste of priests, which is separated from all others ; there are the artificers, who exercise their usual crafts by themselves, and without admixture of any others ; and also there is the clan of shepherds, and that of hunters, as well as that of husbandmen, etc.\" 2 Clisthenes removes the tribes because they are Ionian (Herod. v. 69). We find evidence of the existence of the tribes in Teos, Ephesus, Cyzicus, Tomi and Perinthus (Busolt, Griech. Gesch. p. 393, note 6). The variant Teleontes (which might mean priests) for Geleontes appears to be a mistake."], [302, "284 EARLY ATTICA: TRIBAL DIVISIONS. [IX. 5. in number ; and there is no hint in them of any opposition between the tribes. The distinction of occupations is even more improbable. In the Solonian senate one hundred mem bers are taken equally from each tribe, which presumes equality among them. In what sense could they be equal, if one were the tribe of the soldiers, another the tribe of the herdmen 1 Would not the whole country be at the mercy of the Hopletes if they formed an order distinct from the rest 1 It is, of course, true that many of the families which com posed the tribes gave their names to the villages in which Tribes are they dwelt. We may compare these with not races. similar settlements in England \u2014 Semachidae, Titacadae, Cropidae, with Notting-ham, Bucking-ham, Wal ling-ford, etc. ; and we may infer that Attica was at some time invaded by tribes, which included a variety of gentes or families. When the country was conquered, each family settled on the plot which it had secured. But we have no evidence to show what was the real connection between the members of the family. Was it one of blood only, or was the tie of blood already extended by some fic tion or another, so that men not connected by race with a family were nevertheless included in it, just as whole families, though of alien blood, were admitted to the com munity ? We have no means whatever of answering this question; but two reflections are obvious: (1) The invaders of Attica had settled elsewhere before they settled in Attica, and when thus settled they had undergone whatever relax ing influence a fixed abode exercises on a tribe (by the substitution of local connection for blood-relationship \u2014 the parish for the family) ; (2) Emigrants, unless they are purely nomadic tribes, are usually adventurers, who have broken with the institutions of their kindred, or are for some reason excluded from them. If this were the case with the smaller aggregates, much more so with the larger. The relationship of the members of a tribe was a mere fiction. In practice the families never went higher than the phratry"], [303, "IX. 6.] EARL Y A TT1CA : PYLIAN KINGS\u2014 LAP1THAE. 285 (of which there were three in each tribe) in assuming con sanguinity. Even as a union of gentes, the tribe is without historical value. We must not suppose that there were four tribes of different descent or race in early Attica (infra, \u00a7 18).1 Upon this evidence it is most reasonable to suppose that the tribes were simply names for the largest political aggre gates. They had nothing to do with the residence, nothing to do with the occupations, nothing to do with the descent of the men included in them. They are not restricted to Attica, but represent some ancient division of the Ionians. In the first instance the name may have arisen from the occupation of the members, and they may have been guilds rather than tribes ; but the meaning of the names was lost or disregarded when the division was applied to the Athenians. 6. After the expulsion of Theseus, Menestheus, a descen dant of Pandion, became king of the country. When he fell before Troy, the throne reverted to Demophon, Refugees the son of Theseus. Then followed, of the in Attica same family, Apheidas, Oxyntas, Thymoetas, the two last being brothers. In the reign of Thymoetas, the Pylians came to Attica, flying before the Dorians, with Mel anthus at their head. At this time the Boeotians attacked Attica from the north, and Xanthus, their chief, challenged Thymoetas to single combat. Thymoetas declined, being old, but Melanthus engaged with the Boeotian chief, and slew him. After his victory he became king, and the devotion of his son Codrus, who succeeded him, secured the throne to the Pylian family (supra, p. 118). There is no reason to doubt that attacks were made upon Attica from the north and south in the times which followed the Dorian movement ; and it is certainly true that by some means or another a family tracing descent from Neleus, the king of Pylus, came to the throne at ap' Athens. We also find families claiming to be descendants from 1 See Appendix I., at the end of the chapter, for some interesting illustrations of Greek history in early English institutions."], [304, "286 THE MEDONTIDAE\u2014 MONARCHICAL CHANGES. [IX. 7. the Lapithae and Cadmeans among the Attic tribes, which were possibly enlarged about this time to admit the strangers who flocked to Attica. But the same generosity was not ex tended to all immigrants. The Pelasgi of Boeotia were never admitted to the tribes. A portion of land was, it is said, assigned to them at the foot of Hymettus, in return for their services in building the so-called \"Pelasgic wall\" on the Acropolis ; but they did not long re main in the country. Different legends were told about their expulsion \u2014 some more, some less creditable to the Athenians ; but expelled they were. They took refuge partly in Lemnos and Imbros, and partly in the peninsula of Athos, where they continued to live in the time of Thucydides.1 7. Legend tells us that the Athenians, out of gratitude to Codrus, would not allow the title of king to be borne by any changes in the 0I the rulers who succeeded him. Though his monarchy. posterity, known as the Medontidae from his son Medon, remained on the throne for many generations after his death, they were not /?ao-tAeis or kings, but archons ; and though they held office for life, they were in some way responsible to the community.2 Such evidence as we have contradicts the statement that the title was changed. Long after Medon's time the archons were known as kings, and one of them retained the name even in democratic Athens. But there is no reason to doubt that the powers of the monarchs were greatly diminished \u2014 that aristocracy, or the govern ment of the nobles, took the place of the government of the chief or king. This change went on universally in Greece. The nobles, who even under a warlike monarchy were the coun cillors of the king, became his rivals in the government, when it was engaged with civil rather than with military matters. In Corinth the monarchy was removed about the middle of the eighth century (745 B.C.), though the royal family con tinued to supply the prytanis, who was chosen annually to 1 Vide supra, pp. 28 (re.2), 59. 2 Pausanias speaks of the office as dpxq vireidvvos, iv. 5. 10; yet from ib. i. 3. 3, it would seem that the archons were called fiaciKeis."], [305, "287 IX. 8.] THE ARCHONSHIPS. preside over the State.

Forty years later the office was no longer reserved for the family of Codrus, but became accessible to all the Eupatridae. Finally, in 683 B.C., the single Nine annual decennial archon was abolished, and his powers archons. were divided among nine archons, who held office for a year only.1 How these changes were brought about we do not know. Later legends explained them by the weakness or cruelty of the archons in whose time they occurred. They were in evitable under any circumstances. The union of Attica brought a number of nobles from every part \u201e ... \u00b0 . . Causes which of the country to Athens.

The nobles alone were in possession of the law, and the administration of it.

Now the nobles were united, and the duties of office were shared among them in such a manner that a large number had either been archons or hoped to become archons ; it was the direct interest of each and all to support the members of their order in their administration. Little hope was there under such a rule for the poor man who had a complaint against the rich, or for the humble peasant who demanded satisfaction from his noble oppressor. 9. A government founded on such principles was of neces sity selfish and cruel. Circumstances seem to have made it Poverty and peculiarly severe in Attica. The soil of the debt in Attica, country was thin and unproductive, unable to support more than a moderate population, and any increase in the number of inhabitants led inevitably to an increase of poverty. The evil might have been met by emigration, but at this date the Athenians do not appear to have possessed many ships, or to have sought out new homes beyond the sea. The early Greek colonies, after the migrations, were not planted by Athens, but by Corinth, or Megara, or Chalcis. The Athenians remained in Attica, attempting to make the best of small farms and petty trades. The tract of land which was enough for one generation did not suffice for the"], [307, "IX. io.] THE LA WS OF USURY. 289 next ; the development of trade required capital, which could only be borrowed at a high rate of interest and under severe conditions. In all early forms of civilisation the laws of debt are very cruel. They are made by the rich for Laws of debt in the poor, without any insight into mercantile ear'y society, transactions, or knowledge of the causes of the growth of wealth. So far from aiming at the development or con venience of trade, they seek to make the lender secure and assure him a rich return for his loan. The laws of Attica provided that those who borrowed money without the security of land should become liable in themselves or their families. If the claim could not be met, the father was compelled to sell his children into slavery, or even to become a slave himself, the property of his creditor, to use or sell in or out of the country as he might please. If, on the other hand, a peasant borrowed money on his farm, a stone (6'pos) was set up on it, stating the amount of the loan granted. The interest, which was more than the land could provide the means of paying except under the most favourable conditions, was added to the principal, not year by year, but month by month, till in a short time it became necessary for the debtor to sell or come to terms with his creditors. If he sold, the purchaser was the creditor, or others of his class, whose interest lay in keeping down the price of land ; if he made an arrangement, he found himself a serf on his own property, bound to hand over five-sixths of the produce of his labour to his creditor, and degraded to a position in com parison to which the Helot of Sparta was a happy man.1 10. Similar conditions had existed beyond Attica, but remedies had been found. In Corinth and Megara, the cities nearest to Athens, the people had made The Commons their power felt. A member of the great atcorinth oligarchical family at Corinth, Cypselus, had and eeara thrown in his lot with the commons, and by their help had 1 Hectemorii.

Thea genes of Megara had secured for himself the goodwill of the people by an attack on some cattle belonging to the richer classes; they rose to support him, and by their assistance he was enabled to break the authority of the nobles and establish himself on the throne, Both Cypselus and Thea genes had connections in Athens : Miltiades, of the great family of the Philaidae, had married the daughter of Cyp selus ; Cylon, who in 640 B.C. gained a victory in the double course at Olympia, was the son-in-law of Theagenes. Might not one of these powerful nobles be tempted to follow in the path which had led to such brilliant results at Corinth and Megara ? The elements of success were not wanting ; for the commons, in their poverty and desperation, were ready to support and foster any signs of discord among the nobles. In that, and that only, lay their hope. Under no form of government could they be worse off than they were. It was indeed far better to have one master than many ; above all, a master who would lay on the nobles a large part of the burdens which had hitherto been imposed, directly or in directly, on the shoulders of the poor. II. The nobles seem to have taken alarm. Whether they had reason to suspect the intentions of Miltiades or Cylon Rise of parties we do not know, but it is certain that by some in Attica. means the people made their grievances felt. There were probably divisions in the oligarchic circle. About this time we may place the rise of the parties which, for the next half-century or more, continued to divide Attica : the Pedieis, or men of the plain ; the Parali, or men of the shore; the Diacrieis, or men of the mountains. The inhabitants of The men of the plains of Athens and Eleusis were wealthy the plain. landowners, who, in their contempt for the classes beneath them, were anxious to maintain the position which they occupied ; the men of the shore were traders and merchants, a mixed class, varying in wealth but experi enced in business, with minds opened by intercourse with other"], [309, "IX. 12.] EARLY ATTLCA : POSITION OF PARTIES. 291 cities. They had a stake in the welfare of the country, and well knew that their interests would not prosper in the hands of those who desired to keep up an exclusive The men of right to the administration of law and govern- the shore. ment. In wealth the merchant might surpass the landholder, but his position was still inferior, if he were denied access to the political rights of the nobility. At the same time the Parali had much to lose, and as revolution and domestic anarchy would damage them in their business, they wished above all things to effect a change peaceably ; they were the moderate party, and, like all moderate parties, were probably regarded with suspicion by both extremes. The The men 0f the men of the mountain were the rough herdmen mountain. and shepherds who pastured their flocks on the high lands between Parnes and Brilessus. To these any change was an advance; whether they looked to the shore or the plain they saw a wealth far beyond anything which it was in their power to win, while they were probably conscious of possessing a sturdy strength which was denied to their more prosperous neighbours.1 12. The most pressing need was a reform of the laws which bore so hardly on the poor. In their double position as repositories and administrators of the law, Nee<J for reform the nobles were open to the obvious charge of the system not only of administering the law in their own of law favour, but of making laws or altering hereditary customs for the benefit of their order. How could the trader or the peasant be persuaded that laws, which seemed so harsh, were the genuine laws of the city, as they existed in the days of his forefathers, or, if they were, that they were not in some way unfairly enforced 1 \"Let me know what the law is,\" he might reasonably say, \" before I am brought under it; let us all see what the penalties are, that we may know that justice according to law, and nothing more, is executed upon us.

To this Draco ordered tne n\u00b0bles found it necessary to consent; to write down Draco was elected archon, and empowered to a code- write down the laws of the State in order that all might know them (621 B.C.).1 This had already been done for the Locrians by Zaleucus, and for Catana by Charondas. 13. Of Draco himself we know nothing. Of his laws, those only which related to murder continued in use after Draco's code the time of Solon ; the rest were cancelled or of laws. superseded. The prevailing opinion about them was that they were excessively severe. Demades, the Athenian orator, is said to have remarked that the \" laws of Draco would seem to have been written, not n y' in ink, but in blood \" \u2014 an opinion not too strong for a code under which petty theft was punished by death, and any debtor who was unable to meet the demands of his creditor might be sold into slavery. But it is doubtful whether the harshness of his laws can be attributed to Draco. The oligarchs, in order to make this new concession as worthless as possible, may indeed have induced him to express the existing law in the severest terms, and extend, by analogy, penalties out of proportion to the offences. A theft is a theft, whether it be of a talent or a drachma ; the smaller offence comes under the same category as the larger, and may by a perverse logic have received the same penalty. But in any case, the practice under the written law can hardly have been more severe than what it was before the law was written down, or the difference would have been at once noticed, and the oligarchs would have lost all advantage which the concession might have won them.

When the democracy was restored in 411 B.C., after the revolution of the Four Hundred, it was resolved to revise the statute-book, and the king-archon with the clerk of the Council was authorised to give out a true copy of Draco's law, \" that it might be inscribed and set up before the porch of the king.\" A part of this inscription has been discovered, which, though mutilated, can be restored with some approach to certainty, by the. help of passages in Demosthenes.1 The law is taken from the first \" axon of Solon:\" \"If any one slay a man, not with intent, he must go into banishment. The kings shall be judges in charges for murder or intent, and the Ephetae shall give a verdict.\" 2 The rest is less certain ; it seems to enact that, in the case of involuntary homicide, if the relations of the dead refused to accept satisfaction, the Ephetae should choose Modifications of ten men out of the phratry to which he belonged, earlier rules and arrange the penalty with them ; and further, that any one who slew a murderer, so long as the murderer observed the restrictions laid upon him, and avoided the market on the borders of the land, the games and Amphictyonic sacrifices, should be held guilty of murder as in the case of any other Athenian.3 The kings (pao-iXcls) mentioned in the inscription are the king-archon and the four kings of the tribes (?) : these were to 1 C.

That they were established by Draco seems to"], [313, "IX. 14.] HUMANITY IN DRACO'S LAWS. 295 be pretty clearly made out; he appears to have thought that a crime so serious as homicide, which involved the pollution of the land, could not be judged by so small a body as the \" Kings.\" Why he fixed upon the num ber fifty-one we cannot say with certainty; the number might stand in some relation to the nine archons, if we knew that the archons and the Ephetae were in any way closely connected. Most probably the number is fifty + one, i.e. the first odd number after fifty.1 A court composed of fifty might be evenly divided, but this was impossible with an odd number (assuming that the full number must be pre sent, as in a jury). However this may be, it seems certain that Draco ordained that the Ephetae should sit at all the places where cases of homicide were tried, and that the final verdict of guilt or acquittal should be pronounced by them. This was not the only change which Draco introduced. The regulation that Ephetae might choose ten members from the phratry of a deceased person to \u25a0 r \u2022 , \u25a0 i i \u2022 p -i p i Humanity of accept the satisfaction which his family refused the changes to accept was humane and equitable.

A man was not to be persecuted and remain an outlaw when it had been clearly proved that his act was accidental or justifiable, merely to satisfy the revengeful spirit of the dead man's re latives. Draco also introduced into the law of homicide the merciful provision that no man who carefully observed the conditions imposed upon him by the sentence of law, could be put to death at the will of another. To slay a murderer (i.e. an involuntary homicide) who kept away from all the prohibited places was itself a murder, and to be treated as such. Both these rules were excellently calculated to check the spirit of family vengeance; they emphatically declared that murder 1 Demosthenes, p. 702, mentions a jury of 1001.

At the same time the penal court was increased to a number which represented the majesty of the State, and was far above the suspicion of prejudice in favour of a person or a family. 15. Little was gained by the publication of the laws. Within a few years \u2014 nine at the most \u2014 an attempt was made The attempt at Athens to establish a tyranny, after the of Cyion. pattern of Corinth and Megara. \" In the days of old,\" such is the story, \" there was an Athenian named Cylon, who had been an Olympic victor ; he was powerful and of noble birth, and he had married the daughter of Theagenes, a Megarian, who was at that time tyrant of Megara. In answer to an inquiry which Cylon made at Delphi, the god told him to seize the Acropolis at Athens at the greatest festival of Zeus. Thereupon he obtained forces from Theagenes, and, persuading his friends to join him, when the time of the Olympic festival came round he took posses sion of the Acropolis, intending to make himself tyrant. He thought that this was the greatest festival of Zeus, and, having been an Olympic victor, he seemed to have an interest in it. Whether the greatest festival spoken of was in Attica, or in some other part of Hellas, was a question which never entered into his mind, and the oracle said nothing about it. He thought that his interpretation was right, and made the attempt at the Olympic festival. The Athenians, when they saw what had happened, came in a body from the fields and invested the Acropolis. After a time they grew tired of the siege, and most of them went away, committing the guard to the nine archons, and giving them full powers to do what they thought best in the whole matter \u25a0 for in those days public affairs were chiefly administered by the nine archons. Cylon and his companions were in great distress from want of food and water : so he and his brother made their escape ; the rest being hard pressed, and some of them ready to die of hunger, sat as suppliants at the altar which is in the Acropolis. When the Athenians, to whose charge the"], [315, "IX. i5.] CYLONS CONSPIRACY. 297 guard had been committed, saw them dying in the temple, they bade them rise, promising to do them no harm, and then led them away and put them to death. They Failure of the even slew some of them in the very presence of attempt. the awful goddesses at whose altars, in passing by, they had sought refuge. The murderers and their descendants are held to be accursed, and offenders against the goddess. These accursed persons were banished by the Athenians ; and Cleomenes, the Lacedaemonian king, again banished them from Athens in a time of civil strife by the help of the opposite faction, expelling the living, and dis interring and casting forth the bones of the dead. Never theless they afterwards returned, and to this day their race survives in the city.\" 1 This is the account given by Thucydides of the first attempt to establish a tyranny in Athens. It was not a rising of the people against the nobles, but the attempt of an ambitious man, supported by a few friends and a body of Megarian soldiers, to grasp the supreme power. To the mass of the Athenians the movement seemed likely to bring Athens into subjection to Megara, and the people flocked from the country not to support the rising, as Cylon hoped, but to crush it. The account which Herodotus gives is brief, and in some details inconsistent with the statements of Thucydides. \" There was once an Athenian by name Cylon, . r\\i \u2022 tt Variations in who had won a victory at Olympia. He came the accounts forward as a man who aspired to regal power, of cyion's , , , y, \u25a0 , .. . i attempt. and having gottogether a following he attempted to seize the Acropolis. Unable to maintain his position, he took his seat with others as a suppliant at the Statue. The prytanes of the naucrari, who at that time managed the affairs of Athens, raised up the suppliants on condition that they should not be put to death ; but the Alcmaeonidae are accused of slaying them.\"2 From Plutarch we learn that 2 Herod, v. 71. 1 Thuc. i. 126, Jowett's translation."], [316, "298 POLITICAL CONDITION OF ATHENS. [IX. 16. Megacles was archon at the time. He persuaded the suppli ants to leave the Statue, and submit themselves to justice. In order to secure the protection of the goddess when leaving the shrine, they attached a cord to the base of the Statue, and held it in their hands while descending the hill. When they were near the altar of the Eumenides the cord broke. Megacles and his fellow-archons assumed that the goddess had abandoned her suppliants to their fate, and made an onslaught on their defenceless victims. All outside the precinct were stoned, all within were cut down, those only being allowed to escape who had made supplication to the wives of their conquerors.1 The attempt had been crushed, but a deed of violence and treachery had been done, which, when the danger of the moment passed away, could not but appear in its true enor mity. The land was stained with blood ; the most holy sanctuaries of the city had been violated ; the first officers of the State had trampled under foot the solemn pledges of faith and religion. In time these feelings bore fruit. For the present the attention of the people was called in another direction. 16. At this time the Archons were the chief executive power at Athens. The functions, which had originally been Political condi- exercised by the king, and after the overthrow tion of Athens. 0f the monarchy, by the elective archons, were divided among the nine as follows.

Sol. c. 12."], [317, "IX. i6.] POSITION OF THE ARCHONS. 299 sole representative of a house, or at least provide her with a suitable dowry to ensure her marriage, that the house might not become extinct. The Second Archon retained the title of \"King.\" Before him were brought complaints of outrage and murder, which he referred to their proper tribunals for decision, and all offences against religion. He wore the old royal dress, and his wife as the Queen of Athens for the year (flavLXiwa) was solemnly wedded to Dionysus at the Lenaeum, on the third day of the festival of the Anthes teria (spring). The Third Archon, or Polemarch, was the general-in-chief. He was the judge of the conduct of the citizens when serving as soldiers in the field (if accused of cowardice or desertion), and before him were brought all cases which concerned foreigners or aliens resident in Athens. The remaining six archons were called Thesmothetae. They were the ordinary magistrates of Athens, who sat as judges in cases respecting property (theft, embezzlement, breach of contracts, etc.) As there were no law-courts in existence at Athens at this time, the archons must have been both judge and jury in all cases but those of homicide. In later times, the first three archons were allowed to have assessors to aid them in the discharge of their duties, but these would not be required so long as the archons were chosen exclusively from the privileged classes. Besides the archons, the Kings of the tribes had some kind of judicial power. They were four in number, one for each tribe, and may have been elected annually.

These belong to a different organi sation of the country from that which rested J The Naucranes. on the families and phratries. Each of the four tribes was divided into three trittyes (triads) ; and each trittys into four naucraries. There were thus twelve naucraries 1 Duncker, Hist. Greece, ii. 141 note."], [318, "[IX. 16. 300 ATHENIAN NAUCRARIES. in each tribe, and forty-eight in all. The prytanes of the naucrari must have been the heads of these divisions. So far as we can ascertain, the naucraries were territorial divisions, made for the purpose of taxation or its equivalent. Each naucrary was called on to supply one ship and two horsemen to the state, and doubtless the prytanes were responsible for the performance of these duties. The prytanes of the naucrari were thus the counterparts of the demarchs of later times, with whom they are compared by ancient writers. Herodotus indeed tells us that \" they managed Athens \" at the time of the Cylonian conspiracy, and were responsible for the acts of treachery and sacrilege which brought it to a close. But in this he is probably mistaken, or his account may be that which the Alcm\u00e6onid\u00e6 chose to give of the matter. For the guilt of Cylonian pollution was definitely fixed on Megacles, the archon of the year, and his family were the \" accursed.\" The prytanes of the naucrari may have been very active in the management of local affairs, but they could not have been officers of great executive authority in the city. It is remark able that a division into twelve trittyes should have existed in Attica side by side with a division into twelve phratries (p. 302), and if the two were not identical, as some authorities assert, the divisions crossed. The arrangement into gentes and phratries was inclusive of all those who could in any way be enrolled as Athenian citizens ; but the arrangement into naucraries may have included those who though resident in Attica were not Athenians in the strict sense. Hence the naucraries could not be grouped into the phratries, and the trittys was invented as a link to connect them with the tribe (p. 284). In the tribe all idea of family relationship was lost, and it served equally well as the highest aggregate for gentile and territorial groups.1 1 Naucraries, cf. Aristot.

In the constitution of a Greek city, even when it is monarchical, we hear of a Council or Senate ((3ov\\rj). Such a Senate existed at Lacedaemon, in the Gerousia; at Argos and at Corinth. But it is extremely difficult to say what constituted the Council at Athens before the time of Solon. The Areopagus does not seem to have been concerned with other than judicial matters. It ap parently met at intervals only, and was by no means a stand ing council for the transaction of business. It may be that the large body of archons rendered a standing council un necessary, especially if the tribal kings were associated with them, and the prytanes of the naucraries managed the local business of the land. When the murderers of the Cylonian conspirators were brought to justice they were tried before a council of 300 of their own order, but it cannot be proved that this council was not an extraordinary assembly, con vened for the occasion (but see infra, Appendix ii.). Nor can we speak with any certainty of the nature or duties of the General Assembly (e/cicA^o-to) in the century before Solon. The people must have had some power, or the Draconian laws would not have been published, and Solon would not have been chosen to reform the constitution. We do not know that the officers were elected by, or responsible to, the assembly, and of legislative and judicial authority the people had none. Perhaps we may assume that war could not easily be pro claimed without their consent, as they formed the bulk of the soldiers. If that were the case, the safety and power of the State depended, in the last resort, upon the General Assembly. 18. Greek historians speak of the \"families\" in Attica (yevi]) as aggregates into which the Athenians were classified. In other words they regard them as artificial Thesociaicondi rather than natural. \" The titles ' Gennetae ' tion of Athens : and ' belonging to the same gens ' (yhos) were ami les' not given (we are told) to those who were akin in the stricter sense, but to those who were at the first distributed into the"], [320, "EARLY ATTICA: SOCIAL CONDITION. [IX. 18. 302 so-called gentes.\" Philochorus, the historian of the third century B.C., remarks that those who had previously been called Homogalactes (\"partakers of the same milk\") were after wards called Gennetae. The same author states that \" the Phratries were compelled to receive both the Orgeones (sacrificers) and the Homogalactes, whom we call Gennetae.\" We may therefore suppose that the phratry included two classes: (1) Those who were called \"partakers of the same milk \" because they were supposed to be akin by blood ; and (2) \" sacrificers,\" i.e. men who, though they could not claim even the fiction of blood-relationship, were associated in common sacrifices with members of the yevij. The number of families allotted to a gens was thirty ; and again there were thirty gentes in a phratry. This would give 900 houses in each phratry, and as there were twelve phratries in all (three in each of the four tribes), there would be 10,800 houses for the whole population. If we allow three males in each family we get a population of 32,400 male citizens for the whole of Attica.1 Each phratry had a place of meeting (cppdrpwv) where the members assembled under the presidency of the phratriarch. At these meetings were decided all questions touching the legitimacy of those who claimed a place in the gentes belonging to the association. When a man married he introduced his wife to his phratry at a ban quet ; when his children were born they were admitted into the phratry, and, if challenged, the father swore solemnly that they were his offspring, born in lawful wedlock.

On the next day sacrifices were offered to Zens Phratrius and Athena Phratria, and hymns were sung to Hephaestus. On the third day followed the reception of new members into the phratriae and the registration of the children born since the last festival.1 The difference between the poorer and richer members of the gentes was doubtless very great. The peasant living on a small farm in a remote part of Attica might Distinguished indeed rank as a member of a gens, and his Families. children might be duly registered at the Apaturia, but his position would be widely different from that of the rich and powerful families who formed the governing class. In every gens also there would be broken and landless men, and artisans who, though without land, were valued for their skill and retained under the protection of the gens. With the growth of the city of Athens these elements, at first so unimportant, rose to power ; but in the seventh century the nobles who were the great landowners monopolized the state. Many families could also claim a great position as the repositories of ancient rites. Such, for instance, were the Butadae, who had the charge of the Erechtheum and furnished the priestess of Athena Polias ; the Byzygae, who ploughed the sacred field at Athens ; the Hesychidae, who superintended the worship of the Erinyes ; the Eumolpidae, who were the guardians of the mysteries of Eleusis, and others whose family rites had become a part of the public religion of the city. 1 It is not clear whether cbparpia is the same as -narpa.

[IX. Herodotus tells us that there were no slaves at Athens in early times ; 1 the daughters of the family did the household work and fetched water from the wells. By the time of Solon this simplicity of life had passed away. Slaves were then sufficiently numerous to attract the attention of the lawgiver. In the country they were perhaps less common than in the town, for the poorest class of peasants, even if not reduced to slavery, performed all the duties which could be required of slaves. APPENDIX. No. I. The following passages, from Mr. York Powell's History cf England, are interesting as illustrations of the history of early Attica : \u2014 The English were a nation of franklins or freeholders, living by their land and cattle, every man in his own homestead. A knot of neighbouring homesteads owned by men of the same kindred formed a village called by the family name (Wall! ngford = the ford of the Wallings, Buckingham = the home of the Bookings, Billing = the Billings). House and yard and cattle were the property of the house hold, but the tilth meadow and pasture of the village were held in common by all, being divided afresh every year so that each house hold should have its fair share. A number of villages were grouped into a hundred, so called because at first it was made up of one hundred and twenty households, each sending one armed man to court, council, or war. 1 Herod, vi. 137. This was at the time when the Pelasgians were settled under Hymettus. In Homer slaves are common, both in the house and in charge of the flocks, etc."], [323, "App. I.] ILLUSTRATIONS FROM ENGLISH HISTOR Y. 305 There were three classes among the old English ; two free, gentle (eorl) and simple (ceorl), and one unfree, slave (theow), each with its were-g'dd [man-price] payable to the kindred or master of any one who killed a man. If a gentleman was a knight of the king's (thegen) or his henchman (gesith), his were-gild was higher. Most freemen lived on their own homesteads, but some would take service as henchmen with the king or aldermen or rich gentlemen, whose pride it was to have a body of retainers about them, to guard them in peace, follow them in war, and be standing proof of their riches and bounty ; for they fed, clothed, and armed them, paying them by gifts of weapons, gold rings, cattle, and sometimes farms (for no man's wages were paid in money in those days). Hence the old English poets call kings and princes Lord (loaf-giver) and Ring-bestower, and love to sing of the faithful ness of the henchman and the generosity of his patron. Some landless freemen took up trades and crafts, and were smiths, carpenters, fishermen, huntsmen, or merchants ; others worked on or farmed richer folk's land. For though at first in the villages every household had its ethel or share, yet in time the arable land got divided for ever among them nearly everywhere once for all, instead of being shared out year by year ; and so some became better off than others. Moreover, in each kingdom were large spaces of un enclosed land, folk-land, belonging to the tribe and not yet parcelled out; pieces of this the king and wise men from time to time granted to different people, usually king's henchmen, to hold as their own, so that, as nowadays, some men had large estates. In Christian times the monks were great landowners, and many people were employed, free and bond, on their estates. Slaves worked on their master's land or in his houses, like our servants, the men as swineherds, neatherds, or labourers ; the women grinding the corn in stone querns, and looking after the milking, cooking, and household drudgery. In the east of England slaves were few, but there were many in the west, chiefly captive Welsh. A man might fall into slavery for some crime that he had done, or he might sell himself for bread in time of famine or distress. There was a regular slave-trade carried on between Bristol and Ireland and London and Gaul, some men being so wicked as even to sell their own children into bondage. \u2014 History of England, by P.

Gesch. i. 409-419.] In Sparta we find a Gerousia of twenty-eight members, which is at least as old as the time of Lycurgus (i.e. as the settled form of the constitution, cir. S00 B.C.); at Corinth there is a Council of eighty members, which cannot be later than the establishment of the annual prytanis in 745 E.C. ; in Argos we also hear of a Council, which is no doubt connected with the early decline of the monarchy. But at Athens the existence of the Council under the monarchy, and even down to Solon, is involved in the greatest obscurity. In the changes which took place in the constitution we do not hear of any permanent Council. On the other hand the universal occurrence of these Coun cils in the Greek cities, and the difficulty of constructing an oligar chical constitution without one, make it necessary to assume that there was a Council of some kind in early Athens. The question is, How was it composed ? Various answers have been given : \u2014 1. It is assumed that the Council of 300, of which we hear at the trial of the Cylonian murderers and the expulsion of Clisthenes (Plut. Sol. 12, and Herod, v. 72), was the ancient Council of Athens. To this it is objected that such a Council is (a) far larger than the similar Councils in Sparta or Corinth ; and (6) that we only hear of it on the two occasions mentioned. 2. It is assumed that the ephetae formed the ancient Council. The ephetae and the nine archons made up a Council of sixty members (fifteen from each tribe, or five from each phratry). This assumption implies, that the ephetae were in existence before Draco. But this is contradicted by Pollux, viii. 125 : ecpe'rai rbvpiv dpidpbv els Kai ivevTT]K0VTa, ApaKixiv 6\u00b0 avroiis KaTea-Trjo-ev dpio-TivSrjv aipeBevras' eS'iKa^ov Si tois e(p' aipari SiujKopevois ev rols irevre SiKao~Tr,piois' 2dXwv 6\u00b0 avTols TrpoiTKaTeiTTr)o-e ttjv e\u00a3 'Apeiov Trdyov fiovXrjv, a passage which is not invalidated by the statement in Aristotle, Pol. ii. 12 (1274 b), that Draco did not in any way alter the constitution (noXiTela S' v-napxovoy tovs vopovs edijKe), for the ephetae were all chosen from the nobles. The assumption is confirmed by the statement that the Areopagus did not exist before Solon. But this statement, though current in antiquity (Plut.

His view is confirmed by Pausanias (iv. 5. 2) who tells us that the Messenians in 743 B.C. (?) were willing to refer their quarrel with the Lacedaemonians (which concerned the shedding of blood) to the Athenian Areopagus by Aristotle (?) Pol. ii. 12. 4=1274 a; and by the passage which Plutarch quotes from Solon's law of amnesty (Sol. I.e.) : erriripovs elvai 7rX?)i/ oo-oi il; 'Apeiov irdyov f/ oeroi eV t<ov eeberHiv r) eK irpvTave'iov KaraSiKao Sevres virb ra>v ftao-iKeav eni (povep, k.t.X. 3. That the \" Areopagus \" was the ancient Council. But how was the \"Areopagus \" composed? 4. Busolt's opinion (I.e. p. 419) is that \u2014 A. The archons and ephetae sat on the Areopagus (1) as a fiovki) yepovTiav ; (2) as a court of justice. B. The ephetae sat under the presidency of the archon Basileus at the other courts. C. The archons judged civil cases in the Prytaneum, and could award sentence of death in the case of treason, etc. This explains the existence of the three courts mentioned in the passage of Plutarch, I.e., but, like No. 2, it assumes the existence of the ephetae before Draco. There must be some reason why we do not hear of a f3ov\\rj at Athens as we do at Sparta, Corinth, etc. We may observe that Pausanias speaks of the rulers of Athens as inevdvvoi (iv. 5. lo : toxis d-nb MfXdfcW, KaXovpevovs Si MeSovriSas, kot' dpxds piv debeiXovTO 6 Sripos ti]s e^ovaias rb -rroKii Kai dvri (iairiXeias peTeo-Trjaav es dpxl]v iireiiOvvov, varepov Si Kai 7rpo8ecrpiav ermv Sem eiroirjirav alrols tijs \u00b0PXVS)' and it is obvious that when the archons held office for ten years, and still more when the nine annual archons came into existence, some machinery for election must have existed. For these reasons it is not impossible that a considerable number of the nobles from time to time met together, and I venture to think that there was a Council of 300 in early Athens, though it only met when required. As to the Areopagus, our best authorities are Aristotle (?) and Plutarch. Aristotle (?) Pol. ii. 12, says that Solon was thought a good law giver because he mixed the constitution ; the Areopagus was an oligarchical element, the elected magistracy aristocratical, the law courts democratical. But against this it is urged that \" Solon found the elected magistracy and the council already in existence.\" If this"], [326, "308 THE ATTIC COUNCIL. [IX. -App. II. were all, there would be no difficulty about Aristotle's view ; but just below, and again in Pol. iii. 11, he states that Solon gave the people the right to choose the magistrates and scrutinize their administration. I can only remove the contradiction by assuming that the magistrates, though elected before Solon, were not elected by the people. But if Solon made this change in the elected magistracy while taking it over, he may have made some change in the constitution of the Areopagus which Aristotle does not think it necessary to mention. Plutarch (see supra, p. 307) states that \" Solon put together the Areopagus out of the archons.\" He adds that the majority were of opinion that Solon was the creator of the Areopagus, an opinion sup ported by the fact that Draco never mentioned it. But he points out that Solon himself, in his law of amnesty, spoke of the sentences of the Areupagus, which must therefore have been in existence when the law was made. The contradiction is, however, apparent only. Plutarch was aware that Solon was not the first to assign judicial powers (to Kpiveiv) to the Areopagus ; but he adopts the view that he was the first to put the archons in it, and give the board censorial powers (see infra, p. 414.) We must bear in mind that in one respect Athens differed from Corinth or Sparta. Though the chiefs of Attica were content to give up their separate council chambers and judgment halls, so that the council chamber and judgment hall of Athens served for the whole country, we cannot suppose that all the nobles lived constantly at Athens. They visited their estates, and were careful not to lose their local influence. A permanent Council at Athens might thus appear an undesirable arrangement, as it would certainly be governed by the nobles resident in the city. But a strong executive controlled by the whole body of nobles would suit the situation, and this appears in fact to have been the arrangement. It is worth observing in regard to this matter, that under the later arrangement of the symmories, 300 was the number fixed upon for the first class of richest men."], [327, "CHAPTER X. NORTHERN GREECE. I.\u2014 EPIRUS AND MACEDONIA. I. As we have seen (pp. 27, 35), Dodona in Epirus was the seat of an ancient shrine where the Pelasgi and Hellenes worshipped, and from the adjacent district, so Epirus not far as we can tell, the Hellenes moved towards included the south of the peninsula. In Epirus also ln Hellas dwelt the Graii, or Graeci, from whom the Latins borrowed the name for the continent and its inhabitants. Yet the Epirotae were not included among the Hellenes. In their civilisation they do not seem to have been more barbarous than some of the tribes in Arcadia, but they continued to be barbarians in the Greek sense of the word \u2014 a proof, if the proof were needed, of the capricious use of the term.1 The most important tribes in this district were the Cha onians, once the lords of the whole of Epirus, the Molossians and the Thesprotians. The Chaonians lay near chaonians the coast on the north ; the Thesprotians occu- Thesprotians, pied the country to the south of the Chaonians, MoIossians and were therefore in closer proximity to the Greeks of Ambracia than their neighbours on the north. From Thes protia, as we have seen, proceeded the tribe which crossed the range of Pindus into Thessaly, and thus brought about the great movement which created such a remarkable change in the population of Hellas. The Molossians were in possession of the centre of Epirus. 1 Thuc. ii. 80; Strabo, p. 321. M'J"], [328, "310 EARLY EPIRUS: RULERS AND OCCUPATIONS. [X. I. In Homer we hear of a king of the Thesprotians,1 but in the time of Thucydides the monarchy had come to an end. Monarchy At any rate, both the Thesprotians and the in Epirus. Chaonians are then spoken of as being \"without a king,\" and the Chaonians are commanded by two chiefs annually elected \"from the ruling family.\" The Molossian kings claimed to be members of the race of Aeacus, Molossus being the son of Pyrrhus and Andromache. At a later period they became the sovereigns of the whole country, until they were absorbed into the Macedonian power, and passed with it into the Boman Empire.2 Epirus was divided into a number of long and narrow valleys by the Aous, Arachthus, Achelous, and other rivers. Description 0Q the slopes of the hills were pastures, and by of Epirus. the streams rich meadow land. On these the Epirotes fed the flocks and herds in which their wealth con sisted. On the shore, Panormus and Onchesmus offered good harbours, which apparently were not overlooked by the Phoenicians, for a town in the territory of the Chaonians bore the name of Phoenice. About the beginning of the sixth century, Ambracia was founded by Cypselus, the tyrant of Corinth, near the mouth of the Arachthus. It formed a convenient station for Corinth in her trade to the west, and could enter into rivalry with Corcyra in acquiring such products as the pastoral inhabitants of the interior had to offer. From this city some knowledge of the Greek language and civilisation spread over the south of Epirus.3 At one time the country was very thickly populated ; but if we set aside the part which it played at a much later time in the military events of Western Greece, Epirus is of little importance to the Greek historian. i Od. xiv. 316. 2 Thuc.

The shrine lay at the foot of Mount Tomarus, at some distance The Oracle to the west of Lake Pambotis (Joannina). In \u00b0f Dodona. the Biad we hear of the Selli or interpreters (im-oiprJTai) at Dodona, who communicated to those who inquired of the oracle the responses given by the rustling of the leaves of the sacred oak. The epic poet describes these Selli as persons who slept on the ground (xa/xaieijujs, an epithet elsewhere given to pigs), and never washed their feet (B. xvi. 235). At a later time, perhaps owing to the association of Dione with Zeus, the responses at Dodona were communicated by priestesses, three in number and called Peleiades \u2014 a name which gave rise to many controversies. Some under stood the word to mean \" doves,\" and supported their view by the story that the first Dodonaean priestess was an Egyptian woman, brought by Phoenicians from Thebes to Dodona, who, as she spoke a language unintelligible to the Pelasgi, was said to \"speak like a bird.\" Others considered that the so-called \"doves\" (7reAeia5es) were merely \"old women \" (irikiai). Though eclipsed at a later time by Delphi, which was much more central and easy of access, Dodona remained to the last one of the most important oracles in Greece. In the time of Demosthenes responses were still sought there by the Athenian State, especially on matters connected with religion, and for the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood it was a place of constant resort, even on the most trivial occasions.1 1 The Homeric Catalogue compels us to assume a second Dodona in Thessaly (II. ii. 748 ff.). With the epithet dviirro-KoSes compare the \" Dusty-feet,\" who were the rural population of Epidaurus. For the \"doves,\" see Herod, ii. 55, 57 ; Strabo, book vii., Frag. 1, 2 ; Athenian consultation of Dodona, Dem. in Mid. p. 530 ; for the site and ruins of Dodona, and the questions put to the deity, Carapanos, Dodone. In the inscriptions we find a irpomaT-qs and a naiarch at Dodona (Cauer, Del. Ins. No. 249). On the Acheron, in the south of Thes protia, was the oracle of the dead, at which Periander consulted Melissa (Herod, v. 92 n)."], [330, "EARLY MACEDONIA: PERDICCAS. [X. 2. 312 2. Like the Epirotes, the Macedonians were excluded from the Hellenes, but here the exclusion did not extend to the royal race. These claimed to be Heraclids of not Hellenes the stock of Temenus, and the claim was allowed except by the judges at the Olympian festival. The story of the emigration of Perdiccas and his brothers from Argos to Macedonia is told by Herodotus as follows. The three Temenids, Gouanes, Aeropus and Perdiccas, fled from Argos to Illyria, whence they passed into Upper story of Macedonia, and so came to Lebaea, where Perdiccas. they took service with the king. The eldest fed the horses, the second the oxen, and Perdiccas, the youngest, who was still a boy, kept the sheep. In those days kings, like their subjects, had but a slender store of wealth, and so it befell that the queen of Lebaea was wont to bake bread for the hirelings of the king; and when she baked she found that the loaf of Perdiccas waxed to twice the size of the rest \u2014 not once only, nor twice, but always. So she told her husband, and he, perceiving that it was a sign which boded ill, bade the hirelings begone out of his land. They made reply that they were willing to go when they had received their wages. At the mention of wages the king, as though bewitched, cried out : \" There are your wages, and enough too,\" at the same time pointing to the sunlight which fell into the house through the smoke-hole. At this speech the two elder brothers stood awe-struck and silent, but Perdiccas, drawing a circle round the light on the floor with his knife, replied : \" We accept the gift,\" and gathered the light thrice into his bosom. The brothers then left the house. Soon after, one of those who sat by explained to the king the meaning of that which the boy had done. The king fell into a furious rage, and sent horsemen after the brothers to destroy them. But it happened that, before the pursuers overtook them, they had already crossed a river, which was henceforth worshipped as the Biver of Safety. The river rose and swelled till the horsemen could not cross it. So"], [331, "X. 2.] MACEDONIA : CONQUESTS. 313 the Argives escaped. They retired into another pr^rt of Mace donia, and dwelt near the garden of Midas, where roses grow wild, each with sixty leaves, and in odour surpassing all others. There also is Mount Bermius \u2014 a mountain impass able by reason of the cold and snow. From this land they went forth and conquered all Macedonia.1 Thucydides enables us to trace the progress of these con quests. \" To the Macedonians belong the Lyncestae and Elimiotes, and other tribes of the interior ; these are their subjects and allies, though governed by monarchs of their own. The maritime Macedonia of our day was first Macedonian acquired by Alexander the father of Perdiccas, tribes. and his ancestors, who were originally Temenids from Argos. Here they established themselves as kings, expelling the Pierians from Pieria, and the Bottiaeans from what is called Bottia. They also acquired a narrow strip of Paeonia, by the Axius, running down from the interior to Pella and the sea, and what is called Mygdonia, beyond the Axius as far as the Strymon, from which they expelled the Edonians. They also drove out the Eordi from what is now Eordia, slaying the great majority of them, and the Almopes from Almopia. Other nations also were conquered by these Macedonians, whose territory they still possess, Anthemus, Crestonia, Bisaltia, and a large part of the land of the original Macedonians. The whole is called Macedonia \" (ii. 99). From this it appears that a hill tribe issuing from the upper valley of the Haliac mon, passed into Eordia, where were situated the \" gardens of Midas,\" and Aegae, the old Macedonian capital, and from thence to the sea-coast. The kingdom thus established included a number of tribes, Illyrian, and Thracian (?), but the Macedonians themselves spoke a dialect of Greek. The Macedonians were governed from a very early time by monarchs who united the functions of kings, priests, and judges. It does not appear that the king's power was 1 Herod, viii. 137 ff.

For the earlier period of the monarchy we have a list of names, and nothing more. When the Pisistratids were expelled from Amyntasand Athens, Amyntas, the sovereign then on the Alexander. throne, offered Anthemus as a refuge to Hippias. Amyntas was still reigning, though advanced in years, at the time of the Persian invasion, when his daring son Alexander succeeded both in ridding the country of the presence of the Persians and conciliating their power. This prince is repre sented by Herodotus as a friend of the Hellenes, though his position rendered it inevitable that he should appear to favour the Persians.1 IL\u2014 THESSALY. 3.

The most important port was Pagasae, which eclipsed the fame of the older Iolcus. Like many other districts of Greece, Thessaly is said to have been originally under the rule of one king, and the division into four districts is ascribed to Aleuas, the son of The Aieuadae Pyrrhus. The statement is not more probable and scopadae. here than elsewhere. So far as our information reaches, we find aristocratical families ruling independently in the Thes salian cities, chief among whom are the Aieuadae and Scopadae of Larissa and Crannon. Whenever the need was felt, a general was elected to be the leader of the forces of the whole country. He bore the title of Tagus, and till 500 B.C. he was always elected from the family of the Aieuadae. At the conquest, the original population of the country was for the most part degraded to the condition of Penestae. These were serfs attached to the soil, which they The conquered tilled for the benefit of their masters, to whom Population : they rendered a fixed portion of the produce of Penestae the plots assigned to them. Their condition was therefore like that of the Helots of Sparta, and, like the Helots, they were a source of trouble and alarm to their masters. The great territorial families seem to have had the right of arming their dependants; we hear that Menon, the Pharsalian, assisted the Athenians in the war against Eion, with three hundred mounted Penestae of his own.1 The Phthiotes, Perrhaebians and Maenetes, and other tribes _ . . \u00b0 Phthiotes, etc. which could not be reduced to slavery, were allowed to retain their independence on certain conditions. For this reason they continued to appear as members of the Amphictyonic League. But the best land was in the hands of the Thessalians, who have been compared to the feudal lords of the Middle Ages, living in castles, and surrounded by a crowd of somewhat turbulent retainers. The Thessalians were the greatest horse-breeders of Greece ; 1 Dem. in Arist. p. 687. Meno of Larissa was able to join Cyrus with 1000 Hoplites and 500 Peltasts ; Xen.

Border conflicts raged between the Thessalians and the Phocians on the south, but we do not hear of any serious attempt to pass beyond Thermopylae ; and in spite of the opportunities offered by the Gulf of Pagasae, and the traditions of the Argo and the Minyae of Iolcus, the Thessal ians never became a maritime nation. Among the national amusements of the Thessalians were the Taureia or Tauro-cathapsia, which may be compared to Buii-fights in the bull-fights of Spain. Mounted riders pur- Thessaiy. sued bulls round a circus or hippodrome till the animals were exhausted, when they leaped upon them and dragged them down to the ground by their horns. The famous Pulydamas of Scotussa is even said to have gone into a herd of oxen, and seized the strongest and fiercest bull by the hinder hoofs ; in vain the bull struggled to be free, and when at last, by a great effort, he escaped, he left his hoofs in the hands of Pulydamas. It was the belief of the Thessalians that they owed their country to the action of Poseidon in opening a cleft through Tempe, and allowing the waters which Worship of previously covered the land to escape.

To the south of Thessaly we find a number of tribes which are little more than names in Greek history : Dolopians, Aenianes, Malians, Locrians of Cnemis and Opus. More important are the Phocians, whose territory extended from sea to sea, and included within its earlier limits the famous shrine of Delphi. The Phocians dwelt in a number of small republics, for which the centre of meeting was the Phocicum. Their constitution appears to have been similar to that of the Achaeans in Peloponnesus. The chief cities lay in the valley of the Cephisus. Elatea, the most important, commanded the main road which led from northern Greece into Boeotia.2 Still higher up the course of the Cephisus lay the four communities of the Dorians : Boeum, Erineum, Citinium, and \u201e,u .

In his day it was a large hall ; within, pillars ran along each side, and between the pillars and the wall were steps, on which the envoys sat during discussions. At the end of the hall were statues of Zeus, Athena and Hera. The coinage of Phocis, which goes back to the middle of the sixth century, is federal, like the old coinage of Arcadia. It was struck on the Aegi netic standard, probably at the periodical meetings at the Phocicum.

To the south of the Dorians lay the Western or Ozolian Locrians, whose territory bounded the Corinthian Gulf on the north. Their colonies in the west redeem them from oblivion, for of the Locrians in Greece we know almost nothing beyond their bad reputation as pirates and kid nappers. The chief cities of the country were Naupactus, the point at which the Dorians were said to have embarked when crossing into Peloponnesus, and Amphissa. Be yond the Locrians, to the west, lay the Aetolians and the Acarnanians. The legends of these nations have been related ; in history they take no part till a later period. Even at the time of the Peloponnesian war, the Aetolians seemed to Thucydides to afford a fitting illustration of the old barbaric condition of Greece.1 5. From very early times the tribes which inhabited the centre of Greece gathered together at Thermopylae to offer sacrifice to Demeter. The Amphictyony thus nip 1 y . forme(j consisted of twelve members : Ionians, Dolopians, Thessalians, Aenianes (or Oetaeans), Magnetes, Malians, Phthiotes (or Achaeans), Dorians, Phocians, Locrians, Boeotians, and Perrhaebians. Each member had one vote, and every vote was of equal value, whether the tribe which gave it was great or small. All were pledged to mutual pro tection and assistance ; no Amphictyonic city was to lay waste another, or cut it off from running water in war or peace ; and, if any attempt of the kind were made, the tribes swore to come forward and resist it. The oracle at Delphi and the worship of Apollo were also placed under the protection of this league ; the members undertook to aid the god \" with hand and foot and voice and all their might, should any one pillage the temple or plot against the sacred rites. \" When, owing to the ' Thuc. i. 5, iii. 94."], [337, "X. 6.] DELPHIC AMPHICTYONY\u2014 BOEOTIA. 319 increasing importance of the oracle, a town sprang up round the shrine, the Delphians claimed to be independent of the Phocians, in whose territory the temple lay. The claim was, of course, resisted, and hence arose a series of First Sacred \" sacred wars,\" each more disastrous than the War- other for the unity of Greece. The first, which occurred about the beginning of the sixth century, led to the destruction of Cirrha, the harbour-city of Delphi, and the eternal desola tion of the fruitful plain around it, which was henceforth sacred to Apollo. In this crusade the Athenians took a leading part, and the triumph of the god was marked by a renewal of the Pythian games on a grander scale (infra, c. xiii.).1 IV\u2014 BOEOTIA. 6. Though the legends of Boeotia are full of contradictions, we may assume, with some certainty, that the country was at an early time divided into two great principalities, of which one was subject to Orchomenus, and orchomenus included the lower valley of the Cephisus, and and Thebes. the other was the domain of Thebes (p. 74 ff). Orcho menus was the older city, but in the course of time it became dependent to some extent on Thebes, and inferior in power. Then both cities were conquered by a band of invasion from invaders from the norths who introduced into the north the country, from the south of Thessaly, the worship of Athena Itonia, the name of the river Curalius and the town Coronea. These immigrants were the Arnaeans. They were governed by kings. Opheltas is said to have led them into Boeotia, and his son Damasichthon con- xanthus, the quered Thebes. Finally Xanthus, the second last king. successor of Damasichthon, attempted to invade Attica.

The confede rates were represented by councils presided over by an archon, but the management of the military affairs of the country and the executive power in general were in the hands of boeot archs, officers elected annually by the cities of the federation, each of which elected its own officer. In the Peloponnesian war we hear of eleven boeotarchs only, of which two came from Thebes. This reduces the cities of the federation to ten. Plataea was then under the protection of Athens. Eleutherae and Oropus formed part of Athenian territory, and Chaeronea had passed into the control of Orchomenus.1 In the several cities the constitution was mostly aristocratic. The rich lands were in the possession of the descendants of the conquerors, and were tilled for their benefit by slaves or Constitution hired labourers (Thetes).

There was also a law at Thebes \u2014 whether introduced by Philolaus or not is unknown \u2014 that no one who had not retired from trade for at least ten years should have any share in the government. The rule of families, or \"dynasty,\" as the Greeks termed it, \"a form of government closely resembling a tyranny,\" existed in Thebes at the time of the Persian war. Afterwards it was exchanged for an \"oligarchy with equal laws,\" wealth making itself felt as well as birth.1 In a few cities, as Plataea and Thespiae, democratic tendencies were strong, a division of political principles which led to feuds and disunion in the country. 7. At an early period Boeotia was famous for the worship of the Muses. The shrine of the deities lay on Mount Helicon, not far from the city of Thespiae. Strabo WorshiPofthe ascribed the foundation of the temple and the Muses on Heii consecration of the mountain to the Thracians,2 con' who, as we have seen, were celebrated in mythical times for their skill in music, and, whatever may be the truth of the story, the existence of the temple is a historical fact. It became famous in Greece. From the Muses of Helicon, Hesiod, the second name in Greek epic poetry, received the inspiration of song. We cannot fix a date for Hesiod. Antiquity made him the contemporary of Homer, and represented the two as contending for the prize of poetry. Such a contest was a natural invention at the time when Hesiod and Homer stood opposite to each other as the chiefs 1 Arist. Pol. ii. 12 = 1274 6; iii.5= 127S\u0153 ; Herod, ix. 86; Swaareia, laovopos oXiyapxia, Thuc. iii. 62. The coins of Boeotia afford useful evidence on (1) the ancient independence of Orchomenus, and (2) the federal union of the country. The oldest coins of Orchomenus are stamped with an \"incuse square\" identical with that on coins of Aegina. (We know that Orchomenus, like Aegina, belonged to the Calaurian Amphictyony. It was doubtless the great trading city of Boeotia.) The other Boeotian coins exhibit as a common device the Boeotian shield (the shield of Athena Itonia?), with letters designat ing the city from which they originate (Head, I.e., pp. 291, 293). 2 Strabo, p. 410.

We are also told that Hesiod won a tripod at the musical contests held at the funeral of Amphidamas, king of Chalcis, but we do not know when Amphidamas died. Dius, the father of Hesiod, was a native of Cyme, in Aeolis, who made a precarious living on the sea. Towards the close of his life he settled at Ascra,1 a hamlet lying on the slopes of Helicon, in the territory of Thespiae, where Hesiod in his boyhood tended his father's flocks. On the death of Dius, his two sons, Hesiod and Perses, had a dispute about the inheritance. The case was tried before the chiefs of Thespiae, who decided in favour of Perses. Hesiod intimates very plainly that this sentence was not gained without the influence of bribes, and it is likely enough that Perses, who led a life of idle and extravagant independence, was better known to the higher class than the laborious and thrifty Hesiod. The ill-gotten gain did not thrive. After the lapse of a few years Perses found himself a beggar. He threatened his brother with a new law-suit. Hesiod replied with reproaches and warnings \u2014 with what re sult we do not know. In his later life the poet appears to have left Ascra. It has been supposed, on very slender evidence, that he retired to Naupactus in Locris.2 After his death, wherever that took place, his bones were re- moved to Orchomenus, and a monument erected in the market-place to his memory. At Thespiae also, and in the shrine of the Muses on Helicon, statues were set up in his honour.3 1 For the legendary history of Helicon and Ascra, see Paus. ix. 29, 30. 2 Bergk, Lit. Gesch. i. 921 f. 3 In the time of Thucydides it was a common belief that Hesiod was put to death in the grove of Nemean Zeus near Oeneon, in Locris, \"by men of the district,\" i.e. by Ctimenus and Antiphus, the sons of Ganyctor, whose sister he had outraged (Thuc. iii. 96).

We contrast Hesiod with his brother: the sturdy, honest, laborious, shrewd husbandman, with the idle, reckless, spendthrift lord of a few acres.1 We have the details of his hard life in an age into which he wishes that he had never been born. Only by unremitting industry and vigilant thrift can a livelihood be obtained in the un kindly climate of Ascra, \"which is cold in winter, sultry in summer, and always bad.\" What a contrast is this to the shadowy figure of Homer, of whom we do not even know whether he lived in Asia or Europe, or, indeed, whether he ever lived at all ! There is a contrast equally great between the Homeric and Hesiodic epic. The \"glories of men,\" the labours of the Achaeans on the plains of Troy, the wander- The Homeric and ings of Odysseus in far-off seas, are the themes H\u00abiodic ep;c of Homer. We move among exalted persons, in a scene where there is no room for the interests of humble life. The poet's songs are the \"crown of the feast.\" Hesiod treats of other subjects. His Muse is serious \u2014 nay, she is sad; she seeks no longer to amuse a delighted audience, but to beguile the unhappy and rebuke the foolish. The days of martial enterprise are over; the relations of gods and men are changed ; it is the poet's task now to arrange the knowledge of the past, and record the wisdom of the sages \u2014 a wisdom which is often the fruit of bitter experience. 1 Perses seems in these qualifications to have been a boon companion of the lords of Thespiae. These aristocratic persons despised agri culture and industry. Hence, at a later time, we find the owners of land in Thespiae deeply in debt to the Thebans (Heraclides, Frag. 43 M)."], [342, "HESIOD' S POETRY: ' WORKS AND DAYS.' [X. 9. 324 g. The Alexandrian scholars recognised as the genuine works of Hesiod the Works and Bays, The Theogony, and the Catalogue of Women. Of these the two first remain to ' us, though it is highly improbable that their present form is that in which they were left by Hesiod.1 The Works and Days (828 vv.) fall into two parts, both of which are addressed to Perses. In the first, written after \u25a0 works and the unjust decision of the judges, and when a Days-' second law-suit was threatened, Hesiod urges his brother to reform his conduct, and seek for the means of which he is in need by industry rather than injustice. In the second, we have a number of rules for agriculture and navigation. Characteristic features of the first part are the ascribing of all the evils of human life to Pandora, whom Zeus created for characteristic ***le punishment of men when Prometheus had features of the obtained for them the gift of fire, and the poem* description of the five ages, which meets us here for the first time. Hesiod's view of women is widely different from that of Homer. The good and careful housewife is a valuable help ; in this capacity she is superior to the ox which draws the plough, but she is included in the same category. Not a word is said to remind us of the queenly dignity and virgin grace, of the love and constancy, which throw an undying charm over Homeric story. The woman who seeks to attract notice among men is described in language of savage coarseness, not sur passed by Aristophanes.2 Of the five ages, four are named 1 Schomann, Commentatio Critica, prefixed to his edition of Hesiod, 1869 ; Bergk, Lit.

Between the ages of bronze and iron Hesiod inserts the age of heroes, which pre ceded his own. The growth of epic poetry, which had glorified the heroes of Thebes and Troy, compelled him to make this insertion, and as the heroes of Homer are always described as nobler and better than the men of his own day, it was necessary to depict the heroic age as better and nobler than its place in the declining series would strictly warrant. In the Golden Age men lived like gods ; they were never feeble or old ; death came upon them like a sleep. After death, we are told, the men of that age became holy spirits, who wandered over the earth in the service of the gods, watching the deeds of men, and bringing blessings to the pious. The account of the Silver Age is very unintelligible.1 In that time men were dandled in their mothers' arms for the space of a hundred years\u2014 giant babies they were ! \u2014 but when grown up to man's estate their lives were brief. They made war on each other, and would not render service to the gods, and so they passed beneath the earth. Of the men of Bronze we learn that they were a strong and warlike race, who ate not the bread of men. Their arms, their houses, their tools were of bronze, for iron was unknown. Slain by each other's hands, they entered the home of Hades. The Heroes were those who fought at Thebes for the flocks of \u0152dipus, and at Troy for Helen. After death Zeus removed them to the limits of the earth, where in peace they dwell by the eddies of Oceanus, in the islands of the blest, happy heroes ; thrice a year the earth brings forth her increase for their use.

If Pandora be, as some think, an allegory of luxury, it is still woman who is the chief cause of luxury in human life. But the point of view in this passage ( Works and Days, 57 ff) and in Theogony, 561 ff., is slightly different. 1 See Schomann, Opusc. ii. p. 308."], [344, "326 HESIOD'S POETRY: BEAST FABLES.

After this apologue the poet earnestly exhorts his brother to do his duty as a man, and save himself from ruin. Then follow a number of sayings and apophthegms of which the Hesiodic origin is doubtful. Being pop egm. without any connection, they could, of course, be enlarged by subsequent additions. Whether genuine or not, they mark the growth of that practical wisdom which also received expression in Greek elegiac poetry. The second part of the poem (v. 383 ff.) is apparently separated by a considerable lapse of time from the first. Perses and Hesiod is visited by Perses, who applies to him Hesiod. for helD. Direct assistance is refused. \" You for help. Direct assistance is refused. \" You must work, silly Perses ; work is ordained by the gods for men ; by work alone can you escape beggary.\" A number of rules for husbandry follow, and from husbandry Hesiod passes to navigation. We have seen that Dius, the father of the brothers, gained his living on the sea, and the Thespians, in whose territory Ascra lay, possessed a harbour on the Corinthian gulf. Hence the Boeotian farmer, when his labour was not required on the land, might make money on the sea. The poem is here broken by a curious piece of personal history (vv. 646-662). Though he proposes by the grace of the Muses to instruct Perses in the art of navigation, Hesiod is not himself a seaman. Once only did he take ship, at the Hesiod at tlme when he crossed to Chalcis, and won a Chaicis. trinod at the funeral of Kins' Amohidamas. tripod at the funeral of King Amphidamas. We learn from Plutarch 2 that Amphidamas fell in a contest between Eretria and Chalcis for the Lelantian plain. These 1 Works and Days, 11. 109 ff. 3 Gon. Sep. Sap. 10.

For this reason, and from its general tone, the passage has been thought to be an interpolation. We are, unfortunately, so ignorant of the early history of Euboea that we cannot decide whether Plutarch is correct in connecting Amphidamas with the wars which became so famous in Greece. And if on the one hand no reason can be given why Hesiod, when he had won fame by his poems, should not have crossed over to Euboea to take part in a contest of musical skill at Chalcis ; on the other it may be urged that such a contest could be as easily invented as the more famous one between Homer and Hesiod. This interruption is followed by the rules for navigation. There are two seasons for going to sea : an autumn season, which begins fifty days after the summer sol- RUies anH stice, and a spring season, when the \" leaves at superstitions. the tips of the trees are as large as the print of a crow's foot.\" But this second season is only to be \"snatched ; \" it is danger ous, and those who venture to sea in it stake their lives. \" Do not,\" the poet wisely concludes, \" put all your goods on board ; stow a little, and leave more at home.\" The poem now suddenly reverts to the conduct of life. A number of regulations are laid down similar to those which close the first part. Some exhibit the shrewd wisdom of practical life; in others we have traces of old and unintelligible supersti tions. Marry when about thirty years of age, neither much before nor after, and let your wife be sixteen or seventeen. Marry a maid, that you may have the teaching of her ; and, above all things, seek a wife among your neighbours. Form no foolish friendships, nor yet cast off a friend lightly. Be careful of your speech ; a sparing tongue is a great treasure ; there is ever a charm in winning words. He that speaks evil will hear worse. Be neither over hospitable nor niggardly. Bivers and streams are holy \u2014 they are not to be defiled, nor crossed without a prayer. The ladle is not to be placed above the bowl \u2014 that is unlucky.

[X. 10. 328 Do not use a pot that has not been duly dedicated. Do not, when building a house, leave it unfinished, lest a daw settle on it and utter cries of evil omen. Such monitions prove the ancient date from which they have come down. They are the wisdom of the fathers, handed down from generation to generation in the remote valleys of Greece. The close of the poem is the Calendar, in which the poet distinguishes the days of the month as favourable or un- favourable. As in later times, the month is divided into three decades. The last, or thirtieth day, is to be occupied in reviewing the work of the whole, and providing food for the next. The seventh day is sacred \u2014 on that day was Apollo born ; the eighth and ninth are favourable for labour in the field ; the eleventh and twelfth for shearing sheep, and for harvest, but the twelfth is far the better of the two. The sixteenth day is bad for a girl to be born or to marry on. The twentieth is favourable for the birth of men of great powers of mind. The fourth of the month is the best day for marriage, if the omens are favourable. \"Few are aware that the twenty seventh day is the best for opening a cask, for breaking-in an ox, mule, or horse, and for launching a ship \u2014 one com mends this day, another that, but few know the truth. A day is a mother, and, again, a day is a step-mother. Happy who can make his choice with knowledge.\" Herodotus (ii. 82) does not scruple to attribute the astrological know ledge of propitious or unpropitious days displayed by Greek poets to an Egyptian source, an assertion which is probably due to the Egyptian prejudices of that author. We have no reason to suppose that the rules laid down by Hesiod were not current in Greece in the earliest times, or that the Calendar is a later addition to the poem. 10. The Thcogonia of Hesiod is an attempt to give an account of the origin of the world and of the gods, for the two are in . , fact inseparable. We cannot doubt that there ' Theogoma. l were many such theogonies in early Greece. The poets were at liberty to treat the material as they chose,"], [347, "X. io.] HESIOD'S ' THEOGONIA.' 329 and in every nation the attempt has been made to explain the origin of the world. Framed by men who were entirely without any idea of natural law, these attempts often took a form which was fantastic and unintelligible. Later ages dis carded them as unworthy of credit, and many were lost. The theogony of Hesiod must have been generally received at an early time, and, owing to the reputation of the poet, it was saved from destruction. We begin with the origin of the earth, heaven, and sea. The poet assumes without scruple the existence of any material or force which is needed for his object. Hence Chaos, Earth and Tartarus are primeval, and t-, x\\ \u2022 r Cosmogony. with them is associated Eros, or Desire, a force of which Hesiod makes no further use, but which appears in similar cosmogonies as the impulse to union and creation. Then Night and Day are distinguished. The Earth brings forth the Heaven and the Sea. From the union of Heaven and Earth sprang the Titans. Thus the cosmogony passes into a theogony. From the Titans are born the later race of Cronidae, who finally overthrow their predecessors and attain the supremacy in Heaven. With these are associated the crowds of subordinate deities which the active imagination of the Greeks created. Finally we have a list of the god desses who associated with mortals, and became the ancestresses of heroic races. The poem was thus brought into connection, doubtless by some later hand, with the Catalogue of Women, which, as we have seen, was ascribed to Hesiod. We can no longer separate the materials from which the poet drew in composing this theogony. They were old and new ; native and alien ; the invention of priests Nature of and the tradition of the fathers. The meaning the Poem. of some myths was perhaps already lost when the poet attempted to combine them with others with which they had no real connection. Hence there are parts of the Theogony which are very obscure, and which were so perhaps to the"], [348, "HESIOD'S 'THEOGONIA' &> 'CATALOGUE.' [X. II. 330 author himself. Yet the poem has a great historical value. We see in it more plainly than elsewhere how the gross its historical and rU(^e conceptions, either inherited from value. barbarous times or borrowed from alien barbarous times or borrowed from alien sources, were transfigured by the anthromorphic genius of the Greeks. The actions of the deities are often not human, but the deities are conceived in human form, and connected by human relations. The gods of Hesiod are not stocks and stones, nor demons of fantastic shapes. From the multitude of various traditions and divinities a system was now created which became authoritative in so far as it was generally re- ceived, and exercised a very considerable in- fluence over the later Greeks. In this sense, Hesiod holds a place beside Homer as the creator of the theogony of the Greeks. II. The third poem of Hesiod, which we know only in fragments, is a catalogue of the women who were beloved by the gods, and became by them the mothers of 1 The Catalogue.' heroes. Such catalogues were common in the Boeotian school of epic poetry, which attempted, as we can see from the Theogony, to systematise existing legends and myths. In antiquity we hear of two poems, the Catalogue of Women, and the Eoeae, but it is not certain that 'TheEoeae.' the two were not parts of the same work.1 From this source were taken the genealogies which appear in the later forms of legends. The lines in the eleventh book of the Odyssey, which describe the women who come to Odysseus, are perhaps the best illustration of the nature of this lost poem. The singular name Eoeae is said to have been derived from the words r) oi-q, with which the descriptions of the various heroines began. 1 For the Catalogue and Eoeae, cf. Kinkel, Epic. Frag. p. 90 ff. In any case, the two were combined into one poem, of which three books formed the Catalogue and a fourth the Eoeae (see Kinkel, p. 92). So in Pausanias, i. 43. I (Catalogue), ii. 16. 4, etc. (Eoeae); but he is doubtful whether the Eoeae is the work of Hesiod. His usual phrases are, \" the poem which is called the Eoeae,\" \" the author of the Eoeae.\""], [349, "X. 12, I3-] HESIOD AND HOMER COMPARED. 331 12. Aristotle remarks that Homer knew better than any other author \" what a poet ought to do.\" After a short prelude he introduces his characters, and allows them _ . .. ' Contrast of to speak for themselves, but in his own person Homer the poet rarely comes before us. Very different and Hesiod is the case with Hesiod.

It is Hesiod of Ascra who is Personality imparting to us this homely wisdom, these \u00b0f Hesiod. strange stories of gods, in a poetic form. Even the system of the Theogony is an attempt to impress the stamp of a single mind upon materials gathered from far and near. Another aspect of this change is brought before us in the resentful attitude which Hesiod takes up towards the lords of Ascra \u2014 an attitude quite impossible to the courtly bards of the Homeric age. The strife of high and low has change in the begun; the economical view of life is con- tone of Poetry. trasted with the chivalrous. More important still is the fact that the events of common life are found worthy of a place in poetry. This is the first step to that combination of realism and art which is so characteristic of the Greek elegiac and lyric poetry. 13. However great the hardships of the Boeotian peasant may have been, however severe the climate of the country, opportunities for recreation and enjoyment were not wanting. Every city had its festivals, at which there were generally sports or musical contests, or pastimes of some kind. The national festival of the Boeotian confederacy, the Pamboeotia, was held at Coronea in honour of Athena Itonia. Here a perpetual fire burned before the image of the goddess, who had once appeared in all her Gorgon terrors and turned her priestess Iodama to stone. The festival was the occasion of a great gathering, to which men flocked from all parts of Boeotia. At the shrine of the Muses on Helicon a quin quennial festival was held, at which there were musical contests and dances of boys.

[X. 13. was a rude stone of immemorial antiquity ; lovers sacrificed to him at the Erotidia, which were also the occasion of contests both musical and athletic. At Orchomenus there were Charitesia in honour of the Graces ; Agrionia in honour of Dionysus ; and at Thebes great festivals were held in honour of Apollo and Dionysus. Nor was the Boeotian left without help in the doubts and difficulties of life ; there were many national oracles to which he could repair. He might offer burnt sacrifice to Ismenian Apollo at Thebes ; or consult Ptoan Apollo near Acraephia, a \" most veracious oracle, which answered Mys the Carian in his own tongue ; \" or, if he were not a Theban, he might dream in the temple of Amphiaraus ; or he might seek light and leading in the cave of Trophonius at Lebedea, unless he were deterred by the outlay in victims and the unpleasant ceremonial of consultation.1 In the Boeotian dialect we can observe the beginning of that change in the pronunciation of the Greek vowels which in the course of time reduced them all to a single sound or nearly so (Racism), e.g. v appears for <a and 01, 1 for el, \u2014 Kipevas = Keipevas, 1 for f, \u2014 XP10S \u2014 XP*0S- ei for n. On the other hand, the Boeotians used ov for the ordinary v, but the sound must have been a u, not an 00, for otherwise we should hardly find such a development as Tioi^a = tu^tj. In Siov = Svo, the final o seems to have been lost after the u sound, Slov being for Siovo. 1 Athena Itonia, Paus. ix. 34. I ; Strabo, p. 411.

But it is remarkable that not a single colony was sent out from Athens, though she already stood at the head of a united Attica. At the time of which we are speaking, it was the Ionians of Euboea and Asia Minor, the Dorians of Corinth and Megara, who took the lead ; and the success which at tended the adventurers tempted the islanders of the Aegean, the Achaeans and Messenians of Peloponnesus, to follow in their steps. The colonies were sent out in every direction ; northwards, to Thrace and the Black Sea ; westwards, to Sicily and Classification Italy ; southwards, to Egypt and Libya.

The first was chalcis and situated on the Euripus, at the point where the Eretna. island most nearly approaches the mainland; the second lay at some distance to the south-east, on the same shore. Between the two extended the Lelantian plain, a strip of fertile land, separating the shore and the mountains of the interior, and watered by the river Lelantus. In very early times (1046 B.C. is the traditional date) Chalcis, in connection"], [353, "XI. 4d THE NORTHERN COLONIES. 335 with Cyme, a small town on the eastern coast of Euboea, is said to have founded Cyme in Campania (Cumae). The early date is probably a mistake, arising cyme in Cam from the confusion of Cyme in the Aeolid with Pama- Cyme in Italy. For it is far more reasonable to suppose that the Chalcidians, when established in Sicily, passed through the Straits of Messina and along the Italian shore till they found a suitable site in the islands of Oenaria and Prochyta, and the headland of Cyme, than that they should have penetrated to such distant regions without founding a single settlement on the way.1 Even if it existed, the so-called colony can have been nothing more than an isolated band of pirates. It was not till the eighth century B.C. that Chalcis and Eretria began to send out colonies in the later sense \u2014 i.e. settlements intended to form cities, and generally con firmed by divine sanction \u2014 and the first expeditions were apparently directed to the north. 4. In the Works and Days of Hesiod we hear of a King Amphidamas of Chalcis, at whose funeral games and musical contests were held, in which Hesiod carried off constitution the prize (p. 326). Before the eighth century of chalcis the monarchy had been replaced by an oligarchy of the richer citizens, who called themselves Hippobotae. Under this con stitution public offices were open only to those citizens who were above fifty years of age, and possessed of a certain amount of property.2 Of the government of Eretria nothing 1 So Duncker, Hist. Greece, ii. 157 note. Holm, Gr. Gesch. i. 359, thinks that Cyme may have existed as a pirates' nest before the founding of Naxos. Other writers agree with Duncker in putting it later. The Greeks certainly regarded it as the oldest Greek settle ment in the West (Strabo, p. 243), and it is possible that the Teleboae or some western mariners may have visited the place at a very early time, as Holm suggests. 2 Strabo, p. 447 : eo-TaXrjo-av Si al diroiKiai avrai, Kaddirep e'lprjKev 'Api<TTOTeXi)s, fjv'iKa r) t<oi> 'ImrofioTav KaXovpevi) e-ireKpdTei -rroXiTeia' TTpoeo-Triaav yap oittJs d-nb Tiprjpdrav dvSpes dpiCsTOKpaTiKas apxovres.

Thucydides speaks of the war retna as one which divided Hellas into two opposing camps. The Thessalians, the colonists in Thrace, and the Samians, joined Chalcis ; the Milesians aided Eretria.1 It is interesting to observe that the combatants allowed themselves to be governed by fixed rules of warfare, each side undertaking not to make use of missile weapons. The final battle is said to have been decided by the valour of Cleomachus at the head of his Thessalian cavalry.2 We have no definite date to assign to this war, but as the Euboeans were active in the colonisation of Sicily in the middle of the eighth century, we may, per haps, put the Lelantian war at its close. The islands which had been subject to Eretria were now able to assert their independence, and Andros began to send out colonies of her own (p. 364). 7.

Yet, even with these additions, Megara was neither a large nor a fertile district. The available land was quite insufficient for the needs of the energetic race which possessed it.

Two years later still (658 Dorians found B.C.) an excellent harbour was discovered on Selymbria the European shore of the Bosporus, where the coast is broken by an inlet of the sea (the Golden Horn). Here the Megarians founded Byzantium. The name of the city was taken from the \" fortress of Byzas,\" a stronghold of the native Thracians. For a long time the colonists had to defend their new acquisition against the Thracians in a series of severe struggles, but when these were over, the city rapidly attained prosperity. The entrance to the Black Sea was now entirely in the hands of the Megarians, and, at the same time, their colonies reached farther to the west than those of any other Greek city. The extraordinary development of this little state, the daring energy and fore sight of its citizens, are without a parallel in the history of Greek colonisation. No small part of their Enterprise of prosperity was due to the situation of the the Megarians. country, which, except in the convenience of transferring ships from one sea to another, was a rival of Corinth.

Quarrels between the two colonies were frequent, but neither succeeded in destroying the other; and, owing to her superior site, Byzantium retained her precedence.1 8.

At this time Miletus was at war with Melos and Carystus. Amphitres was unsuccessful against Melos, but Laodamas defeated the Carystians. To him, therefore, the throne was given. Amphitres, in revenge, fell upon him and slew him as he was sacrificing to Apollo. Soon afterwards he was himself slain by the sons of Laodamas. But the sons were not allowed to succeed their father on the throne. The consti tution was rearranged and became an oligarchy, under a pry tanis or president, \" who had supreme authority in many matters.\"1 The abolition of the monarchy did not secure domestic peace for the city. We hear of the rise and fall of a tyrannis, and of factions between the notables and commons, in which either side proceeded to acts of the most atrocious cruelty.2 And from the beginning of the seventh century, Miletus, as the chief of the Ionian cities, began to feel the weight of the Lydian power.

On either side of the peninsula, which faced the north, lay an excellent harbour. From Sinope in 756 B.C. a new colony was founded farther to the east. This was Trapezus \u2014 the modern Trebizond. Between these colonies and the mother city the Milesians established Trapezus, and Cyzicus in the Propontis, which became the Cyzicus. emporium of their trade with the Black Sea (675 B.C.) Finally, in 708 B.C., the Milesians, in concert with the Parians and Erythraeans, founded Parium in the Hellespont, and very soon afterwards the Parians made an attempt to secure the island of Thasos, and wrest from the natives of the opposite coast a share of the profits in the gold mines of the region. The colony underwent severe struggles, but was at length successful. Fifty years later the Milesians extended their colonies to the northern shore of the Euxine. Istros, a city on the coast, south of the Danube, was founded about 650 B.C. Colonies on Not many years later Olbia was planted at the north of the mouth of the river Borysthenes (Dnieper) from which the town was subsequently re-named. These were followed by numerous other settlements : Theodosia, Panticapaeum, Phanagoria, Phasis, and others, until the shores of the Black Sea were covered on every hand with Grecian colonies.1 It is said that Miletus, directly or in directly, planted no fewer than eighty colonies in the Euxine. At a later time these towns became the chief source of the corn supply of Greece ; even in the time of Xerxes vessels laden with corn could be seen sailing through the Hellespont.2 9.

The Amazons dwelt on the southern coast; and Iphi geneia had been wafted from Aulis to the Tauric Chersonese. Yet, in the space of a century, this sea was crowded with Greek settlements. The barbarians on its shores became friendly allies ; Scythians copied Hellenic manners, and Greeks married Scythian women. So great was the power which the Greeks possessed of assimilating alien elements, and carrying their civilisation with them wherever they went.2 IL\u2014 COLONIES OF WESTERN GREECE. 10.

At this time the extreme west of Sicily was in the posses sion of the Phoenicians, who had established themselves at various points on the coast. Of the inhabitants of the interior, the most western were the Elymi, whose stronghold was Eryx, and their tutelary deity a goddess whom the Greeks called Aphrodite; next to these were the Sicani, who also worshipped at Eryx ; and further to the east, in the immediate proximity of the Greeks, lay the Sicels. These and the Sicani were of the same race as the early inhabitants of Italy. II. The new-comers were not content with Sicily.

From this point, according to the legend, pirates returned to Sicily and established themselves on the Straits of Messina. They were soon joined by a band of Chalcidians, and the new settlement (728 B.C.) was called Zancie, from the shape of the site, The chalcidians which was a promontory in the form of a sound zancie sickle. The colonists quickly saw what advantages they would gain from a complete command of the strait, and in order to establish a city on the Italian shore they sent to Chalcis to ask for assistance. The Chalcidians responded to the appeal, and, in union with a number of exiled Messenians, founded Bhegium (715 B.C., or earlier). Finally, about 648 B.C. the Zanclaeans established a new outpost in the west of Sicily, on the Himera, a river flow ing into the sea on the northern shore, in close proximity to the ancient Phoenician towns of Panormus and Soloeis."], [362, "CORINTHIAN COLONIES: SYRACUSE.

It is said that the Eretrians had already perceived the importance of the place, and had attempted to colonise it. But they were unable to maintain themselves against the attack of the Corinthian Chersicrates, who, like Archias, was an exiled or dishonoured member of the Bacchiad family.1 The island was supposed to be the abode of the Phaeacians of Homeric story, and the colonists \u2014 for of the original inhabitants we know nothing \u2014 were eager to rival the nautical skill of their mythical predecessors. There was wood in abundance for shipbuilding ; the soil was productive of wine and oil ; and a remunerative trade could be carried on with the inhabitants of the neighbouring coast.

The city lay on the south coast of the island, at the north of the river of the same name. From Gela, after the lapse of a century, was founded Acragas or Agrigentum (c. 580 B.C.), which became, under her tyrants, the second city of Sicily. 14.

When the rebellion of the Partheniae had been suppressed at Sparta, the defeated insurgents were bidden by the Delphian oracle to \"seek the clear waters of the Taras.\" Thither, therefore, they went in the year 708 B.C., and founded Taras, or Tarentum, in the Iapygian Bay, at the mouth of the river of that name. The city rose to importance by its trade and manufactures, and, though it had to undergo severe conflicts with the Messapians of Brentesium, it re mained the chief centre of Greek civilisation in this part of Italy (supra, p. 269). The Tarentines were not the first Greeks who had pene trated this region. Thirteen years previously (721 B.C.) Achaeans from Peloponnesus had founded Achaeans in Sybaris on the Crathis,3and in 710 B.C. a second Italy- Achaean city had been established at Croton, near the Lacinian headland.

Here, about 600 B.C., they founded Massilia (Mar seilles) near the mouth of the Bhone. A later colony went out about 565 B.C. to Alalia, in Corsica, which was joined twenty years afterwards by the Phocaeans who refused to submit to Cyrus. The colonists had to sustain severe conflicts, not only with the natives, whom they dispossessed, but with their rivals in navigation and commerce, the Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians. These nations naturally resented the intrusion of new-comers into regions from which hitherto they had reaped an undivided harvest.2 About 540 B.C. a great battle took place at Alalia. The Greeks are said to have been victorious, but they lost forty out of their sixty ships. Alalia was abandoned, and the Phocaeans founded a new colony in Lucania at Elea (Velia, c. 540 B.C.) 1 For Locri, see Polyb. xii. 5 ff. ; Strabo, p. 259. 2 For Massilia, etc., cf. Arist.

Temples were founded for the worship of Greek deities. Samos, Aegina, and Miletus possessed separate temples ; but the Hellenium was a common shrine for the colonists from Teos, Clazo menae, Phocaea, Chios, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, Phaselis, Bhodes, and Mitylene.1 Naucratis, as the settlement was now called, became a great and flourishing city; and a knowledge of Egypt, the land of immemorial antiquity and stupendous monuments, was diffused throughout Greece. A second colony in Africa was Cyrene, a settlement of the Theraeans.

Herodotus tells a romantic story of the founding of this city, which, he says, was the account given by the colonists at Cyrene, and differed from that of the Theraeans. Etearchus, king of Oaxus, in Crete, had a daughter Phronime, whom her stepmother, the second wife of Etearchus, accused of unchastity. Etearchus delivered the girl into the hands of Themison of Thera, a friend who had pledged himself to carry out any command which Etearchus might impose upon him, bidding him throw her into the sea on his voyage home. Themison was indignant that such a charge should be laid upon him, but he would not break his oath. He threw Phronime into the sea, as he was pledged to do ; drew her out again, and carried her to Thera, where she was taken by Polymnestus as his concubine. She became the mother of a son, Battus, who was so called because he stammered in his speech. When he became a man, Battus repaired to Delphi to be helped of his infirmity. Without vouchsafing any answer to his questions, the oracle bade him found a colony in Libya. Battus replied that he was unable to do so with the forces which he had at command, and when the oracle made no further communication he returned to Thera. After his return all went ill with him and the Theraeans. In their distress they sent to Delphi, but the answer was still the same : A colony must be sent to Cyrene. At length Battus was despatched with two penticonters. He failed to establish the colony, and returned, as before, to Thera. But the Theraeans, in their fear of the displeasure of the deity, would not allow the emigrants to land. In despair they returned upon their way, and settled on the small island of Platea, off the Libyan coast. Still fol lowed by misfortune, they sailed after two years to Delphi, in the hope of a more favourable response. But the answer was the same : They must colonise Libya. Battus then returned, and settled at Aziris, on the mainland, where he remained six years. In the seventh year the Libyans conducted the emigrants to a more fertile spot, where"], [369, "XI. I7-] GREEK AFRICAN COLONIES: CYRENE. 351 the \"sky was pierced.\" Here was founded the city of Cyrene.1 The Theraeans knew nothing of Phronime or Themison. In their stor3r the King of Thera was at Delphi offering sac rifice and consulting the oracle, which com- Theraean manded him to colonise Libya. He declared account. that he was too old for such an undertaking, and pointed to Battus, the son of Polymncstus, who stood by his side, as better fitted for the task. They returned home, and, owing to their ignorance of the situation of Libya, the colony was not sent out. Thera was now afflicted with a blight, and on consulting Delphi the Theraeans were once more bidden to colonise Libya. They made inquiries in Crete for some one who was acquainted with the country, and at length found a certain Corobius, who had been driven out of his course to the island of Platea. Thither they went, and when the news of their arrival reached Thera, a strong detachment of the inhabitants of the island was sent to join them.2 Battus, the name given to the son of Phronime, is a Libyan word, the titular appellation of the kings of Cyrene. It could not have been in use till the city had been founded and recognised by the nations of the coast. The defect from which Battus suffered is derived from his name ; it has arisen from the similarity of the Libyan title to the Greek word which means to stammer. From other sources we find that the real name of the founder of Cyrene was Aristoteles.3 The cause of his migra tion was not a defect of speech, but defeat in a The probable party quarrel. Compelled to leave the island facts of Thera, and unable to force a return, he retired with his adherents to the African coast, and founded a new city. That he occupied the island of Platea before he settled on the mainland is probable. Thence he may have passed, as the story relates, to Aziris, and from Aziris to Cyrene.

Still farther to the west was the colony of Euesperides. 18. The rapid and simultaneous development of colonisation in the eighth century B.C. is one of the most remarkable features of Greek history. It is true that piracy was common in the earliest times of which we have any record. Even Colonies and then it was the scourge of the Mediterranean, \u2022pirates' nests.' and( doubtless, the Greeks took an increasing part in it, as their knowledge of maritime affairs developed. But stations established by pirates, and immediately aban doned when some more suitable post offered, are not Greek colonies in the sense in which we find them spreading far and wide, from the middle of the eighth century, with the guid ance and approval of Delphi. The nature and foundation of these settlements can only be explained by reference to the political conditions of the prominent cities of the time. The general causes already alluded to (p. 333), the growth of the population, the love of liberty, the desire of wealth, whatever force they may have had, are too permanent and universal to explain entirely so peculiar a phenomenon. The middle of the eighth century marked the close of a change in the constitutional history of Greece.

Others feel them selves his equals, and regard his superior position as an infringement of their rights ; or his virtues degenerate into vices, and monarchy becomes a tyranny. In one way or another the monarchies of Greece came to an end, and their place was taken by elective officers chosen from certain families, or under certain restrictions of age or wealth. At Argos the monarchy was at an early age reduced to a mere name; and though it was revived in its fullest extent by Phidon, it declined after Phidon's death. In Corinth the monarchy ended, amid strife and bloodshed, in 745 B.C. In Athens the kings became life-archons ; these were succeeded by decennial archons ; the privi leges of the ruling family were gradually set aside ; and at length the duties of the office were parcelled out among nine annual officers. In Thebes the monarchy appears to have ceased at an early period, if it be true that Xanthus, the contemporary of Melanthus, was the last king. In Euboea the kings were succeeded at Chalcis by the oligarchy of the Hippobotae. It is only in the half barbarous states of Greece that we find monarchs continuing in power; in Macedon and Epirus. A similar change went on in the cities of Asia Minor. The Penthilidae of Lesbos, the descendants of Agamemnon of Cyme, the Neleid princes at Miletus and Ephesus, disappear, to make room for oligarchies.1 19. The oligarchies which succeeded the monarchies, whether founded on birth or wealth, regarded themselves as a privi leged class, and sought by every means to maintain their position against the lower orders. When the navigation of the Aegean fell into the hands of the Greeks, Growth of dis. and excellent sites for the development of trade content were discovered on every hand, it was natural that those who felt themselves shut out from privileges at home should seek 1 This political disturbance is not by itself sufficient to account for the colonies of the eighth century.

Z"], [372, "[XI. 19. 354 ASSYRIA AND PHOENICIA. new abodes where no such invidious distinctions existed. There was generally some nobleman, who, either from love of adventure or because he was dissatisfied with affairs at home, was willing to lead the emigrants. In cities where the oligarchy was distinctly one of wealth, as at Chalcis or Miletus, any citizen who was in danger of losing his franchise would rather leave the city or send his sons from it, than sink into the lower ranks. Of some of the cities which sent out colonies at this time we have sufficient knowledge to be able to point out the circumstances under which the emigrants left their home. Archias, as we have seen, went away from Corinth owing to a disgraceful outrage ; Chersicrates, the founder of Corcyra, who was also a Bacchiad, is said to have been deprived of his citizenship.1 In Locri we see how discontent arose in Cause of the an oligarchical city. In the parent town the foundation of older families who governed the state were known as the Hundred Houses ; they con sidered themselves the nobility, and jealously guarded their privileges. If women of these families married husbands of lower rank, the marriages were not recognised ; the offspring was not admitted to the privileges of the nobles. It was a man of this disfranchised class, Evanthas by name, who founded the new colony.2 A similar cause led to the foun dation of Tarentum by the Partheniae of Sparta. The Messenians at Bhegium were fugitives from the oppression of the Spartans; Cyrene, as we have seen, owed its origin to a faction at Thera. External circumstances also contributed not a little to the success of Greek colonisation at this time.

Then followed the contests of Egypt and Assyria for the control of Syria, contests which, however decided, inflicted great loss on the Phoenicians. Under such circumstances the Phoenician mariners looked more and more to the West ; Carthage rose to power as Tyre and Sidon sank into subjection. At the same time the Phoenicians of the West seem to have left the rich and fertile lands of Eastern Sicily and Southern Italy unoccupied. Their trade drew them to the extreme west (Tartessus and the Atlantic) or to the north of the Tyrrhene Sea (the mouth of the Bhone), and the Greeks were thus at liberty to seize upon that part of the Mediterranean which was most suited to them. Lastly, the decline and fall of the Assyrian empire (from 650 B.C. onwards) left Egypt free from attack in that quarter. After the repeated invasions of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal had broken the power of the Ethiopian kings of Napata, Psammetichus was able to establish himself as Pharaoh at Sais. Under his protection and that of his successors, the Greeks were at last permitted to enter the secluded valley of the Nile, and share in the trade of Ethiopia, Arabia, and the Bed Sea.1 20. The Greek colonies were not, like those of Borne, established to extend and secure Hellenic dominion, however great the part which they played in diffusing Hellenic civili sation. On the other hand, they were more than trading stations.

For the Greek colonist did not look forward to returning home with the wealth which he had amassed, and closing his life in the haunts of his childhood. When he left his native city he ceased to be a member of it, his fortunes being henceforth bound up with the fate of the colony of which he had become a member. For this reason the prosperity of the mother 1 See the sketch in Busolt, Griech. Gesch. i. 294."], [374, "356 INDEPENDENCE OF THE COLONIES. [XI. 20. cities was not always in proportion to the prosperity of the colonies which emanated from them. Byzantium outstripped Megara, and, under the reign of her tyrants, Syracuse became a far more powerful city than Corinth. But though inde pendent, the colonies acknowledged a certain debt of reverence to the mother state. Fire was taken from the public hearth by the colonists to their new home ; the deities of the mother city were the deities of the colony. We hear of instances in which distinguished men were brought from the mother city to settle disputes among the colonists, and if a war arose between mother and daughter, the younger city had to repel the charge of ingratitude, and prove that the war was in evitable. But it also happened that a colony could not be considered the offspring of a single city. Either the colonists had amalgamated with the original inhabitants, Mixed colonies. .. , - , . - . ,. or more than one city had combined in the foundation, or a later band had reinforced an earlier settle ment. Such colonies, while they assumed a more independent position, were exposed to the evils which naturally arise in a heterogeneous population.1 21. In many cases the colonists did not establish them selves without severe conflicts with the previous inhabitants. Relations of the At syracuse\u00bb we are told, Archias \" drove the colonists and Sicels out of the island \" (Ortygia),2 and at the natives. Byzantium the Megarians suffered severely from the attacks of the Thracians, whom they dispossessed of their ancient fortress. In Libya it was some years before the emigrants could pass from the island where they first landed to a desirable settlement on the mainland. The hostility was natural. The natives resented the occupation of their terri tory ; they became aware that the products of their country would pass into other hands, with little, or at any rate very inadequate, remuneration to themselves. They must expect either to be driven off the ground or reduced to the position 1 Thuc. vi. 17 : o^Aoic o-vppiKTois 7roXvav8povinv ai 7roXeit \u00abai paSlas exovai twv noXireiav ras perafioXas Kai e7rtSova?.

On the other hand, we hear of Greeks intermarrying with Thracians ; both Themistocles and Thucydides were sprung from such a union. And in the open ports on the Black Sea, where the Greek was rather a trading merchant than a colonist in the stricter sense, the relations would tend to become more friendly than those which existed between a city of conquering emigrants and their immediate neighbours.1 But in spite of frequent conflicts, the native population in many districts was greatly influenced by the Greek colonists.

Greek heroes were thought to have settled in the country, as Diomed at Argyripi, and the eponyms of Italian tribes were traced to a Greek parentage. Daunus and Iapyx were said to be the sons of Lycaon the Arcadian. In religion, more especially, the Greeks were exceedingly tolerant. We have already seen how they adopted the deities of Asia Minor, respected their temples, and maintained their worship. The same principle was observed in the later colonies. Yet, along 1 At Pantieapaeum, which was founded by Milesians, the native princes, or half-breeds, finally established a monarchy which con tinued for some generations under Leucon, Satyrus, and Parisades (Strabo, p. 310)."], [376, "GREEK COINAGE AND TRADE ROUTES.

In all the spheres in which the Greeks strove for distinction \u2014 in the games at Olympia, in art and literature \u2014 the colonists proved themselves not unworthy of the source from which they sprang. 22. The varieties of the coinage enable us to distinguish the lines of trade which were followed by the great com- Coinage, and mercial cities of Greece. The two principal trade routes. standards were the Aeginetic and the Euboean (supra, p. 230, n. 2). Both were originally derived from Babylon \u2014 the first through Phoenicia ; the second, which is really a gold standard though applied by the Euboeans to the coining of silver, through Asia Minor, from which it passed by Samos to Euboea. These two systems of coinage point to two great divisions of commerce. In early times the trade of the Aegean was in the hands of the Phoenicians. They carried wares from Tyre and Sidon to the islands, and from hence to Argos or Aegina, which in time became the centre of this Eastern commerce. This was the first era of trade in Greece. It was essentially a trade with the East ; for even if the Phoenicians obtained some objects, such as amber, from the West, they were careful to conceal all knowledge of the West from the Greeks. The second begins with the dis- covery of the West and the spread of colonisa- tion, which was closely followed by the move ment which brought Sardis within reach of the sea. Euboea, Corinth, and Athens now became the great emporia of the Aegean. The Phoenicians gradually removed to the far west, where they divided the trade with the Tyrrhenians, and brought the products of Spain or the Cassiterides or the"], [377, "XI. 23-] GREEK COINAGE AND TRADE ROUTES. 359 Baltic to the Greek mariner at Massilia or Sybaris or Syracuse. At the same time, the mines in the north of Greece came within reach of the Euboean colonies in Chaicidice. This is the second era of trade ; it is chiefly a trade with the West. From the first there was, no doubt, a bitter rivalry between the two. For a moment Aegina may have cherished hopes that a share of the trade with the West would fall to her. The earliest coins of the Chalcidic colonies in Sicily were struck on an Aeginetic standard, and Corcyra maintained this stan dard to the last. But the hopes were soon at an end. The colonies changed over to the standard of Chalcis. The rivalry was finally suppressed by the destruction of the Aeginetans by Athens. Besides the Aeginetic and Euboean standards there were two others less widely accepted. The first of these, with a stater of 173 grains, was current in Asia Minor (except Minor standards the west coast). Thence it passed into Thrace ; of *\u00b0\u2122& for Thrace, like Asia Minor, was rich in metals, and coined money at an early period. The second was a better-preserved Phoenician standard (220 grains) minted at Miletus, and current on the south coast of Asia Minor. The coinage of the neigh bouring Greek cities was sometimes determined by these standards. Byzantium, for instance, adopted the standard current in Thrace and Asia Minor ; Ialysus and Lindus, in Bhodes, the Phoenician standard. This standard also passed from Miletus to Abdera in Thrace, whence it penetrated into Macedon, and there gave rise to the Macedonian standard.1 23. In material civilisation the mother country must have greatly profited by her colonies. A merchant, visit ing Corinth about the year 600 B.C., would have found a large collection of wares in the bazaars and depots of the city. Wine was supplied from many sources : from Mende, 1 See Head, Historia Numorum, Introduction, pp. xlvi. ff., 230.

Among the spices and medicinal herbs would be found mar joram from Tenedos, thyme from Hymettus, saffron from Bhodes, hellebore from Anticyra, silphium from Cyrene. The finest woollen goods were supplied by Miletus or Athens ; the best flax and hemp by Elis and Tarentum ; Cyrene and Epirus furnished hides, Arcadia oak for shipbuilding, Macedonia timber for houses ; Cyprus and Chalcis sent copper, Attica, silver ; iron utensils were supplied by the towns of Laconia, bronze pans by Delos or Aegina. The gold, if any could be found, even in Corinth, was an importation from the East; the electrum from Sardis. Those who were in search of objects ornamental rather than useful would have the opportunity of purchasing bronze statuettes from Aegina, terra-cottas from Tanagra, pottery from Athens and Bhodes, or from the shops of Corinthian makers. Fine metal work was imported from Sicyon, or fashioned by native artists. Among the rarer com modities were amber from the Hadriatic, richly embroidered garments from Italy and Thera, purples from Tyre, ivory and glass from Sidon. There would be slaves imported from Thrace and Asia Minor, and, perhaps, a few horses might find their way to Corinth from Thessaly or Arcadia, especially at the time of the Isthmian games. Sportsmen would know where to find a fighting cock which had been brought over from Tanagra or Bhodes. And who could tell what new or rare commodity, purchased from Phoenician or Tyrrhenian traders, might not be hidden in the ship which had newly come from Sybaris ? For the far West was at this time as fabulous a region to the Greeks as India to the Venetians and Portuguese in the Middle Ages. 24, Nothing is more remarkable in the history of Greek"], [379, "XI. 24.] DELPHI AND THE COLONIES. 361 colonisation than the influence exercised by Delphi in guiding the settlers to a new home. It was the duty of every band of adventurers, before leaving their native shores, to seek the advice and sanction of the god. So strongly Delphi and the was this felt by the Greeks themselves that any Colonies. colony which set forth without this ceremony was doomed to failure from the first. We find the practice noticed as early as the foundation of Naxos in 735 B.C., which was established under the protection of Apollo Archagetes, and it is illustrated in the most striking manner in the legends of the foundation of Cyrene, and the unfortunate attempt of Dorieus of Sparta to establish a colony on the Cinyps in Libya (see infra, chap. xiv.) In some instances the responses, or what were supposed to be the responses, given to the founders of the colonies were preserved. We know how Phalanthus, the founder of Tarentum, was guided to the mouth of the Taras (supra, p. 269). The settlers in Byzantium were The Responses told to found their colony opposite \" to the eiven- city of the blind\" (Chalcedon).

In other instances the responses were given in more ambiguous language, and it was left to the penetration of the settlers to divine the exact spot which was assigned to them. To the colonist the responses, however obscure, served as a charter, which entitled him to take possession of the land of aliens. For the priests of Delphi appear vaiueofthe to have claimed a right of possession in the sanction of whole world beyond the limits of Hellas. e p '' In their eyes property did not exist, except among the Greeks.

We may also suppose that they were careful to conceal the sources of their knowledge, as by this means the possession of it became the more surprising. Great indeed must have been the astonishment of the wandering mariner when he dis covered that his divine guide was acquainted with the local peculiarities of the place selected for the colony to a degree which required a personal knowledge of the country.1 To Delphi it was of the first importance that no colony should succeed which settled without her sanction, and that Effect of the sue- none which fulfilled all the obligations imposed cessofcoionisa- on it should fail.

Although she was never a political power, even in the colonies, her advice was sought by all, and it was given to all without distinction of city or tribe. For her interests lay in the universal prosperity of Hellas, and in promoting harmonious relations with foreign potentates. Hence her sanction came to be regarded as the seal of a common Hellenism, and in this way, by the end of the eighth century B.C., the shrine of Apollo was a recognised centre of unity in Greece.

It is not untrue to say that in Greece the age of colo nisation was succeeded by the age of tyrannies. No doubt, Political changes tte llne of dlvlsl0n was bv n0 means clearly in the seventh drawn, and colonies were sent out in the seventh century as well as in the eighth. But the characteristic feature of the period extending from the middle of the seventh to the middle of the sixth century is the internal change which then took place almost simul taneously in a number of cities. The oligarchies were over thrown ; many of the ruling families were executed or driven into exile ; their property was confiscated, and the rule of one took the place of the rule of the few. The change was the inevitable result of the progress of events. The establish ment of colonies had given a new impulse to commerce, especially to commerce with the West ; and as the cities which engaged in it grew in wealth, power and extent, an ever-increasing population flocked to them. Hence arose new political conditions. In those states which were purely or mainly agricultural, the population was spread over the whole country. If on the one hand common interests combined the poor against the rich, there was, on the other, no concentra t wn and tl0n \u00b0*** f orces which could give effect to feelings country popu- of discontent. In the mercantile cities it was lation. otherwise. When both parties were within the same walls, the bitterness of opposition became more intense, and at the same time the inhabitants of the cities 1 H. G. Plass, Die Tyrannis, etc., Leipzig, 1859. 360"], [385, "ARISTOCRACY AND TIMOCRACY. 367 XII. i.] were wealthier, more enterprising and far-sighted than the shepherds and peasants of the country. They had a clearer view of the evils which pressed upon them, and were able to combine for their removal. It was not a conflict between rich and poor only, but between a privileged and an unprivi leged class ; and in those cities where the descendants of an old population occupied a subordinate position towards a conquering race, the memories of the past gave a force and sanction to the growing discontents. For these reasons the oligarchies in the mercantile cities of Greece, and more especially in the cities on the isthmus, which lay in the track of the Western trade, found themselves, in the seventh century, in a very critical position. In some instances, moderate counsels prevailed. The oligarchies of birth no longer insisted on their position ; the aristocracy, or rule of the nobles, gave way to a Aristocracy and timocracy, or rule of the rich. Energetic men, timocracy. who had made their own way in the world, were no longer excluded from civic power and office. This revolution, for such it may be called, was sometimes carried out with the aid of an eminent citizen, who was appointed to reform the con stitution and establish a code of laws, as Solon was at Athens, and Zaleucus at Locri. Or the constitution was for a time sus pended, and plenary powers given to an umpire or Aesymnetes to adjudicate between the contending factions, and arrange the state upon a basis which would satisfy both. Such an umpire was Pittacus of Lesbos, who for ten years was absolute ruler of Mitylene. But in the cities where the aristocracies refused to make concessions to the lower orders \u2014 whether they were aristocracies of birth or of wealth \u2014 the only remedy was force. If there happened to be in the privileged class a man unscrupulous enough to employ the spirit of discontent in his own interest, he could come for ward as a demagogue, and rise to power on the ruins of his order. Or if in the unprivileged class there was any one of unusual force of character and intellect, the opportunity was now open to him of attaining the foremost position in the"], [386, "368 ACCOUNTS OF TYRANTS UNTRUSTWORTHY.

Democracy and democratical forms of government did not yet exist; if the traditional constitution was set aside, the government must fall into the hands of the man who took a leading part in removing it. 2. The accounts which have come down to us of the rise and administration of the tyrants in Greece are exceedingly Accounts of the untrustworthy. Even when they are not tyrants untrust- obvious fictions, they are founded on traditions worthy. handed down by the oligarchs whose power the tyrants broke, often by very violent means. At such hands the memory even of a great and patriotic man was not likely to meet with mercy or justice. Whatever his actions, they were done with a sinister object. Did he adorn his city with monuments, or execute useful public works, \u2014 his aim was to crush the citizens by laborious tasks. Did he send offerings to Delphi or Olympia, \u2014 they were furnished by exactions wrung from the people. The truth or falsehood of these statements was a matter of no importance. Fiction was always more entertaining to the Greeks than history, and those who could hardly have understood the measures by which Periander made Corinth the first city of Greece, found it easy to connect his name with actions of inhuman cruelty and lust. We must, therefore, receive these accounts with the greatest caution. In spite of the worst which has been said against them, the tyrants hold a legitimate place in the Place of the progress of Greek constitutional history.

That the lower classes sometimes found themselves deceived, and had reason to hate a tyrant no less than they had hated the olig archs whom he removed, is doubtless true, but even in that case it was better to have one master than many. And when the tyrant's work was done, and the oligarchs had been too severely weakened to maintain themselves against the grow ing power of the people, it was easier to remove a ruler whose safety depended entirely upon his own watchfulness, who"], [387, "XII. 3] THE FIRST TYR ANNIS: SICYON. 369 had forfeited every claim to the rights of a citizen, and was universally hated, than to exact justice and consideration from a close and unscrupulous order. To the Greek the very name of the \" tyrant \" was detestable, but at this distance of time it is impossible to deny that the tyrants, though their rule involved the suspension of civic life, were often men of great capacity, who played an important part in the history of Hellenism, and that the cities which they governed enjoyed great prosperity and power. SICYON. 3. It was at Sicyon that the first tyrannis arose. After the Dorian conquest of the city the Ionian population had been allowed to remain as a fourth tribe, the Aegialeis, beside the three tribes, the Hylleis, Pamphyli and Dymanes, into which, here as elsewhere, the Dorians ranged themselves (sup. p. 64). The proportion of the Dorian tribes to the Ionic shows that the Dorians, whatever their numbers, were the preponderant and ruling power in the city ; their attitude towards the subject population is perhaps indicated by the title \"Skin-wearers,\" which was here given to \"certain slaves, who resembled the Epeunacti,\" a class of the Helots at Sparta.1 The territory of Sicyon was of very limited extent, reaching only from the river Nemea on the east to the Sythas on the west, and bounded on the south by the territory of Phlius and Cleonae. The city lay in the valley of the Asopus, which, though confined at first between mountains, situation of the opens towards the sea into a plain of remark- city able fertility (the Asopia). In this plain, on an elevated platform between the rivers Helisson and Asopus, about two miles from the shore, was built the older city or acropolis ; at the foot of the hill lay the newer town, and in Sicyon's most flourishing days there was also a port on the sea-coast. Owing to the situation the city probably had some share in 1 KaTavaK0<b6poi, Athen.,271 D., from Theopompus. For the con tempt which the word expresses, cf. Theognis, v. 55. VOL.

Oil and wine were produced in abundance in the Asopia ; and in the upper valley of the river there were mines of copper, a fact of some importance in the history of the town, as it was owing to this supply of metal that Sicyon became at an early date a flourishing home of plastic art.1 4. We are too ignorant of the history of Sicyon in the period from the Dorian invasion to the rise of the Ortha gorids, to be able to explain the conditions under which the establishment of the tyrannis became possible. In the first Sicyon in the Messenian war Sicyon showed her antipathy eighth century, to Sparta by supporting the Messenians, from which we may conclude that the Ionian or non-Dorian popu lation was even then of importance in the city. As the family which rose to the throne was of this Ionian stock, the Dorian influence must have still further declined in the next century. We may conjecture that the Ionians availed them- selves of the growth of trade, which the Dorians In the seventh. . \u00b0 , -. . . . despised, to amass wealth, and by this means were enabled to resist more successfully the oppression of the ruling tribes.

In legendary history Argos and Sicyon were closely connected. When expelled from Argos by Amphiaraus, Adrastus had withdrawn to Sicyon, and on the death of Polybus, the Sicyo nian king, without male issue, Adrastus, as the husband (or son) of his daughter, succeeded to the throne. At a later time he returned to Argos, of which city Sicyon became a vassal kingdom. The connection thus established was confirmed at a later date by the submission of Hippolytus to Agamemnon, and, once more, by the colonisation of the city by the Dorians of Argos under Phalces (supra, p. 103). Under liberate sicyon each of the great dynasties therefore which had from Dorian ruled in Argos \u2014 the Perseids, Pelopids and Heraclids \u2014 Sicyon had been in dependence on that city. The remembrance of the ancient vassalage was kept up by various religious rites and ceremonies at Sicyon, especially by the worship of Adrastus as a hero, and the Dorian conquest was sufficiently proved by the existence of the Dorian tribes in the city. Clisthenes resolved to eradicate every vestige of the connection. He began with an attack on Adrastus. In order to suppress the choric songs and religious rites with which His attack on the hero was honoured at Sicyon, he sent to Adrastus. Delphi, requesting permission to expel him from the city. His request was refused: \"Adrastus,\" said the priestess, \"is the lawful king of Sicyon, and thou art a man of blood.\" Finding that he could not openly remove Adrastus, Clisthenes determined to make it impossible for him to remain in the city, and with this object invited the hero Melanippus, who in the Theban epic was the deadly enemy of Adrastus and slew his son-in-law Tydeus, to take up his abode in Sicyon. A shrine was founded for Melanippus in the Prytaneum, and the honours hitherto paid to Adrastus were transferred to the Theban. After"], [391, "XII. 6.] CLISTHENES LIBERATES SICYON. 373 such an insult it was supposed that Adrastus would leave Sicyon of his own free-will.1 6. In his treatment of the Dorians, who had so long been the ruling order in Sicyon, Clisthenes was restrained by no scruples of religious feeling. He was at once \u201e , ... \u00b0 . . He changes the able and eager to exhibit to the world the names of the old opponents of his race in a degraded and Donantnbes helpless position. The names of the four tribes of the city were formally changed, the Aegialeis, to whom the tyrant belonged, being now called Archelai, or rulers of the people ; while the three Dorian tribes received the most contumeli ous titles. The Hylleis became Hyatae or Piglings ; the Dymanes, Choreatae or Porkers ; the Pamphyli, Oneatae or Cuddies. Clisthenes must have felt himself in a strong position when he could thus openly trample on Dorian susceptibilities in spite of the proximity of two ancient Dorian communities at Sparta and Argos. As his political arrangements are said to have continued in use for sixty years after his death and the extinction of his power, it is clear that in this case the violence of the tyrant expressed the popular wish.2 In the same anti-Dorian spirit Clisthenes engaged in a war with Argos, which indeed under the circumstances was almost inevitable. Of the details of the struggle Goes to war we know nothing, but the tyrant's triumph with Ars\u00b0s over the Dorians in Sicyon is a proof that he cannot have been defeated by the Dorians of Argos. The beginning of the sixth century, in which the reign of Clisthenes falls, marked a period of decline in the power of Argos; at this time she was quite unable to maintain her ancient claims of sovereignty. Clisthenes also caused the re- puts an end to citations of the rhapsodes to be discontinued the rhapsodes at Sicyon.

The genius of Herodotus has made an incident in the private life of Clisthenes the most striking event of his The marriage reign. As the tyrant was without male issue, of Agariste. j(. was a matter of the greatest importance that a suitable match should be provided for his only daughter, Agariste. At the Olympic Games, at which he was victorious with a chariot and four, he caused a proclamation to be made that any Hellene who held himself worthy to marry the daughter of Clisthenes of Sicyon should repair to the city within sixty days at the latest ; for in a year from the sixtieth day, Clisthenes would betroth his daughter. Then all the Greeks who were proud of themselves or their lineage came to the wooing. From Italy came Smindyrides of Sybaris, the most luxurious of men, and Damasus of Siris ; from Epidamnus came Amphimnestus ; from Aetolia, Males, the brother of the misanthropic athlete Titormus. From the Peloponnesus came Leocedas, the son of Phidon, the great tyrant of Argos ; Amiantus, an Arcadian of Trapezus ; Laphanes, the Azanian from Paeum ; Onomastus, the Elean. Athens furnished Megacles, the son of Alcmaeon, and Hippoclides, the son of Tisander, who surpassed all the Athenians in wealth and personal beauty. From Eretria came Lysanias ; from Thessaly, Diactoridas of the Scopadae of Crannon ; from the Molossians came Alcon. For a year Clisthenes entertained this troop of suitors, in order that he might test their accomplishments, manners, temper and disposition. Sometimes he visited them in person, sometimes he watched their exercises, but more especially he feasted them with profuse magnificence. The Athenians found favour in his eyes above all the rest ; and of the two he preferred Hippoclides, partly owing to his personal qualities, and partly because he was connected with the Cypselidae of 1 Herod, l.c."], [393, "XII. 7] AG A PISTE'S WEDDING. 375 Corinth. When the day arrived for decision, a great banquet was prepared, at which Clisthenes entertained not only all the suitors, but also the whole population of the city. After the meal the guests diverted themselves with pleasant tales, each man striving to outdo his neighbour in 'Hippoclides the wit and point of his story. At length does not care-' Hippoclides, weary of this amusement, in which he had greatly distinguished himself, called for a flute-player, bade him play a dance-tune, and danced to the music, more to his own satisfaction than to that of Clisthenes. Ere long he asked for a table, upon which, when he had executed some Laconian and Attic measures, in order to exhibit the more his unrivalled agility, he planted his head and gesticulated with his legs in the air. Clisthenes could contain himself no longer. Starting from his seat, he cried aloud, \"Son of Tisander, you have danced your wife away.\" \" Don't care,\" said Hippoclides \u2014 an expression which became proverbial at Athens. Clisthenes then pronounced in favour of Megacles, and dismissed the rest of the suitors with courteous words and presents. We cannot support this account as historically accurate. It is, for instance, quite impossible that the son of Phidon of Argos should be a contemporary of Clisthenes criticism of \u2014unless indeed we alter the date of Phidon's the stor>'' celebration of the Olympia (supra, p. 229). The subject was one which inevitably led to exaggeration. The marriage of the only child of the great monarch of Sicyon created a stir in Greece ; and was probably the scene of such magni ficence and rejoicing as had never before been witnessed. Here was a new Helen, whom the choicest flower of Hellas sought to win. Many suitors might be ascribed to her, and the inventive genius of the Greeks would quickly supply a list of distinguished names, without criticising them too severely. The principal fact was certainly true. Agariste became the wife of Megacles of Athens, and she bore him children; among others, Clisthenes, the Athenian reformer, and a daughter who was married to Pisistratus, after he"], [394, "CLISTHENES' DEATH.

Athens. But from the day of the wedding we hear no more of Clisthenes. How or when he died \u2014 whether he remained on the throne to the last \u2014 we do not know. We may, however, confidently assert that the tyranny at Sicyon was not suppressed by the Spartans ; for, if that had been the case, the changes introduced by the tyrant would have fallen with him, and the Dorians would have been at once restored to their old position in the city. Without fixing any year for his accession or his death, Nicolaus ascribes to Clisthenes a reign of thirty-one years. We may venture a little beyond this statement, and say that his reign fell in the first thirty years of the sixth century.2 After the death of Clisthenes, whenever it took place, we have nothing more to record of the political history of Sicyon till the city appears as a member of the Laced aemonian confederacy towards the close of the century. By what means the changes of Clisthenes were supported and pre served after his death, as we are told that they were, we cannot even conjecture. 9.

Yet it cannot have taken place long before, for Clisthenes the son of Agariste was an active party leader at Athens in 509 B.C. - If his death is to be placed c. 570 B.C.

Q-] CLIS THENES' CHA RA C TER. 377 crowned the judge who decided against him in the games, and, as some say, the sitting statue in the Agora of Sicyon is the likeness of this person.\"1 Nicolaus on the other hand, though he agrees with Aristotle about the military ability of Clisthenes, presents his character to us in a different light. Having gained his power by treachery, he exercised it \"with greater cruelty and violence than any of his predecessors.\"2 That Clisthenes was a far stronger character than his brother Isodemus is obvious \u2014 if there be any truth in the narrative of Nicolaus ; but no acts are recorded of him such as those which disgraced the life of Myron II. and clisthenes did not brought about his death. The charge of oppress the people. violence has probably arisen out of his treatment of Adrastus and the Dorians, as that of \" insolence \" against Phidon of Argos from his celebration of the Olympia. It is nowhere said that Clisthenes oppressed the people by laborious tasks, after the usual manner of tyrants; on the contrary, it is allowed that the cost of the portico which he built in the marketplace of Sicyon was defrayed out of the spoils of the war with Cirrha. The \" change from the tyranny of Myron to the tyranny of Clisthenes,\" of which Aristotle speaks, may have been a change from the rule of a selfish despot to that of a monarch who extended and developed the resources of his city. All that we really know of Clisthenes is in his favour. (1) He delivered Sicyon from dependence on a foreign city ; (2) he was renowned throughout Greece for his military ability ; (3) though he left no son to take his place, the changes which he introduced continued in force for two generations after his death ; and (4) he made Sicyon a dis tinguished home of plastic art by inviting to the city the best masters of the time.3 1 Pol. v. 12, 1 = 1315 b. 2 Frag. 61 Muller. 3 The' total duration of the tyrannis was 100 years (Aristotle, loc. at., Diod.

At its south-western extremity, the isthmus which connects northern Greece and the Peloponnesus sinks rapidly down from the summit of Geranea (5000 feet) to a narrow and fiat strip of land, about three and a half miles wide, and at no point more than 240 feet above the sea. To the south of this depression, where the isthmus ends in the mainland of the Peloponnesus, the mountains rise once more. On the east is Oneum, which attains a height of 1900 feet, and to the west of this, but separated from it by a river flowing through a deep ravine, is Acrocorinthus (1850 ft.). Strictly speaking, Acrocorinthus is a spur of the still higher mountain which separated Corinth from Cleonae, but, owing to the ravine on the east and the depression in the south, it has the appearance of a detached hill, especially when seen from the north. This was the Acropolis of Corinth, a magnificent watch-tower guarding the entrance into Peloponnesus. The town lay on the northern slope of the mountain, close upon the stream which divided it from Oneum. On the west, the level space, about a mile and a half in breadth, between the city and Lechaeum, the port on the Corinthian Gulf, was crossed by long walls ; and on the east Oneum ran out to the Saronic Gulf, where was Cenchreae, the eastern port of Corinth, at a distance of seventy stades from the city. Owing to this splendid situa tion, Corinth not only commanded the isthmus, as a bridge between two seas, but also held the key of the routes between northern and southern Greece. Of the two great roads which ran from Sicyon and Argos to the north \u2014 into which those from Elis and Sparta converged \u2014 one was commanded by the long walls of Lechaeum, and the other passed under about 510 B.C., at which time the contumelious titles of the Dorian tribes must have been removed, we get 510 + 60 = 570 B.C. for the death of Clisthenes, and 670 B.C. for the rise of Orthagoras, if the hundred years ascribed to the tyrannis by Aristotle are to be calcu lated without any interruption."], [397, "THE CORINTHIAN TRIREME. 379 XII. io.] the eastern wall of Corinth, while the third and less impor tant route, by the Saronic Gulf, passed through Cenchreae. Corinth was thus the central emporium of Greece, and her importance was greatly increased by the growth of her colonies in the west. No Greek sailor would pass the dreaded Malea if he could profitably dispose of his goods at the isthmus, and the mariners of the west preferred the shorter and safer route up the Corinthian Gulf to the circuit of the Peloponnesus. These natural advantages were improved by the mechanical genius of the Corinthians. For the convenience of those who wished to sail to the east or west, a path- Enterprise of way was constructed at Schoenus over the the Corinthians. lowest and narrowest part of the isthmus, by which ships could be transferred upon rollers from one sea to the other. For this purpose the cargo was generally taken out, and no doubt it was sometimes found advantageous to traffic in the ports of the city while the ship was drawn over the isthmus. The Corinthians were also fully alive to the necessity of maintaining a superior navy. They had not gained their position in the west without conflicts with the Chalcidians, by whom the trade was at first carried on, and the prize could not be retained without energy and enterprise. Towards the end of the eighth century the Corinthian ship builders constructed a new vessel far superior in swiftness and strength to anything which had yet been seen. The ordinary ships of the time were either sailing-vessels (irXola) or fitted with a single bank of oars, twenty-five on each side (penteconters). The new Corinthian galley contained three banks of oars, each rising over the other, and carried a crew of 200 men. Unfortunately the Corinthians could not keep the invention to themselves. In 704 B.C. Aminocles built triremes for the Samians, and in 664 B.C. the Corcyraeans were able to defeat the Corinthians at sea.1 1 For Corinth, cf. Strabo, p. 378 ff. ; Aminocles, Thuc. i. 13 ; the defeat of the Corinthians, supra, p. 345."], [398, "[XII. ii. 380 CORINTH: STORY OF CYPSELUS. II. This defeat may have contributed to the internal changes at Corinth which followed it. Within the next ten Rise of the years (655 B.C.) the rule of the oligarchy Cypseiids. (supra, p. 344), after a duration of ninety years, was brought to an end. The immediate cause of the change is said to have been a dissension in the family of the Bacchiads. Amphion of Corinth had a daughter Labda, who was lame, or in some way deformed, and as no one of her own rank would take her to wife, she was married to Aetion, of the deme of Petra, a descendant of a Lapithan family which had long been settled there. Oracles warned both Aetion and the Corinthians that the son of this marriage would \"justify\" Corinth, and the Bacchiadae resolved to kill the child as soon as it was born. Ten men were sent for this purpose to the house of Aetion at Petra; but when placed by his unsuspecting mother in the arms of the man who had asked for him, and who had undertaken to dash him immediately to the ground, the infant smiled. The man was touched with pity at the sight, and handed him to the next, by whom he was passed on to the next, until he reached the tenth, who gave him back to his mother. When they left the house, the men accused each other of cowardice, and after a time they returned intending to destroy the child by a common act. But Labda, who had overheard them, hid the child in a chest ; and when he could not be found the men went away, and reported that they had done all that was required of them. This child was Cypselus, the first tyrant of Corinth.1 \u2014 If there are any elements of truth in this story, it is useless to attempt to disentangle them. The incident of the chest Cypselus. seems to be due to the name Cypselus (a name which occurs elsewhere, both of places and persons). In Greek kypseU means a chest, and it appears to have grati fied the pride of the tyrant's race to suppose that the founder had been saved in this wonderful manner. Periander gave 1 Herod, v. 92."], [399, "XII. 12.] CORINTH: TYRANNY OF CYPSELUS. 381 confirmation to the legend by consecrating a magnificent chest in the Heraeum at Olympia. Less mythical accounts omit all mention of the chest, and tell us that the oligarchs had made themselves hated by their oppression, greed and misrule.1 Then Cypselus, who was a favourite with the people \u2014 though he belonged to the Bacchiads by birth \u2014 availed himself of his position as polemarch to conciliate the people still more, until at length he came How he became forward as their champion, slew Patroclides, Tyrant the prytanis of the year, and established himself as tyrant with the consent of the people. The brief notice in Aristotle supports this view ; and we may assume with certainty that Cypselus won the affections of the common people, and rose J;o power with their assistance and approval.2 12. Cypselus reigned for thirty years. By his wisdom and moderation he was able to retain the affections of his citizens to the last ; he kept his throne with- The reign of out the assistance of that \"commonplace of cyPseius. tyrants,\" a foreign body-guard. The city prospered under his rule. Though he was unable to bring Corcyra into sub jection, he succeeded in restricting her trade by the foundation of the three colonies already mentioned (p. 346), Ambracia, Leucas and Anactorium, in which he placed his three natural sons, Gorgus, Pylades and Echiades. His wealth was doubt less enormous. He was able to build a treasure-house at Delphi, and therefore, we may presume, to consecrate offerings, which he intended it to receive, but whatever these may have been, they were far surpassed by the golden colossus of Zeus which he set up at Olympia \u2014 a statue not cast, but beaten with the hammer, and one of the wonders of the world. The Greeks told various stories of the methods employed by Cypselus to defray the cost of his magnificent piety ; how he taxed the Corinthians at ten per cent, for ten years, thereby acquiring the whole of their property ; how he robbed and 1 Nic.

The trade of Corinth would provide ample resources for a ruler who had no standing army to maintain.1 In Herodotus Cypselus is described as a tyrant who banished a great number of Corinthians, deprived others of their character of possessions and many more of their lives. Cypselus. -p^js picture is drawn in the colours in which Herodotus loves to paint a tyrant, and from other authors we receive a more favourable impression. Though the exiled Bacchiadae felt the tyrant's rule to be severe and unjust, the people whom he rescued from oppression regarded it in another light. He was their champion, and could rely on their protection, while the care with which he governed the city and promoted her interests won for him universal confidence. But in Greece, at any rate in early times, the people had not the power of expressing their thoughts in literature. That was the exclusive privilege of the oligarchs, to whose partial judgment is due the contradiction that the memory of the tyrants was hated at Corinth, though the period of their rule was the most flourishing era of the city.2 13. In 625 B.C. Cypselus was succeeded by Periander, whose long reign of forty years marked the highest point ever reached by the military power of Corinth. The son followed the lines laid down by the father, and succeeded where he failed. While Cypselus had contented himself with establishing rival colonies to check the development of Corcyra, Periander reduced the rebel- Subdues lious island to submission, and placed his son Corcyra.

But for the long reign of Periander, Plutarch observes, the Hellenes would not have dwelt at Apollonia, or Anactorium, or Leucas. In the north of the Aegean, in order to secure a share in the profitable trade with Macedon and Thrace, Periander founded the colony of Potidaea, and this city also he placed under the command of one of his sons, Evagoras.1 In the Peloponnesus he ex tended the domain of Corinth by the conquest of Epidaurus. He had married Lyside, or, as he chose to call her, Melissa (the Bee), the daughter of Procles, tyrant His wife of Epidaurus, and niece of Aristomenes, the Melissa. hero of the second Messenian war. After she had borne him two sons (or more), she fell a victim to his violence. A war with Procles was the result of this unhappy catastrophe. Periander was victorious ; he carried his father-in-law captive to Corinth, where he apparently kept him, and Epidaurus became a dependency of that city.

To Periander was due the revival and extension of the Isthmian Games. The Ionians had long offered a sacrifice of Revival of the l'uiis to Poseidon on the shore of the Saronic isthmian Gulf, and with the growth of Corinth the Games. attendance at this festival increased. At length, in 587 B.C., stimulated perhaps by the new importance which was being given to the festival of Apollo at Delphi, Periander added gymnastic contests to the sacrifices. These were the Isthmian Games, held in the pine woods at Schoenus, every two years, in the second and fourth years of the Olympiad. The victor's crown was a wreath of wild parsley.2 Like his great contemporary at Sicyon, the tyrant of Corinth favoured the worship of Dionysus. In his city and The worship during his reign, the dithyramb or song in of Dionysus. honour of the wine-god became \" choric,\" the wild unmeasured strains previously in vogue being balanced by strophe and antistrophe, as the chorus danced round the altar. This innovation was due to Arion of Methymna in Lesbos, who at the same time increased the gaiety of the performance by dressing the members of the chorus in attire suited to the occasion, and introducing them as Satyrs in the train of the god.3 When at the height of his fame, Arion resolved to visit Italy and Sicily.

The sailors readily agreed to this, for they could desire nothing better than to hear the greatest harp-player of his time. Arion clad himself in the robes which he wore at musical contests, and, standing on the deck at the end of the vessel, he played a solemn strain, after which, as he had promised, he plunged into the sea. He was not doomed to die. A dolphin came and carried him safely on his back to Taenarum, whence he returned to Corinth and told his story to Periander. Periander was incredulous, and kept him in charge till the Corinthian sailors should return. On their arrival at Corinth he sent for them, and made inquiries about Arion. They answered that they had left him safe and prosperous at Tarentum, when to their amaze ment Arion came forward, dressed in the robes in which he had thrown himself into the sea, and compelled them to confess the truth. The story was current in Corinth and Lesbos, and was confirmed by the existence of a bronze statue at Taenarum, representing a man seated on a dolphin. The statue was seen by Pausanias, and the inscription on it, to gether with an ode in which Arion celebrated his delivery, has come down to us.1 15. Another story brings Periander into close connection with Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Miletus. We are told that he sent an envoy to Thrasybulus to inquire Periander and the best method of governing a city. Thrasy- Thrasybulus of bulus made no direct answer, but walked with Mlletus the envoy through a field of corn, and, as he walked, he struck off all the finest and tallest ears till none were left. Periander asked the envoy on his return what Thrasybulus had said. He replied that he had said nothing ; he seemed to be a man out of his mind, and bent upon doing mischief to 1 Herod, i. 24 ; Paus. iii. 25. 7 ; cf. Aelian, Hist. An. xii. 45. The device of a man seated on a dolphin is found on various coins, e.g. those of Tarentum and Methymna. Of the ode Bergk says (Poet. Lyr. iii. 79, SO): \"Mihi novicium omnino videtur carmen, quod ante Euripidis aetatem vix potuit componi.\" VOL. I. 2 B"], [404, "[XII. 16. 386 THE CHEST OF THE CYPSELIDS. himself. He then told Periander what he had seen in the corn-field. Periander understood the meaning which Thrasy bulus intended to convey ; if a tyrant wished to remain secure in his position, he must cut off and destroy all who were eminent in the city.1 16. Periander did not fall short of his father in the splen dour of his offerings to the gods. The chest which the The chest of the \" Cypselidae \" dedicated at Olympia was one Cypseiids. 0f tne most famous achievements of early Grecian art. It was made of cedar wood, and covered with pictures in relief, in which gold, ivory and cedar were the materials employed. Pausanias, who describes the chest more minutely than intelligibly, speaks of five fields (vwpcu), each filled with subjects from the mythology of Greece. In four of the five inscriptions were added to explain the subjects, and Pausanias remarks that some of these were written in the old manner known as boustrophedon \u2014 i. e. continu ously from right to left, and left to right. The \" fields \" were apparently horizontal bands running round the chest, and as Pausanias in describing them proceeds from right to left with the first, third and fifth, and from left to right with the second and fourth, we must suppose that the chest had three sides only covered with pictures, the fourth being for some reason vacant, as would be the case with a chest set against a wall.2 1 Herod, v. 92.; Arist.

In the highest or fifth compartment was a grotto, in which were a man and a woman sleeping on a couch, surrounded by four handmaidens. These were Odysseus and Circe, for though there was no inscription, it was possible to identify the figures of the maidens by the tasks allotted to each, which corresponded with the description in Homer. There was also a Centaur in which the fore-legs were those of a man \u2014 perhaps Chiron ; winged horses yoked in chariots, in which rode the Nereids, and among them Thetis, receiving the arms from Hephaestus. Nausicaa too was there, driving with her women to the washing-pits, and Heracles shooting down the Centaurs. \" Who was the artist I could not discover, but it is possible that the pictures are by one hand, the inscriptions by another.

The description is of the greatest interest and value, partly for the light which it throws on the history of Greek art, and partly for the evidence which it supplies of the existence of the Homeric and cyclic poems at an age preceding the reign of Pisistratus. 17. The close of the life of Periander was saddened by domestic troubles, of which Herodotus gives us the following account. After the death of their mother, the two sons of"], [407, "XII.

When parting with them on their return, Procles Troubles at the asked the question, \"Do you know who close of Peri killed your mother % \" The younger son, whose ander's reign' name was Lycophron, took the question much to heart, and when he reached Corinth, refused to have any com munication with his father or to speak to him. Periander, in a rage, banished him from the house, and inquired from his elder son what Procles had said. After a time the youth, who was of much slower intelligence than his . . . . Lycophron. brother, remembered the question and repeated it. Periander now issued a proclamation that no one was to entertain or support Lycophron, or even to speak to him. For three days the unhappy boy had remained in the porticoes of the city, when Periander himself addressed him, and sought to soften his resentment. Lycophron was in exorable, and merely answered that Periander had transgressed his own proclamation. Finding all attempts at reconciliation useless, Periander sent his son to Corcyra, and proceeded to make war upon Epidaurus. Towards the close of his life, when he felt the need of a younger hand to support his power, he sent to Corcyra, desiring Lycophron to return and occupy the throne of Corinth. Lycophron made no reply. Then Periander sent his daughter, in the hope that she might persuade her brother to return. She urged the necessity of saving the tyranny from falling into other hands, and the evils of a stubborn spirit, but in vain. Lycophron steadily refused to return to Corinth while his father lived. Periander sent yet a third time, proposing that he should go to Corcyra, and his son succeed him at Corinth. To The murderof this proposal Lycophron agreed, but when the Lycophron. Corcyraeans heard that the dreaded tyrant was coming to rule over them, they seized Lycophron and put him to death. Periander resolved on a terrible revenge.

Fortunately those who The revenge of were in charge of them put in at Samos on Periander. their way to Sardis. On hearing what a fate was in store for the boys, the Samians directed them to attach themselves to the temple of Artemis. From this asylum they would not allow them to be removed, and when the Corinthians attempted to starve them out, they held a festival with dances of girls and boys who carried cakes and sweetmeats, which the Corcyraean boys were allowed to snatch from the bearers as they approached them in the dance, and by this means they were kept alive till the Corinthians, weary of the delay, returned home. We do not hear that Periander made any attempt to revenge himself upon the Samians.1 From another source \u2014 later it is true \u2014 a different account of the sons of Periander has come down to us.

In the room of Nicolaus he established Psammetichus, the son Periander's 0I nls half-brother Gorgus, at Corcyra.2 What death- ever the truth about these unhappy incidents, they were quickly followed by the death of Periander. 18. The character of this tyrant appears in antiquity in 1 Herod, iii. 50 ff. 2 Nicol. Damasc. Frag. 60 M. The meaning of the words \"establish ing a tyranny,\" which are used of Lycophron, is obscure; perhaps he assisted Procles against Periander.

Though early tradition seems to have enrolled him among the Seven Sages \u2014 his sayings were quoted beside those of Solon and Thales, for the shrewd character of practical wisdom which they contained \u2014 a later Periander. generation did not scruple to charge him with the worst crimes. He was not only a bloodthirsty tyrant, who re moved every enemy from his path without pity or remorse, but his cruelty extended to women and children \u2014 even to those of his own kindred. In order to provide himself with gold for an offering, he is said to have stripped all the women in Corinth of their ornaments, and, in another version of the story, to have taken even their garments that he might burn them in honour of his dead wife, who, when he consulted her spirit after death, complained that she was cold. This wife he not only killed by an act of savage violence, but he insulted her body after death. Other stories darkened his memory by the stain of incest with his mother, and when it became difficult to reconcile such a character with the reputation of Periander the sage, it was in the course of time assumed that the two persons were distinct. The truth is now beyond our reach. It is clear that Periander was a firm and vigorous ruler, and a great soldier, who extended the power of Corinth to the utmost limits which it ever attained. That he took strict precautions for his own safety is no doubt true, but the accounts which we have of his bloodshed criticism of the and pillage come from a tainted source. We tradition. may believe that his relations with his wife Melissa were unfortunate ; she may have fallen a victim to his violence, for the death of a pregnant wife through a husband's bru tality is almost a commonplace in the tyrant's career ; and her death may have given rise to domestic strife. But in regard to some of the charges brought against Periander, we must remember that in the eyes of Herodotus every tyrant Periander was able to quell. The hostages seem to have remained at Samos till Periander's death\u2014 at least we hear no more of them.

[XII. 19. was or ought to be a monster of iniquity ; and in the period when Greek biographies were written, the life of sage or philosopher was thought insipid without an infusion of vice.1 19. Periander was succeeded by Psammetichus, the son of his half-brother Gorgus, who had followed Nicolaus in the government of Corcyra. Of his reign we know nothing. When he had sat on the throne three years and a half he fell by the hand of an assassin, and with his death the tyrannis at Corinth came to an end, after a duration of seventy-three years and a half (655-582 B.C.). With the fall of the tyrants Corinth reverted to an oligarchical form of government. The supreme authority was placed in the hands of a Council of eighty as before, of whom eight were prytanes. Each tribe therefore furnished one prytanis and nine councillors to the governing body. The immediate result of the change was not en- Faii of the couraging. Corcyra established her independ tyranny: the ence ; Epidamnus and Epidaurus were once more free. From her position as a great naval power, commanding the sea to the west, and respected as far as Miletus and Egypt in the east, Corinth became a city of merchants, renowned for her wealth, and notorious for her profligacy. The family of the Cypselids experienced the utmost severity of oligarchical resentment. Their houses were torn down, their goods confiscated, and the body of Psammetichus was cast out of the country without burial.2 1 Suidas has two notices of Periander, the son of Cypselus. In the first he is a sage who composed 2000 gnomic verses, and died of a broken heart (cf. Anth. Pal. vii. 620). In the second ( = Nic. Damasc. Frag. 59 M.), he changed \"the monarchy into a tyranny,\" kept a bodyguard of 300 men, prevented his citizens from possessing slaves, and put an end to their leisure by providing new tasks for them. He fined every one who sat idle in the market-place. From Hermippus we hear that he drowned all the procuresses in the city (Athen. 443 A). 2 It is remarkable that the last of the Cypselids should bear the name of the Egyptian prince who about this time had done so much for the Creeks in Egypt. It is possible that Cypselus or Periander entered into relations with the Egyptian monarch, or at any rate wished to testify his friendship by this compliment."], [411, "XII. 20.] THE TYRANTS: MEGARA. 393 MEGARA. 20. In the seventh century Megara played an important part in the development of Hellenic commerce. Her colonies were established in the distant west and in the T h c n fife n e s . north, at Selinus and at Byzantium. And at Megara, as elsewhere, the increase of prosperity led to dis sensions between the poorer and the richer classes. For though we are ignorant of the internal arrangements of the city, we know that it contained two conflicting elements \u2014 the oligarchs, who lived within the city walls and owned whatever rich meadow-land there was in the barren and mountainous country ; and the peasants, who \" were clad in the skins of goats,\" and lived on the hills \"like deer.\" Nothing was needed but an opportunity and a man to give effect to the mutual hatred of these parties ; and when Theagenes, who was himself of noble birth, seized the herds of some rich oligarchs, which were feeding by \u00b0 i i i His rise. a river, he was at once supported by the people, and enabled to put himself at their head.1 He became tyrant of Megara in the popular cause. The date of his ac cession to the throne is uncertain, but as Cylon of Athens was his son-in-law (supra, p. 296), his reign may be placed in the last three decades of the seventh century. At this time Megara was at war with Athens for the possession of Salamis (infra, p. 398), and it is not improbable that Theagenes owed his position, at least in The conquest some degree, to his success in leading the ofSaiamis. Megarians in this struggle. For a time the Megarians were victorious. Salamis was even occupied by colonists from Megara, probably men of the poorer class, who looked up with gratitude to the Friend of the People by whom they had been placed in possession of their new farms. We are also told that Theagenes supported Cylon in his attempt to establish a tyranny at Athens. Like other tyrants, he 1 Arist. Pol. v. 5. 9 = 1305 o."], [412, "THEAGENES TYRANT OF MEGARA.

An aqueduct which he built to convey water into the city is described by Pausanias, 700 years or more after its erection, \" as remarkable for its size, ornamentation, and the number of the pillars.\" This is all that we know of the events of the reign of Theagenes, and of its close we know nothing. There is reason to suppose that he did not retain the throne till his death.

At any rate it is very unlikely that a tyrant was on the throne of Megara when the city allowed the dispute about Salamis to be referred to the decision of the Spartans.1 After the restoration the government appears to have been conducted with moderation, at least for a time. The straits to which the city was reduced in the war with igarc y. Athens probably made the union of classes im perative. Then a change occurred ; the race for wealth became all absorbing, and the more so as the external power of Megara began to decline. Money made the man ; the old social distinctions were cast aside : birth was less and less regarded, aristocrats married daughters of the common citizens if they had a rich dowry, and high-born ladies did not disdain alliance with wealthy parvenus. Enormous rates of interest prevailed ; on every hand were oppression and greed. At length the people retaliated, and a radical democracy took the place of the oligarchy. Of the aristocrats The Democracy. r . ., , , . . some went into exile, and their goods were con fiscated ; others, who remained at home, were compelled to feast the poor in their houses under pain of pillage and violence. A law was publicly passed that all sums which had 1 See Vogt, De rebus Megarensium, Marburgi Catt., 1857, p. 81, where the scanty evidence is collected."], [413, "XII. 21.] REVOLUTION IN MEGARA. 395 been paid as interest on borrowed money, should be repaid to the borrower. So great was the public contempt of established law and Hellenic custom, that on one occasion the Amphic tyons had to interfere to secure compensation for injuries done to a sacred procession on its way through Megarian territory. When this change took place is uncertain, but it cannot have been much later than the middle of the sixth century.1 21. Of the condition of the city at this time the Megarian poet Theognis, whose life fell mainly in the second half of the century, has left us a lively picture. He saw the evils of mis rule, and himself suffered by them. He warned his citizens that their conduct would end in their destruction ; State of Megara in other words, that the oligarchs, of whom he as described by was one, were going to excess in their greed and e\u00b0sms dishonesty. \" A city, even in the profoundest peace, is on the way to ruin when the people are oppressed, and justice is perverted.

SOLON. I.\u2014 THE STRUGGLE FOR SALAMIS. I. Across the bay of Eleusis and in the very eye of the citadel of Athens lies the island of Salamis, which at one extremity almost touches the coast of Megara, and at the other approaches the harbour of Athens. In the earliest times the island is said to have formed an inde pendent state, governed by kings of the stock of Aeacus, but afterwards it declined, owing to the growth of the neighbour ing cities of Aegina and Megara, and passed into the hands of the Athenians. Towards the end of the seventh century Lost by the B.C., the Megarians, instigated perhaps by Athenians. Theagenes, obtained possession of the island. The Athenians attempted to dislodge them, but in vain. Every effort failed, and at length, in the course of a long and distressing war with Megara, Athens was reduced to such a state of despondency that a law was passed forbidding any one to propose to recover Salamis on pain of death.1 Then Solon, the son of Execestides, who traced his descent from the old royal family of Attica, \" indignant at the disgrace which had fallen on his city, and seeing that many of the younger citizens were eager to recover the island but durst not speak of it,\" resolved to bring the matter once more into Solon rouses public notice.

About the same time the Athenians were engaged in a Avar with Crisa, a city adjacent to Delphi, which sought to maintain her claim to the possession of the ' shrine of Apollo. The sanctuary lay in the territory of Crisa, and had originally been under her con trol, but the Delphians, as their prosperity increased, claimed to be an independent community ; the oracle, they said, was the property of the Hellenic nation, and no longer in the jurisdiction of Crisa. They also charged the Crisaeans with exacting tolls from the pilgrims who landed at their port of Cirrha (at the mouth of the Plistus) on their way to the oracle. The matter was brought before the Amphictyonic Council, where Solon took a leading part in the discus sion. He urged the Amphictyons to support the Delphians, and to put an end to the unjust extortion of the Crisaeans. \" Let all come to the help of the god ; and take part in the 1 The chief source of our knowledge of the Salaminian war is Plutarch, who quotes no authorities for his statements. He distinguishes four stages in the progress of the struggle ; (1) Salamis is taken by Megara ; (2) it is recovered by Solon, with help from Pisistratus; (3) is lost again ; (4) after a long contention is finally assigned to Athens. Herodotus mentions the capture of Nisaea by Pisistratus (i. 59), who, he says, was general (polemarch ?) when he took it. For the passage in Homer see Plutarch, Sol. c. 10, and Strabo p. 393. With regard to the chronology, it is difficult to believe that Pisistratus took a pro minent part in a war before 600 E.C., as he lived till 527 B.C., and he cannot have been a polemarch till much later (the polemarch, as an archon, would be thirty years old or more). Yet if the war with Salamis was the beginning of Solon's influence in Athens, his success cannot be put later than 600 B.C. The loss of Nisaea is stated by Plutarch to have taken place before the visit of Epimenides (in 596 B.C. ?).

In spite of this array of forces the enemy was able to hold out for ten years (595 586 B.C.) Crisa was the first to fall. The oracle had de clared that the city would not be taken till the sea washed the shrine of Apollo, and as Delphi lay at a distance of some miles from the coast, this response filled the Crisaeans with hope. But Solon, who was present with the Destruction or army, persuaded the three commanders to agree crisa and in consecrating the Cirrhaean plain to Apollo, 'rr a* and by this means to bring the precincts of the god down to the sea-shore. Further resistance was in vain, and Crisa now fell into the hands of the allies.

Sol. 11. In Hymn. Apoll. 262 ff. Crisa includes the whole district from the shore to the temple. An interpolation in Strabo tells us that Cirrha was destroyed by Crisa, which was afterwards destroyed by the Amphictyons. 2 Strabo places Cirrha on the sea-shore opposite Sicyon, and distinguishes it from Crisa (p. 418) ; Pausanias regards Crisa as the ancient name of Cirrha (x. 37. 5). Cirrha was the larger and more important, though the more recent town ; and probably the Crisaeans had little more than a nominal authority over it ; but the Delphian priests did not make any nice distinction in the guilt of their rivals.

Gymnastic trials of strength were also held (586 B.C.), and, in the second celebration of the games, races with horses and chariots, the hippodrome being laid out in the territory of Cirrha. This part of the festival was quite at variance with the traditional feeling of the Delphians, if we may trust the author of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. In his opinion the rattle of chariots and the watering of mules at the holy springs would be vexatious to the deity ; while elaborate games would divert attention from the temple.

Severe as this sentence was, it seemed to come too late. The Megarians had meanwhile got the upper hand in the contest for Salamis, and the Athenians in their distress connected this disaster with the offence which had brought upon them the guilt of bloodshed. Superstitious fears took possession of the city ; ghosts and apparitions were seen ; the seers were warned by the sacrifices that further expiations were needed to appease the wrath of heaven. The visit of In this emergency the Athenians invited the Epimenides. assistance of Epimenides of Phaestus in Crete, a man of superior reputation for sanctity and sacerdotal power.

More than all, by propitiations and purifications, and the establishment of new modes of worship, he soothed the prevailing excitement and induced the citizens to listen to reason, and return into harmony with one another. At his departure the Athenians, in gratitude for his services, offered him large sums of money and marks of high distinction, but of these he would accept nothing. He asked for a branch from the sacred olive of Athena on the Acropolis, and with this reward returned to Crete.1 There have been times in the history of many nations when superstitious fears have prevailed with remarkable Nature of the force, and in ancient Greece these seasons of distress. excitement were by no means uncommon. No crisis but had its prophets who filled the people with alarm, nothing supernatural that was not readily believed. The beginning of the sixth century B.C. was in a peculiar degree a time of religious emotion. It was marked by the rise of that Orphic literature, by the spread of those mysteries, which, however contemptible in our eyes, were full of meaning to the Greeks. The sleep which rounded life was broken by dreams ; the simple worship of ancestors was disturbed by puzzling thoughts of a hereafter ; and with the deepening sense of moral guilt came the need of more efficacious means of expiation.

IV.\u2014 THE ARCHONSHIP OF SOLON. 6. The affair of Cylon had thrown into the background troubles of a more lasting nature, which, when the religious distress abated, again began to agitate the people. Nothing had yet been done to remove the burden of Povert and debt and poverty which oppressed the poorer wealth at citizens ; the old strife of parties had never Athens been healed. Melancholy indeed is the picture which is drawn for us of the social state of Athens at this time. In the higher classes there prevailed a spirit of selfish greed, in the lower there was hopeless misery and degradation. The wives and daughters of the rich seem to have lived in luxury, marriages more especially being occasions of great and osten tatious extravagance ; while the yeoman was obliged to sell his children into slavery in order to purchase release from the crushing claims of his creditor.1 Such a contrast of rich and poor was fraught with great dangers, which no one observed more clearly than Solon. He saw that internal strife, when a powerful neighbour like Theagenes was at hand to take advantage of it, was not unlikely to end in the ruin of the state, and he pointed out his view of the situation in an elegiac poem addressed to the people. \" It is not the will of the gods that our city should perish, for over us The warning are spread the hands of our guardian goddess of Solon- Pallas Athena ; it is the desire of gain which will bring us to ruin ; the thoughts of our leaders are not honest, and their greed will bring great evils upon them.

Meanwhile many of the poor go into foreign lands, sold as slaves, and burdened with shameful bonds. My spirit bids me warn the Athenians of the evils of misrule.

Solon enjoyed the confidence of all parties. Though by birth he belonged to the aristocracy, his fortunes had thrown Solon elected him among the merchants, that by trade he Archon. might repair the damage done to his property by the excessive liberality of his father. Twice he had come forward in a time of public distress and rescued the city from a most serious situation ; it was resolved to ask his assistance once more, and in 594 B.C. he was elected archon, with power to mediate between the various factions in the city.2 To an ordinary Greek such a position would have been merely the stepping-stone to a tyranny. He would at once have enlisted the people on his side, and established himself in supreme power by the overthrow of the oligarchy. Many citizens, and especially his own kindred, urged Solon to take this step; many more despised him for refusing to take it, but neither taunts nor persuasion prevailed on him to go beyond his powers. He accepted office with misgiving, knowing well that the arrangements which might be best for all parties would probably be those which would satisfy none. His first measure was the famous Seisachtheia. Every citizen who had been sold into slavery, at home or abroad, The Seisach- was restored to liberty; all debts secured upon theia' the person or landed property of the debtors were cancelled ; and for the future no one was allowed to lend money on the security of the debtor's person. \" Some authorities, as, for instance Androtion (fourth century B.C.), are of opinion that the Seisachtheia was no more than a modera tion of the rate of interest ; but the majority assert that it was a cancelling of all contracts alike, and with this view 1 Sol. Frag. 4 B. 2 Plut. Sol. 14."], [425, "XIII. 8.] SOLON'S SEISACHTHEIA. 407 Solon's words agree.\" l Solon's words are : \" In the day of vengeance, dark Earth, mightiest mother of the gods of Olympus, will be my surest witness of this, Solon's account from whom I removed pillars planted in many of it- places, and whom I freed from her bonds. Many citizens, who had been sold into slavery under the law or against it, I brought back to Athens their home ; some of them spoke Attic no longer, their speech being changed in their many wanderings. Others who had learnt the habits of slaves at home, and trembled before a master, I made to be free men. All this I accomplished by authority, uniting force with justice, and I fulfilled my promise.\" 2 From this it is clear that by some means debtor-slaves were restored to liberty, and lands burdened with debt were relieved of the incumbrance.3 8. At the same time Solon made a change in the coinage, introducing into Attica the standard known as the Euboeic in place of the old Attic or Aeginetan (see supra, Alteration of ch. xi. \u00a7 22). The difference between the two the standard standards was about 38 per cent. ; at least this of coinaee was the difference assumed by Solon, who recoined seventy- 1 Plut. Sol. 15. 2 Sol. Frag. 36, 37 B. 3 It is true that we cannot establish the meaning of \" mortgage pillar\" for opos by reference to other passages in contemporary literature (Cox, Hist. Greece, i. 201) but this, which is the common meaning in legal Greek, appears to be the only admissible meaning here. If we translate opoi \" boundaries \" (as Cox suggests), we must accept one of three explanations : \u2014 (1) Either Solon introduced liberty of sale in land, so that properties burdened with debt could be sold and the debt paid ; or (2) he introduced a redivision of property (thus removing the boundaries) ; or (3) he put back into their old place the boundary stones which had been moved so as to encroach on the property of others. The first meaning is against the sense of the whole passage ; it would be little better than irony to speak of land as \" liberated \" which had been sold to pay debts. The second is against the testimony of antiquity ; as a redivision of the land was precisely the measure which Solon did not propose. The third sense puts a forced meaning on the word dvelXov, which means \"I took up,\" or even \"I destroyed,\" without any reference to replacing in a previous position. See Mr. Lang's Introduction to Aristotle's Politics, p. 88."], [426, "CHANGE OF THE COINAGE. [XIII. 9. 408 three of the old drachmas into a hundred of the new. This measure has often been regarded as a part of the Seisachtheia ; as though the change was intended to be a relief for those who had sums of money to pay. For, by availing himself of the new standard any one who owed a hundred drachmas in the old coinage could pay them in the new, and retain thirty-eight drachmas out of the debt. Those who take this view are compelled to maintain that Solon did not cancel the debts secured on land, but reduced the capital by the sums paid in interest, and provided that the rest should be paid in the new coinage. But as we have seen, this view of the Seisachtheia is not supported by the account of it which Solon himself gives. On the other hand, if all debts on land and person were cancelled, it is difficult to see what debtors benefited by the change in the coinage. It is true that any one who pos- sessed a stock of money, and also owed consider not apart of able sums, might save largely by paying his the Seisach- debts in the new currency; but when the laws of debt were so severe, and the rate of interest so high, no one was likely to borrow if he had ready money. And if he had borrowed on the security of land, he was entirely freed from the debt by the terms of the Seisachtheia. The alteration of the coinage, therefore, was merely a regu lation intended to facilitate business and trade, not a device for the relief of debtors. At the same time it appeared to increase the wealth of those who had money at the moment when they were called upon to make sacrifices by cancelling many debts that were due to them.1 9. As Solon had foreseen, the measure caused general dis satisfaction. The rich were annoyed at the loss of their money, the poor, who had looked forward to a complete redistribution of property, were discontented with the relief which had been given. In time the evil brought its own remedy. Each party found in the complaints of the other a reason for acquiescing in a measure which, while giving 1 Plut. l.c. ; Head, Historia Numorum, p. xlii."], [427, "XIII. io.] CONSTITUTION OF SOLON. 409 assistance to the poor, had not impoverished the rich. In a short time Solon stood higher than ever in public estimation. He had averted the impending crisis by an arrangement at once firm and impartial, and he had resisted the temptation of a tyranny. When he laid reform tne down his office at the end of the year (July constitution 593 B.C.), he was requested to reform the entire political constitution of Athens. The laws, the offices, the political and social arrangements of the city were com mitted to him for readjustment and correction. It was a solemn charge, but it was placed in worthy hands.1 V.\u2014THE CONSTITUTION OF SOLON. 10. We are not able to give a complete or accurate account of the constitution of Solon, partly owing to the want of materials, and partly because later writers attributed to Solon legal and political institutions of which he was not the author. But we know the objects which he had in view, and we can trace in^outline the method object of by which he attempted to realise them. As the Solon's con- Seisachtheia had removed the bitter feeling stroy the power which separated rich and poor, so the new of the Gentes. form of constitution was intended to destroy the barrier which separated the privileged and unprivileged classes. Hitherto Athens had been an aristocracy ; all the political and judicial power was vested in the noble families, against which all other classes in the state were powerless. This opposition it was necessary to remove. Solon felt that a state was not composed of a single class, but existed by the harmony of all classes ; that political power must be granted to all according to the measure in which they were able to receive it. On what basis could such a harmonious relation of classes be organised 1 Obviously not on the basis of birth, which was a source of dissension rather than union, a barrier which 1 Plut. Sol. 16."], [428, "410 SOLON'S CONSTITUTION: FOUR CLASSES. [XIII. could only be removed in two or three generations. A property qualification was the only expedient, for riches were a prize ._ . which, with the growth of commerce, seemed to Necessity of a ' \u00b0 ' property quaii- be within the reach of all. The increasing im fication. portance of money was being felt everywhere in Greece at this time, and, however much the old aristocracies might struggle against it in the spirit of Theognis, the pos session of wealth was becoming the means of access to the higher functions of citizenship. Those who were richest had the greatest power. Solon carried out this system more thoroughly than had been done hitherto in any city of Greece, and what was elsewhere a principle of oligarchy he combined with democracy. II. He divided the citizens into four classes, according to their annual income. The first class, or Pentacosio- The four classes medimni, consisted of those whose annual ofSoion. income amounted to 500 medimni ( = 750 bushels) or more ; the second class, or Hippeis, of those whose income was between 500 and 300 medimni ; the third class, or Zeugitae, of those whose income was between 300 and 150 medimni; the fourth class, or Thetes, of those whose income was less than 150 medimni. In this census that in come alone was calculated which was derived from landed property, profits of trade or business being excluded, so that all merchants, shopkeepers, artisans, etc., who had no landed property, were included in the fourth class, whatever their wealth might be. It was of course open to any rich merchant, if an Athenian, to purchase an estate and thus raise himself into a higher class ; aud, conversely, any landholder who was compelled by extravagance or misfortune to sell his property, value of the of necessity sank in the political scale. By this arrangements, means a scheme was provided which not only enabled those who had a share in the country's wealth to exercise a due influence in the government, but removed restrictions which had hitherto prevented the most enter prising part of the community from acquiring important civic rights. But Solon also insisted that the wealth which con-"], [429, "XIII. 12.] SOLON'S CONSTITUTION: THE ASSEMBLY. 411 ferred political rights should be invested in landed property. That was a pledge that the welfare of the citizen was closely united with the welfare of his city.1 To each of these classes certain duties were assigned. The three highest classes were expected to discharge without pay ment the expenses inseparable from the offices Duties imposed of state ; and the members of the highest class on the classes. may also have been required, even at this early period, to contribute as trierarchs to the maintenance of ships of war. From the Hippeis the horse soldiers of the community were selected, the equipment and maintenance of a horse being a matter of considerable expense at Athens. The Zeugitae were the heavy-armed soldiers of the state ; it was their duty to provide themselves with the necessary armour, except a shield and lance, which were given to each citizen at the public expense on his attaining his majority. From the Thetes no military service was required, or nothing beyond their appearance in the field as light^armed soldiers. Nor were they eligible to any office of state. But as rowers in the triremes they formed the most important part of the Athenian navy.2 12. Having thus removed aristocratical privilege, Solon proceeded to arrange the constitution on the broad prin ciple that every citizen should have a voice in it. Before his time the Ecclesia or General Assembly of the The Assembly citizens may have had the power of deciding on peace or war; such at least is the probable conclusion, and we have nothing but probability to guide us in form ing an opinion. Solon assigned to it the right of electing the public magistrates, and passing sentence on their conduct at the end of their year of office\u2014 rights which obviously imply freedom of discussion. By this addition the Assembly was at 1 Plut. Sol. 18 ; Boeckh, Staatshaushaltung, p. 645 ; Aristotle (?) Pol. ii. 12. 6= 1274a; Pollux, viii. 130.

The people became the sovereign power in the state, so far as the administration was concerned. They elected and controlled the executive. That they should take any part in civil or criminal legislation was hardly contemplated at the moment when Solon was drawing up a code which he hoped would suffice for the next hundred years.1 Two qualifications were necessary in every Athenian who attended the Assembly : he must be of full age, which in Athe nian law was fixed at the twentieth birthday, and he must be a citizen. But what constituted citizenship 1 Were those only citizens who were born of citizen parents on both sides \u2014 of an Athenian father and an Athenian mother 1 Apparently not, for otherwise the sons of Miltiades by the daughter of Cypselus of Corinth, and of Cylon by the daughter of Theagenes (if there were any) would have been deprived of citizenship. These are instances from the time immediately preceding Solon ; and it does not appear that Solon made any change. Megacles, his younger contemporary, married the daughter of Clisthenes of Sicyon ; and Pisistratus married the daughter of this Megacles. As there is no suggestion that the issue of their marriages were, or would be, debarred from Athenian citizenship \u2014 on the contrary, the son of Megacles was Clis thenes of Athens \u2014 we must suppose that it was enough that the father was an Athenian citizen. On the other hand, the marriage must be solemnised according to Athenian rites, and the issue registered in an Athenian phratry. \"I give my daughter to Megacles to be his wife according to the laws of the Athenians,\" are the words of Clisthenes of Sicyon in dis posing of the hand of Agariste.2 1 Arist.

Such men would have little time or inclination to make visits to Athens merely for political purposes. Nor were they likely to be efficient as speakers in the Assembly, or to have any special knowledge of current events. A more compact and permanent body was needed for the satisfactory discharge of public business. Solon met the need by the creation of a Council of 400 members, chosen equally from each of the four tribes \u2014 a remarkable institution, which was without a parallel at the time in Greece. Unfortunately we know nothing whatever of the qualifications of the members of this Council, the mode of election, or the arrangement of business. We may conjecture that only the first three classes were eligible as councillors ; that the election was managed by the Phylobasileis and the heads of houses, and that the Coun cil was divided into committees which attended daily at the Council Chamber for a fixed time. But these are merely con jectures. Plutarch dismisses the Council of Four Hundred in a single sentence : \" Seeing that the people were greatly puffed up and emboldened by the remission of debts, he instituted a second council (in addition to the Areopagus) by choosing a hundred men from each of the four tribes ; to these he assigned the duty of preparing measures for the people, and they were to forbid anything to be brought before the people which had not been previously considered by them.\" This was, of course, the duty of the Council in later times ; and may have been its duty in the time of Solon ; but we cannot suppose that this was the sole or the chief reason for its creation.

IS-] SOLON'S CONSTITUTION: THE AREOPAGUS. 415 form of government to exist which was not supported by the good-will of the citizens. That constitution, and that alone, was firmly established which satisfied the aspirations of the people, and had its roots fixed in their affections. With this object in view, Solon established the Council of the Areo pagus. We have seen that even before his time the hill of Ares was the most solemn place of judgment in Athens ; it may also have been the place of meeting of the old aristo cratical Senate. With this ancient and hallowed site Solcn identified the Board which he intended to be the supreme authority on all matters touching the social and moral welfare of the state, and by this means he secured for his new Council the force of tradition, and the associations of holy ground. The Council consisted of the archons and ex archons \u2014 i.e. of members selected from the aristocracy, but chosen by the people. As the archonship was open to the first class only, and those who offered themselves for it must be men over thirty years of age and of blameless life and character, Solon at one stroke created a Council composed of the best representatives of the highest class of citizens, who in the first instance received their position by the votes of the whole people. The members were elected for life, which enabled them to exercise their power fearlessly, and with the growth of time their numbers became considerable. Allowing twenty years for the average life of the ex archon, the whole body of the Areopagus would not be less than 200 in number. The Council represented the best practical wisdom, the most tried moral and political worth in the city. It also confirmed the rich in their position, but only when they gained the votes of the community. Before the Council all cases of intentional homicide, intent to murder, arson and treason were brought for trial. But it received other powers even more impor- pOWerofthe tant, which enabled it to exercise a paternal Areopagus. control over the city. Even if no formal complaint was brought before it, the Areopagus had the right to make inquiries into the life of the citizens and their means of sub-"], [434, "416 SOLON'S CONSTITUTION: THE HELIAEA. [XIII. 16. sistence ; its sentence fell on the idle and profligate no less than on the criminal. The members were irresponsible ; their decisions could not be revoked, and they appear to have been rarely impugned. \"It was the bulwark of the land and city, the like of which no man had seen either in Scythia or in the island of Pelops ; a Council incorrupt, awful, and severe ; a watchful guardian over those that slept.\" To the last it con tinued to retain the respect and admiration of the best citizens of Athens ; and, though stripped of its prestige by Pericles, it seems to have been restored to a considerable degree of power after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants. The two councils, the Areopagus and the Four Hundred, Solon regarded as the two anchors of the state, and time confirmed his opinion.1 16. As the archons were chosen from the first class only, and the Areopagus was composed of archons and ex-archons, the administration of the law was entirely in the hands of institution of the aristocracy. This could not fail to be a the Heiiaea. serious danger : it was of little use to have one law for the rich and poor, if the administration of it lay in the uncontrolled power of the rich. To remove this difficulty Solon created a Heiiaea, or popular court of law. From the citizens of every class, who, being over thirty years of age and of good character, chose to offer themselves for the purpose, a certain number were annually selected and empanelled as a jury, after taking a solemn oath. Before this body those officers of state could be tried whose conduct was attacked at the scrutiny in the Assembly ; it was also a court of appeal from the judicial sentences passed by the archons. Any citizen who felt himself unjustly treated could bring the matter before a jury of his fellow-citizens. As there was no distinction of classes in the Heiiaea, and as the members were numerous, bribery and influence were rendered almost impossible, and by this means the people were secured against the aristocracy. Though this court was the beginning of the later judicial system of 1 Plut. Sol. 19 ; Aesch. Eum. 703 ff ; supra, p; 308."], [435, "XIII. IJ.]S0L0N'S CONSTITUTION: NATURE & WORTH. 417 Athens, it must not be confounded with it. In the first instance the Heiiaea was not concerned with the immediate decision of law-suits, but with cases which came to it from the Ecclesia or the archons, and as the members were not paid, and therefore would not devote more time than necessary to their duties as jurors, the meetings were probably rare.1 17. Thus did Solon \"mix the constitution,\" combining aristocratical with democratical elements. The people were supreme in the last resort over all questions Nature 0f Solon's of peace and war, over the conduct of the constitution. executive, and the administration of law \u2014 powers without which they could not rise above the condition of slaves. On the other hand, the executive was in the hands of the aristo cracy or the rich, to whom also the way to the Areopagus was reserved. Though the Assembly and the Heiiaea were open to every Athenian above twenty and thirty years of age, the Senate of Four Hundred, with which rested the initiative in all matters brought before the Assembly, was probably composed of men whose means allowed them to be absent from their property ; and the Archons were chosen from the first class only. But these oppositions were softened by the graduated scale of property qualification, which, while destroying the power of that most dangerous element in a small state \u2014 a needy aristocracy, made it possible for every citizen to rise into a higher political position. The constitution of Solon was an admirable Its worth and structure, at once firm and elastic. Even at impartiality. this distance of time we are astonished at the genius which formed so accurate an estimate of the strength and the weak ness of the elements on which he had to work, and created a constitution such as had never existed in the world before, by uniting the past with the future, and the reverence for prescription with the love of freedom. Solon did not, like Lycurgus, crush every natural feeling in the interest of the state, nor place, like Pericles, the city rabble in a position 1 Aristot. Pol. ii. 12. 4 = 1274 a ; Plut. l.c. 18 VOL.

Poet, soldier and states man, he saw life from every side. By his wise impartiality he won the respect and confidence of his citizens, and what he gained he used for the noblest purposes. To the last his memory was cherished as that of the statesman \" who loved the people.\" VI.\u2014 THE LAWS OF SOLON. 18. A code of laws was a necessary part of Solon's reforms. The ordinances of Draco were not only in a great measure Necessity of a useless owing to the severity of the punish new Code. ments inflicted, but they were probably quite inadequate to satisfy Solon's views of the office of the legislator. In his judgment laws were not merely a means of punishing crime and checking injustice ; they might interfere if necessary in the private life of the citizen, and direct his most intimate arrangements, as well as determine and guide his public conduct. His code was thus of a most comprehensive character, and though we cannot suppose that it included all the laws which were at a later time ascribed to Solon, it was no doubt a larger and more complete body of enactments than had previously been brought together. It is impossible and unnecessary here to pass the whole under review ; those provisions only will be mentioned which throw a light on the social or political state of Athens at the time. It is a curious feature of Attic law that many acts which we regard as the private affair of those who are injured by Personal and them were made public offences, while others public offences. 0\u00a3 a far graver character were looked upon as private wrongs. Homicide, for instance, in regard to which Solon took over the laws of Draco without change, remained to the last at Athens a private wrong done to the kinsmen of the dead, and if they did not prosecute, the offender escaped. We must not infer from this that murderers were not punished at Athens. Beligious feeling and family pride fur nished motives for vengeance, and there was no want of men"], [437, "XIII. 10.] SOLON'S LA WS: THE POSITION OF WOMEN. 419 willing to prosecute. But it is a proof that the unity of the civic body was imperfectly realised. In order to remedy this defect, and at the same time to defend the weak and help less against those who might otherwise attack them with impunity, Solon made it legal for any one who chose to come forward as a prosecutor in cases of assault and injury. \" That city was the best,\" he said, \" in which those who are not injured come forward in defence of those who are, and punish the evil-doer.\" 19. From the Greek point of view Solon was more successful than Lycurgus in legislating for the women. We have, it is true, very slight evidence on which to estimate either the morality or the education of Athenian women, but of their political insignificance there is no doubt; and it was impossible that they could exercise any social influence, for they were not allowed to appear in society. Silence was their chief ornament, and their highest reputation to remain unknown. The rules which Solon laid down about them were at once more severe and more lax than we should tolerate. Marriage Laws about presents were forbidden : the bride could bring women. three changes of clothing, and furniture of some slight value into her new home, but nothing more. Wealthy wives led to ill-assorted marriages, in which the old were paired with the young, a union neither beneficial to the state nor likely to bring happiness to the household. No woman was allowed to leave home with more than three changes of clothing, and a very small amount of food, or with a basket more than a cubit in length \u2014 a regulation which was no doubt intended to put an end to display at festivals in different parts of the country. Excessive wailing at funerals was illegal; three changes of raiment only could be burned at the funeral pyre ; and visits to the tombs of those who were not members of the family were forbidden except for the purposes of burial. It was an ancient rule at Athens and elsewhere in Greece, that the next of kin must either marry an The Heiress. orphan girl who was the last of her family, or provide her with a dowry to enable her to find a husband."], [438, "SOLON'S LAWS: PUBLIC MORALITY. [XIII. 20. 420 In the case of rich heiresses this sometimes led to injustice. The next of kin might be old, or incurably diseased, but his legal right was indefeasible. To remedy the evils which might thus arise, Solon, while allowing the kinsman to retain his right, shielded the heiress by a number of regulations which made it difficult and unpleasant for any unsuitable person to insist on his claim. Another law relieved the children of a mistress from the duty of supporting their father. \"They owed him nothing for the disgrace he had brought upon them by their birth.\" In other respects Solon showed a certain inconsistency. If a husband surprised a paramour, he might indeed slay him on the spot ; but for offences with violence the fine was a hundred drachmas, and for seduction it was no more than twenty. A different class of crimes met with severe punishment. Death or loss of civic rights awaited those who had led Public infamous lives, or attempted to corrupt others. morality. g0 SUSpjci0US wag Solon of this evil that the gymnasia were placed under the most stringent rules in regard to the age of those who kept them, the time of opening and closing, and the admission of strangers.1 20. Other laws were intended to protect the State. Any citizen who remained neutral in a sedition, lost his civic rights. Law about To Plutarch this appeared a strange and remark neutrality. aDje enactment, but it is easily explained by reference to the condition of Athens at the time. In a period when party strife ran high, it was necessary for the peace of the community that each section should know the strength of the other. If there was a number of citizens who might suddenly declare themselves on this side or that, either party could hope at any moment to be superior to the other, and out of such a state of uncertainty serious evils would arise. It was also of the first importance that every man should take a part in political life. The Greeks had very little respect for the idiotes, the man of retiring disposition, whose interests did 1 Plut. Sol. 20-23 ; Lysias, i. 32."], [439, "XIII. 21.] SOLONS LA WS: POLITICAL DUTIES. 421 not extend beyond himself or his family. Through the state the citizen received not only the means of making a living, but the opportunity of developing his social and political nature, and any one who neglected those opportunities neglected the noBler half of his duties. For somewhat similar reasons Solon laid down a rule that those persons only should be adopted as citizens at Athens who were either The adopted exiled for life from their own cities, or came to citizen. Athens to settle there, after breaking up their old home. A man was not allowed to be a citizen of two cities ; he was not to remain at Athens justjso long as suited his interests or con venience, and then return to his original home, perhaps to escape some public burden. He must cast in his lot with his adopted city, and share her weal and woe.1 21. Before the time of Solon, the property of a man who died without heirs went to his gens. He had no power to dispose of it by will or testament. This ar- powers given rangement was a survival of ancient rules to make wllls about property which prevailed at a time when individual ownership hardly existed at all, or at the utmost a man had a life interest in what was regarded as common property. His representatives, if he left any, succeeded to his rights, but it was not in his power to alienate these from his gens, if they could not remain in his own family. This disability Solon removed. A man who died without children was permitted to dispose of his property in whatever way he might think proper. But the disposition must be the act of his own free will ; the testament was invalid if pro cured by compulsion or influence \u2014 the influence of women is specially mentioned. The testator must also be of sound mind unaffected by disease or drugs. The rule was a great step forwards in emancipating the individual from the control of the gens, and in this respect it is quite in harmony with the general aims of Solon's constitution. But it is doubtful whether the Athenians made use of the freedom to the full 1 Plut. Sol. 20-24."], [440, "422 SOLON'S LAWS: INHERITANCE\u2014 TRADE. [XIII. 22. extent. Whenever it was possible, a childless man preferred to adopt the son of his relations as the heir of his race and property. Plutarch, influenced perhaps by Boman ideas, speaks of the law as putting friendship in the place of con sanguinity, but the most common effect of it was that a man left to an adopted son the property which would otherwise have been divided among his relatives within the recognised degrees of inheritance.1 22. Another law forbade the exportation from Attica of any article but olive oil. The regulation is of little im- Exportation portance, but it would be interesting to know of olive oil. -with what view Solon established it. Was the exception made because olive oil was produced in quan tities beyond the requirements of the inhabitants 1 Or shall we ascribe to Solon the far-sighted policy of fostering by a favourable enactment the growth of produce for which Attica was peculiarly suited ? The Attic olive oil was the best in Greece ; jars of it were given away as prizes to the victors at the Panathenaea, and an olive spray, or a jar, or both, are constantly found on the coins of Athens.2 Solon appears to have encouraged trade and handicraft by every means. Among his laws was one which relieved a son Laws for the from the duty of supporting his father in old encouragement age, if the father had neglected to teach him a of trade. trade. With the same object he induced many strangers to settle at Athens. It was the boast of the Athenians that they offered especially favourable terms to the aliens who came to their city. Whether this claim is true or not we are unable to decide ; it is, however, certain that the trade of Athens was carried on to a very large extent by foreigners resident in the city, and the regulations which were laid down for the control of commerce at Athens were not more burdensome than those in existence at Venice in the fifteenth century. 23. A few more laws may be noticed for the light which 1 Plut. I.e. 21. 2 Ibid. l.c. 24."], [441, "XIII. 23] SOLON S LAWS: THEIR DURATION. 423 they throw on the Attica of the time of Solon. An Olympian victor was rewarded with five hundred drachmas, a sum equivalent to the income of a citizen of the first Miscellaneous class (for a medimnus was counted as equal to a laws. drachma) ; an Isthmian with one hundred. Any one who slew a wolf received five drachmas from the state ; and for a wolf's cub, one drachma ; the first being the value of an ox, the second of a sheep. Those who lived within half a mile of a public well might use it, but beyond that distance a man must dig a well for himself ; yet if no water could be found at sixty feet, he might take four gallons twice a day from his neighbour's well. Olives and figs were not to be planted within nine feet of a neighbour's border; swarms of bees must be settled three hundred feet at the least from an exist ing hive. No one was allowed to cut down more than two olive trees in the year on his estate under pain of a fine of a hundred drachmas.1 Solon also passed a law preventing any citizen from owning more than a fixed amount of land, and he compelled every one to show how he got his living.2 The laws were inscribed on wooden axdnes or tablets, fastened in square frames of wood, so that they could be turned round. The name given to these frames The axones and and tablets was kyrbeis. Some small fragments kyrbeis of the axones were in existence in the Pry taneum at Athens in Plutarch's time. The language of the laws, judged by a later standard, was archaic, but it seems to have been preserved unaltered to the beginning of the fourth century B.C. The Council, as a body, swore to observe and enforce them, and each of the archons pledged himself to set up a golden statue of the size of life at Delphi, if he transgressed change in the them in any point. Solon fixed a hundred years laws as the time during which his enactments should remain in force. In this he seems to have made a distinction between his legislation and his constitution, for he also spoke of his 1 Plut. i.e. 23. Dem. p. 1074. 2 Ar.

[XIII. 24. laws, meaning his political arrangements, as the best the Athenians could receive, not the best which he could have devised, and fixed ten years as the period within which no change should be made. Chilon of Lacedaemon, with characteristic severity, considered it a blot on his legislation, that he contemplated any change whatever.1 VII.\u2014 LEGENDS OF SOLON. 24. When at length his work as legislator was ended (585 B.C. V) Solon is said to have left Athens. His regulations Travels of met with much criticism ; in order to avoid Solon. making alterations in them, he bound the Athenians by an oath to observe them for ten years, and then departed. In his travels he reached Egypt, where he associated with Sonchis of Sais, and Psenophis of Heliopolis, priests from whom he acquired information about the life and doctrines of the Egyptians. He also visited Cyprus. The fall of the Assyrian empire at the end of the seventh century B.C. had left the princes of Cyprus more independent ; but, on the other hand, the severity with which the second empire of Babylon pressed upon the Syrian coast, in the first years of the sixth century, must have exercised a very depressing effect on the trade of the Phoenicians. By the time of Solon's visit, the Greeks were masters of a great part of the island. Solon was the guest of Philocyprus of Soli, a prince \" whom in his poems he extols above all others.\" According to Plu- tarch, Philocyprus dwelt in a city of no great size, founded by Demophon the son of Theseus, on the bank of the river Clarius. Though the site was strong, it was inconvenient, and on Solon's advice the prince removed the city to the subjacent plain, where he rebuilt it on a larger and more commodious scale. Solon assisted him with his advice in making the city as pleasant and convenient as possible. Inhabitants flocked to it, to the envy of the neighbouring princes, and the name of the city was changed from Aepea (steep) to Soli, in honour of Solon. Some lines of an elegiac 1 Plut. Sol. 25 ; Lysias, in Theomnest. i. 16 ff. ; Herod, i. 29."], [443, "XIII. 25.] SOLON AND CROESUS. 425 poem addressed by Solon to Philocyprus have been preserved. \" May you long continue to reign at Soli, over your city and people ; and may Cypris of the violet crown send me in a swift ship safely from your far-famed island. For the foun dation of this city may she grant me her favour and fair renown, and a safe return to my country.\" x 25. More famous than the sojourn in Egypt or Cyprus is the visit which Solon paid to Croesus, the king of Sardis. Whether such a meeting can have occurred is soion and more than doubtful. At the earliest date, Croesus. Croesus cannot have ascended the throne of Lydia before 563 B.C., and even if Solon's visit fell at the very beginning of his reign, it is later by ten years than the date at which a ten years' period of travel after the work of legislation came to an end. But at the beginning of his reign Croesus had not yet attained that pre-eminent position which the story ascribes to him. It was not till he had extended the borders of his dominion to the sea, by the conquest of the Greek cities of the coast, that the king of Sardis could regard The meeting himself as the most prosperous of men. This improbable. difficulty in the chronology cannot be removed ; but, as Plutarch remarks, it is not worth while, for the sake of a puzzle which no one can solve, to discard so good a story and one so characteristic of the men. Herodotus has rendered immortal the meeting of the wisest of the Greeks and the richest of the Asiatics; the scene forms a page of history which can never be erased. Croesus received the Athenian gladly, and when he had showed him all his wealth and power he asked Solon who, in his judgment, was the happiest of men. Solon replied, \" Tellus of Athens.\" Born of an honourable race, endowed with sufficient means, when he had lived long enough to see his children in prosperity, and Tellus children born to them, Tellus fell nobly in battle for his country at Eleusis. Disappointed of the first place in the rank of the happy, Croesus inquired to whom 1 Plut. l.c. 26; Herod, v. 113."], [444, "[XIII. 26. 426 SOLON AND ANACHARSIS. Solon ascribed the second prize : \"Cleobis and Bito,\"wasthe answer. These were Argives who had drawn their mother in a car from Argos to the temple of Hera, a distance of more cieobis and than five miles. When the Argives were loud Bit0- in their praises of the young men's strength, and the Argive women rejoiced with the mother in the piety of her sons, she prayed to the goddess that her choicest bless ings might descend upon them. Then followed the sacrifice and festival, after which the young men retired to rest in the temple. They never rose again, but died in their sleep. Croesus could restrain his indignation no longer : Was he not second in happiness ? Were men of private station to be placed before the monarch of Lydia 1 Solon answered that the days of man are three-score years and The happy man. , . - . - , P , ten, and in this long lapse of time there is no certainty that to-morrow will be as to-day. Life is a \" chap ter of accidents.\" \"I see that your wealth is great,\" he continued, \" and that you are lord over many subjects ; but I cannot call you by the title you claim, till I know whether your life has ended happily. The wealthy man is not happier than he who has sufficient for the day, unless it be his for tune to end his life in prosperity. Wealth is not happiness. It enables us to satisfy desires, or support calamities ; but a prosperous man has no need of it, for he is untouched by disease or disaster, and his children grow up round him. If such a man end his life as he began it, he may justly be accounted happy.\" The calamitous fall of Croesus was a signal proof of the wisdom of Solon's words.1 26. In a similar spirit the Greeks could tell of other famous men with whom the great Athenian was brought into con tact. When occupied with the reform of the constitution, Solon and he was visited by Anacharsis of Scythia, who Anacharsis. announced his desire to become Solon's friend and guest. Solon replied that \" it was better to make friends at home.\" \" In that case,\" required Anacharsis, \" do you, who 1 Herod, i. 29 ff."], [445, "XIII. 26] SOLON AND THALES. 427 are at home, make me your friend.\" Solon was pleased with the retort, and for a time entertained him hospitably. Anacharsis, on inquiring into Solon's occupation, thought it absurd that laws, which he compared to spiders' webs, could restrain men from wrong and injustice if they had the power to break them. Solon, in answer, pointed to the respect for law which binds men to fulfil contracts even to their own disadvantage. The issue proved that Anacharsis formed a truer estimate of Athenian character than Solon.1 On another occasion Solon is said to have visited Thales, the philosopher of Miletus, to whom the tripod, which the Delphian oracle had assigned \" to the wisest,\" soion and had been returned after passing through the Thales. circle of the Seven Sages. Thales was a bachelor, upon which Solon rallied him. Upon this Thales disguised a man as a messenger recently come from Athens, and when Solon in quired the latest news, the supposed stranger replied that there was no news of importance except the public funeral of a youth, the son of one of the leading men in the state, who had been absent from his country for a long time. His name he could not remember, but he was a man distinguished for his wisdom and probity. Solon, with growing anxiety, pressed question after question, until at length he asked whether the young man was the son of Solon. The stranger replied that Solon was the father's name. Then Solon began to wail and lament for his son's death, until Thales checked him, saying that the story was his own invention. \" But now you know the reason,\" he added, \"why I have chosen to remain without wife or child.\" 2 27. It is doubtful whether anything was known of Solon a hundred years after his death, beyond his laws and con stitution, and the incidents and traits of char- Little known acter recorded in his poems. Herodotus tells of Solon us of the travels on which he went after his legislation, 1 Plut. Sol. 5. 2 Ibid. l.c. 6."], [446, "428 SOLONS CHARACTER. [XIII. 27. and his meeting with Philocyprus and Croesus. But the years of travel after the work of legislation is over are an incident common to Solon and Lycurgus, and the meeting with Croesus is a manifest fiction. The diligence of Plutarch has added nothing that can be called historical to the account of Herodotus. The interviews with Anacharsis and Thales are of the same fabulous nature as that with Croesus. How Solon attained his power, what was his real position towards the rich and the poor, and what were the circumstances which made his reforms possible \u2014 these are facts which no ancient author has made clear to us. His rise is explained by his success in the wars with Megara and Crisa, though it is obvious that neither of these was brought to a success ful issue till the Seisachtheia was passed, and the reforms concluded ; nor is there a word in Solon's poems which leads us to suppose that he was a great general. Though we cannot recover the details of Solon's life, we have the means of tracing an outline of his character. Like His character Archilochus, Theognis, Alcaeus and Sappho, seen in his he still lives in his poems. In these he poured poems. 0U\u00a3 thoughts which guided and sustained him in his arduous task, in these he sought recreation in lighter moments. But, whether grave or gay, the poems represent the man. In the political verses we observe his fearless criticism of the richer classes, his de- Political verse. ... , l i - nunciation of covetousness and greed, his sym pathy with the oppressed. Yet there is no attempt to rouse class against class. \" I gave the people such a measure of power as was enough, neither defrauding them, nor offering them more than their share. And for those who had influence and wealth I took care that they suffered no wrong. Over both I held a protecting shield, and allowed neither to encroach on the other.\" Had he followed the wishes of either party he would have been \" as a wolf among dogs.\" He rejected with scorn the suggestion that he should make himself tyrant of the city ; the position which he attained by his self-control was far higher. Later in life he urged his"], [447, "XIII. 27.] SOLON'S SEPTENNIADS. 429 citizens to be on their guard against Pisistratus, whose graciousness was only intended to lull them into a false security ; \" out of such a calm there must needs break a storm.\" For himself he desired prosperity and His thoughts a good name ; he would be the favourite of about wealth his friends and the dread of his enemies. Wealth is a blessing, but only when justly got, for justice is more abiding than riches. Zeus beholds all things, and sooner or later his sentence falls on the guilty. Men seek for wealth in their various professions and trades, but the end is hidden from all, and honesty remains the best policy. In another poem Solon divides the seventy years of life into periods of seven. In the first period the child has got his teeth ; in the second boyhood is passing The ten away ; in the third the hair is on the young Septenniads. man's lip ; in the fourth he is in the fulness of his bodily strength ; in the fifth it is time to marry and think of the generation to come ; in the sixth the mind begins to be stronger than the body ; in the seventh and eighth periods (between forty-two aud fifty-six) the intellect is at its best; at sixty-three age is coming on, and the powers of thought and speech are not what they were ; and if a man lives to the full term of seventy years death will not come on him before the time. Such was human life in the eyes of the wisest of the Athenians. It is a harmonious picture, broad in conception and calm in tone ; each period has its allotted joys and powers ; let not youth forestall age, or age regret youth, or the closing scene be troubled with idle wishes to outlive the appointed span. Take the goods which are provided ; rejoice in the strength of youth, be happy with wife and child, make merry with a friend or at a festival, listen to the teaching of years; if good changes to evil, evil changes to good ; the honest man has the gods on his side, and will not lose his reward.1 1 Solon, Frag. 5, 9, 13, 15, 20, 27 Bergk.

Far from conquering Tegea, they met with a severe defeat, many Spartans were captured, and the fetters, which they brought with them, were placed on the feet of the prisoners, whom the Tegeatae compelled to work on measured plots in their fields.

When Croesus, who ascended the throne of Lydia in 560 B.C., inquired at Delphi whom he should choose for an ally among the Greeks, he was directed to Sparta as the fore most city. Thither his envoys went, and they received a favourable answer, for Croesus had already won the good opinion of the Spartans by an act of great s ana . liberality. At this time gold was extremely croesusof rare in Greece, and when the Spartans required Lyd,a some for the statue of Apollo at Thornax, they sent to Lydia to purchase it. Croesus, however, would accept no payment, and gave them as much as they wanted. The alliance had not been long concluded when Croesus was besieged in Sardis by the Persians. He sent to the Spartans for aid, which they prepared to furnish ; but before the soldiers could be embarked the news came that Sardis had fallen, and help was useless.1 5. At this moment the Spartans were ill able to spare men for the assistance of a foreign ally. The old quarrel with Argos about the Thyreatis had broken out once more. The district was now, and had been for some time, in the hands of Sparta (sup-a, p. 232) but Argos, perhaps because she had no longer anything to fear from Periander or 0 1 /1 i_ Final contest Clisthenes, thought herself able to press her between Sparta claims to the disputed territory. In order to and *re\u00b0s for r . * the Thyreatis. avoid a general engagement, it was agreed that the matter should be decided by a contest betweeen three hundred combatants chosen from each side. The battle raged fiercely until three only of the six hundred were left : Alcanor and Chromius of the Argives, Othryadas of the Spartans. Night came on, and the Argives returned home in triumph. Meanwhile Othryadas spoiled the dead Argives of their weapons, which he carried to his camp, and remained on the field under arms. When the morning broke, the armies of both sides came to ascertain the result. Each claimed the victory ; the Argives maintaining that they had two survivors against one, the Spartans that their warrior was in possession 1 Herod, i. 69, 83. VOL.

In their distress they sent envoys to solicit the aid of Sparta.

On the voyage, it occurred to the Samians that they were sent as exiles rather than as auxiliaries. They returned and landed on Samos. But as Polycrates had effectually prevented the Samians in the island from rendering the least assistance by threatening to burn their wives and children (whom he had already placed in the docks for this purpose), the exiles were defeated and driven back to their ships. They now sailed to Laconia, and appeared before the authorities at Sparta, asking for assistance, and setting forth their wrongs, like Pythermus, in an elaborate speech. Once more the Spartans showed their dislike of The Samians eloquence. They bade the Samians put their ask help.. request into a briefer form ; they were unaccustomed to long speeches, and could not remember them. The next day the Samians appeared with an empty sack, and said, \" The sack needs meal.\" Even this speech the Spartans considered unnecessarily long ; for the mention of the Spartan assis sack might have been omitted. Nevertheless tance useless the request was granted, and a force was sent to Samos. Some successes were obtained, but they were fruitless. After forty days of siege, the enterprise was abandoned, and the Spartans returned home.1 7. By the end of the sixth century the position of Sparta as a leading state was clearly recognised. She became the head of a confederacy which, spartathe without being arranged on any formal basis, head of a was henceforth an established fact. On all hands the cities sought her alliance, either from fear or from policy. This was especially the case in the cities which had succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the tyrants, Corinth and Megara, inasmuch as the oligarchs, insecure in 1 A story was current at the expense of the Spartans, who had no gold and silver coinage, that Polycrates bought them off with coins of gilded lead.

Corinth was now controlled by a senate of joined by eighty members, chosen from the eight tribes Corinth (p. 392), under which the laws were well administered, if we may trust the praises bestowed by Pindar on the order and justice which prevailed in the city. But her empire had fallen with the fall of the Cypselids; as a military power she felt herself unable to stand alone, and in spite of the great interests which she had at stake, and the strength of her navy, Corinth never took an independent line in politics. She was content to follow the lead of Sparta, Argos, or Athens, as the development and protection of her commerce required. At Megara, in the party conflicts which followed the fall of Theognis, the aristocracy had been succeeded by a democracy which punished and impoverished its oppressors. This violence in time produced a reaction, which brought the oligarchs once more into power. By joining the city of Sparta, which now controlled the whole of the west and south of the Peloponnesus, the restored exiles were enabled to keep their opponents in check, and the alliance was the more necessary as democratic principles found support in the neighbouring city of Athens.1 8. Of the personal history of Anaxandridas and Ariston, whose reigns fall in the middle of the century, we know Anaxandridas nothing beyond the domestic complications of and his wives. wbich Herodotus has given such an amusing and graphic account.

The ephors, in alarm for the succession, bade him put her away and marry another woman, that the race of Eurysthenes might not perish, and when Anaxandridas refused to put away a wife against whom he had no cause of complaint, they bade him take a second in addition to the wife whom he already had. To this proposal he assented, and henceforth he kept two houses, an \" arrangement anything but Spartan.\" Soon after her marriage his second wife bore him Cleomenes, who was her only child ; and after the birth of Cleomenes, the first wife, who had hitherto been bar ren, conceived, and bore three sons in succession : Dorieus, Leonidas, Cleombrotus. On the death of Anaxandridas, Cleomenes, as his eldest son, succeeded to the throne. Ariston, the contemporary monarch of the Eurypontid line, married a woman who, from being the ugliest child, became the greatest beauty of her time. She Ariston and had previously been the wife of Agetus, from the wife of whom Ariston gained her by an act of perfidious treachery. He had long been on terms of intimate friendship with Agetus, and, in remembrance of their mutual affection, he proposed that each should allow the other to choose what he liked best from his possessions. Agetus agreed to this, and chose what he wished from the possessions of Ariston, but when Ariston's turn came he chose the wife of Agetus\u2014 a request which was quite unexpected, for Ariston was already married to a second wife. Ariston however insisted on the terms of the agreement, and Agetus gave way. Ariston put away the wife he had, and took to his house the wife of Agetus. Hitherto he had been childless, but by this wife a son was born to him somewhat before the usual time. He happened to be sitting in the council chamber with the ephors, when a servant announced the child's birth. At the moment he repudiated the paternity in the hearing of those who sat with him, but afterwards he repented the rash exclamation, and acknowledged the child as his own. The name given to the son was Demaratus. The exclamation"], [456, "438 KING CLEOMENES\u2014 DORIEUS.

Another incident which occurred not long after the accession of Cleomenes was the visit of Maeandrius the Samian to Sparta. At the time when Polycrates, the Maeandrius tyrant of Samos, left the island on his fatal at sParta journey to Magnesia, Maeandrius had been put in charge of Samos, and after the death of Polycrates he became ruler of the city. \" It was his desire,\" Herodotus tells us, \" to be the most righteous of men, but he failed in the attempt.\" On hearing of the tyrant's death, he established an altar and con secrated a precinct to Zeus Eleutherius in the suburbs of Samos. Then he gathered together the Samians, and ex pressed his willingness to lay down the power with which he had been intrusted, if he might take six talents of the money of Polycrates, and retain the priesthood of Zeus Eleutherius as an hereditary honour in his own family. This condescen sion met with a most ungracious response. \"You rule over us, a base-born wretch, and worthless as base ! Better give an account of the money in your hands ! \" \u2014 Troubles at such was the answer of Telesarchus. Maean- tn^eatn of drius, perceiving that if he ceased to be tyrant Polycrates. some other Samian would seize the prize, withdrew into the Acropolis ; and, sending for his opponents one by one on the pretext of giving in his accounts, he put them in chains. Sub sequently he fell sick. In the impression that he would not recover, his brother Lycaretus put all the prisoners to death in order to secure his own passage to the throne. Such was the position of affairs, when the Persians appeared on the island to restore Syloson, the brother of Polycrates, to the throne, by command of Darius. The Samians made no resistance whatever to the invaders. Maeandrius and his supporters agreed to leave Samos, and though his departure was not without danger, owing to the treachery of a half witted brother, which greatly incensed the Persians, he 1 Herod, v. 42 ff.

The Spartans, who accepted the command of the oracle in good faith, at length sent an expedition against Athens under Anchimolius to carry it out, but the attempt entirely failed, owing to the efficient assistance rendered by the Thessalian horse to the Pisistratidae. A second army, which was despatched under the command of Cleomenes, was more successful. The Thessalians were defeated, Hippias and his party were shut up in the Acropolis, and after a few days' siege a happy accident put the children of the besieged in the power of the Spartans.

It was not long before the part which the Alcmaeoni dae had taken in influencing the responses sent from Delphi to the Lacedaemonians became known at Sparta. It was now remembered that the Pisistratidae had always been the friends of Sparta, and that the Athenians since their libera tion had exhibited no feelings of respect or gratitude.

Certain oracles also, collected by the Pisistra tidae, which Cleomenes had brought away from the Acropolis, informed them that Athens, when free, would be a far more dangerous neighbour than Athens under a tyranny. They resolved to invade Attica, and this time with the avowed intention of restoring a tyrant. The allies were summoned 1 Herod, v. 62 ff.,69 ff."], [460, "SPARTA &y PLATAEA\u2014 INVASION OF ARGOS.

At some time when Cleomenes was in the neighbour hood of their city, the Plataeans, who suffered from the piataea and oppression of the Thebans, came to him, and Sparta. expressed a wish to put themselves under the protection of Sparta. Cleomenes pointed out that they were at a great distance from Sparta, and that Plataea might be enslaved several times over before the news could reach the Eurotas ; it would be better to apply to the Athenians, who were close at hand.

While admiring the loyalty of the Erasmus in refusing to betray his citizens, Cleomenes resolved that the Argives should not escape. He returned to Thyrea, and after propitiating the sea with the sacrifice of a bull, crossed with his troops in Sicyonian and Aeginetan vessels to Nauplia. The Argives came down to meet him, and the two armies lay opposite each other near Tiryns, at a place called Sepea. The Argives had been warned against a surprise, and, in order to guard themselves, they arranged their move ments by those of the enemy ; whatever com- severe defeat mand the Spartan herald proclaimed to his the Argives. troops was equally obeyed by them. On perceiving this, Cleomenes bade his men seize their arms and attack the Argives when the herald gave the sign for the morning meal. The attack was of course unexpected ; many of the Argives were slain, and many were driven into the sacred grove of Argus, where they were surrounded by the Spartans. Having ascertained the names of the fugitives from some Argives who had deserted to him, Cleomenes sent a herald, and summoned them, one by one, giving the name, and announcing that the usual ransom of two minae had been paid. In this manner about fifty men were induced to leave the shelter of the grove, though each was immediately put to death, for the grove was so thick that those within it tJ\u00b0sm,h\"eGroave could not see the fate of their comrades.' At of Argus, but length, one of the fugitives climbed up a tree \u00a3**\u00b0 and ascertained the truth. It was now useless to summon any more ; Cleomenes therefore bade his helots pile fagots round the grove and set it on fire. While it was burning he asked to whom the wood was sacred, and on hearing that it was the grove of Argus, he became aware that the oracle had deceived him. The Argus which he had captured was not the Argos which he had hoped to capture. He at once dismissed the greater part of his army, retaining only a thousand of the best soldiers, with whom he went to sacrifice at the great temple of Hera.

He defended himself by affirming that the oracle which had been vouchsafed to him had been fulfilled by the Cleomenes tried capture of the grove, and proceeded to relate and acquitted. what had occurred at the Heraeum. When he was sacrificing there a flame shot forth from the breast of the statue, which convinced him that he had gained all the success which the goddess was willing to grant, for if the utter destruction of the city had been intended, the flame would have appeared from the head. This explanation the Spartans considered to be satisfactory, and Cleomenes was acquitted.2 15. Another incident of the reign of Cleomenes was the arrival at Sparta of a number of Scythian envoys. Darius, cleomenes and the Persian king, had invaded Scythia; and the Scythians, the Scythians, eager to revenge themselves upon him, sent to Spiarta with a view to an alliance and a concerted attack upon Persia.

We have now reached the period at which Arista goras arrived at Sparta, in the hope of inducing the state to join in the Ionic revolt, and the history of Sparta, as of Greece generally, becomes a part of the Persian Great position Invasion. From the middle of the sixth cen- of Sparta. tury Sparta had been steadily gaining in power, and at the end of it she was acknowledged on all hands to be the foremost state in Greece. Already enriched by the conquest of Messenia and the extension of her borders towards Arcadia, the humiliation of Argos and the extinction of the tyrants of Corinth and Sicyon left her without a rival in the Peloponnesus. At the same time her severe discipline and martial training probably gave rise to an exaggerated idea of her power. We do not know how large an army she could put into the field ; but, even if other states could provide more men, Sparta could send better soldiers. At Plataea her contingent amounted to 5000 Spartan hoplites, an equal number of heavy armed Lacedaemonians, and not less than 40,000 light-armed; for, in addition to her own citizens, she could assemble the perioeci and the helots, though it must be said of the last that if armed they were a source of danger, and if unarmed of comparatively little efficiency. Besides her own forces, Sparta was at the head of a great confederacy. Unfortunately we have not sufficient evidence to allow us to state precisely who the con- The Spartan federates were, or the relation in which Sparta Confederacy. stood to them. We have seen that the Corinthians and Megarians looked to her for support ; Sicyon and Aegina fur nished ships for the invasion of Argolis, and the Tegeatae served as a part of the Spartan army. We may also assume that Phlius and Epidaurus were \" allies \" of Sparta. In some 1 Herod, vi. 84."], [464, "THE DUAL MONARCHY.

Nevertheless Sparta was much at the mercy of the other states of the Peloponnesus. They had the power to reject her proposals, and annihilate schemes which she had greatly at heart. We do not indeed hear of any formal arrangements by which it became confederacy a necessary to consult the states which furnished check on Sparta. soldiers to the Spartan kings, but the failure of the expedition against Athens was not likely to be for gotten. In the next century, when we are able to collect more evidence of the nature of the Spartan confederacy, we shall see that a new line of policy was never adopted without previous consultation of the allies, though the final decision seems to have rested with the Spartan Assembly. Another source of weakness was the double monarchy. When Demaratus decided for the Corinthians against weakness of Cleomenes, the invasion of Attica was at once the double rendered impossible. Herodotus informs us monarc y. \\}&zX in consequence of this quarrel it became a law at Sparta that the two kings should never go out together on any expedition. This was certainly the rule at a later time, but it is doubtful when it came into force.

They were"], [465, "XIV. 17- ] KINGS AND EPHORS\u2014 LITERATURE. 447 generals for life, or, speaking more strictly, so long as they satisfied the demands of the state. Even over so vigorous a commander and so headstrong a man as Cleomenes the state was supreme. Not only was he put on his trial for his failure at Argos, but he subsequently left Sparta to avoid a similar danger. Leotychidas, the successor of Demaratus, ended his life in exile under a judicial sentence. Yet at the beginning of the reign of Cleomenes, so far as we can tell, the two kings, when unanimous, were supreme in foreign policy. They could march out whenever they chose, and no Spartan could prevent them, on pain of the public curse. In domestic matters they were under more restraint. Though released from the training, the king lived the common life, and was expected to consult the good of the community even in his private affairs. As the power of the kings gradually declined, that of the ephors increased. In the administration of the state they held the foremost place ; they could banish \u25a0 r .

The next the Ephors. century will supply instances in which their authority became as great in the control of the foreign policy of Sparta as it already was over the internal government of the city and the domestic life of the citizens. 17. While attaining this high position in politics and the field, Sparta either remained stationary in other respects or fell behind. The sixth century was remarkable for the growth of literature in Hellas. It is true that no poet of this period was ever placed on a level with Homer, or perhaps with Archilochus ; yet elegy flourished, and s^^ lyric song attained an unique excellence in the her position Aeolic poets, philosophical thought found ex- ,onfltehtete7sorld pression in the Ionian, Pythagorean and Eleatic schools, the foundations of science and history were laid, and dramatic poetry was attracting attention. In this intellectual stir and spring Sparta took no part. In the seventh century she had been the centre of literature, so far as there was a"], [466, "LACONIAN WIT\u2014 SPARTAN VIRTUES. [XIV. 17. 448 literature in Greece at the time \u2014 the chosen home of poets aud musicians. Terpander, Tyrtaeus and Alcman had largely contributed to shape the education and form the temper of her citizens. Now all was changed. Her solitary repre sentative in the realms of thought was Chilon, whom we may regard as a man of great practical wisdom, but of whom nothing remains or is recorded beyond a few aphorisms and a short poem. Sparta had acquired as much literature as she needed, and she left it to others to attract the minstrels and singers of the new generation. We may even venture to doubt whether the warriors whose obedience to law was the wonder of the world could read and write ! Brevity and ex- Brevity and pressiveness were the tradition of Sparta, where wit at Sparta. the eloquence of the Phocaean Pythermus was as ineffectual as his purple robe. Plutarch \u2014 if it be Plutarch \u2014 has preserved for us a collection of apophthegms ascribed to illustrious Spartans, which are read with greater interest than pleasure, as less remarkable for wit than plainness of speech. But, however low the estimate we have to place upon their intellectual, and in some respects upon their moral virtues, the Spartans were a tower of strength to Hellas. They lived for the state, and not for themselves. They set the example, for the first time in the history of the world, of military discipline which recognises the word of command as beyond dispute, and of courage which prefers death to flight. At the time when the conflict between tyrannies and oligarchies, oligarchies and demo cracies, was raging round her with terrible ferocity and most disastrous results, Sparta remained without change ; her firm government, supported by the martial virtues of her citizens, rendered inestimable services to the cause of freedom. The chronology of the reign of Cleomenes is very uncertain. Thucydides (iii. 68) tells us that the Plataeans had been allies of the Athenians 92 years at the destruction of the city in 427 b.c. This gives 519 B.C. for the commencement of the alliance, which took place in the reign of Cleomenes (Herod, vi. 108), who must therefore have been on the throne at this time. (Grote contests this date on the"], [467, "XIV. l8.] CHRONOLOGY OF CLEOMENES' REIGN. 449 ground that Cleomenes was not in Northern Greece before 510 or 509 B.C., and with this I agree (see p. 474). The death of Cleomenes occurred at the time when Darius was making preparations for reveng ing himself on the Athenians, and apparently after the disaster of Mardonius in 492 b.c, but before the battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. (Herod, vi. 85, 94). This allows a reign of thirty years for Cleomenes (which seems to contradict the expression of Herodotus, v. 48: ov yap riva noXXbv xpovov rjp^e 6 KXeopevns, but see Stein's note). As to the events which occurred in his reign, the colonies of Dorieus must be put at the beginning (yet if Dorieus took part in the destruction of Sybaris, his second attempt at colonisation cannot be earlier than 510 B.C.) ; the visit of Maeandrius took place not long after the death of Polycrates, i.e. not long after 521 B.C. ; the restoration of the Alcmaeonidae and the expulsion of the Pisistratidae, about 510 B.C. ; the visit of- the Scythians took place some time after the invasion of Scythia by Darius in 516 \u2014 513 B.C. The date of the invasion of Argos is very doubtful. Pausanias (iii. 4. I) puts it immediately after the accession of Cleomenes. But in Herod, vii. 148, the Argives in 4S0 B.C. say that they have recently suffered a severe defeat. Hence Clinton brings the Argive war down to 510 b.c. ; Grote and Stein to 495 B.C. The Tiryuthians appear at Plataea in 479 B.C. : we may suppose that they were the SovXoi who had been driven out of Argos by the younger generation, which had grown up after the defeat by Cleomenes. If we allow twenty years for this, we get 479 + 20 for the defeat, i.e. about 500 B.C. With their expelled SovXoi still unsubdued, the Argives might plead that they could not spare men to fight the Persians. But how this plea is consistent with the fact that in 490 B.C., or soon after, a thousand volunteers went from Argos to aid the Aeginetans against Athens, it is difficult to say (Herod, vi. 92). The oracle (Herod, vi. 19, 77) given to Miletus and Argos in common would come more naturally after the outbreak oi the Ionic revolt.

Though he removed the worst evils which arose from the inequality of property in Attica by for bidding the sale of debtors into slavery, the inequality still remained. The poor citizens were still poor, in spite of the Seisachtheia, and the reform of the constitution. At the same time the admission of the lowest class in the scale of property to the rights of Athenian citizenship, and the authority given to the General Assembly, had thrown a power into the hands of the masses, which filled the more conser vative citizens with resentment and alarm. And so the old party quarrels, which had divided Attica before the reforms of Solon, reappeared after them with even greater violence. The men of the plain were led by Miltiades, a grandson of the tyrant of Corinth, and Lycurgus, the son of Aristolaidas ; the men of the shore by Megacles, the Alcmaeonid, who had recently strengthened the position of his family by his mar riage with Agariste, the daughter of Clisthenes of Sicyon. At the head of the mountaineers stood Pisistratus, a de scendant of the royal stock of Nestor, who, as we have seen, had greatly distinguished himself in the Salaminian war. As he possessed property in the neighbourhood of Marathon,"], [469, "XV. 2.] RENE WED PAR TY FE UDS AT A THENS. 451 Pisistratus may have been intimately known to the inhabit ants of the adjacent hills.1 2. It was a defect in Solon's constitution that it made personal attendance at Athens necessary for the effectual exercise of citizenship. In the Assembly the people were supreme ; but it was difficult for failure of the people to meet in the Assembly. For Solon's con citizens of the poorer classes who worked on their own small plots of land, any regular attendance was impossible. Still less could they come forward as members of the council, or take an active part in the administration of politics. We do not know whether Solon divided the council into sections, each of which was to remain at Athens for a specified time as a standing committee ; but on any system a councillor would be kept in the city for at least one month of the twelve, and if the management of affairs was not to fall into the hands of a clique, frequent attendance of all the members would be required. Under such conditions the country farmer, even if he possessed the necessary qualifi cation, found political life impossible, and when it became clear to him that he was being governed by those who had more leisure than himself, he began to look with suspicion on the Solonian reforms. What was the value of institu- 1 Plut. Sol. 29. 10. The Berlin Fragments of Aristotle inform us that Damasias, who had been elected archon, held office (?) two years, and was then forcibly expelled. The archons were then elected as follows ; four from the Eupatridae, three from the Apoikoi, and two from the Demiurgi ; and these were the archons in the year after Damasias. At this time the archonship was the chief bone of con tention between the parties in the state. The fragment goes on to speak of the cancelling of debts and of quarrels arising out of poverty. The uncertainty of the readings in the Fragments and of the order of the pieces render their evidence of little value. We cannot decide whether Damasias is the archon of 639 B.C., or of 586 b.c. If the first be meant, Plutarch's account of the reforms of Solon is inexplic able ; if the second, the reforms were found to be insufficient within eight years from Solon's archonship (cf.

The merchant had a career open to him ; a fortunate venture would at once enable him to rise in the world, and enjoy the leisure necessary for the administration of the offices now placed within his reach, but such a prospect only increased the discontent of those to whom it was denied. 3. Solon watched the failure of his hopes with the deepest distress. He endeavoured to recall the leaders of the con- Soion's op- tending parties to a sense of their duty to the position to country, and to soothe the bitterness of their pisistratus. followers. With a true instinct he regarded Pisistratus as by far the most dangerous of the three. Pisi stratus was an approved general, and the faction which he led was composed of poor men who had nothing to lose ; Megacles and Lycurgus were at the head of parties with a great stake in the country. If they succeeded, the worst result would be a return to an oligarchy either of birth or of wealth, but the course of Greek politics had already shown what aims the aristocratical leader of a popular party set before him. By playing the part of the people's friend, Cypselus, the Bacchiade, had become tyrant of Corinth, and Theagenes tyrant of Megara. Thirty years previously, in a time of a national distress, Solon had attracted public attention by an elegiac poem. He repeated the attempt now. A fragment of the verses has been preserved, in which he warns his countrymen against the flattery of a smooth tongue : \" Fools, ye are treading in the footsteps of the fox ; can ye not read the hidden mean ing of these winning words ? \" l The attempt was in vain. Pisistratus met the vehement expressions of Solon by driv- 1 Sol. Frag. 11 B."], [471, "XV. 4.] PISISTRATUS TYRANT OF ATHENS. 453 ing wounded into the market-place. The people's friend had suffered in the people's cause ; his life was in danger. The incident roused the Athenians to an unusual exercise of political power. Without any previous discussion in the Council, a decree was passed by the people allowing Pisistratus to surround himself with allowed a body a body-guard of fifty men, and to arm them guard; hebe with clubs. Thus protected, he threw off all disguises, and established himself in the Acropolis as tyrant of Athens.1 4. Of the party-leaders who had opposed Pisistratus, Lycurgus and Megacles departed from Athens ; Miltiades and Solon remained in the city. Though he Miltiades at continued to enjoy the influence which was Athens* due to his wealth and birth, Miltiades was, of course, with out any power in the state ; a member of one of the oldest and greatest Athenian families, he was compelled to look idly on, while Pisistratus administered affairs at his own absolute discretion. In his disgust at his position, he was the more inclined to accept an invitation which came to him about this time (560 B.C.) from an unexpected quarter. As he was sitting in the portico of his house, he caught sight of a number of men, whom their dress showed to be strangers, passing along the Sacred Way. He offered them the shelter and hospitality which in the heroic age it had been the first duty of a Greek chieftain to extend to an alien. They proved to be Doloncians from the Thracian Chersonese, who finding themselves unable to resist the incursions of their northern neighbours, the Apsinthians, had applied to Delphi for advice. The god bade them choose a Hellene to lead their forces, and when they inquired more precisely about the manner in which their choice should be determined, they were bidden to offer the post to the man who should first show them hospitality after they left the temple. They offered it to Miltiades, who consulted the oracle at Delphi, 1 Herod, i. 59 ; Plut. Sol. 30."], [472, "MILTIADES\u2014 DEATH OF SOLON.

Pisistratus not only allowed him to remain at Athens undisturbed, but attempted to win him over to the altered position of affairs. The aged law giver remained obdurate. He refused to be reconciled to the tyrant who had enslaved Athens, and withdrew into privacy till his death, which must have taken place not long after the usurpation of Pisistratus. The story was told, and believed by Aristotle, that after his death, his ashes were scattered over the island of Salamis, that no one might collect and remove them from the land which he had chosen to be the place of his burial.2 5.

When Lycurgus and Megacles once more united their forces, Pisistratus was unable to resist the combina- pisistratus tion, and found it necessary to leave the city, expelled. Whether he was driven out of the country, we are not in formed ; he may have retired to his estates in the neighbour hood of Marathon, where he would be surrounded by his party and safe from attack. 6. The coalition formed against him did not last. After the lapse of about four years, Lycurgus and Megacles quarrelled. We may conjecture that the Alcmaeonids had not forgotten the sentence passed upon them by the aristo cratic party in the matter of the Cylonian atrocity, and that the aristocrats were jealous of the power of the wealthy and ambitious family which owed so much to the tyrants of Sicyon and Sardis. Whatever the cause, Megacles now offered to support Pisistratus in returning to pisistratusand Athens, and the interests of the two leaders Megacles were to be consolidated by the marriage of uni e' Pisistratus with the daughter of Megacles. The offer was accepted. The combination of the two parties was strong enough to disarm all resistance, but it was necessary to veil the personal motives which had caused the opposing elements to unite. A plan was invented for giving a divine sanction to the return of the tyrant, which, though Herodotus regards it as an instance of barbarian simplicity discreditable to cultivated Greeks, and most of all to Athenians, was eminent!)' successful.

The proclamation was obeyed, and Pisistratus became a second time tyrant of Athens.1 When established on the throne, Pisistratus went so far in fulfilling his engagement with Megacles that he married his daughter. But his sons by an earlier union, Hippias and Hipparchus, were by this time grown up, and as he had no intention of disinheriting them in favour of any child which might be born from this second marriage, he gave his young wife no hope of offspring. As soon as this came to the know ledge of Megacles, he was greatly enraged at the insult offered to his daughter, and at the failure of his hopes of securing Pisistratus is the tyranny for his family. He renounced all again expelled, connection with Pisistratus and returned once more to his old associates, the men of the plain.

His influence with the poorer population of Attica was probably as great as ever, and he was now in a position which enabled him to assume an independent attitude towards other powers. By some means which we cannot explain, he not only induced the Thebans to supply him with money, but also acquired possessions in Thrace on the Strymon, from which he derived a considerable revenue, and from these resources he was able to maintain a troop of mercenaries, which he engaged from Argos. Meanwhile he was encouraged and supported in his 1 Herod, i. 60. - Ibid. i. 61 ; vi. 121."], [475, "XV. 8.] PISISTRATUS' THIRD TYRANNY. 457 design by Lygdamis of Naxos, who like himself had retired to Eretria with his adherents after a fruitless endeavour to found a tyranny in his own city.

Such extraordinary negligence is perhaps to be explained by the jealousy of the rival parties, which, while they combined against the common foe, retained so much of their old animosity, that each was not displeased to see a power at hand which could certainly prevent the other from becoming dominant. 8. When at length the long-delayed opportunity came, Pisistratus crossed over to Marathon, and there encamped with his adherents round him. The Athenians now took alarm, and at once marched out to oppose him. The two armies met at Pellene. Whatever the relative strength of the forces may have been, the commanders of the Athenians were no match for Pisistratus in strategy. He had himself led an Athenian army, and knew that it was the habit of the soldiers, when in camp, to rest or amuse themselves after the morning meal. Selecting this moment for his attack, he suddenly threw his mercenaries on the enemy. The scattered and disorganised forces of the Athenians fled at the first onset, but as an indiscriminate slaughter would have embittered the feelings of those over whom he wished to rule, Pisistratus bade his sons ride after the He returns for fugitives, calm their fears, and assure them the third time. that no harm would happen to them.1 No further resistance was offered.

[XV. 9. city, and from the other leading families which chose to remain at Athens, or were unable to escape, Pisistratus took four hundred hostages as security for their submission. He also retained a number of his Argive mercenaries in his service as a bodyguard. Thus for the third time he became tyrant of Athens, winning the throne on this occasion, not by fraud or collusion, but by open force. 9. In spite of the hatred which the name of Pisistratus excited in democratic Athens, it is clear from the evidence of Herodotus and Thucydides that the city prospered under his rule. At home and abroad there was peace, broken only by Pisistratus an unimportant war with Mitylene for the and sigeum. possession of Sigeum, if such a war took place. For though it is certain that Pisistratus established his natural son Hegesistratus at Sigeum, it is doubtful whether Herodotus is not mistaken in asserting that the son had to maintain his position by force of arms against Mitylene. The war which broke out between Mitylene and Athens was brought to a conclusion by the decision of Periander of Corinth, who assigned Sigeum to the Athenians. Periander died in 585 B.C., and therefore the statement of Herodotus cannot be true unless we suppose that the city had been subsequently lost to the Mitylenaeans, and had now to be reconquered by the Athenians. This is not very probable. After the subjugation of the Anatolian coast by Cyrus, Sigeum could not belong to Athens or to Mitylene, except in name. If not actually acquired by the Persian king, it was in his power, and the tyrant of Sigeum, equally with the other tyrants in the Asiatic cities, was a vassal of Persia. And in this fact we may find the key to the situation. Pisistratus sent his son to Sigeum \u2014 perhaps against the wishes of the Mitylenaeans, who perceived his intentions, and were jealous of them \u2014 not because he wished to establish him in an independent principality, but in order that he might be brought into contact with the Persians. Subsequent events proved the wisdom of the plan. When the Pisistratidae were expelled from Athens, they retired to"], [477, "XV. 10.] ADMINISTRATION OF PISISTRATUS. 459 Sigeum, and thence entered into communication with Darius, in order to obtain his help in their restoration.1 10. The friendly ties which Pisistratus had contracted, when in exile, with Argos and Thebes were doubtless drawn still closer after his usurpation, and even the more distant countries of Thessaly and Macedonia were connection with invited to enter into alliance with the Argos, Thessaly monarch of Athens. When the Spartans and Ma\"donia. first attempted to expel Hippias, they were defeated by the Thessalian cavalry, which came to his aid, and after his final expulsion, a home was offered to him both in Macedonia (at Anthemus) and in Thessaly (at Iolcus). These relations with the north of Greece probably stood in some kind of con nection with the acquisition of those domains on the Strymon, from which Herodotus informs us that the tyrant derived a part of his revenue.2 One of the first acts of Pisistratus after his restoration was the establishment of Lygdamis on the throne of Naxos, and when Lygdamis in turn aided Polycrates in Alliesand acquiring and maintaining his power in Samos, friends of the Aegean was controlled by men who were PislsXTatus pledged to support a tyrant's rule. He was also on very friendly terms with Sparta, for though his obligations to Argos were great he did not go so far in requiting her services as to assist her against Sparta ; and, if at Athens he had crushed the oligarchs whom Sparta favoured, he allowed the democracy, which Sparta hated, no opportunity of rising to power. By this policy and these alliances his position was firmly established from without, and at the same time he secured himself from domestic attack, partly by placing the four hundred children, whom he had taken as hostages from his opponents, with Lygdamis at Naxos, and partly by 1 Herod, v. 94, 95. 2 Ibid i 64 While agreeing in all that Mr. Grote urges against the possession of property on the Strymon by Pisistratus, I cannot think that his rendering of the words of Herodotus (vol. m, 92, n. 2) is tenable."], [478, "460 ADMINISTRATION OF PISISTRATUS.

In order to provide means for the payment of these, and for all other expenses of war and peace, he appropriated to his own use the ordinary revenues of Athens, no less than the rents of the silver mines at Laurium, and even imposed a tax of 5 per cent, on the produce of the land. This tax was afterwards regarded as an instance of tyrannical oppression, but taxation was certainly a more just and equitable method of raising money than the ordinary Athenian system, by which the expenses of the fleet fell almost exclusively on the rich. If the poorer citizens complained that they were taxed at all, the richer escaped a disproportionate burden, and Pisistratus was so far the gainer that the entire control of the fleet (if the trierarchies were for the time abolished) was now in his own hands.1 II.

More especially did he aim at diminishing the population of the city and increasing that of the country ; his own adherents were the shepherds and herdsmen of Attica, and he was aware that the dangerous democratic spirit which dethrones tyrants is nursed in cities, not in fields.

There were times when the spirit of the Athenian people reached a nobler prosperity of height, but we may doubt whether there was Attica at this ever a period when Attica enjoyed greater prosperity than during the reign of Pisistratus. Yet the historian is justified in speaking of the nation as held down and dispersed by the Pisistratids : the spirit of freedom was sternly repressed as intolerable to tyrants ; the leaders who could have given effect to that spirit were exiles in distant lands.1 12. The tyrants in the earlier half of the century, Clisthenes of Sicyon and Periander of Corinth, had shown themselves very zealous in the worship of the gods. Pisi stratus followed in their steps.

It was the chief festival of Athens ; the Great Panathenaea.1 Though it never reached the eminence of the national games, it was a point of union for all the Athenians, a scene of splendour and magnificence which was worthy of the city of Pallas. Equal attention seems to have been paid to the worship of Dionysus. The god of the vine was the god of the rustic population, in whose honour they celebrated their harvest festivals, and in Attica he was specially worshipped in the deme of Icaria, not far from Marathon ; he was thus in a particular manner the deity of the hill people, who had so long and faithfully supported the tyrant. To the festivals at which the bounty of the god was celebrated at Athens, the Lenaea and An- thesteria, Pisistratus may have added a third \u2014 the city-Dionysia, which in time was destined to eclipse the rest. That he favoured the dramatic representa tions so inseparably connected with the worship of Dionysus may be inferred from the success which Thespis of Icaria achieved about this time, by coming forward as an actor, and personating character \u2014 thus laying the foundation of that drama, which equally on its serious and its comic side became in the next century the most splendid memorial of Athens. Plutarch tells us that Solon was induced by his love of learning to be present at a performance given by Thespis. When it was ended he sent for Thespis, and asked him whether he was not ashamed to tell such monstrous lies before so large an audience ; Thespis answered that he saw no harm in what he had said or done ; \" it was mere amusement.\" \" Amusement,\" cried the old man, smiting heavily with his staff on the ground \u2014 \"if these are our amusements, we shall 1 Schol.

Even in the days of Solon, as we have said, the need was felt of some form of doctrine which should carry men beyond the limits of their earthly existence, Mystic power or relieve them from the oppressive sense of of worship. guilt which was the necessary concomitant of the growing elevation of the moral sense. The demand was quickly met. Epimenides, with whose aid the public distress created by the Cylonian atrocity had been removed, was followed by a host of imitators, \"Orphics and Bacchics, and Pythagoreans,\" whose labours were principally directed to three ends : \u2014 (1) the creation of a mystic religion, accompanied by a ritual more or less elaborate, by purification, abstinence, and other forms of asceticism, unknown to the earlier Greeks ; (2) the composition of a number of poems, chiefly fathered on Orpheus, developing the myth of Dionysus Zagreus, who having been torn to pieces by the Titans was re-begotten by Zeus, and perhaps identifying this Dionysus with the Iacchus of the Eleusinian mysteries ; and (3) the collection or invention of \"oracles,\" which enabled the possessor to fore tell the future and shape his conduct in public or private by the knowledge thus acquired. The institution of an ascetic life is closely connected with the appearance of the Pytha goreans in the cities of Magna Graecia ; it was there carried to the greatest extent, and forms the chief feature in the domestic history of Croton and other towns. In Greece proper, among a number of \" mysteries,\" some The Eleusinian of which were perhaps relics of older forms of mysteries. faith, while others were introduced as the need of them was felt, the Eleusinian worship of Demeter and Persephone, the Madonna and Child of ancient Greece, began about this time to take the foremost place. We cannot describe the 1 Plut. Sol 29."], [482, "464 THE ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES. [XV. i3, ritual of the festival with accuracy ; what was seen was pro bably of more importance than what was heard or said. If in the best account which has been given of them, the rites appear to have been childish and absurd, we may indulge the reflection that all religious ceremonies, when the spirit in which they are instituted is forgotten, are without force and meaning. To the Greeks at any rate, the mysteries were often the foundation of brighter hopes, if they did not mark the beginning of a better life.1 Among the composers of Orphic poems, a place must be assigned to Onomacntus. Onomacritus, whom we know to have been retained in the service of the Pisistratidae. It was he who threw into its most popular form the story of Dionysus Zagreus, and we may with confidence ascribe to him and his associates a large part of the so-called Orphic literature. He also arranged the oracles of Musaeus, and for some time he was in disgrace with his employers, who had detected him in interpolating a forged oracle into the collection. When the . . . Pisistratidae retired to Persia, they took Ono- Prophecies and ' J predictions : macritus with them, and availed themselves of his somewhat equivocal talents in order to persuade Darius to undertake the cause of their restora tion. Those oracles which promised well for the Persians, he repeated ; what boded ill he concealed.2 Nor was this the only instance in which Pisistratus and his sons turned the current belief in oracles (which they may have shared) to a good account. It was on the advice of Amphilytus, the Acarnanian seer, that Pisistratus joined battle with the Athenians at Pellene, and when Hippias abandoned the Acropolis of Athens to Cleomenes, he was careful to leave behind a collection of oracles which went far to diminish the elation of the victorious Spartan (supra, p. 441 ).a 1 In the year 480 B.C., as many as 30,000 persons took part in the Eleusinian mysteries ; such at least is the inference to be drawn from Herod, viii. 65.

Of the public library which Pisistratus is said to have founded we have not, and never shall have, any trustworthy evidence. The story is, doubtless, a fiction of Library some Alexandrian grammarian, who ascribed Pisistratus. to the Athenian tyrant the love of books which distinguished the prince under whom he lived.1 A similar anachronism has given rise to the famous legend that Pisistratus caused the poems of Homer to be collected for the first time into the two epics in which we now read them, a task which was accom plished by a committee of four persons, Onomacritus (supra, p. 464), Zopyrus (of Heraclea), Orpheus (of n , V j -n \u25a0 i / 1 \u2022 i His supposed (Jroton), and Epiconcyius (a name which edition of seems to be a corruption of eViKuil/ kvkXos !) the Homeric That a committee should succeed in combining scattered ballads into epic poems, which are acknowledged masterpieces, would be a feat without a parallel in the history of literature ; and when the committee is composed of men otherwise almost unknown \u2014 with the exception of Onomacritus, a detected forger \u2014 it is impossible to accept the story without the most cogent evidence. But the evidence is by no means cogent. The earliest authority for the statement, to whom we can assign a date, is Cicero, who tells us that \" Pisistratus is said to have arranged the books of Homer, which were previously in disorder, in the sequence in which we now have them.\" This famous sentence, upon which the theory of the Pisistratean origin of the Iliad and Odyssey was first erected, is perhaps a translation, and not a very careful translation, of an epigram, which is almost certainly a forgery. In one of the \"Lives of Homer\" we are told that the followino- lines were written on the base of a statue set up in honour of Pisistratus at Athens : \u2014 Tpi's pie TvpavvevaravTa rooravraKis l\u00a3e8io>\u00a3ev Sijpos ' K0r)vaio,v Kai rpls einiydyero, 1 Aul.

It is highly improbable that a statue in honour of Pisistra tus ever existed at Athens, for even if one had been set up in the lifetime of the tyrants, it would not have remained after their fall. And if the statue had existed, this epigram could not have been written upon it. The lines are at once false in fact and improbable in sentiment. Pisistratus was not thrice expelled from Athens, and neither Pisistratus nor his friends could have thought it worth while to record on his statue as the crowning work of his tyranny the col lection of the Homeric poems, an encomium which can only have proceeded from a literary critic, or student of Homer. He re-arranged And lastly, even if the words represent a his the recitation of torical fact, they do not support the theory omenc poems, nas heen reared upon them. They tell us that Pisistratus \" collected Homer,\" which had previously been sung in disconnected pieces ; and the statement merely means that Pisistratus caused the poems to be sung continu ously, from end to end \u2014 not piecemeal, as the preference of the rhapsodist might suggest. Solon may have provided for the recitation of the Homeric poems at Athens ; Pisistratus may ha/e gone a step further in the same direction, making the recitation continuous, so that the whole of the poems were recited, not of course at one and the same performance, nor by the same person, but at the same festival, the Pan athenaea. The continuity of the poems was thus established, interpolations became less easy, and there was less fear that any part would perish. This is as much as can be ascribed on this evidence to Pisistratus. There is no trace in antiquity of a Pisistratean text of Homer ; and Aristotle, who re peatedly quotes the poems of Homer, and criticises them, never mentions Pisistratus in connection with the authorship. Had he been aware of the Pisistratean origin of the Iliad and"], [485, "XV. IS-] PISISTRATUS' DEATH\u2014 HIPPIAS' TYRANNY. 467 Odyssey, he must have mentioned the fact, when calling atten tion to the superior unity of these poems in comparison with the Cyclic epics, which were the work of single and individual authors.1 15. Pisistratus remained in undisturbed possession of the throne till his death in 527 B.C. He was succeeded by his eldest son Hippias, with whom Hipparchus Death of and Thessalus, his younger sons, were associated Pisistratus. in the government. The brothers had stood beside their father in the years of exile ; it was in fact due to the advice of Hippias that Pisistratus resolved upon a last attempt to recover the throne of Athens. They were now men of experience, in the prime of life. For a time they conducted affairs as Pisistratus had done before them ; they were wise and moderate, careful of their money, and zealous in the worship of the gods. They also sought to make Athens the home of wit and literature. Lasus of Hermione and Simonides of Ceos now resided in the city, and Hipparchus sent a ship to convey Anacreon from Samos to Athens.2 The political connections into which Pisistratus had entered were maintained : Hippias was on excellent terms with the Aieuadae of Thessaly and with Amyntas the king of Macedon. To all appearance the tyranny was as firmly established in the hands of Hippias as it had been in those of Pisistratus. But the dynasties of Greek tyrants never lasted. The oppression of the ruler was more keenly felt by the people as the evils from which he had delivered them Greek tyrannieS faded from remembrance. The sons of a never perma tyrant, born to the inheritance of a throne, forgot the arts by which their father had gained and secured the affections of the people. The oligarchs found more support in their desire to overthrow a tyrant than they could gain when attempting to establish the privileges of their own order. For these and other similar reasons a tyrant's power 1 Nutzhorn, Die Enstehungsweise, etc., p. 15 ff. ; Monro, Iliad, p. xxvi. f - Herod, vii. 6 ; Plat.

Jealousy and lust impelled The sons of them to actions which not only revived old Pisistratus. feelings of hostility among their political op ponents, but added to these an intense passion of hatred in the hearts of some of their subjects. Cimon, the half-brother of Miltiades, who had been banished from Athens by Pisistratus, was the owner of famous mares which were three times victorious in the chariot race at Olympia. On the second occasion, at the request of Pisistratus, he caused the tyrant to be proclaimed as the owner, and was in consequence allowed to return home. The third victory occurred after the death of Pisistratus. This proud distinction provoked the envy of Hippias and his brothers ; to be a victor in the chariot race at Olympia was to be known throughout Hellas as a man of wealth and posi tion. A wise ruler would regard the success and prosperity Hippias and of a subject as the best evidence of the mildness cimon. an(j justice of his rule. Hippias, on the con trary, regarded Cimon as a rival in distinction, and perhaps suspected him of designs against his throne. He caused him to be secretly assassinated. The body was buried in the \" Hollow,\" and over-against the tomb a grave was dug for the famous horses.1 16. The conduct of Hipparchus was even worse. Unable to induce Harmodius, a youth of the race of the Gephyreans, Hipparchus and to listen to his proposals, he revenged himself Harmodius. a pUblic insult to his sister. When arranging a procession, in which he had invited the maiden to take a part as a \" Basket Bearer,\" he rejected her as unworthy of a place, and declared that she had never been invited at all. Harmodius and his friend Aristogiton determined on revenge, and a conspiracy was formed to destroy the tyrants. Though the number of the conspirators was small, it was thought that the act would be well received, and command 1 Herod, vi. 103."], [487, "XV. i6.] HIPPARCHUS ASSASSINATED. 469 universal sympathy. The time selected for the attempt was the festival of the great Panathenaea. On this occasion it was the custom for the Athenians to appear with lance and shield, in order to take part in the procession, and the conspirators hoped that they might find support in the armed crowd against the soldiers of the tyrants. While Hippias, with his body-guard round him, was in the Ceramicus arranging the procession, Aristogiton and Harmodius, who, like the rest of the conspirators, had daggers concealed under their garments, watched him at a short distance, intending to attack him, To their alarm, they saw one of their fellow-conspirators enter into close conversation with the tyrant. They supposed that he was giving information of their plans. Begarding them selves and the rest of the conspirators as doomed, they deter mined to strike a blow before the fatal moment Murder of came. If Hippias was beyond their power, Hipparchus. they could still be revenged on Hipparchus, the immediate author of their disgrace. As they returned into the city they met him near the Leocorium, and without a moment's delay stabbed him to death. Harmodius was at once cut down by the guards in attendance, but Aristogiton escaped for a time.1 When Hippias was informed of his brother's death, he gave no outward sign of grief or alarm. He merely requested those Athenians who were standing near to put down their arms and follow him to an adjacent place. Such an order was not remarkable, for it was the custom of the Athenians to lay aside their arms when summoned to a meeting. Hippias at once directed his guards to seize the weapons. The citizens were then searched, and all who were found with concealed daggers were arrested. Erelong Aristogiton was discovered, and put to the torture, but he refused to disclose the names of his associates.2 Not even from his mistress Leaena, whom Hippias did not hesitate to torture also, could any 1 Thuc. vi. 54 ff.

He also depreciated the coinage, and allowed some of the richer men to purchase exemption from those state burdens which might fall upon them (514 B.C.).3 17. The oppressive measures of Hippias aroused new hopes in the breasts of those who longed for the expulsion of the The Aicmae- tyrants.

With this object in view the Alcmaeonids connected themselves closely with Delphi. When the temple was burnt down in 548 B.C., the Amphictyons decreed that it should be rebuilt out of funds to be provided by all Hellas. Not less than 300 talents were to be spent. (about \u00a370,000), of which the Delphians pledged themselves to find 75 talents.

Their offer being accepted, they displayed the greatest liber- 1 This story is perhaps apocryphal (Paus. i. 23. 2). 2 Herod, v. 55, 62 ; vi. 123 ; Thuc. vi. 53, 59. 3 Arist.

Instead of using ordinary limestone for the pronaos, as they were allowed to do by the terms of their contract, they built it of Parian marble. Such lavish expenditure in the decoration of the national sanctuary won for them a high reputation throughout Hellas. So far from being \"the accursed,\" they became conspicuous for piety, and the whole influence of the Delphic priesthood was on their side. Even the God himself took their part, and insisted on their restoration to Athens (supra, p. 440). 1 The Alcmaeonidae were now led by Clisthenes, the grand son of the tyrant of Sicyon, and the inheritor of his wealth. It was doubtless his foresight which brought i- i -i i \u00ab\u25a0 -i -i Clisthenes. about the connection of the exiled family with Delphi. His ancestors on either side had taken a leading part in the Sacred War to which Delphi owed her indepen dence. He was also aware that Sparta was hostile to the existence of tyrannies. She had recently expelled Lygdamis from Naxos, and restored the government of the island to the oligarchs. By the influence of Delphi \u2014 which was very great on the Eurotas \u2014 he might hope to induce Sparta to act in the removal of the Pisistratids. His means appear to have been placed beyond the reach of the Athenian tyrant. What ever property his family held in Attica must have been con fiscated at the return of Pisistratus ; but it was possible to store up funds in various temples, which in ancient Greece were often used as banks ; for no power, however great, could pillage a temple without incurring the guilt of sacrilege. l8. Thus Hippias found himself between an external danger, the magnitude of which he was too wise to under estimate, and a secret hatred of which he could Hippias and not ascertain the extent. He endeavoured to Aeantides. strengthen his position by marrying his daughter Archidice to Aeantides, the son of Hippoclus, the tyrant of Lampsacus, who at this time stood high in the favour of Darius,2 and his tyranny grew more and more oppressive.

But however popular their cause might be, they found themselves unable to make head against the tyrant's forces, and they were driven out with considerable loss.1 The Spartans now took up their cause.

When further delay became impossible they sent the force under Anchimolius to expel the tyrants from Attica (supra, 440). This was defeated, but a second expedition was more successful.

The people, in the free exercise of their rights, were the only secure defence of Athens against the factions of the noble families. With their aid the power of the privileged class must be broken beyond repair ; the city must be emancipated from those influences which had done so much to render the provisions of Solon ineffectual.1 Clisthenes endeavoured to realise these objects by reform ing the constitution in three directions.

But before his plans were matured, still less carried out, the aristocracy made an attempt to recover their isagoras and position. The party was at this time led by the aristocracy.

The Spartans and Isagoras were driven into the clisthenes Acropolis, and being unable to endure a siege, soon returns.

Hysiae and Oenoe fell into the hands of the Boeotians ; and the Chalci dians from Euboea effected a landing at Marathon (506 B.C. ?) Meanwhile Hippias was in Asia, endeavouring to obtain aid from Persia. So serious was the danger that the Athenians sent an embassy to Sardis, to ask for alliance with the Persian king. Artaphernes, the brother of Darius, who was at the time satrap of Sardis, agreed to grant the prayer of the envoys on the condition that earth and water were sent from Athens to the Great King, as a sign of submission. The terms were accepted, but they were at once repudiated by the Athenian people, who were greatly displeased at the conduct of their envoys. Only when it became known that the allies of Sparta would not join her in the attempt to restore the tyrants, was Athens free to deal with her enemies in the north. She then attacked the Boeotians, and severely defeated cieruchi at them. Seven hundred were brought as cap- chaicis. tives to Athens. On the same day the army crossed the strait and attacked the Chalcidians, and here also the Athenians were victorious. The city fell into their hands ; the oligarchical Hippobotae were deposed, and the rich Lelantian plain, so long the source of contention between Chalcis and Eretria, was divided among 4000 Athenian citizens. The seven hundred Boeotian prisoners were soon afterwards ransomed at two minae (about \u00a37) each. Thus on every hand prosperity attended the efforts of Athens to establish her independence.1 The Thebans, however, were resolved to avenge their defeat. On consulting the oracle, they were bidden to bring the matter before their public assembly, and to request the aid of their nearest of kin. Thebes and This response created no small astonishment, Aegina. for the Tanagraeans, Thespians and Coronaeans, who seemed to , be their next of kin, had been their allies in the late 1 Herod, v. 74, 77; vi. 108; Diod.

But it occurred to some one present that Aegina and Thebe were the daughters of Asopus, and that the Aeginetans might be the next of kin. To Aegina, there fore, they applied for aid. At this time the island was in great prosperity, and, as she had a long-standing quarrel with Athens, neither the power nor the will were wanting, if by any means she could injure the city. Without any proclama tion of war she began the attack by laying waste Phalerum and other districts on the sea-coast of Attica. When the Athenians were about to retaliate, they received an oracle, Aegina attacks informing them that if they waited for thirty Athens. years and in the thirty-first consecrated a pre cinct to Aeacus, everything would go as they wished ; if, on the other hand, they attacked at once, their fortunes would vary, though in the end they would be successful.1 The Athenians at once consecrated the precinct, but they could not defer their revenge for thirty years. For a moment they were checked by the news that the Spartans intended to restore Hippias, but when this danger passed away a de sultory warfare seems to have raged between the two cities, in which, so far as we can see, the Athenians had not ships to injure the Aeginetans, nor the Aeginetans men to invade Attica with any hope of success.2 Meanwhile the Boeotians abandoned hostilities on the news of the decisive part taken by the allies of Sparta in refusing to restore Hippias. At any rate the Thebans were unable to extend their power beyond the Asopus into the territory of Plataea. THE CONSTITUTION OF CLISTHENES. 21. Solon had founded his arrangements of the Council on the ancient division into tribes ; the four hundred members being furnished in equal shares by the four tribes. We do not 1 Herod, v. 79-81.

The phratries were accustomed to meet, and could easily be adapted to the purpose of nomination or election. It is obvious that such an arrangement would throw a great deal of influence into the hands of wealthy families. Moreover, many of the Attic villages (demes) have names which are patronymics \u2014 which implies that they were at one time or another the home of some family of note ; and we have already seen what a power Pisistratus could exercise over Family in the mountaineers who dwelt in the neighbour- fluence. hood of his estates. Under these circumstances the elections to the Council could be easily controlled by the oligarchs ; and at the same time the Assembly could only be reached, so far as the initiation of measures went, through the Council. Here, then, was a difficulty which a reformer must at once remove, if the people were to act independently of the families which had so long ruled them. Clisthenes determined to separate the old tribe and phratry from politics. In the opinion of Herodotus he removed the Ionic tribes owing to his contempt for the clisthenes Ionians, and in imitation of his grandfather establishes , ,, tn \u2022 Ten Tribes. Clisthenes, who had destroyed the Dorian tribes at Sicyon.1 This is, of course absurd. It was natural that Clisthenes of Sicyon, in his desire to break down the Dorian element in his city, should call the Dorian tribes by opprobrious names, but the situation of affairs at Athens was quite different. Clisthenes of Athens could not intend to insult the Ionian population of Attica at the very moment when he was desirous to raise them to power. He had other motives for the changes which he now introduced. In the place of the four Ionic tribes he created ten new ones, 1 Herod, v. 66 ; supra, p. 373."], [496, "CLISTHENES' POLICY: THE DEME. [XV. 22. 478 named after ten heroes, Cecrops, Erechtheus, Pandion and Aegeus, the four ancient kings of Athens ; Oeneus, a son of Pandion ; Acamas, a son of Theseus ; Hippothoon, whom Theseus had established at Eleusis ; Ajax of Salamis, who ranked as an Attic hero ; Leon, who was said to have sacri ficed his daughter to save Athens ; and Antiochus, the son of Heracles. Statues of these heroes\u2014 the Eponymi as they were called, because they gave their names to the tribes\u2014 were set up in the market-place at Athens. Each tribe had an overseer or governor and a treasurer ; a common shrine and a festival ; from time to time, as occasion demanded, all the members of the tribe were convened at Athens for the despatch of business.1 22. In each tribe, according to the arrangement of Clis- thenes, there were ten \"demes,\" or villages. These demes _. _ were not a creation of Clisthenes, for they were The Demes ' J as arranged the existing villages and towns of Attica, but by Clisthenes, he seemg haye been the firgt tQ appjy the name deme universally to them, and to have arranged them in a manner which suited his political plan, for we cannot suppose that there were precisely a hundred villages in Attica at this time. Like the tribe, each deme had a hero, and a sanctuary, at which all the members worshipped. The inhabitants of the deme were enrolled in lists, which were kept by the demarch or governor. He also presided at the meetings, where affairs which affected the community, such as the management of common lands, or the amount to be raised in order to defray expenses, or any other important matter, were discussed. He was elected by his fellow demesmen, and held office for a year. The position was one of importance in a limited sphere, for the demarch kept the register of citizens who were of age to bear arms ; through his agency crews were chosen for ships of war, and money collected. At the end of his year of office he was doubtless compelled to give in an account of his 1 Herod, v. 67 ; Pollux, viii. 110."], [497, "XV. 23.] LOCAL INFLUENCE REMOVED. 479 management, and answer any attack which might be made upon it.1 23. This change transformed the political status of the Athenian citizen. The old family ceremonies and meetings continued to exist, but only for private life ; and a new religious influence arose out of the forms of worship which bound every one to his deme and his tribe. At the same time a new interest in politics had been created by the establishment of local centres in which every inhabitant could find a place and play his part. But if Clisthenes had stopped here he would not have emancipated the Athenians from territorial influence. Families which had been domi nant in their districts under the old system would have been dominant still. Clisthenes saw what was required, and made arrangements to secure it. In the first place he enrolled a large body of citizens by extending the franchise to a number of emancipated slaves and resident aliens. Enfl.anchise- These new citizens would swell the population ment of slaves of the city, where no doubt they chiefly con- an a lens' gregated, and the \"resident aliens,\" who were for the most part engaged in tiade, would be quite independent of the Athenian families.2 Next he arranged the demes which formed a tribe in such a manner that they Arrangement were not contiguous\u2014 at any rate in every of the demes. case. Demes from the north of Attica were combined into one tribe with demes from the south.3 By this means the strength of local influence was greatly impaired; and, as Athens itself was the meeting-place for the tribes on import ant occasions, no inconvenience arose from the dispersion of the demes of which they were composed. But another innovation which we may ascribe to Clisthenes\u2014 and it was the most important of all\u2014 must have rendered any immediate 1 Herod, v. 69 ; Harpocration, Aypapxos. ' Arist.

No one could, however, be a councillor for two successive years. We are not told that any minimum of property was required as a qualification for a councillor, but it is improbable that the poorest (Solonian) class would be able to give the time which the duties of the office required.1 24. The new Council was reorganised in accordance with the basis upon which it was founded. Instead of four Arrangement hundred members, five hundred were now of the Council. chosen, fifty from each of the ten tribes. As this was too large a body to be retained permanently at Athens, it was subdivided into ten tribal divisions of fifty each, and at the same time the year was divided into ten presidencies. During each of the ten presidencies the members of one of the ten tribes remained continuously at Athens, in the Council Hall, that they might be in readiness to transact the business of the hour, and while in office these were called the Presi dents, and their tribe the presiding tribe. The Council met daily, and, as before, nothing could be brought before the General Assembly without previous discussion in the Council. It is also probable \u2014 and unfortunately we cannot get beyond probability in speaking of the proceedings of Clisthenes \u2014 that the Assembly was now more frequently convened than formerly. Such a change was necessary in order to assure the citizens of their power, and even more so for the trans action of public business.

Boards of Ten. charged with the superintendence of various departments in the state. Of these the most important were the Ten Strategi, or Generals, who, together with the Archon Polemarch, were the commanders-in-chief of the army and the fleet.1 That the naucraries were increased from forty eight to fifty by Clisthenes seems certain, for the old number could not be brought into any relation with the ships and new tribes. As each naucrary supplied a ship, cavalry the navy of the Athenians is now to be estimated at 50 triremes ; and if each naucrary continued to furnish two mounted soldiers, as before, the cavalry would amount to no more than 100 horse.2 The amount of heavy armed infantry at Marathon was 9000. 26. Lastly, Clisthenes is said to have introduced the re markable institution of ostracism.3 This was a device for re moving any citizen whose presence in the city 0stracism. seemed to threaten the unity or harmony of the state. The presidents of the Council came before the Assembly (not later than the seventh Prytany) with the question, whether it was necessary that any citizen should be sent into exile.

In the presence of the Archons and the Council, the people met not as usual in the Pnyx, but in the market-place, and gave their votes by placing in urns, arranged for the purpose, small tablets of earthenware, on which they wrote down the name of the person whom they wished to banish. If six thousand votes were given against any one person,1 he was compelled to leave the city for ten years. Neither his property nor his civic rights were touched ; he was in no sense regarded as a criminal. Ostracism was merely the assertion of the people that a single citizen had acquired such power in the city that it was expedient for all to be rid of him for a time. Though much has been said in favour of the institution as a safeguard against civil strife or the rise of a tyrant, it has never been proved that it contributed to the welfare of Athens. How ever honourable it may have been to Aristides, Themistocles, and Cimon to go into banishment, it was not honourable nor expedient for the city to banish them. Ostracism made it possible for the rabble to rid themselves of the man who calculated to controlled them, at the time when they most do more harm needed control, and to deprive a statesman of t an goo . political power, who pursued a policy of which they disapproved, no matter how wise and just the policy may have been. Under any circumstances Athens was weaker and less efficient when deprived of the services of her ablest men.2 Ostracism is said to have come to an end with the banishment of Hyperbolus in 418 B.C. Party spirit ran high between Alcibiades and Nicias; ostracism was demanded in order to expel one or other of the disturbing elements, but while Nicias and Alcibiades escaped, the 1 Such appears to be the meaning of the passage in Philochorus, and so Grote understood it.

It is impossible to give any clear account of the means by which Clisthenes was enabled to carry out such extensive reforms. Herodotus, who is our sole authority, How did ciis merely informs us that Clisthenes, finding him- outhlsre\"^ self overpowered by the nobles, took the demos forms? into partnership, and by this means became far stronger than his opponents.3 Nor do we know in what capacity he brought forward his numerous proposals. Was he placed by the people in a position analogous to that of Solon in 593 B.C. ? Or did he propose his measures in the Council and Assembly, and pass them by decree of the people ? The changes were clearly the result of careful consideration : it was not any partial amendment ; it was an entire reform of the consti tution, which Clisthenes set before him. They were also carried out, so far as we know, without alteration. For these reasons we may assume that, after the failure of Isagoras, Clisthenes was allowed to take up an autocratic position in order to give a new constitution to the city. 28. After the collapse at Sparta (p. 441), no further attempt was made to restore the Pisistratidae. Hippias, however, exhibited something of his old tenacity, and Hippias in would by no means accept the change in his Asla fortunes as final. On leaving Sparta he returned once more to Sigeum. whence he entered into communication with the satrap of Sardis, endeavouring by every means in his power 1 Thuc. viii. 73 ; Plut. Aristid. 7. 2 Grote writes at great length on the good which ostracism was intended to do ; but when he comes to relate the good that it did, the account is meagre indeed. 3 Herod, v. 69.

Henceforth we hear no more of Clisthenes. the old factions of the Hill, the Plain, and the Shore. The state was at length united, and penetrated with a single spirit. Every one felt himself a part of the whole ; in fighting for his city, he was fighting for a society in which he had equal rights and privileges. He was impelled to take an active part in politics by the feeling that he could sensibly influence the welfare of the state, with which his own welfare was indissolubly connected. A spirit of inde pendence was alive in the heart of every Athenian, prompting him to play his part beside his fellow-citizens. It might be He made the difficult or irksome to attend the frequent democracy a meetings of the Assembly ; but the Assembly was now a real power. To leave the labour of the farm, or the occupations of trade for service in the field demanded as great a sacrifice from the Greek as it does from the Frenchman or German ; but the Greek was fighting his own battles ; he did not lay down his life at the bidding of a master. He felt that he must bear his part in the defence The democratic of his country, for, if he failed in that, he was spirlt- guilty of treachery to his fellow-citizens. From every one great efforts were expected, for freedom was a possession difficult to win, and more difficult to keep. Under such conditions political life became a moral influence of the 1 Herod, v. 96."], [503, "XV. 29.] THE DEMOCRACY. 485 highest kind. It generated and developed the highest virtues of which man is capable : the love of freedom, devotion to a common cause, self-respect, and self-control. In such a state a good citizen could be pronounced a good man, and nothing that was visionary or morbid, the life of the recluse, together with the qualities which serve for virtues in such a life, could find a place in it. Men were willing to sacrifice their lives, but they did not despise \" ' e CIty' them; on the contrary, they \"cherished their bodies as the dearest thing they had,\" if only they could use them in the service of the state. Nor was the domestic life forgotten in the political. It was in his own home that the duty of the citizen was most clear. To preserve his property intact, to keep up family traditions of worth and honour, to breed sons and daughters who would carry on the race undeteriorated \u2014 this was as much a part of the Athenian's duty as attendance at the Assembly, or service in the field. In the same large spirit the Athenian learned to live for others while living for himself. If he amassed wealth, it was his desire to spend it, not in selfish indulgence, but in a manner which would bring him credit Public spirit with his country. That was hardly his own at Athens which had been gained under the protection of the community and the gods. The increase of the field and the flock was a gift of the heavenly powers, not to be taken without recom pence and thanksgiving. To add splendour to their festivals was at once a pious duty and the best means of securing their good-will and blessing. Temples rose and festivals were adorned with processions and contests, not to gratify the pride or ambition of a single man, but as an expression of the piety and thankfulness of the people. In the time of Clisthenes the Athenians were free from many of the evils which appear in the democracy of the next century. They were a people, not a rabble, a state, not a city ; they were animated by a noble public spirit, not by a selfish greed ; they desired liberty, not aggrandisement. But the elements of decay were not wanting. It was impossible"], [504, "[XV. 29. 486 THE DEMOCRACY. to prevent the political power from falling into the hands of the city. The best and soundest part of the population, the Seeds of decay owners and tillers of the soil in Attica, could already sown. not he so regular in their attendance at the Assembly as the inhabitants of Athens, who were always at hand. The introduction of the lot in elections was a security against influence, but it was no security against incompetence and dishonesty. For a time these evils were hidden. The enthusiasm which followed the triumphs of the Persian war carried the democracy successfully through another generation, but only to increase the mischief which it delayed. The men who \"fought at Marathon \" passed away; and what Aristides had begun with the noblest motives, Ephialtes and Pericles completed in the interests of a party. The meaning of the change was veiled at first by the splen dour of the new city ; an Athens arose which was the wonder of the world. The beauty of the Acropolis, the magnificence of the Dionysia seemed to be outward and visible signs of the prosperity and happiness of Athenian life. But national culture, even when attained, is a poor compensation for the loss of national honesty. Art and poetry can introduce a subtle charm into society, but they cannot supply that civic virtue on which alone democracy, the most exacting of all forms of political life, can safely rest.1 1 Isocr.

The rich abundance of products and the softness of the climate inclined them to a degree of luxurjr unknown in the mother country ; the leisure, which their wealth permitted, enabled the nobler minds to indulge in speculative curiosity, and pursue the pleasures of intellect.1 Along with the influence of climate and soil other forces were also at work of still greater potency and more important Oriental in their effects. On the continent of Asia, the influences. Greeks were brought into contact with nations whose civilisation was widely different from their own and in some points in advance of it. The mountains which fringe the Anatolian coast are pierced by four considerable rivers ; the Caicus, the Hermus, the Cayster and the Maeander. At or near the mouths of these lay the most im- portant of the Greek cities, and though the position may have been chiefly recommended by the richness of the alluvial plains which these rivers form, there were other causes which helped to determine the site. It was through these river valleys that all communication between the coast and the interior was carried on ; the great road which connected Mesopotamia and the west passed through Phrygia into the valley of the Hermus, and finally struck the sea at the mouth of the Cayster. A distance of seventy miles brought the Greek from Ephesus to the capital of the Lydian empire at Sardis, and a much shorter distance was needed to put him in contact with some of the most important features of Asiatic life and character. Often he lived face to face with them. It was on the ruins of Carian or Lelegian cities that his new home was built ; he worshipped under Greek names deities which were not Greek ; reared temples to them with the aid of Lydian or Egyptian treasures, and carved their statues under foreign influence 1 For the climate and soil of Asia Minor see Herod, i. 142-149 ; for the effect of climate, Hippocrates, Deaere, etc.,\u00a7\u00a7 12 and esp. 16, Littre\\ on airoXepoirepoi elcri r\u0153v \u00a5,vpo>iraiaiv oi 'Ao-irjvoi Kai rjpepojTepoi Ta qdea ai l>pai a'lriai pdXio-ra, ov peydXas rds perafioXds -noievpevai, ovre eiri rb Seppbv, ovre eni to y^vxpbv, dXXd 7rapa7rXno-('coc."], [507, "XVI. i.] ORIENTAL INFLUENCES. 489 \u2014 influence so deeply felt that it was quickly transmitted to the west. Before Solon's death the temple of the Great Mother may have been seen at Athens ; in the Eleusinian myth of Demeter there are elements which seem to have been borrowed from the story of Cybele and Attys ; and the poet Sophocles, a Hellene of the Hellenes, allows his Grecian mariners to appeal to the all-nurturing mountain goddess, whose shrine was washed by the golden stream of Pactolus. Greek logographers discovered that the old Lydian dynasty of Sardis was descended from Heracles no less than their own Spartan kings ; Assyria and Egypt were connected through Perseus with the royal line of Argos. And with religious rites and legends came knowledge of a more sober and lasting nature. The accumulated stores of the east were brought within the touch of western genius. By 585 B.C. Thales was able, no doubt with the help of Chaldaean tables, to foretell an eclipse of the sun, and the same interest in physical causes led to other specula tions out of which arose the germs of natural philosophy. Men began to ask \u2014 and they have gone on asking ever since\u2014 What was the cause of life and growth ? Was it water, from which all things proceeded, as the old poets seemed to hint when they spoke of Ocean and Tethys as the parents of the gods ?

The records of past ages, the manners and habits of distant nations, began to attract intelligent attention, and the Muse of history took her place beside the deities of melody and song.

THE GREEK CITIES IN ASIA MINOR. 2. About the beginning of the seventh century a movement took place among the barbarous tribes which roamed through \u201e. \u201e. the vast territory that extends to the north The Cimmer- J . ians in Asia and east of the Caspian Sea. A nation whom Minor. the Greeks called Scythians, but who called themselves Scoloti, pressed forward to the west, into the territory lying immediately above the Black Sea, and expelled the Cimmerians, who for some time had been settled there, and had given their name to what was called the Cimmerian Bosporus. In search of new homes the Cimmerians crossed the sea, and fell upon Asia Minor, where for the next hundred years they continued to be a source of trouble and danger. They conquered the Milesian colony of Sinope, and held it for two generations ; they invaded and destroyed the flourish ing kingdom of Phrygia (696 B.C.) ; they captured Sardis, \" except the citadel,\" and under their chief Lygdamis they burned the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Magnesia on the Maeander was utterly destroyed by them ; and in spite of"], [509, "XVI. 3, 4.] SARDIS AND THE GREEKS. 491 defeats by Assurbanipal of Assyria and Gyges of Lydia, they were not expelled from Asia Minor till the reign of Alyattes, in the beginning of the sixth century.1 3. Soon after the appearance of the Cimmerians in Asia Minor, a change occurred in the dynasty which reigned at Sardis, the capital of Lydia. For many genera- chan_e in the tions (twenty-two according to Herodotus) the royal dynasty throne had been in the possession of a family at ar ls whom the Greeks called Heraclidae, because they claimed descent from the sun-god of Lydia, who was identified with Heracles. The last two or three sovereigns of this race appear to have exercised little authority in the kingdom, and to have been governed in turn by two powerful families, the Mermnadae and the Tylonidae. At length Gyges, the head of the Mermnadae, entered into relations with the wife of the reigning Heraclid, whom Herodotus calls Candaules, and others Sadyattes, and with her assistance or connivance, he assassi nated the king and usurped the throne. Such King Gyges. a step naturally excited the opposition of the Lydians, and especially the Tylonids ; and in order to secure the prize which he had won, Gyges was compelled to ask the assistance of the Carian king Arselis. The contention was finally settled by an appeal to the oracle at Delphi, which decided in favour of Gyges (c. 685 B.C.).2 4. The accession of the Mermnadae was an event of the greatest importance to the Asiatic Greeks.

Assurbanipal sent an army to his assistance, which inflicted severe chastisement on the invaders, but Gyges was no sooner extricated from his difficult position than he threw off his allegiance, and even sent mercenaries to Psammetichus of Egypt, who was openly at war with Assyria. But the Cimmerians, though defeated, were not crushed; another battle took place, in which Gyges was slain and the Lydians suffered so severely that Ardys, his son, who succeeded him on the throne, found it necessary to place Lydia once more under the protection of Assyria (c. 650 B.C.).1 5. Ardys renewed the attack upon Miletus, but met with no better success than his father. Yet he captured Priene, a city which at that time lay on the sea-coast, on the north shore of the Latmian Bay, and was charged with the superintendence of the Panionian festival at Mycale.

At his death he was succeeded by Sadyattes, who in a brief reign of five years resumed the a ya now traditional policy of making war upon Miletus, but resumed it without result (c. 615 \u2014 610 B.C.).1 6. At this time Miletus was under the control of a prince, Thrasybulus by name, who had made use of his position as prytanis of the city (p. 340) to establish a Miletus under tyranny. Of the manner in which he obtained Thrasybulus. his power, exercised it, and lost it, we are ignorant ; we only know the advice which he gave to Periander (p. 385) about the management of a city by a tyrant, and the scheme by which he is said to have rescued Miletus from the attack of Alyattes the son of Ardys. That prince had no sooner ascended the throne than he engaged in a war with the Ionian city. At first the Milesians ventured to meet him in the open field, but after severe defeats at Limeneum, and on the Maeander, they remained within the city walls, and left their territory at the mercy of the Lydians, who being without a navy could not cut off the city from the sea. Year by year the harvests were carried off or destroyed, and Miletus was entirely deprived of the supplies which she drew from the fertile land round the mouth of the Maeander. A scarcity of food began to be felt in the city when a happy The war with accident gave a new turn to the situation. A'yattes. During an invasion of the territory of Miletus, the Lydian soldiers had set fire to the temple of Athena at Assessus, and when Alyattes subsequently sent to Delphi to ask advice about an illness from which he was suffering, he was informed that no answer would be given till this temple had been restored. On this he requested leave to send a herald to Miletus to negotiate a truce during which the temple could be rebuilt. 1 For Ardys and Sadyattes, Herod, i. 15. Herodotus allows a reign of twelve years to Sadyattes, and asserts that six of them were occupied with the Milesian war. But Eusebius gives only five years for the entire reign, and this seems to be the more correct account. See Gelzer, le., p. 239. Duncker, Hist.

Thrasybulus, who had been informed by Periander of the oracle, resolved to entertain the herald in a manner which would convince Alyattes that the Milesians were quite in different to the desolation of their country. All the corn in the city was brought out into the market-place for the occasion, and the inhabitants were bidden to feast and keep holiday. When Alyattes heard of such abundance in a city which he imagined that he had reduced to famine, he at once abandoned the war and came to terms with Miletus. 7. Thus the greatest of the Ionian cities was ranged on the side of the Lydians. Colophon also, though we do not know why, placed her famous cavalry at the disposal of the Lydian king, who, if we may trust the account given in Polyaenus (vii. 2. 2), did not hesitate to massacre them, and make a treacherous though unsuccessful attack on the city. In an Conquest of attempt on Clazomenae the Lydians suffered a Smyrna. severe defeat, and Priene held them at bay; but the city of Smyrna, which had offered a successful re sistance to Gyges, was captured, her walls destroyed, and the inhabitants dispersed into villages. This conquest placed Alyattes in posession of the lower valley of the Hermus, and brought the Lydian empire down to the sea-coast. As he had also succeeded in ridding Asia Minor of the Cimmerians, he was able to bequeath to his son Croesus a power far greater than any which had yet been swayed by the sceptre of a Mermnade.1 8.

He was succeeded by his son Croesus, then thirty-five years of age, a prince of great ambition and capacity, who resolved to make the most of his splendid inheritance. This object he pursued with such success that in ten years he had not only reduced all the Greek cities to dependence, but had also conquered the \"barbarian\" tribes which had not hitherto acknowledged the Lydian supremacy. The Phrygians and Mysians, the Mariandynians, Chalybes and Paphlagonians, the Asiatic Thracians and the Carians, the Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians, Pamphylians were now subjects of Sardis ; only the brave and civilised Lycians and the Cilicians in the south maintained their independence. This rapid elevation of the Lydian monarch to a position of supreme importance in Asia Minor, ending as it did in sudden, unexpected and irretrievable ruin, was an event which deeply impressed the ancient world.1 The rise and fall of Croesus was a signal instance of the instability of fortune ; and in the minds of reflective Greeks, who were beginning to feel and uphold the sanctity of moral law, it was a proof that wealth was by no means the first of blessings ; that unscru- 1 Herod, i. 26 ff.

On his accession to the throne Croesus turned his arms against Ephesus, which, after the fall of Smyrna and the alliance with Miletus, was the most important Greek city now independent of Sardis. Ephesus appears at this time to have consisted of two communities, which, though living amicably side by side, were separate from each other. On the slopes of Mt.

It was equally the interest of both communities to develop the trade of the city, and improve her position as the key of communication between the eastern and western world ; but while the Greeks looked to the sea, the temple held to the land. The deity which was worshipped there was not an importation from Greece, but the Astarte of old Phoenician visitors combined with the Cybele of Hither Asia (supra, p. 132). The name of Artemis, which Homer had associated with virgin purity and grace, was here given to a goddess whose functions as a nursing mother and patroness of birth were clearly indicated by the numerous breasts carved upon her monstrous statue. Her high priests were eunuchs, a form of asceticism which, however degraded and insane, commanded respect among Asiatic nations. The custom was also a safeguard against the growth of an independent priestly dynasty ; it completely cut off the temple from the civic life which surrounded it, and gave a pledge to the worshippers who came from Phrygia or Lydia or Syria that the old rites of their native goddess would not be sacrificed to Hellenic prejudices or ambition.

Croesus was not a conqueror of the barbarous type whose instinct is only to destroy ; he appears to have had a personal liking for Greeks and Greek civilisation ; and his policy led him to form an alliance with the leading city of European Greece. That his rule was not oppressive is proved by the fact that the Ionian cities refused to listen to Cyrus when he invited them to revolt from Sardis.1 12.

The empire was divided between the conquerors. The territory to the north and east of the Tigris fell to Media ; the south, from Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, formed the new kingdom of Babylonia. By this partition the kingdoms of Lydia and Media became conterminous, and as the bound aries were unsettled, it was inevitable that a war should break out between Alyattes and Cyaxares the Median king (in 590 B.C.).

To confirm the arrangement the daughter of Alyattes was married to Astyages, the son of Cyaxares. But within a few years of the fall of Nineveh a tribe of Persians issuing from Pasargadae, their home on the east of the Persian Gulf, acquired the ancient kingdom of Elam in Southern Mesopotamia, where they chose the city of Susa as their capital. This conquest appears to have been achieved by Teispes about the year 595 B.C.

We have no trustworthy account of the war, but there is reason to suppose that Cyrus was joined by the soldiers of Astyages. However gained, the victory was complete, and Media was added to the Persian Empire. By this success Cyrus became the neighbour of Croesus, who saw with alarm his brother-in-law Astyages replaced by an ambitious and successful conqueror.1 14. Croesus resolved to be first in the field in the conflict which he perceived to be inevitable, and his first step was to Croesus and arrange a combination of forces against Cyrus. Cyrus.

Unfortunately Croesus gave these auxiliaries no time to assemble. Confident in his own forces, which had hitherto been uniformly successful, eager that the glory and the profit of the conquest should be his own, and supported by the answers which he had received from the oracles of Delphian Apollo and Amphiaraus, he crossed the Halys in the spring of 546 B.C., and declared war upon Cyrus. He was able to lay waste a considerable part of Cappadocia, and to acquire the strong city of Pteria, operations which seem to have consumed the whole of the summer, but with the appearance of the Persian army in the autumn his successes came Defeat and to an end. Defeated, or at least not victorious, fal1 of Croesus. in the battle which took place, he retired to Sardis with the intention of renewing the contest in the ensuing spring, against which he summoned his allies to meet him. But Cyrus made war in a manner which did not admit of such convenient delay. In spite of the advanced season he followed Croesus to Sardis, and after a brief siege of fourteen days, he took both the city and the king. Croesus was treated with the generosity which Cyrus extended to all his captives, and after appointing a viceroy to complete the subjugation of the newly acquired kingdom, the conqueror returned to the East.1 15. The fall of the Lydian empire did not affect Miletus, which had already come to terms with Cyrus, nor had the inhabitants of the islands much to fear, as the Cyms and Persians were without any fleet whatever. The the Asiatic case was otherwise with the cities of the coast, Greeks which, as they had previously refused the overtures of the conqueror, were now exposed to his resentment. They endeavoured to conciliate him by offering submission, and at the same time to secure for themselves the favourable terms which they had enjoyed under the supremacy of Croesus. 1 E.

In this crisis of their fortunes two remarkable men came forward with proposals to the Ionians, which if they had been accepted would have given a new course to the history of Greece. Bias of Priene, one of the Seven Sages, ..... . , ., . Bias oi Priene. advised his countrymen to abandon altogether the cities on the Asiatic coast, and seek new settlements in Sardinia. The Phocaeans had already founded a colony in Corsica, from which it is probable that the Greeks received exaggerated ideas of the wealth of the neighbouring island ; and as an unknown country, in the hands of the Etruscans and Phoenicians, it was the prize on which every adventurous Greek cast longing eyes. Had the Ionians followed the advice of Bias and established themselves in force on Sardinia, the dream of a western empire which fired the imagination of the Athenians in 416 B.C. might have been anticipated. Thales of Miletus, who was also one of the Seven, ,..,-\u201e. , . , Thales. was less ambitious than Bias, yet his proposal marks a greater departure from the ordinary views of a Greek statesman. He advised the Ionians to break up the separate existence of their cities, and unite in a common council-chamber at Teos, the centre of Ionia. This chamber, he proposed, should direct the affairs of the nation, and be supreme over the various members, which would stand in the same relation to it as the demes of Attica stood to Athens. This plan, which is remarkable as the first appearance of the idea of a federation among the Ionians, was greatly at vari ance with the Greek view of the city. For though it was a custom to worship common deities, and to unite in Amphic tyonies for their protection, a strict division was isolation of the made between religious and political union. In Greek cities the eyes of the citizen isolation and independence were insepa rable, and no Greek community would acknowledge that any 1 Herod, i. 154."], [522, "TYRANTS LN THE GREEK CITIES.

On these principles the suggestion of Thales was disregarded, though the alternative was submission to Persia on such terms as she chose to dictate.1 18. When Cambyses, who succeeded Cyrus in 529 B.C., invaded Egypt, he compelled the Ionian and Aeolian Greeks to furnish contingents to his army, \" for he regarded them as slaves bequeathed to him by his father,\" and after his death (522 B.C.) they furnished both ships and men to Darius in his invasion of Scythia (about 515 B.C.). By this time we find that a change had been made in the internal constitution of t rants estab- tne clties > tyrants in the interests of Persia nshed in the being established in the place of the old Greek cities. oligarchies or democracies. In the fleet which Darius took to the Danube we hear of Daphnis of Abydus, Hippoclus of Lampsacus, Herophantus of Parium, Metrodorus of Proconnesus, Aristagoras of Cyzicus, Ariston of Byzantium, Strattis of Chios, Aeaces of Samos, Laodamas of Phocaea, Histiaeus of Miletus, Aristagoras of Cyme. These tyrants were compelled to attend with their ships in order to make a bridge across the river. When Darius was absent in Scythia the question was raised among them by the Scythians, sup ported by Miltiades, the second tyrant of the name in the Chersonese (p. 453), whether they should not seize the oppor tunity to destroy the bridge, which they had been left behind to guard, and allow Darius to perish. But Histiaeus pointed out that they were far too insecure in their own position to adopt such a course. They were tyrants in the interest of Persia, and held their thrones by the terror of the Persian name ; if this were removed, the cities would prefer a popular to a despotic government. This opinion, which gained the day, is a striking indication of the nature of the authority which the Persians had set up. Yet we may observe that the tyrants were in all cases Greeks, not Medes or Persians ; it was through the Greek passion for independence that Cyrus 1 Herod, i. 169, 170. Bernays, Phokion, p. 24."], [523, "XVI. 19, 20.] GREEK REVOLT & SUBJUGATION. 505 had reduced the Asiatic cities ; it was by the Greek love of absolute power that Darius kept them under control.1 19. The Scythian campaign of Darius was a signal failure, involving the loss of many thousand soldiers. The disaster revived the hope of freedom in many of the Asiatic cities, especially in those which lay in the north of the Aegean. Some failed to send soldiers to supply the place of the slain, some plundered the defeated army. It was necessary to reduce the rebellious cities to submission ; even Revolt of the Lemnos and Imbros, in spite of their insular Greek cities. position, were now to be made subject to Persia. For this purpose a Persian army under Otanes, the son of Sisamnes, was left behind by Darius on his return to Asia. He lost no time in subduing the cities on the mainland, and then proceeded with the help of the fleet of Lesbos to attack the islands. The Lemnians fought bravely but unsuccess fully ; they were conquered, and Lycaretus, the brother of Maeandrius of Samos, was made tyrant over them.

In the seventh century B.C. we may the island. assume the existence of a rich aristocracy in the island, in which the women enjoyed a free and influential position. Alcaeus and Sappho, whose names have become immortal among the lyric poets of Greece, were members of this privileged class. 23. Alcaeus, like Archilochus of Paros, was at once a poet and a soldier, and like Archilochus he was a better servant of the Muses than of Mars. He could describe 1 \u2022 i Alcaeus. in stirring verse the hall resplendent with armour, the sword, the shield, the horse-plumed helmet, the linen corslet in which the Lesbians went out to battle, but his courage failed him on the field.

Little did the cavalier poet imagine that his name would be for ever written side by side with that of the \"shambling, shabby, swag-bellied bragga docio\" whom he so heartily hated and despised.1 24. Among the poetesses of Greece \u2014 and they were numerous \u2014 Sappho holds the foremost place. To the Greeks she appeared a creature almost superhuman, a \"world's wonder;\" and modern readers, to whom nothing remains of her poems but two odes, one of which is imperfect, and a number of short fragments, have never failed to repeat the praises of antiquity. It is impos sible by translations or criticism to convey any adequate sense of the charm of her language ; what has been said of Shakespeare \u2014 that his words cannot be hidden \u2014 applies with equal force to Sappho. Her poetry bears the stamp of an imperishable genius, capable of giving complete expression to the thoughts and feelings which men are always and everywhere striving to utter. A vivid imagination carried her through all the regions of human passion ; the fervour of the lover in the presence of his beloved is expressed as strongly as the despair of the forsaken maiden. Not less striking are her womanly dignity and intellectual pride, her maternal tenderness and solicitude. Unlike many literary women, she exercised a great influence over her own sex, and, so far as we can understand a connection which later Her com- writers misinterpreted, she gathered round her panions. a society of women whom she guided and encouraged in the cultivation of song. These were her \"companions,\" of whom she sometimes spoke with the extravagant affection natural to her highly wrought tem perament. To us the existence of such a society, so far from indicating anything extraordinary or repellent, is a proof that a rational liberty was allowed to women in Aeolis 1 Diogenes Laertius, Vila Pittaci, esp. \u00a7 9 ; Alcaeus, Fragmenta, in Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci, vol. iii."], [527, "XVI. 25.] LESBOS: MELANCIIRUS\u2014PITTACUS. 509 at this time. But the different position of women is one of the most remarkable of the peculiarities which distinguish the tribes in Greece. Among the Ionians, in the peninsula and in Asia, at Athens and Miletus, we hear of no female poets, nor were women expected or allowed to take any part in society ; but at Sparta and Elis, as we have seen, and still more among the Aeolians, women were both influential and cultivated. From this difference of manners arose many of the charges brought by Attic writers against the women of Dorian and Aeolian cities.1 25. Lesbos did not escape the curse of domestic strife, which afflicted the cities of Greece. Towards the close of the seventh century, the rule of the aristocracy Party strife became intolerable to the people, who organised '**> Lesbos. a rebellion under their leader Melanchrus. The rising was successful, and for about ten years Melanchrus was tyrant of Mitylene. His severity seems at length to have provoked even his own party, a number of whom, under the command of Pittacus, joined the nobles in attacking him. Melanchrus was defeated and slain, but his death did not \u2022 c c i i- Melanchrus. bring about a peaceful settlement ot the fac tions in the city. A new demagogue named Myscelus rose to power, but only to fall a victim to the nobles, who, however, were not secured in their old position by his fall. New leaders of the rabble came forward, and defeated the aristo crats. At length, weary of the strife, the people of Lesbos put the government in the hands of Pittacus ; he was chosen aesymnete or umpire to arrange the constitution in a manner which would satisfy the claims of both parties. Unfortunately we can give but a vague account of this remarkable man, the Solon of Lesbos. Though his origin was humble, he showed himself a consummate statesman, and he shares with Solon the glory of refusing the temptation of a tyranny. He left no constitution behind him, and of his laws nothing was 1 Sappho, Frag. 28, 52, 68, 85, B."], [528, "[XVI. 26. LESBOS: WAR WITH ATHENS. 510 preserved worthy of notice but the remarkable statute that a man who committed a crime when intoxicated, so far from being excused on that account, should suffer double punish ment. That he was a brave soldier is clear from his conduct in the Sigean war. The Greeks allowed him a place among the Seven Sages, and to him, as to the rest, a number of wise maxims are assigned. The character which Diodorus has preserved (perhaps from Ephorus), describes him as one whose like Lesbos never had seen, and never would see again, \"let her wine be never so much better and more plentiful.\" Easy of access, yet not without reserve, devoted to the welfare of his citizens, and inclined to overlook their mis deeds, a prudent statesman and a wise lawgiver, he delivered his city from three great evils \u2014 tyranny, civil strife, and foreign war.1 26.

The war went on for some years with varying fortune. On one occasion, Alcaeus, the aristocratic poet, only saved himself by leaving his helmet in the possession of the enemy. A signal success was gained for Lesbos in 606 B.C., when Pittacus, whom Phrynon had challenged to single combat, defeated and slew his enemy.

Thus the Athenians remained in possession of Sigeum, while the Mitylenaeans held Achilleum and so much of the coast of the Troad as was secured by their colonies.1 Paros. 27. The island of Paros, which may be described as a mountain of marble surrounded by a flat fringe of marshy but fertile soil, still retains the traces of the numerous population which was once spread over the Cyclades. In prehistoric times the Carians were in possession of the island, from which they were dislodged by the Ionians in the course of their migration to Asia. Colonies were afterwards sent out from Paros to Thasos and Parium \u2014 the second in conjunc tion with the Milesians, who also called in the friendly aid of the Parians to put an end to the quarrels of their citizens (p. 495) ; and at a later time we shall have to record the visits of Miltiades and Themistocles to the island. But Paros has a another and a far greater claim to the notice of the historian as the birth-place of Archilochus, whose name marks an epoch in the growth of Greek poetry. He was the son of - Telesicles by a slave, and was born about the middle of the seventh century. In 709 B.C. he went with his father to the colony in Thasos, but the venture brought him neither wealth nor reputation.

The attack failed entirely; Archilochus threw away his shield, and ran for his life. He returned to Paros, where he 1 Euseb. Chron. 01. 43.3 = 606 B.C., for Phrynon's death.

[XVI. 28. found himself as unsuccessful in love as he had been in war. He wished to marry Neobule, the daughter of the aristocratic Lycambes, but for some reason Lycambes, after giving his consent to the match, withdrew it. Archilochus was not the man to overlook an insult, or to be scrupulous in his way of resenting it. He attacked both Lycambes and his daughters with libels so savage and scandalous, that according to the siain in common story father and children hanged Euboea. themselves for shame and vexation. Dis- appointed of the hope of this marriage, Archilochus became a mercenary soldier; he took service in Euboea, where he fell by the hand of Calondas, a Naxian. 28. While the lyric poets of other nations have thrown themselves into ideal attitudes and striven to express ideal passions, the Greeks were occupied with their own thoughts, Greek lyric feelings, and circumstances. There is no P\u00b0etry attempt to conceal love or hate bv the use of attempt to conceal love or hate by the use of feigned names or any other illusion of poetic art ; it is not Lalage, or Lesbia, or Cynthia who appears in the lyrics of Alcaeus and Archilochus, but the dark and bright-eyed Sappho, or Neobule (?) shaded by her hair, with a wand of myrtle in her hand. This expression of personal feelings in verse began, as we saw, in Hesiod, and it reaches its greatest height in Archilochus, to whose influence this characteristic of Greek lyric poetry is largely due. Every incident of his eventful life, every mood of his passionate nature, was reflected in verse, while his great gifts of language and music enabled him not only to clothe his thoughts in vigorous words, but also to greatly developed invent metres suitable to every theme. Before by Archilochus. njs t.jme the hexameter and pentameter were the only forms of verse in use ; but his restless genius refused to be confined within such narrow limits ; he invented the iambic, the tetrameter or trochaic, and a number of more varied and elaborate lyric measures. Thus poetry became in his hands an instrument of the widest range ; his song of victory was chanted at Olympia when the athlete went up to receive his crown ; his abuse of Lycambes was the foundation"], [531, "XVI. 29.] PAROS\u2014 SAMOS. 513 of satirical poetry. We have glimpses of the incidents of his soldier's life : he kneads his bread with the spear, and drinks his wine spear in hand ; he calls for wine on board ship to sustain him in the watch. But, though he bears himself as a soldier, his love of satire is deeper than his love of glory : \" Some Saian is happy with that shield of mine. A right good shield it was, and I will get me another like it !\" \" We were a thousand warriors, and each of us had slain his man, yet the corpses were but seven !\" We go with him to Thasos, the hate ful island which rises \" like an ass's back out of the sea ;\" or we listen to his description of the good leader \u2014 Reality of \" no lanky, long-haired, straddling fop for me, hls P\u00b0=ms but a tight little bandy-legged hero, firm on his feet.\" At one moment he bids his spirit be patient in the hope of better things ; at another he reminds himself that sorrow will not cure his misfortunes, nor rejoicing aggravate them ; at another he rolls out a dithyramb \" with the thunder-stroke of wine upon his soul.\" In the judgment of the Greeks Archilochus ranked next to Homer ; and though the fragments which we possess by no means support such an estimate, we can trace even in what remains the outline of a character more vehe ment than that of our own Landor, of a genius which imparted a new impulse to Greek literature, and furnished it with new forms of expression.1 Samos. 29.

A hundred years later we hear of the removal of a king, Demoteles, and the establishment of an oligarchy of Geomori or land-owners, under whose rule a colony was sent out to Perinthus on the Thracian coast, in the hope of obtaining a share of the commerce of the Black Sea. A collision with Megara was the inevitable result of this step, war between an(l ln the hostilities which followed we obtain Samos and a glimpse of the domestic history of Samos. Megara. Victorious in the battle, the Samians returned home with no fewer than 600 prisoners, bound in the fetters which had been brought from Megara to enchain the Samians. But on the voyage, the captives and the crews, who were united by their common hatred of oligarchs, entered into a conspiracy to put an end to the government of the Geomori. Orders had been given that the prisoners should appear in their fetters before the governing body in the council-chamber Revolution at at Samos, and this opportunity was seized by Samos. the conspirators for carrying out their plans. The fetters were arranged to allow the prisoners to move freely ; they were provided with daggers, and when brought before the notables, they at once massacred all who were present (c. 565 B.C.). The government of Samos now became a democracy, but how long the people remained in power we do not know ; when we next hear of the island, the oligarchs are at the head of the state.1 30. But their rule was destined to be again suspended, and this time the disturbance was clue to one of their own order, who, following the example of Pisistratus, Lygdamis, and Rise of Poly- others, came forward as a tyrant. Hero crates, dotus informs us that Polycrates was the son of Aeaces, that he rose and got possession of Samos, and became \" master over men who were his equals.\" At first he 1 Thuc. i. 13 ; Plutarch, Quaest.

With the defeat of the combined forces of the Milesians and Lesbians, Polycrates removed the only naval power which could be brought against him in the interests of Sardis.1 Lying close to the Asiatic shore, and almost commanding the approach to Miletus and Ephesus, the island of Samos possesses conspicuous advantages of position, which Polycrates did not fail to turn to account. He invented a new kind of vessel for the conveyance of merchandise ; his Resources of swift penteconters, which were little better than Polycrates pirates' junks, issuing from the sheltered creeks of the island, levied contributions on the vessels which sailed into the ports of Asia, and especially Miletus, the wealthiest of them all.

With him money made the man. By money he had gained his position ; by money he kept it; and by the hope of money he was enticed to his ruin. His name was handed down to posterity as one of the tyrants who had impoverished and oppressed his subjects by erecting great buildings ; but of the three, monumental works which distinguished Samos, the conduit of Eupalinus seems to have been completed before Polycrates came to the throne, and the other two, the mole in the harbour and the temple of Hera, were at least begun. His care was mainly for himself. He spent money on his ships, erected docks and arsenals, and strengthened his city with fortifications ; he built himself a magnificent palace, and maintained a splendid court. Everything that was rare and costly was purchased for Polycrates ; every artist of superior ability was attracted to Samos by the highest pay. Democedes of Croton, the physician who afterwards became famous at the court of Darius, was induced to leave Athens by a yearly salary of two talents (\u00a3450) ; Anacreon of Teos and Ibycus of Bhegium took up their abode at the Samian court \u2014 poets who could impart elegance to a life of dissipation, and amuse a tyrant's leisure by throwing a veil of beautiful language over the most repulsive features of the Hellenic Eros.1 31.

Deeply impressed with the spectacle of such prosperity, and at the same time penetrated with the feeling that the gods were envious of the happiness of men, Amasis of Egypt, as Herodotus informs us, sent Polycrates a word of friendly warning: \"Let him throw away what he considered to be the most priceless of his possessions, and by 1 Aristot.

But his precaution was in vain ; the ring was swallowed by a fish ; the fish was caught and presented to Polycrates, who, on recovering his jewel, was struck with the mysterious turn which events had taken, and wrote a full account of the whole matter to Amasis. The Egyptian renounced all further intimacy with P operates ; a man so prosperous must needs be visited by the wrath of the gods, and he wished to escape the painful sight of a friend's calamity. 1 These apprehensions were realised. By a single false step Polycrates was brought from the summit of his prosperity to a most disastrous end, perishing \"unworthily Death of Poiy of himself,\" and by a death so miserable that crates- Herodotus will not relate it. The satrap of Sardis at the time, which was shortly before the death of Cambyses (in 522 B.C.) was Oroetes, who, either owing to an insult which he had received from Polycrates, or because he had been taunted by the satrap of Dascyleum with the independence of Samos, conceived a deadly hatred to the tyrant, and resolved on his destruction. With this object he sent to Samos, requesting permission to convey himself and his treasure to the island, out of the reach of Cambyses, by whom, as he pretended, he was in danger of being put to death ; how great the treasure was Polycrates might ascer tain by sending to inspect it, and a part would willingly be given as the price of safety. Polycrates, who was greatly in need of money, at once fell into the trap. In spite of the warning of his daughter, he crossed over with a few Samians to Magnesia.

The Samians with him were dismissed uninjured, and reminded that they owed their freedom to Oroetes ; the retinue were kept as slaves, and among them was Democedes.1 32. It is easier to kill a tyrant than to dispose of his power. On the death of his master, Maeandrius, who was in possession of his palace, assembled the notables of Samos, and proposed that the government should be restored to them, making at the same time some limitations in his own favour ; but the proposal was rejected, and Maeandrius was compelled to maintain himself as tyrant (supra, p. 439). Not many years elapsed before Syloson, the brother of Polycrates, The Persians who had once gratified Darius by the present in Samos. of a scarlet cloak, was restored to Samos, with the help of Otanes and a force of Persians. When Otanes arrived at the island no one attempted to offer any resistance, and even Maeandrius was willing to retire. But his brother Charilaus, who was partly insane, urged Maeandrius to attack the Persian soldiers while off their guard in expec- Treachery of tation of the peaceable cession of the island, or Chaniaus. at any rate to give him the command of his mercenaries. Maeandrius was base enough to listen to this proposal ; his own retreat from the island was secure ; he reflected with pleasure that Samos would not pass unscathed into the hands of Syloson. He withdrew to the sea-shore by a secret passage, and meanwhile Charilaus threw open the gates of the Acropolis, and fell upon the unsuspecting Persians. He succeeded in cutting down a number of picked men, but when the rest of the force came up he was driven with his soldiers into the Acropolis. Otanes now determined on revenge ; the instructions of Darius, that The island is he was not to kill or enslave any Samian, netted. an(j to place the island uninjured in the hands of Syloson, \" he forgot while bearing them in mind,\" and commanded his soldiers to slay every citizen \u2014 man or boy. 1 Herod, iii. 120-125."], [537, "XVI. 33.] THE GREEK ISLANDS: DELOS. 519 Samos was \" netted\" after the Persian manner, and delivered over to Syloson, \"empty of men.\" The tyranny thus re established for Syloson passed to his son Aeaces, who was reigning at the time of the Ionian revolt.1 Delos. 33.

Thucydides tells us that in \" ancient days \" there was a great gathering of the Ionians and neighbouring islanders at Delos ; thither they brought their wives and children to be present at the Deiian games, at which musical and gymnastic contests were held, and the cities celebrated choral dances. A picture of the festival has been preserved for us in the Hymn to Deiian Apollo, from which indeed Thucydides quotes his description. We can see the Ionians in their long sweeping robes of white, their hair fastened into a knot with golden grasshoppers; such was their splendour, so brave the show, that \"one who looked thereon would say that they were immortals who knew not age.\" \"There is also another marvel, whereof the glory will never perish,\" the chorus of Deiian maids, who sang first of Apollo, of Leto and Artemis, and then took up the praise of famous men and women of old ; so charming was the song that all around 'stood tranced to hear,' \" for they imitate the tones and gestures of all, The minstrei and every one seems to be speaking with his of Chios. own lips.\" \"Fare ye well, maidens,\" the minstrel prays; \" speak of me also in the after-time, whensoever a wayworn 1 Herod, iii. 139-149 ; vi. 13.

Modern criticism has, however, compelled us to abandon the idea that the Homeric hymns were the work of the authors of the Iliad or Odyssey, and there appears to be no evidence by which we can fix the date of the Hymn to Apollo.1 But the antiquity of the Deiian festival is supported by the sacrifices and chorus which the Messenians sent to it in the generation which preceded the first Messenian war (i.e. circa 770 B.C.)\u2014 on which occasion the hymn was composed by Eumelus of Corinth (supra, p. 261). Two centuries later the prosperity of the Ionian cities of Athens and Samos added new splendour to the great Ionian festival. Pisistratus purified Delos by removing all the tombs which lay within sight of the temple, and Polycrates presented the adjacent island of Bhenea to the deity. But the disasters which subsequently overtook Ionia owing to the extension of the Persian empire led to a decline of the great Ionian gathering ; and for some time before it was resuscitated by the Athenians in 426 B.C. the festival fell into comparative neglect.

Our earliest picture represents the island as containing one hundred cities, all of which are in the control of a single monarch. A genealogy was in vented by which Minos became the father of Deucalion, whose son was Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans at Troy. But what we know of Crete in historical times by no means corresponds to this description. The monarchy has dis appeared, and in the place of the hundred subject cities are a number of independent communities, inhabited by Dorian Greeks, and governed by institutions which appear to have been almost identical in every city. The The Cretan Greek historians and philosophers of the fourth institutions. century B.C. regarded the Cretan institutions as the oldest in Hellas, and it was the general opinion that Lacedaemon, whose laws were the admiration of all, had obtained at least the germs of her polity and her training from the colony of Lyctus.1 35. The Cretan institutions present a curious mixture of equality and exclusiveness, of a people who were trained to live in common, and of nobles who were able to set laws at defiance. The chief executive officers were the ten Cosmi, who if chosen by the whole people were chosen only from certain privileged families. The length of time during which they held office is uncertain, but as we hear of suspensions and resignations it is reason- 1 We do indeed hear of a king Etearchus at Oaxus, or Axus, in Herodotus (iv. 154), but we do not know that the historian is using the word \" king \" in the sense of ' ' monarch \" (Hybrias says that he is called \" a mighty king,\" infra, p. 526). There were subject cities in Crete into which the Dorian institutions never penetrated (Itt-i)kooi, see infra). For the Cretan seamen, see Herod, iv. 151, and the proverb, 6 Kpi)s dyvoel BdXacro-av ; and for the commanding position of the island, Arist.

The Cosmi were not only the chief rulers of the state, but also the generals-in-chief of the community. From those who had been Cosmi were chosen the Gerontes or elders, who formed the Council, which therefore consisted of men taken from privileged families. Of the Councillors we only know that they held office for life, that they were not required to give any account of their office (dvim-evOwoi), and were uncontrolled in their decisions (avToyvdipove';). The mode of election, the age of admission, the numbers, the duties are unknown. These exclusive elements in the Cretan institutions were balanced by a popular assembly composed of all the free citizens of full age, before which important questions were brought for confirmation. The citizens might accept or reject (?) the proposals brought before them by the Cosmi and Gerontes, but no discussion was allowed ; no citizen had the right to speak in the Assembly.1 When we compare these arrangements with the Lacedae monian constitution, we find that the Cretan Cosmi united the military and political functions which at Sparta were divided between the kings and the ephors. But while the kings were hereditary, the Cosmi were elected ; and while the ephors were chosen indiscriminately from all the Spar tans, the right to become a Cosmos was restricted to certain privileged families. The Cosmi, like the ephors, are spoken of as ' chance persons ' (01 tv\\6vt\u20acs), which implies that no special qualification was required for the office ; but the evils which we should have expected to arise out of such elections were obviated partly by the very limited scale on which the Cretan Cosmi were called upon to act as generals, and partly by the training which enabled every Cretan to be at least an efficient soldier, if not a competent general. In fact, the 1 See Arist. Pol. ii. c. 10, with Newman's notes.

The restriction of the councillors to those who had been Cosmi is at first sight a striking distinction between the Lacedaemonian and Cretan constitution, yet the hereditary right of the Spartan kings to sit in an assembly which was otherwise elective offers a certain resemblance to the Cretan arrangements which con fined the privilege of being elected to a few families. 36. As in Sparta, so in Crete the constitution was sup ported by a system of training and common meals. The principle in both was the same ; there was to be a complete separation between the military and the productive classes, every citizen was to be a soldier and to live for the state ; but the details of the arrangements were different. The systematic training did not begin at Crete till the age of seventeen, though fathers took their sons at a The training far earlier age to the common dining-halls, at Crete. where they sat on the floor and listened to the conversation of their elders, or waited upon them at dinner. At seventeen the boys were formed into troops, not, however, in any fixed numbers, but every youth of distinction was allowed to form as large a \"troop\" as he could get together; and the troop so formed was placed under the supervision of the father of the youth who had collected it. The members of the same troop had common sleeping-places, and took their meals together. The training went on for ten years, and consisted chiefly in running, in learning the use of arms and the bow ; in scanty fare and clothing ; in hunting on the hills of Crete; in conflicts between the various troops, in which the combatants, marching to the sound of music, fought with their fists, or even with steel. A certain number of youths were also trained as mounted soldiers, for in Crete the \"knights\" had horses, though the Spartans had not! When the training came to an end the youths, who were now in their twenty-eighth year, became full citizens; all"], [542, "CRETE: THE SERFS. [XVI. 37. 524 those who passed out of a troop at the same time were ex pected to marry at once, though they did not take their wives home till they were of an age to manage household affairs. After marriage, as before, the men dined at common tables.1 The common meals at Crete were not furnished, as at Sparta, by the contributions of the individual members, who The common lost their citizenship if unable to provide the meals. quota, but by the state. The public funds were divided into two halves, of which one went to the sup port of the temples and payment of state services, the other to the Syssitia. At the common meal rich and poor were on the same footing ; no one could be deprived of his franchise by a failure of crops, or the invasion of an enemy. Even the wives and children of the citizens were supported at least to some extent from this fund. This arrangement, however communistic it may appear, by no means excluded the exist ence of unequal private property at Crete. It was only the public funds, arising from the cattle fed on public lands, or from the contributions of subjects, which were thus applied ; the private estates of the citizens were entirely within their own control.2 37. Like the Spartan, the Cretan system of common meals and training rested on the distinction between a dominant The serfs and a conquered race \u2014 between those who at Crete. owned and those who tilled the soil.

Like them they were adscripti glebae, and bound to furnish a certain amount of the produce of the soil to the owner ; like them they were not allowed to wear the arms of the freeman, the lance, the sword and the shield (though they might serve as bowmen). In other respects they enjoyed a far better position than the Helots, and those who were the serfs of private masters appear to have succeeded under certain cir cumstances to a share of the property. On the other hand there was no class in Crete which exactly corresponded to the Perioeci of Sparta. For in Crete there was no sovereign city, but a number of cities which had been acquired by gradual colonisation ; the country had never been subdued from one end to the other by a conquering people, as Laconia was subdued by the Spartans. The towns which had not received Dorian institutions in the island seem to have governed themselves, paying a fixed amount of tribute to the Dorian cities ; their position resembled that of the Magnetes or Perr haebians in Thessaly ; they were not, like the Perioeci of Sparta, embodied in the Dorian states and without an in dependent existence.1 38. The intellectual training of the Cretans was of the very slightest nature. The boys were taught to read and write (ypappara), and instructed in the ele- Inteiiectuai ments of what was known as \" music \" in training of Greek education. To march in time and sing a few warlike songs was a part of their martial exercise, and when taken to the dining halls by their fathers the boys could hear the discussion of public business and the praises 1 Arist.

We hear of Thaletas as a poet who aided greatly in the development of the training in Crete and Sparta; but the only fruit of Cretan poetical o-enius which has come down to us is the song of Hybrias : The song of \" Sword and spear are to me a mine of wealth, Hybrias. and the goodly buckler, my body's defence: with this I plough, with this I reap, with this I trample the sweet wine from the grape ; by this am I known as a Lord of the Serfs.

The Cretan prophet Epimenides (supra, p. 403) spoke of his countrymen as \" always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies;\" Aristotle observes that they avoided the difficulties arising from over-population by affording op portunities for unnatural vice ; and in the time of Polybius the Cretans were notorious throughout Hellas for their treachery and greed. In that historian's opinion it was absurd to compare the institutions of Sparta and Crete, for institutions are known by their fruits, and who would compare a Spartan with a Cretan 1 2 39.

But owing to differ ences in the institutions themselves, and still more to differ ences in the circumstances of Crete and Lacedaemon, it was inevitable that the principles should have different results in the two countries. Firstly : At Sparta the ephorate and the 1 Bergk, Poet. Lyr. Graec. iii. 651. \u00a5.pr}res dei -^sevarai, KaKa drjpia, yamepes dpyal. Arist. Pol. ii.

But the office of the Cosmi at Crete, who were at once elective and hereditary, was too exclusive to answer to the wishes of the whole community. We hear that the magistrates were sometimes suspended by a party of powerful nobles who wished to escape the penalty of their misdeeds, or that they resigned before the term of office was complete. In these periods of suspension the character of the government was changed, and what was nominally a \" polity,\" or a government conducted in the interests of all, became the rule of a family in its own behalf, which the Greeks called a \"dynasty.\" Secondly: At Lacedaemon there was one city only, in Crete there were many ; and as they were often at war with each other, Crete was disturbed by domestic hostilities from which Sparta was entirely free. These conflicts might have ended in the entire ruin of the Dorian communities had it not been agreed by common consent that arms were never to be placed in the hands of the serfs. Thirdly : The Cretan serfs could not, like the Helots, seize the opportunity of their masters' absence in foreign wars to rise against them ; owing to the number of the cities they were broken up into smaller groups ; every town aided its neighbour against the common enemy, and no one city had such a force of rebels to repress as Sparta. Fourthly : In an island, which could neither make nor mar among the neighbours, bribery by foreign states was unknown among the high officials. Greedy as the Cretans were, and eao-er to make money by any and every means, the Cosmi seem to have been free from the stain, perhaps because they never enjoyed the opportunity, of selling the interests of of their country. Fifthly : Though the insular position of Crete was thought by Aristotle to have provided a natural equivalent for the \"expulsions of strangers\" so common at Sparta, it is obvious that an island situated in the highway"], [546, "THE ORIENTAL GREEKS: CYRENE. XVI. 40. 528 of trade is less cut off from intercourse with the world than a city hidden in a remote mountain valley. The Cretans certainly did not discourage the visits of strangers, and special arrangements were made in the dining-halls for the reception of guests. But this hospitality never drew them into the circle of Greek politics ; they lived apart, often sending out troops of mercenary archers, but neither entering into alliances, nor attempting conquests.1 CYRENE.

Battus was succeeded by his son Arcesilaus II., sur named theCruel. A quarrel between this king and his brothers led to the foundation of Barca by the discontented princes, who also caused the Libyans to revolt from Cyrene. Arcesilaus attempted to suppress the rebellion. For a time the Libyans retreated before his army, but on reaching a place called Leucon, they turned and attacked their pursuers. The Cyrenaeans were totally defeated ; no fewer than 7000 hoplites being left on the field. After this disaster Arcesilaus fell ill, and when suffering from the effects of a drug he was smothered by his brother Learchus, who was in turn treacherously assassinated by Eryxo, the wife of Arcesilaus. The throne now passed to the son of Arcesilaus, Battus the Third, who was lame. To men so sensitive of bodily defects in their rulers as the Greeks, this seemed an aggravation of misfortune, and in their distress the Cyrenaeans applied to Delphi for advice. They were bidden to put their affairs in the hands of a citizen of Mantinea in Arcadia, whence a leading citizen named Demonax was sent to be the legis lator of Cyrene. His reforms were democratic. Demonax He arranged the citizens in three tribes, of atcyrene. which the first included the Theraeans and perioeci; the second the Peloponnesians and Cretans, and the third the rest of the islanders. Battus was allowed to keep the royal domain and the priesthoods, but the political powers which the kings had enjoyed were transferred to the people.1 1 Herod, iv. 159-161.

Defeated in this attempt, he went into Arcesilaus in. exlle at Samos, while his mother Pheretima, and Pheretima. who supported him in his ambition, retired to Cyprus. At this time Evelthon was king of Salamis, and to him Pheretima applied for help ; but her application was in vain. Evelthon was willing to give her anything but an army, and at length, when she still persisted in her request, he sent her a golden distaff and spindle, \" and a supply of wool,\" as the gifts most suitable for a woman. Arcesilaus was more fortunate at Samos ; he was able to collect a considerable force by holding out the prospect of a division of land at Cyrene, and, encouraged by an ambiguous oracle, he led his forces to the city, from which he succeeded in expelling his opponents. In his victory he forgot the warning of the oracle, and proceeded to acts of cruelty, which when too late he foresaw would bring upon him the wrath of the deity. In order to avert the impending evil he retired from Cyrene to Barca, leaving his mother regent in his stead. His wife was the daughter of Alazir, king of Barca ; to him, therefore, he might confidently look for protection. But when walking in the market-place he was recognised by some Cyrenaean refugees, The Death of who, with the aid of the Barcaeans, fell upon Arcesilaus. him and slew him.

The Barcaeans replied that they were all equally implicated; the king had been justly punished for the numerous acts of oppression of which he was guilty. The Persian army now arrived at Barca, and when a second demand for the assassins was met by a second The Persians refusal, it at once invested the city.

After digging a wide trench and covering it over with soil, he took his stand upon this manufactured ground, and agreed with the Barcaeans that they should pay tribute to the king, but remain otherwise unmolested, so long as the earth upon which they stood remained the same. On this the Barcaeans opened their gates, and received the Persians into the city, who no sooner found themselves in possession of the walls than they broke in the soil upon which they had stood when concluding the treaty, and declared the agreement void ! Those who had taken a leading part in the murder of Arcesilaus were given up to Pheretima, who impaled them outside the city walls, to which she also affixed the breasts of their wives. The rest of the Barcaeans, except the Battiadae and those who supported them, were enslaved by the Persians ; Pheretima left her friends in command of the city. On their return the Persians were allowed to pass through the city of Cyrene. Badres, who of course could render no assistance at the inland town of Barca, attempted to make up for his enforced inaction by urging Amasis to seize the place, but Amasis refused to commit a new act of treachery; he was sent against Barca, not against Cyrene.

We hear of a council at which Pheretima attended after her son left Cyrene for Barca; how it was elected, and what were its functions is not stated. The perioeci who are mentioned as forming the first tribe with the Theraeans \u2014 i.e. with the original settlers \u2014 were perhaps Libyans.1 Herodotus is of opinion that Libya cannot be compared in fertility with Europe or Asia, but to this general statement he allows some exceptions. The land round the Cinyps (p. 438) was unlike the rest of Libya, and equal to products and the very best land, even to Babylonia, in pro- trade of ducing wheat, the yield being at times three- yr< hundred-fold. The land of the Euesperitae was also excel lent, producing a hundred-fold in a good season. Of the fertility of the Cyrenaica Herodotus says less than later authors, but he calls attention to the peculiar advantages of situation which Cyrene enjoyed, owing to the elevation of the site, which was the highest in this part of Libya. Crops could be gathered there for eight months in the year, first on the low land near the shore, next on the middle ground, and last on the terrace above the city. The Cyrenaeans exported a large amount of vegetable produce ; \u2014 wine, oil, dates, etc., but the most important article of commerce was the far-famed silphium, of which every part was valuable \u2014 the fruit, the stem, the leaf, the juice. The exact nature of this plant is uncertain; it is described by Theophrastus, and is often represented on Cyrenaean coins ; but either the plant is extinct (and Strabo says that it was becoming scarce in his time), or the description is not suffi ciently exact to allow of identification.2 1 The tribes of Cyrene (cf.

For two centuries before this time the old empire of the Pharaohs, which in Decline of the reign of Bamses the Great (circa 1320 Egypt. B.C.) extended from Nubia to Syria, had been falling to decay. The Egyptians were at no time a warlike nation ; they preferred paying soldiers to fighting their own battles, and an ever-increasing multitude of mercenaries, the Ma or Mashawasha of the inscriptions, was introduced from Libya. The inevitable result followed. A soldier class was formed which in time became the ruling power in the country ; a number of principalities grew up, each governed by a soldier-chief whose authority depended mainly on the swords at his disposal \u2014 the twelve kings of the narrative of Herodotus. Meanwhile an Ethiopian empire arose at Napata near Mount Barkal in Nubia, which by degrees extended its power as Ethiopian far northwards as Thebes, where, by forming Kings, alliances with the powerful priests of Amon, it became the representative of the old civilisation of Egypt. Then at the close of the eighth century the Assyrians ap peared on the scene, and a struggle began for the supremacy of the country. At one time the Ethiopians were able to Assyrian assert their authority \u2014 which was however invaders. little more than nominal \u2014 over the soldier chiefs ; at another Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal carried fire and sword to Memphis and Thebes. Amid this confusion"], [553, "XVI. 43.] PSAMMETICHUS & HIS MERCENARIES. 535 Psammetichus, the prince of Sais, was able to establish his power over his rival chiefs. How he first rose to eminence, whether he was the viceroy of the Ethiopian Pharaoh or the vassal of the Assyrian conqueror, seems doubtful : what is certain is that he owed his throne mainly to the help of Ionian and Carian mercenaries ; that he justified his claim to become the Pharaoh of Egypt by marrying the niece of Sabako, the first of the Ethiopian monarchs (whose dynasty failed in the male line) ; and that Assurbanipal, owing to troubles nearer home, was unable to shake him from his position.1 Thus the Greeks entered Egypt. At first they came as soldiers only. Psammetichus could not expect the support of the Egyptian mercenaries, for they were to a large extent in the service of the rival princes, whom he had outstripped in the race for the throne. It was necessary for him to retain the new-comers in his pay. On either side of the Pelusiac arm of the Nile, a little below the city of Bubastis, he established the Ionians and Carians in \" camps,\" where they remained till the reign of Amasis, who removed them to Memphis to be his own body-guard, and in order to facilitate communication he placed Egyptian boys with the mercenaries that they might learn their language.2 Such obvious partiality to foreigners created a bitter feel ing of jealousy in the Egyptian military caste. Herodotus tells us that no fewer than 240,000 of the native or Libyan soldiers, wearied with the excessive service which Psam- Difficulties metichus imposed upon them by keeping them *n|,sina^fa\u00b0\u2122 for three years without change in the guard- shown to the stations of Elephantine (in the south), Daphne Greeks.

They were followed by 1 Wiedemaun, Geschichte Aegyptens, p. 606, speaks of Psammetichus as the viceroy of Nut-amen, the last Ethiopian Pharaoh; Maspero (Histoire ancienne, p. 528, ed. 4,) speaks of his fidelity to Assyria. The Greek authorities for Psammetichus are Herod, ii. 147-15S ; Diodorus, i. 66 ff. ; Polyaenus, vii. 3 (worthless) ; Strabo, p. 801. 2 Herod, ii. 154."], [554, "GREEKS IN EGYPT. [XVI. 43 536 Psammetichus, who endeavoured to induce them to return, but in vain, and they remained in Ethiopia on the lands allotted to them. That a King Psammetichus marched into Nubia is one of the most certain events in Egyptian history; the Greek mercenaries who accompanied him have left a record of their visit in the inscriptions on the leg of the colossus of Bamses at Abou-Simbel in Nubia. But whether the Psam metichus mentioned in the inscriptions is the first or the second king of the name cannot be decided, and the number of the deserters is no doubt exaggerated. Psammetichus was succeeded by Necho, who devoted his reign to the development of the trade and navigation of Egypt. He began the construction of a canal which was to connect the Mediterranean with the Bed sea ; he sent Phoenician ships round Africa, which proved for the first time that the continent was circumnavigable ; and for the protection of commerce he maintained ships of war on the Mediterranean and the Bed sea. His son was Psammetichus H., who after a short reign was succeeded by Apries or Hophrah. Apries is said to have increased the number of the mercenaries to 30,000, and when the expedition against Cyrene failed, on which he had sent Egyptian troops only, an open mutiny took place among the native soldiers, who believed that their comrades had been wilfully sent to destruction (p. 529). Amasis, the king's brother-in-law, was despatched to recall them to obedience, but the troops persuaded him to put himself at their head and march against Apries, who attempted to meet them with his Greek mercenaries. A battle took place at Momemphis, in which Apries was defeated and taken prisoner. After reigning for six years as co-regent with Amasis he was put to death (569 B.C.).1 1 For the deserters, Herod, ii. 30, Diod. i. 67. For Necho, Herod, ii. 158, iv. 42 ; for Psammetichus H., Apries, Amasis, ib. ii. 161 ff. Maspero and E. Meyer accept the story of the desertion, and decide for Psam metichus I. Wiedemann rejects it, and considers that the inscriptions were written during an invasion of Ethiopia by Psammetichus II."], [555, "XVI. 44, 45.] GREEK COLONY OF NAUCRATIS. 537 44. Amasis was now king of Egypt, and the troops with whose aid he had won his position might reasonably look forward to an anti-Hellenic reaction which would restore to them their old privileges. But in this they were bitterly dis appointed. Amasis had no sooner gained the throne than he manifested the strongest inclination to play a very in dependent part as Pharaoh. He refused to submit to the old solemn ceremonial, and when he was not occupied with the business of his office he indulged himself in genial pleasures with his friends. So far from favouring the Egyptian soldiery, he removed the Ionians from their camp on the Pelusiac arm of the Nile to Memphis, in order that they might become his body-guard. He married a Greek wife from the family of the Battiadae of Cyrene. He even allowed Greek mer chants to settle at the city of Naucratis in the Delta \u2014 which he appears to have given up to them \u2014 and to L A \u00b0 .

When we remember how sensitive the Greeks showed 1 Herod, ii. 154, 178. That a city on the site of Naucratis was in existence in the time of Psammetichus I. is rendered probable by the scarabaei found there ; and as these scarabaei come to an end with the beginning of the reign of Amasis, it is not unlikely that a change of population was made then. There is a doubt whether Psammetichus I. allowed traders to settle in Egypt (Diodorus), or whether this was first permitted by Amasis (Herodotus). Strabo has a story of a MiXrjo-iav re'ixos, founded near the Bolbitinic mouth of the Nile, iu the time of Psammetichus, and he represents the Milesians as subsequently founding Naucratis after \"defeating Inaros at sea\" (p. 801). Necho also sent presents to the temple of Apollo of Branchidae (Herod, ii. 159), at which we find an imitation of Egyptian art. There is therefore evidence of a close connection between Miletus and Egypt before the time of Amasis. But Strabo's account is very obscure, and Necho merely sent dvaBrjpara to the god of the nation which assisted him. It is difficult to believe that Amasis can have restricted the privileges already granted to the Greeks by confining thera under pain of death to one emporium, when hitherto they had been permitted to enter Egypt freely.

[XVI. 45. 538 themselves to the civilisation with which they were brought into contact in Asia Minor, we should expect to find them borrowing largely from the far more ancient and far more advanced civilisation of Egypt. That they did not was due to The Greeks the circumstances under which they first entered little in- the country, the restrictions imposed upon Egynp\"anby them, and the exclusive spirit which governed civilisation. Egyptian society and religion. The mercenaries whom Psammetichus introduced were established in camps in the Delta apart from the Egyptians, and so far as we know they only visited other parts of Egypt on military service ; even the merchants whom Amasis received into the country were not allowed to settle or to trade except at Naucratis, which was also situated in the Delta. The Greeks therefore had little opportunity of visiting the great temples and tombs ; or of acquainting themselves with Egyptian life and manners. The habits and customs of the Egyptians were also of such a kind as to place an impassable barrier between the Greeks and themselves.

The minute rules for purification observed by the Egyptians, the preservation of the body by embalmment, the worship of animals were to the Greeks foolishness. Much might have been learned about Egypt from the written monu ments at Memphis, when Amasis transplanted the Ionians thither, but the hieroglyphics were quite unintelligible to the Greeks, and probably to the common people of Egypt, while Learned the attitude of the learned class towards Egyptians foreigners was one of patronising contempt. despised the \u00b0 r \u00b0. , Greek.

To what extent they were acquainted with the past history of their own country we do not know, but they never hesitated to repeat fabulous and inaccurate stories about it. These stories were in fact the history of Egypt as it was known to the common people, from whom it passed to the Greeks through the mouths of ignorant inter preters. Even so patent a falsehood as the rise of the Nile in springs between Elephantine and Syene seems to have been thought by the scribe at Sais an explanation good enough to give to Herodotus. When at length, by the foundation of Alexandria, Greeks and Egyptians were brought more closely together, the civilisation of both countries was too effete to give or receive any quickening impulse. The Greeks may have acquired additions to their knowledge of mathematics and medicine from the Egyptians, from whom also the name of Epaphus and the worship of Isis passed to Greece at an early stage in the intercourse of the two countries. For the rest, Egypt was the Thibet of the day ; and Egyptian doctrines on \"the last things,\" real or supposed, had an attraction for the \" esoteric Buddhists \" of Greece, which increased as specula tion became more spiritual than philosophical.1 1 By the time of Diodorus (see i. 69) it was believed that Orpheus, Homer, Pythagoras and Solon had visited Egypt in spite of the dangers which awaited aliens in that land before the reign of Psammetichus. This is of course a fiction due to admiration of the antiquity of Egypt. Herodotus is misled in the same direction, and discovers impossible connections between Egypt and Greece. Putting aside some scientific knowledge, the earlier Greeks borrowed nothing from Egypt but the doctrine of immortality, of transmigration\u2014 if indeed this is Egyptian\u2014 and the worship of Isis. Neither the art, nor the music, nor the poetry, nor the philosophy of the Greeks in their best days was influenced by Egypt."], [558, "NOTE. 540 NOTE ON THE LAWS OF SOLON, Page 418. The following passage from Demosthenes (?) (Against Euergus and Mnesibulus, Kennedy, vol. v. pp. 95, 96) shows what difficulties lay before a man who wished to prosecute any one for the murder of a person not belonging to his own family. The woman to whom allusion is made had been the nurse of the plaintiff in the suit (which concerned false testimony). For her fidelity she had been set free ; she married and lived with her husband, but after his death she came back to the plaintiff's house. While attempting to defend his property, she had been beaten by the defendants, and died from the blows : \u2014 \" After her death I went to the Interpreters, to learn what course I ought to take in the matter ; and I detailed to them everything which had taken place, the arrival of these men, the attachment of the woman to our family, the cause of my having her in my house, and that she had lost her life for not giving up the cup. The Interpreters, having heard my story, asked me whether they should expound the law to me only, or give me advice also. I replied, ' Both.' ' Very well,' they said, 'then we will expound to you what the law is, and advise you what is for your good. The first thing is to carry a spear in front of the funeral procession, and to make proclamation at the tomb, if there is any one connected with the woman ; and, after that, you must watch the tomb for three days. The advice that we give you is as follows : \u2014 As you were not present yourself, but only your wife and children, and you have no other witnesses, we recommend you not to make proclamation against any one by name, but generally against the homicides and guilty parties ; and further, not to commence proceedings before the king-archon. For the woman does not come within the law to enable you, as she is no relation, and was not even a servant, according to your account. It is to relations and masters that the law assigns the duty of prosecuting. Should you therefore take an oath in the Palladium, you aud your wife and children, and should you imprecate curses upon yourselves and your house, many people will form an unfavourable opinion of you, and, if your adversary be acquitted, you will be thought to have committed perjury ; and, if you convict him, you will incur public odium. Our advice is, that you perform the necessary religious ceremonies for yourself and your house, then bear the misfortune as patiently as you can, and take vengeance, if you like, in some other way.' \""], [559, "INDEX I {The first numeral refers to the Chapter ; the second to the Section.)
