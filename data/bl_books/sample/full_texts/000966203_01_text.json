Donnant, who added to it, an account of the situation of the United States of America. The result of what he has given, will be found in the few pages that follow. Though the translation is not altogether literal, and I have illustrated the account by means of a divided circle, I hope Mr. Donnant will not consider that as altering his work, or taking an improper liberty with it, as he has in au unequi vocal manner approved of my mode of illustrat ing Statistical Accounts by the aid of geometry, which is evident by the following extracts taken from his dedication to Mr. Chaptal, minister for the home department at Paris, prefixed to the translation of my work. \" It is not a general statistique that I in\u00bb -' tended to give, but rather the elements of a 3"], [18, "VI \" that study rendered easy to every one ; and \" those who will take the trouble to read this \" volume will find what principally constitutes \" the first principles of that branch of know -* ledge.

It has, in my opinion, two \" great advantages, that of being short, and of \" representing to the eye at once, the arranged \" analysis of all that it contains. To speak, to \" the judgement and imagination both at once, \" is the surest method of making an impres \" sion on the memory ; it is therefore the best \" mode of teaching a difficult science.\" \" The most part ofstatistic.il works which have \" appeared till now are so voluminous, that those <\u25a0* who are not initiated in that study are afraid to \u2022*\u25a0* begin, least the instruction they might reap"], [19, "VII \" should not repay the labour they must neces \" sarily undergo.\" ** The best method of attracting students to '* that science, so useful, butsolittle understood, \" was to produce a work which might suit almost \" every rank of society. \u2014 This is the end which \" William Playfair proposed to himself ; it rc \" mains for the public to judge whether he has \"succeeded.

Without the aid of the government, in this study, individuals can make but little pro gress in any country, and their labours must remain very imperfect. In our old world, the progressive state of population in its early stages is disgraced by fiction, or drowned in oblivion ; and even in our enquiries into the present state of things we are perpetually interrupted by antiquated customs, the prejudices of many, and the indifference and negligence of nearly all. In your new country it is quite the reverse ; the progress may be traced, and the present situation ascertained.

No authentic records exist to make u? acquainted with the progress of population in the ancient world ; and if they did exist, they would scarcely serve us for a fair comparison. The United States, in possession of all the arts and inventions which have since those earlyperiods increased the powers andabbrevi- ated the labours of men, must naturally advance with far greater rapidity. Situated on a Continent, whichenjoys all the advantages of a large island, without dangerous neighbours to invade them, their fertile country interspersed with the finest navigable rivers \u25a0on the face of the earth. Enjoying a good government, speak- ing all the same language, having Europe as a market for their superfluous produce, and as a store-house for those manufac tures which they have not yet established amongst themselves, it would be difficult to conceive any nation enjoying a more complete assemblage of those favourable circumstances which lead to wealth and greatness, than we find concentrated in the United States of America. No kingdom in Europe is much more fully peopled than the Province of New York ; and when we consider with what"], [28, "16 facility its inhabitants can emigrate to the Western Countries, the short time it has been settled, and that it is not the most fertile portion of the United States, it seems fair to suppose that the average population of the whole country will not fall much short of that. In the Province of New York there are 147 persons to a square mile ; let us then suppose the whole country to arrive at 100, which is only two-thirds, and the num ber of inhabitants will amount to 130 millions, a population not much inferior to that of all the nations in Europe. The era at which this new country will jjrobably arise at snch a degree of population may, perhaps, seem very distant ; but if we judge by what has already taken place, we are not justified in thinking so, as the Census taken of the people about 14 years back, and again within the last three years, will make abundantly evident. The period between the first and second enumeration is nearly 12 years, and during that time the population had increased in, the ratio of 3 to 8, or rather more than 1 to 2J. That we may not err in calculating on too rapid an increase, let us, however, suppose it only to double in the period of 1 5 years, and that the population in 1800 was 8 millions, then in the year 1815 it will be 16 mil lions, in 1830 it will be 32 millions, and in 1845, 74 millions, and before the end of the present century that country will be fully peopled. It may be said that, long before the population attains the height in question, the rapidity of its progress will be abated. It is indeed possible that it may be so in some degree; but we are not warranted in such a conclusion from the state of New York, where the population is far beyond that on which we calculate, yet it has not of late gone on much less rapidly than those that are more thinly peopled. The United States are then approaching to a degree of power ancl greatness, so far as extent of territory and number"], [29, "17 cf inhabitants constitute them, of which our ancient Europe affords no example. In China, perhaps, we might find something like a parallel as to numbers of men and extent of territory, but there is rery little analogy between the character of the Chinese and the Anglo-Americans, and between their governments still less, so that we do not find on the whole globe any thing to be compared to what the United States are likely soon to become. They arc upon al most gigantic scale ; a third rate pro vince is equal in extent to France, with all her aggrandizements, and the whole is equal in magnitude, and probably may soon be in population, to all the nations in Europe, the Russian dominions excepted. The divided circle which represents the surface of the coun try, has been constructed for the purpose of shewing, in an easy and accurate manner, the proportional extent of the dif ferent provinces ; and it is scarcely possible to look at it with out a few important observations occurring to the mind. The great inequality of the divisions will naturally lead to a new organization when the country comes to be more equally peopled, for not to speak of the fine territory of the West, which is intended to form different States, the proportion of Virginia to the Delaware is rather too preposterous to remain as it is at present. The whole country is too extensive to remain under one government for a long period \u2014 there is at least no example of a republic on so large a scale. The Anglo-Americans, as they may be called, extending so far already, and increasing so fast, will naturally take pos session of the mouths of all the rivers that convey their pro duce to the ocean or the Gulph of Mexico. They will settla"], [30, "18 to the West of the Mississippi, so as by securing both shores to have full possession of the navigation. The extent to which they may go in that direction will probably be as far as the rivers that fall into the Mississippi are navigable, and the lands well watered. This would include a country of nearly a million of square miles, and would almost double the extent of the civilized and peopled portion of America. It would admit of a population of 200,000,000. All that prodigious extent of country will be peopled with men speaking the English language, and having English laws and manners, and naturally disposed to use English manufac tures, in preference to those of any other nation. On this subject we shall make some remarks hereafter, it is sufficient to observe at present, that there is every reason for thinking that the interests of these Western people, and of his Britannic Majesty's subjects, will lead to a lasting and beneficial connection both in politics and commerce. The United States of America were British Colonies till the 4th of July, 1776. It was on that memorable day that the Representatives of the different Provinces made a solemn declaration, in which they explained their motives for throw ing off their allegiance to the King of Great Britain, appeal ing to the Supreme Being for the justice of their cause, and the uprightness of their intentions, in declaring themselves free and independent. The Deputies to the Congress were 55 in number, who swore to maintain that declaration at the peril of their live* and fortunes. The States were then 13 in number, and each was to preserve its sovereignty, liberty, and independence, joining, however, into a league or confederation for their mu tual safety and protection; this compact was afterwards ratified"], [31, "19 en the 9th of July, 1778.

The rapid increase of the Western Territory is chiefly occa sioned by emigration from the Oid States, as well as from Eu rope, and there is not a doubt but that when highways have been cleared, and the navigation of the rivers a little assisted by art, it will become one of the finest and most flourishing coun tries on the surface of the globe. The price of passage from France to America is from 25 to 301. in the cabin, and half-price in the steerage. The Ame rican ships in general are thinly manned, and not so well provided in case of sickness as French or English vessels. Good land, uncultivated, may be had from lOd. to 5s. the acre, and it is well in purchasing not to go to any great distance from a navigable river. In 1794 lots of 100 acres of land, in Virginia, might be purchased for 1001. one half of which was cultivated, and the other half covered with wood, together with a large house, some cattle, and all the agricultural instruments necessary \u2014 but such bargains cannot now be had ; in many cases prices having risen 20 per cent, since that time. The hire of a waggon is two dollars a day. When one goes a journey of six or eight days into the interior of the country, it is necessary to carry a tent and provisions. In the Southern States, where slavery is still admitted, 'he hire of a male negro is from four to five dollars a month, and of a black woman from two to three dollars. One negro can clear a quarter of an acre a day, or if the B 3"], [34, "22 trees are very large, half the quantity. If there is a woman t\u00bb assist, two acres may be cleared in a week.

Pigs are the most lucrative animals to rear ; when young they are cheap, five or six months is sufficient to fatten them, and, as they live in the woods, they cost almost nothing. Implements of agriculture are best purchased in America, they arc as cheap there as in Europe, and better adapted for the business. Nails arc, however, an exception, it is better to buy them in Europe. The principal articles it is necessary to purchass in sea-port towns are, axes, spades, hoes, plough-irons, saws, chissels, &c. 9 In the Western country the prices are not above one-fourth of these."], [35, "23 For a barrel of West India rum you may get five or six pounds, andfor three barrels you may have a large houseerected, together with a stable and other out-houses.

In six months one may clear 20 acres of land, that is to say, cut down the trees, burn the branches, dig round the roots, and prepare wood for en closures, so as to begin to sow in April. It is in that month they plant tobacco and sow maize. Wheat and bailey are sown in November, and oats in February. Negroes are dear in South Carolina, but in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, they may be purchased for 50 or 60 pounds. Negroes in these three last States are very expert at their work. They can in general forge and make tools, construct buildings, and understand the cultivation of the various things; the lands produce. It is best to hire free Negroes, they arc the most industrious and sober, and more profitable than white la bourers, bearing fatigue better, more willing to serve, and at lower wages *.

Though the soil of the American States is fit for producing Tines in many places, and satisfactory trials have been.made, ye( at p esent all their wines arc imported. Those which sell best are Port and Madeira, and in general all the hot wines. The wines of Provence sell well, and are improved by the voyage. Claret sells pretty well, but is not in great request. Champagne and Burgundy run a risk of spoiling daring the voyage, they can only be carried in bottles, and the sale is slow, and attended with little profit; besides the expence of bottles and boxes is considerable. Brandies are still more pro fitable and certain than any sort of wine. This only applies to bra .dies ;n ade from wine, for such as are made from cider or grain are not so good as those distilled in America. Good brandies from Orleans, Bourdeaux, and Languedoc, are of certain sale. Olive oil, dried fruits, prunes, &c. are sold with considerable advantage ; oils for America should be of a middling quality; the best are too dear and sell slowly; the common are apt to become rancid and unsaleable during the vcj age by sea. Oils of a second quality should be bottled and put in boxes of twenty-five or thirty pints, they will then sell readily. Olives are subject to spoil during the voyage ; the sale is slow, and profit small. The large prunes of Tours arc preferred, and are never to bs had there in sufficient quantity, because they are used for im proving the taste and quality of rum, to which they give a. yellowish colour, giving to it an appearance of age."], [37, "25 Lyons silks, gold a*id silver lace (for military uniforms only), and millinery are almost exclusively imported from France. White silk stockings of a second quality, light ruffles, rib bons, silk shoes, and other objects of luxury, sell with con siderable profit, but in small quantities, and whoever takes much of a sort will be disappointed. As to dear articles of a sine quality in dress, they are of a very difficult sale, and it is generally impossible to get any profit on them. Watch and clock work, of a good quality, bear but a middling price ; silver watches from two guineas to four, and gold from four guineas to twenty sell well. French jewellery seils advantageously, but not of a dear sort ; car-rings, bracelets, watch chains, and trinkets, of a middling quality, sell best. In all articles of luxury and taste the assortment should be varied, and the quantity not very considerable. Papers plain and stained sell well, as do mill stones, and plaster of Paris unburnt. Those observations were made by M. Donnant for French trade, but with a few exceptions they will apply to that o f England. In return for the articles sent to America, the principal to lie expected from thence are : From the Southern states tobacco, which is the staple. Vir ginia alone exported formerly sixty millions pounds weight ; Maryland forty millions in the year, but they do not now send near so much. The Carolinas and Georgia on the contrary cul tivate tobacco more than formerly, and other exportation"], [38, "26 increases. In Virginia and Maryland they prefer cultivating wheat maize, hemp, and ilax, as being more certam profitable. The hogshead of tobacco weighs 10001b., and sells in the. country at nine pounds sterling. Georgia and the two Carolinas produce indigo, bnt of au inferior quality ; nevertheless, within these few years in South Carolina, the cultivators have found means to improve its qualities, so that in some cases it is preferable to that of St. Domingo, it may therefore safely be taken in exchange. Turpentine and tar are extracted in great abundance from the fir trees that grow on the coast of Jersey, Virginia, and North Carolina. These two articles are produced there in greater quantities, and cheaper than in any part of the United States. Wheat is the chief staple of all the United States ; of it there is always a surplus, and for it from other countries there is always a demand. It is better to bring wheat than flour to Europe, as the flour is apt to heat ; besides that, grinding is dearer in America than in Europe. For the 'Y\\ est India Islands, on the contrary, flour obtains the preference. The extended coasts of p\\merica are favourable to fisheries, so that the south of Europe, Spain and Portugal in particu lar, receive great quantities of fish in return for wines, liquoiy and fruit. Whale oil makes a considerable article of exportation. The following table will serve to give an idea of the expor tation of the United States.

There are no territorial taxes, nor any interior duty on the necessaries of life. The most part of the revenues arise from the importation duties on foreign goods, which duties arr countervailed by a drawback when again exported, so that they fall only on foreign goods consumed in the country, and therefore operate as an encouragement to the home manu facturer. Great attention has of late been paid to the coining of money on a proper principle, by giving its full intrinsic value to tha pieces intended for circulation, and renouncing all idea of gain from a species of mean and impolitic robbery on tha pcop'e, which has been, and still is, practised by many Sove reigns and states of the Old World. England reformed its monied system by placing the greatest man in Europe at the head of the mint ; Sir Isaac Newton regulated the coin Gf that country. In America the government has followed that wise example, and has appointed the most ingenious man in their States to regulate their circulating coin. They have named for that purpose Mr. David Rittenhouse. There are several banks established at Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Baltimore, Charlestown, Alexandria, and some other places.

The American manufactures consist chiefly in articles of ne cessity. Those for luxury are nearly all imported, but the manufactories increase with great rapidity. The greatest part of the inhabitants, except in large towns, make their cloth, linen, and other necessaries at home. The exports from the United States have more than doubled during the war, but they have decreased since the peace. They consist chiefly in grain and raw material, the produce of the soil, all which are exempted from duty, but the government retains the right in cases where the public good requires it, either of suspending or forbidding their exportation. The produce. of the country may be exported in all sorts of ships of any nation without restriction, except those ot enemies. The exports amount to five times the value of the taxes.

It is possible that a single piece of furniture in th-e house of some luxurious individual in Europe may bear a price equal to all the diamonds and jewels worn by the inhabitants of the United States ; that is not, however, for the want of Avealth, but owing to the useful activity to which it is applied by the inhabitants of the United States, where none are without some concern with agriculture, commerce, or manufactures. America has few charms for the luxurious, the dissipated and the gay ; but it is a fine abode for the man whose enjoy ment consists in repose, competence, and with filling his place in the world, and an attention to his duty at a distance from the troublesome and vain pursuits of ambition and avarice. It is a country where the affluent may enjoy all the tranquil pleasures of life, and where the poor, if honest and industrious. may soon raise themselves to ease and independence.

There is no portion of the world so well watered by rivers, lakes, and streams, as the eastern portion of the continent of North America. The whole of these countries, on account of their connection by internal navigation, seems to have been intended by nature for the most intimate connection ; the communication between Georgia and New Hampshire is, beyond comparison, more easy and expeditious than that between the North and the South of England, France, or Spain. The canals about to be cut at Southky, Susquehannot, and Delaware, will open a communication between South Carolina and the countries to the West of Pennsylvania and of New York. The works carrying on at Potomack will procure a passage from the southern States to the western parts of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, and the northern lakes. From the straits of Lake Erie to Alexandria on the Potomack, in which distance of 607 miles there will be but 40 miles of land carriage, and that all at one place. The canals intended from the Delaware to the Chesa peak, will open a communication between South Carolina, New Jersey, and Delaware, Pennsylvania, and part of the State of New York. North America will be then, as if it Mere, a great number of large fertile islands communicating together with facility at little expence, and exempt from the danger of the sea. Nothing in any other part of the world resembles that astonishing chain of lakes which is found in the interior of North America; they may be considered as internal fresh"], [47, "35 Witter seas, of which, those only of the' second class, are su perior to any lakes on our eastern continent. The Lake of the Woods, named so from the vast quantity of timber which grows on its borders, is situated at the southern extremity of Lake Winnepeck ; its length from east to west is 70 miles, and its extreme breadth extends to 40. Long Lake is situated towards the east ; the length is about 100 miles, bur it is nowhere above 20 in width. Lake Su perior is the* greatest of all, and may not improperly be called the Caspian Sea of America; it is the greatest sheet of fresh water on the globe, and is 15 or 1600 miles in circumference. A great part of the borders consist of rocks and mountains ; the water is pure and transparent, and the bottom seems in general to be formed of rocks. Though in Summer the waters of that lake are very warm on the surface, yet a fathom below it is so cold that he who drinks of it seems to be drinking newly melted ice. Its po sition is between the 46th and 50th degree of north latitude, and the 8th and 9th degree of longitude, west of Philadelphia. There are many large islands in that lake, M*hich the native Indians suppose to be the habitation of the Great Spirit. Three very large rivers and above 30 smaller ones run into that lake. On the barders of one of the large rivers are found great quantities of virgin copper, and one of the smaller ones is remarkable for having a perpendicular water-fall of 500 feet ; it is extremely narrow, and from a distance re sembles a white ribbon, or garter, suspended in the air. A number of small islands, particularly those towards the east, abound with great strata of copperas, which may be come an important object of commerce, as it costs nothing on c2"], [48, "36 the spot, and may be brought away in boats at no very great cxpence. The chain of lakes connected by a large and sometimes rapid stream of water, consists, besides Lake Superior, of Lakes Huron, Saint-Clair, Erie, and Ontario, making in all a cur rent of near 2000 miles before they fall into the Gulph of St. Lawrence. The navigation of these lakes is difficult, and the communi cation between them interrupted w ith shoals, rapids, and at one place by the immense and grand cataract of Niagara ; they in general abountl in fish, and at some future time may become the sources of great wealth to those who settle on their bor ders. Next in size to Ontario is] Lake Champlain, separating the state of Vermont from that of New York ; it is about 80 mile? in length, but is no where above 14 in breadth. It is well furnished with fish, and its borders are fertile. Lake George is on the south-west of Champlain ; it is very narrow, and only 35 miles in length, its borders are hilly, and the valleys between fertile. The Mississippi River forms at present the great western boundary of the United States of America. Its source has not yet been explored, but it is believed to be about 3000 miles distant from the sea, following its course, which in some places is full of turnings aud windings *. This river receives in its course the Ohio, the Illionois, the Missouri, together with avast number of large rivers and smaller streams, which, * Those who wish to read a fine account of this river may apply t\u00bb Hutehins's Geography of the United States."], [49, "37 all united, traverse with rapidity and majesty immence forests, and fertile plains, till they fall into the Gulph of Mexico. The great length and extraordinary depth of that river, to gether with the salubrity of the waters and the richness of the slime which it carries down, are objects well deserving the attention of the naturalist. The course of this river is so crooked and winding, that from the mouth of the Ohio to New Orleans, the distance by it is 850 miles, though in a straight line it is only 460, and might be shortened above one third by cutting through a few necks of land, some of which are not more than 70 feet across. Charlevaux says, that in 1722 the river made a great current at a place called Cut Point, when some Canadians thought of deepening the bed of a small rivulet, and letting the main river into it. The force of the current was so great, and the ground so rich, that in a very short time the whole was carried away, and 14 leagues of navigation saved by that means. The ancient bed of the river in that part is now dry, except when the overflow comes ; and the new one has been sounded to the depth of about 30 fathoms without finding a bottom. During the spring the inundations of the Mississippi rise very high, and the current is so strong as to render the as cending in boats extremely difficult, though there is a sort of counter current near the borders which facilitates it con siderably. The stream of the river, when high, runs about five miles an hour, but towards autumn, when low, it does not run above two miles. There are, however, several parts where owing to clusters of islands, banks of sand, or rocks, the water always runs with a strong current ; the extent of those rock* c 3"], [50, "38 being in some places several miles ; the voyages in autumn are more tedious than in the spring. Those merchandizes which are sent up the Mississippi are conveyed in boats of 50 tons burthen, rowed up the stream by 18 or 20 men to each. From New Orleans to the Il!:ono:.s river, the voyage re quires 8 or 10 weeks. Below New Orleans the country be comes more flat towards the sea ; and so late as the tredty in 1762, those lands which have probably risen from the sea, were mentioned as being an island ; water is there found by digging to a very small depth, and huge trunks of trees are found buried in this alluvial land. When Mons. De la Salle descended this river to the sea, it is certain that the mouth of it wa-* then very different from what it is now. It has even been observed that the mouth changes its place, and the nearer one approaches the sea the more evident this becomes. Trees carried down by the current of the river are stopped in their progress by the bar, which the waters of the Gulph oppose; if a single tree is stopped, that serves to impede others, and thus a factitious ground is formed by degrees. \u2014 There is at all times to be seen between the Balize and the Missouri an enormous quantity of trees, sufficient to furnish wood for a whole town in America for several years, and which no human force is sufficient to remove. The sand, gravel, \u2022jnd mud, which the river brings down, cement the whole together ; in a few years vegetation begins, and they are covered by degrees ; each inundation not only adds to their extent in length and breadth, but it augments their depth, and in the space of a few years an island is formed that changes the course of the river. The Mississippi runs in a smooth and clear stream till it meets with the Missouri, when its waters become muddy and"], [51, "39 troubled till they fall into the Ocean. The Missouri is larger than the Mississippi before they meet, and is much deeper and more navigable. Sonic French merchants ascended it for the space of 12 or 1300 miles, and it was still a large deep navigable river. From the Missouri to the Ghio, the western bank of the Mississippi is the highest, except in a few places; from the Iron Mine to Iberville the eastern border is more elevated than the western, on which the smallest rise is n *>t discern able for the space of 750 miles. From Iberville to the sea there is no rising ground on either side, and both di minish gradually till the mouth, where they are only two or three feet higher than the ordinary level of the water, in the river *. The slhne which the Mississippi leaves, after it overflows the adjacent fields, is like that of the Nile ; it deposits a ma nure similar to that which has occasioned the fertility of Lower Egypt. When the banks of this river are cultivated in the manner the soil and temperature of the climate will admit, it will be inferior in population to no country on the globe. The com merce, riches, and power of America may, at some future period, be concentrated on the borders of the Mississippi, which resembles the Nile also for its number of mouths, all emptying themselves into a Gulph not altogether unlike the Mediterranean Sea. Mr. Carver appearing to me to be better acquainted with this river than any other traveller, what follows is stated upon his authority. * Such is the newly acquired territory, which being uninhabited, the States will extend as far to ths North and the West as they think proper. c 4"], [52, "40 The fall of St. Antoin 44\u00b0 3' north, is 600 feet in width and 30 feet high, and forms one of the most beautiful cascades that it is possible to imagine. The country round is extremely fine ; the ground rises and falls agreeably, without either high mountains or extensive plains ; the verdure is the most lux uriant and veriegated, interspersed with woods and trees of different sorts. A little above the fall is a small island of about an acre and a half, upon which are a vast number of lofty oak trees, loaded with the nests of the eagle ; the instinct of those animals leads them to seek a refuge, inaccessible to the pursuits of men, or the attack of beasts. The Mississippi has never been ascended by any European beyond the river St. Francis, so that we owe to the Indians all the information we have of it above its junction with that river. Mr. Carver imagines, both from what he learnt of the In dians, and from his own observations, that the four principal rivers of North America, St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, the Bourbon, and the Origon, rise all within 30 or 40 miles of each other, on the highest ground on that continent, though they fall into the sea at an immense distance from each other, and from their source. Mr. Jefferson, whose able researches and his very extensive knowledge have placed him the rank of the best authorities, in his Notes on Virginia, has given us a description of the Ohio, adding some remarks on the western waters of Ame rica, which throw a great light on that interesting subject ; we shall therefore give some extracts from his work, and with them complete what we have to say on the interior navigation of the United States."], [53, "41 The Ohio is the most beautiful river on the face of the earth ; the current is smooth, the waters clear, and its banks covered with the finest verdure. There are no rocks nor rapids but at one place. It is about a quarter of a mile broad at Fort Pitt, 1500 feet at the mouth of the great Kanhawa, and 5055 at Lewisville. A quarter of a mile is its width at the Rapids, from 3 to 4 miles below Lewisville, half a mile where the flat country begins at the Green River, a mile and quarter where it receives the Tenessee, and only a mile where it falls into the Mississippi.

The rapids are in 38\u00b0 8' of north latitude. The overflowing of the river begins in March, and lasts till July, during which time a first rate ship of the line could descend from Lewisville to New Orleans, were it not for the crooked turnings of the river. The rapids at Lewisville de, scend about 30 feet in the course of a mile and a half. The bed of the river is there of solid rock, and its course is di- vided into two by an island. The south branch, 500 feet in width, is dry during four months of the year, but the most northerly is sufficiently deep to be navigable for boats during most part of the year; and it is not supposed that it would be attended with great expence to render it navigable during the whole of the season. The waters are never at any time above thp depth of 10 or 12 feet at the rapids. The countries watered by the Mississippi, and the various rivers which run into it, form five eighths of the United States, two of which are watered by the Ohio and its various rivers which join it during its course ; the other two fifths are"], [55, "43 situated on the Mississippi and the rivers which run directly into it. Before we quit the subject of these rivers which water the western territory of the United States, we shall take a rapid view of their manner of communicating with the Atlantic Ocean, Hudson's River, the Potoinack;, and the Mississippi. By the latter river all weighty productions may easily descend to the Gulph of Mexico on rafts, which being made of build ing timber, themselves are a saleable article ; the con ductors may return by land or in light boats. The heavy productions, such as corn, staves, tobacco, salt provisions, hemp, &c. will unquestionably be sent by this conveyance in preference to any other ; but the manufactured goods of Europe will be conveyed by Hudson's River, or the Potomack. By Hudson's River it is necessary to mount to the Lake Erie, from whence goods may be conveyed with little inter ruption into the interior of the country in all directions, but the communications between the lakes is froze up three months in the year, as well as Hudson's River, whereas the other more southerly communications are not liable to any such inconveniency. From Alexandria, which is a principal depot on the south-east coast of the United States, the passage is only in terrupted in one place, where it is necessary to carry the goods by land. The only impediments in the way of this navigation are removing with great activity, so that it will soon be navigable all the way, and become the shortest, easiest, and least expensive. The expence of sending goods of which the value is con siderable, and the weight small, by this route to the western"], [56, "44 territory will not be such as greatly to enhance their price. If then matters could be so conducted as to establish a re gular exchange of American produce for European manu factures by these two diflerents routs, or by way of New York, we might have corn, &c. from that country at a very reason able rate ; and those who live on the western waters might have European articles at a price such as to encourage their consumption to a degree that might, when that country becomes peopled, be one of the most extensive, lucrative, and sure markets for Europeans that has ever yet been discovered or carried on."], [57, "45 Observations on the True and Natural Interests of the British Government and United States of America. By W. Playfair. Statistical facts are collected principally for the use of forming deductions, and distinguishing what is tcise and possible to be done, from what is unwise or impossible. In the pre sent case let us endeavour to draw some conclusions from the facts before us. It appears, that before 30 years the United States will con tain a greater population than any single nation in Europe. That the western country will in the end be the most populous, as it is the most fertile and extensive. The Mississippi which is, at present, the ideal boundary, will not then be the real one ; but the lands contiguous to it on the west will be occupied also by the same people, both on ac count of their fertility and local situation, as well as to ensure the navigation of the river. Whatever may be the conduct of France and Spain rela tive to New Orleans and the Floridas, it is clearly an object of too great magnitude, and too necessary for the people who live on the waters of the west, to command the mouths of that river, the only one by which 800,000 square miles of country communicates with the ocean, for them to per mit it to be in any hands but their own. Nature has given them the right, and nature will furnish them with the means of asserting and preserving it. No power in Europe, nor all the powers combined together, will, in a few years, be able to keep possession, by force, of the mouths of the Mississippi. The Floridas will naturally also fall into the hands of the Americans. It is"], [58, "46 absurd to think that the languid and feeble government of Spam can keep possession of a thinly peopled narrow track of coun try, which cuts off the whole of the southern part of the States from a direct communication with the Gulph of Mexico : the only intention of retaining which seems to be to prevent that natural and necessary communication. The interior country of America, so extensive, fertile, and well peopled, will not, however, for many ages be a manufac turing country. Its industry and capital will be directed to wards agriculture ; and if matters are so conducted that Eng lish goods find their way there upon reasonable terms, the consumption of them will probably be such as to give occu pation for our manufacturers on au increased scale for many years to come. * Though the internal force of America will be such as to put the navigation of the Mississippi, so far as it runs in the form of a river, intircly independent of any other power, yet as those countries will not for long, and perhaps never, be able to maintain a great naval force, they will find it their interest to enter into a treaty offensive and defensive with some power in Europe, who has the ability and an interest in protecting and keeping safe the navigation of the Gulph of Mexico, without which the freedom of the internal navigation of the river will be to little purpose. Circumstances point out in the most direct manner a con nection between Britain and America for that purpose ; Bri tain is the ablest to grant, and the most interested in granting protection and safety to the consumers of its manu factures. Men who speak the same language, who have nearly the same manners, and live under similar laws. The inter ruption of so large a branch of trade would greatly affect the prosperity of this country, while it would injure that of the western territory still more ; it is therefore a connection"], [59, "47 sounded in every way upon mutual inferest. A small surplus of produce will supply the people in those f 'rtile countries with all those articles of European manufacture which never flourish where population is thin and land in plenty. We may be friends ; we naturally shall have a great commercial connection ; but if we ever become enemies, or entertain jealousy of each other, it wiil be without grounds and without advantage. The absurd and now exploded system of perfect equality is not more contrary to the nature of things, than that all nations should produce the same objects, or, in other words, be rivals in trade. There must be a division of labour amongst nations as well as amongst individuals, if it is intended that their industry should be employed to the best purpose, that is to say, if with a given quantity of labour they mean to procure the greatest possible quantity of those articles that are necessary to the preservation or conducive to the enjoyment of life. Not only may an extensive and friendly intercourse be ex pected with the citizens of the United States, but they may be the cause of ending those jealousies that have so long dis turbed the repose of European nations. The great staple articles of France are wines, brandies, and fruits, of which neither England nor any Northern nation produces, or can produce any considerable quantity. France also excels in many articles of taste and luxury, for which no \u2022other nation appears to have an equal genius. The French have a peculiar happy climate and diversity of soil, so that they do not want much from any other nation ; and with very little attention they may produce more of the articles above enumerated (in which they never need fear a rival), than sufficient for every purpose of commerce and exchange. France has no need to turn its views to what is commonly meant by commerce. It has far more solid, and better sources of wealth, than those that merely consist in"], [60, "48 manufacturing or carrying for others, for which neither the na tural situation nor the disposition of the people is at all fitted. The immense market opening in North America will put an end to the ill-founded jealousy of nations* : and while on this subject, it is natural to take notice of another theatre for industry, commerce, and consumption, rising up in the very heart of the old world, on the borders of the Black Sea, fitted by nature, and intended by the Emperor of all the Russias to become a great, wealthy, aud civilized country. The theatre of commerce is enlarging with great rapidity ; and if mankind are wise, they may now begin to enjoy more fully and freely the advantages arising from the discoveries of Columbus, of Cabot, and the labours of Peter the Great. As for England, it must cultivate manufactures and com- merce; and if it acts wisely, will find an ample market in America. We owe much to the wisdom and moderation of those who have gone before us; and by wisdom and moderation alone can we preserve those advantages which have been our inheritance. It ill-becomes us to be jealous of other nations ; for let the question be argued a*s it may, we at least have our share of commerce ; and we may not only keep it, but see it increase, if we avoid those errors which have hitherto brought on the decline and ruin of all wealthy nations. We have no occasion to grasp, let us only rely on the interest of other people for trading with us, and we shall have a surer hold than we can have by any other means. The separation of the United States of America from the British Government, is the best example of this; while we struggled for dominion we had little profit and great expence. Since we lost the dominion * I say ill-founded ; for though it is proverbial that individuals of the same trade do not agree, yet they have some reason : but here are nations of different trades that disagree."], [61, "49 we have had great profit without any expence, and that the advantages will increase, js as certain as the augmenting popu lation of America; provided we trust to mutual interest as the tenure by -which we are to enjoy the advantage, and act accordingly*.

The United States of America offer at this time a very ad- Tantageous prospect to the British Nation. They take more of our manufactures than any other country, and indeed near as much (of manufactures, though not of colonial produce) as the whole of Europe. Their population is rapidly increasing, and with it, if proper means are taken to supply them, the demand of our manufactures will augment proportionally. The western country of America even before the purchase of Louisiana was equal in extent to 3-fifths of the United States, and now it is equal to 2-thiids of the whole. It is by far the most fer tile as well a. most extensive portion of the Republic, and even In __i merica: \"oreigit. Wines, in Cask ., Bottles, or other Vessels.

This western country has for several years been peopling very rapidly, and will do more so now that the navigation of the Mississippi is perfectly secure; and while the portion of Ame rica that lays on the eastern coast of that continent is our rival in commerce, and possesses every maritime advantage, the whole of this western territory, though watered by the finest navigable rivers on the face of the globe, has but one sea port, or in other words, only communicates with the sea by the Mississippi River, which seems destined on some future day to bring down the sur plus of a thousand millions of acres of the most fertile lands in the known world. Though in the progress of things several centuries must elapse before the western territory of the United States can become a manufacturing country, yet necessity, arising from the difficulty of procuring manufactures from Europe, or from the high price at which they are sold, may induce the new settlers to dispense with the use of many articles they would otherwise consume, and lo manufacture others for their own use and consumption. From the situation of that country, its nature, and all cir- cumstances, it is evident that it will afford a great market for English manufactures if supplied at a reasonable rate. By it we may then greatly increase our trade, on a secure and perma- nent footing, so that neither interest, caprice, nor party, will deprive us of that market. That country produces heavy articles that will not bear land carriage to the Eastern Seas ; but the greatest part of the British goods wanted there, are light in comparison to their value, and maybe carried over-land from Sew York to the Ohio, or from Alexandria, Philadelphia, or Boston, from which places it is at present supplied in scanty quantities, and at exorbitant prices. The plan proposed, is to establish warehouses for English goods at different stations on the Ohio, and Mississippi, from Fort Pitt to New Orleans, receiving the produce of the country in return, which may be sent down the river on rafts during nine months of the year, in order to supply our West India Islands, as well as Europe, with the produce of those fertile plains. Mutual interest will then draw both countries closer together. To the British nation this is a great object, and though it may not appear so to the Americans themselves, it is an object to them likewise, for their interest is to be so closely united with this country, that neither intrigue nor party, nor any momentary views shall be able to create a misunderstanding."], [84, "72 The recent acquisition of Louisiana by the United States, makes the Author of those observations bring forward his plan at this time, which he has meditated ever since 17S9. To sum the whole up in one short statement, there are good grounds for calculating that in a few years English manufactures, to the value of one million sterling, may be annually disposed of in the western territory, if produce is taken in return ; and if otherwise, not one third of the amount; for in those inland places there is no means of procuring money with which to buy Euro pean goods in great quantities. In less than 20 years, at the rate the western country is now peopling, above five millions value of English manufactures may be sold there annually, if this plan is adopted, which will pro duce the double effect of preventing the inhabitants from culti vating manufactures, and give them the means of purchasing ours ; but if we do not embrace this opportunity, it will never re turn, and the trade of this country to America will not increase to any very great height. If we speak of a century to come, the establishment of the present plan, or the not establishing it, may make twenty millions annually difference to England. What would England now have been, had not pains been taken to lay the foundation for trade to other countries, on a firm basis? In comparison to what it is, it would have been no thing ; yet there never was an opportunity like the present, particularly as it costs no money, but will amply repay those who engage in it, from the very beginning. A bushel of wheat may be got in exchange for a Sheffield knife, on the borders of the Ohio; the same wheat can be sold in the West Indies for between two and three dollars, and other produce with propor tional advantage. Public and private interest unite in stimula ting all those interested in the trade and manufactures of this country, to assist in forwarding so beneficial an enterprize. It is not indeed a matter of speculative indifference. Our exports have fallen off full one third last year (see Mr. Pitt's Report, just published before the close of the session of parlia ment), or fifteen millions sterling. We are shut out almost from every port on the continent of Europe, from the Gulph of Venice to the coast of Denmark. Is it not then time to lay a founda. tion for other markets ? It certainly is, and the western part of Am. .ica is the only great one within our power, and in securing it, we likewise secure the trade and friendship of the Eastern States, which we now enjoy. A volume might be written on this subject, but that volume could only enlarge on the present statement, it could say no more than what is already laid down in a manner th&\u00a3 is not to be refuted or denied. .?\u2022> 1W1 55 [plenditming, Printer, Button Garden."], [85, ""], [86, ""], [87, ""], [88, ""], [89, ""], [90, ""], [91, ""], [92, ""], [93, ""], [94, ""]]
