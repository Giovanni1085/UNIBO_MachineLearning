They say it has a million of people in it, which, however, I do not believe. It is regularly built, the streets all exactly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which gives the figure of it great advantage. What are their buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to the universal com- merce of England, Holland, France, and Spain? What their cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety ? What are their ports supplied with,\u2014 a few junks and barques, to our navigation, our mer- chants' fleets, our large and powerful navies ? Our city of London has more trade than all their mighty empire. One English, or Dutch, or French man-of-war, of eighty guns, would fight with and destroy all the shipping of China. But the great- ness of their wealth, their trade, the power of their government, and strength of their armies, is surprising to us ; because, as I have said, considering them as a bar- barous nation of Pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect such things among them ; and this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their greatness and power is represented to us ; otherwise it is in itself nothing at all. For, as I have said of their ships, so may be said of their armies and troops ; all the forces of their empire, though they were to bring two mil] ions of men into the field together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the country and starve themselves. If they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or fight a disciplined army, one line of German cuirassiers, or French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of China j a mil lion of their foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, though they were not above a thousand in number j nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German or English foot, and three thousand French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China. And so of our fortified towns, and of the art of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns : there is not a fortified town in China could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of a European army ; and, at the same time, all the armies of China could never take such a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved, no, not in a ten years' siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going off; they have powder, but it is of no strength ; they have neither discipline in the field, exercise to their arms, skill to attack, nor temper to retreat ; and therefore, I must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard our people say such fine things of the power, riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew that they were a contemptible herd, or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a people.\" \u2014 De Foe, written about the year 1720."], [11, ""], [12, "HONG KONG."], [13, "THE CHINESE WAR: AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BRITISH FORCES FROM THE COMMENCEMENT TO THE TREATY OF NANKING.

Hence it will only be necessary to recapitulate succinctly the most remarkable events that occurred in the latter part of the year 1838, and during 1839\u2014 events which led immediately to the formation of the first arma ment directed by the British Government against the shores of China, the author's remarks being restricted to such a brief retrospective summary as may suffice to connect the details of the war with the train of causes by which it was produced."], [33, "3 THE OLD SYSTEM OF TRADE. Our relations with the empire, during the continuance of the chartered privileges of the East India Company, were generally preserved upon a tolerably comfortable footing by the prudent and wary conduct of the \" Select Com mittee of Supercargoes,\" established at Canton by the East India Company, who scrupulously guarded against any infraction of the laws and regulations, however arbitrary, of the Chinese authorities ; but disputes and difficulties did some times arise, notwithstanding all the precautions taken, and occasional stoppages of the trade ensued, rendering it necessary to call in the assistance of the commanders of any British men-of-war cruising in the China seas. The great confidence, however, reposed by the Hong merchants * and the agents of the East India Company in each other, as well as the great importance of the trade to both parties, made these differences generally easy of accommoda tion. The English were strictly prohibited from entering within the city walls, and were per mitted to reside only in factories (Hongs) on * Hong merchants, or Co-Hong, being Chinese merchants, licensed by government, through whom alone the English were allowed to trade.

During the lengthened period of British intercourse, all their prejudices had been studiously respected, and the Chinese had been left to their own belief that we did in reality pay them homage, and sue with humility for such intercourse as they would permit us to hold with them. The mercantile profession is not in high estimation among the Chinese, and hence it is not to be wondered at that the sub dued tone which we had maintained towards them should have brought them to regard us in the light of an inferior people. The change from the East India Company's submissive style to the assertion of certain rights in commerce, made by the representative of the British Go vernment, was therefore a matter not easily to be understood by the nation whose pride, the offspring of ignorance and despotic government, had been fostered for so long a period. The balance of trade was, for some time, on the side of the Chinese, who received it in dollars from the East India Company ; but by degrees the introduction of British manufactures, metals, cotton from India, and lastly opium, to a very considerable extent, turned the tide in our favour, and then the dollars and Sycee silver (the"], [35, "INTRODUCTION OF OPIUM. 5 produce of their own country) began to ooze out in formidable quantities. The attention of the Imperial Cabinet being called to this national evil, orders were given to stop entirely the trade in opium, as that with which the empire could most safely and easily dispense. The importa tion of this article, about half a century ago, was inconsiderable, extending to not more than 1000 chests, but it had reached the immense quantity of 40,000 chests ; and as the people of all the southern portion of the empire were known to be all, more or less, addicted to the use of the drug, in smoking chiefly, it was an evil of gigantic magnitude. It was first introduced into China as a medical drug, under a fixed duty, and though hindrances were op posed from time to time by the Chinese authori ties, the trade continued to thrive until 1820, when a jjroclamation was issued against it. It having by this time become exceedingly profit able to the British mercantile' community, very fast sailing vessels (clippers) having been built expressly for its transport from India, and a very large capital being engaged in it, every effort was used to prevent its stoppage, and an anchorage for the opium vessels was resorted"], [36, "6 BRIBERY. to, at a greater distance from the immediate power of the mandarins. Here the vessels were visited regularly and openly by Chi nese boats, who bought in, paid for, and car ried away, the opium ; and the commanders of the Chinese war-junks, who occasionally made mock demonstrations against the vessels at the anchorages, managed to establish with the ship masters a regular system of bribery, under which several dollars per chest were reserved for and paid over to them. Thus the nominally proscribed traffic continued to flourish, Chinese of all ranks taking an active part in it ; and the export of specie continuing to increase, the anxious attention of the imperial cabinet was directed to its suppression. Among the great councillors of the state, there were some who recommended the legalization of a trade in the article by barter against merchandize only ; but the advocates of total prohibition prevailed, and towards the end of the year 1837, procla mations were issued, directing the foreign ships to leave the coast, and the foreign merchants to repair from Canton to Macao. Delays were, however, permitted by the governor of Canton, who was himself well known to be extensively"], [37, "FIRST SEIZURE OF OPIUM. 7 interested in the opium trade ; but the position of the British community was very critical, and the restrictions on their entire trade very irksome, throughout the year 1838. A man darin of high reputation, as an able adminis trator of public affairs, named Lin, had been empowered by an imperial commission to act as governor of the Kwang-tung (Canton) and adjacent provinces, and to adopt such coercive measures as would, it was believed, (upon his assurance,) lead to the effectual suppression of the opium trade. The first overt act was on the 3rd December, 1838, when some opium was seized by the police, upon the persons of some Chinese labourers, (coolies,) who were carrying it from the water-side to the factories, on account of Mr. Innes, a merchant there. The coolies were imprisoned, and the Hong merchants, instigated by the authorities, at once suspended the entire British trade, with a threat that it should not be restored until Mr. Innes, the offending party, had quitted Canton, an alternative which that gentleman was, on the 15th December, con strained to adopt. The trade, however, con tinued interrupted until the 1st of the succeed-"], [38, "8 A FRACAS. ing month, and in the meantime much popular indignation was excited against the foreign residents in the factories, by the determination with which they resisted an insulting attempt of the city authorities to execute, in the open square, before the factories, a Chinese trader, who had been convicted of the offence of selling opium. This attempt was frustrated, but a riot ensued ; the foreigners were hemmed in by the mob for many hours, and a detachment of Chinese troops was at length sent to quell the disturbance. The chief superintendent of British trade in China, Captain Elliot, who had succeeded the late lamented Lord Napier in that capacity, had struck the British flag, and removed from Canton some time before, in consequence of a difficulty in the manner and style of his com munications with the governor of the province, the latter refusing to receive such as the super intendent had been directed by his government to make ; and as soon as he was informed of the state of affairs at Canton, he came up with a flotilla of armed boats, furnished by the mer chant-vessels then lying at Whampoa. On the following day, Captain Elliot assembled the"], [39, "RESUMPTION OF TRADE. 9 foreign residents, and having explained to them the view which he took of the position of affairs, he issued a notice, directing that all British owned vessels engaged in the forbidden traffic should drop down the river, beyond the Bogue, before the expiration of three days, from the date of the said notice. On the 1st January, 1839, the trade was once more resumed, and on the 3rd an edict of the Emperor was made public, appointing Lin to proceed to Canton, for the express purpose of stopping for ever the traffic in opium, which had become so obnoxious to the imperial cabinet. Proclamations and edicts shortly followed, from the governor of Canton, exhorting the people to forsake the evil practice which had so enslaved their minds, and dictating terms for bonds, to be in future executed by the merchants regarding vessels arriving from beyond the Bogue, to guard against the entrance of opium craft into the Chinese waters, from which the governor demanded that all ships, of whatever class, engaged in any way in the transport of the article, should be at once removed \u2014 a suspen sion of all trade being, as usual, the penalty of non-compliance. The appointment of a special"], [40, "10 APPROACH OF LIN. commissioner by the emperor, for the purpose of investigating affairs connected with the opium traffic, and of the foreign trade in general, was announced in one of these documents, dated 23rd January, 1839, in which the near approach of Lin was alluded to as \"a tender and earnest warning,\" to deter the foreigners from perse vering in the illegal practices which had aroused the indignation of his celestial Majesty, under penalty of the stoppage for ever of their trade with the great empire \u2014 a calamity which, by depriving them of the tea and rhubarb of the central flowery land, must, in the opinion of the governor Tang, remove from them the main support and comfort of their lives. Shortly after the publication of this edict, incidents indicative of the approaching storm became frequent ; the passage of boats on the river was impeded, the tone assumed in the city became insolent and offensive, and the back doors in the factories were blocked up by order of the Governor, under pretence of their afford ing facilities for smuggling the forbidden drug into the houses of the suburbs. On the 26th of February, the police suc ceeded, in a hurried manner, in putting to death,"], [41, "THE FACTORIES AT CANTON."], [42, ""], [43, "EXECUTION. 11 by strangulation, a Chinese accused of opium dealing, before the windows of the Hongs occu pied by the foreign merchants, on which gross outrage the flags at all the consulates were in stantly struck, and H.

On the 10th of March, Commissioner Lin made his public entry into the city, and after in terviews with the principal municipal authorities, and a personal investigation into the accounts and records of the Hoppo and Hong merchants, he signified to the Kwang-chow-foo, or chief jus ticiary and comptroller, that the arrest of several individuals named in a proclamation which he issued, and who had become notorious for the extent of their dealings with the merchants as opium brokers, was deemed necessary ; he made himself acquainted with the details of the traffic as it then existed in the Canton waters, and then issued two proclamations, in which he specially informed foreigners, that he had deter mined to put down the traffic altogether, and requiring that all opium on board ships should"], [44, "12 lin's proclamations. be given up to his officers, and that the foreigners should, jointly and severally, enter into a bond by which the penalty of death should be incurred by any person or persons who should hereafter attempt to import the forbidden article. Three days only were allowed for consideration and for the preparation of the documents, and the Im perial Commissioner promised, on behalf of his sovereign, entire forgetfulness of all past of fences, and a permanent restoration of the trade under the favourable circumstances which for merly existed. At this time Captain Elliot was absent in Macao, and the Hong merchants in consequence communicated the substance of the orders they had received from Lin to the chairman of the Canton Chamber of Commerce, upon which body they endeavoured to impress the belief that, in the event of non-compliance with the terms pro posed by his excellency, more than one of the Hong merchants would be sacrificed to his in tense and implacable indignation. On the 19th March the summons to surrender the opium was followed up by a notification from Yu, the Hoppo or customs magistrate, that during the existing state of affairs it was the"], [45, "13 FIRMNESS OF THE MERCHANTS. pleasure of Lin that passports should not be granted for foreigners either to proceed to Ma cao or to quit the boundary of the factories ; while troops were observed on the river, and in the suburb adjoining. In this alarming situation the merchants did not, however, evince any un due haste or trepidation, but replied in a firm tone, that, while they disclaimed all desire for any further connexion with the opium trade, they required time for calm deliberation on so important a question, expressing a hope that the report of a committee, which had been appointed to take it into consideration, would not be delayed beyond a week. An attempt was now made by Lin to obtain possession of the person of Mr. Launcelot Dent, a British merchant at Canton, by means of an invitation to a conference within the hitherto impassable city gates, conveyed to him through the Hong merchants, from accepting which he was dissuaded by his friends. After having directed all British vessels to rendezvous at Hong-Kong, and prepare to resist every act of aggression on the part of the Chi nese, Captain Elliot arrived in Canton on the 24th March, and establishing himself in the"], [46, "14 stoppage of the supplies. British factory, he hoisted the ensign upon the flag-staff before it, and conducted Mr. Dent from his own abode to the protection of the consular dwelling. Captain Elliot arrived at the factory- jetty in a boat of H. M. S. Larne, which had scarcely touched the stairs, when a vast number of Chinese armed boats closed round the water entrances of the factories, and forming three distinct lines across the river, effectually ex- cluded their occupants from all communication with their friends outside. On the same day, the whole of the Chinese servants attached to the factories were withdrawn by order of the municipal authorities, and fresh provisions, of which an abundant supply had been hitherto daily obtainable, ceased to appear within the enclosure of the foreign Hongs. In the evening, a general meeting of all foreigners was con- vened by Captain Elliot, at which he informed them, that passports had been already solicited for Her Britannic Majesty's subjects, and recom mended preparations to be made for the imme diate removal of books and property on board the vessels then lying at Whampoa, announcing at the same time, that he had received as surances from the Portuguese government at"], [47, "15 SURRENDER of THE OPIUM. Macao, of protection to all British subjects, so long as the traffic pursued by them, within the limits of that settlement, should not be at variance with the laws of the Chinese empire. The courage of the British community was much strengthened by this energetic measure ; but what was their consternation when, early on the morning of the 27th, a notice issued from the office of the chief superintendent, calling upon them all to surrender forthwith, for the service of the Crown of England, all the opium under their control, under penalty of the withdrawal of the responsibility of her Ma jesty's government ! After some demur, this hard alternative was submitted to, and returns were sent in to Captain Elliot of the prodigious amount of 20,280 chests, which they were prepared to surrender, according to the terms of the superintendent's notice ; which being communicated to the imperial commissioner, arrangements were made by the latter without delay, for its reception at Chunhow, near Chuen pee, in the neighbourhood of the Bogue forts. Lin now addressed himself to the other con suls, demanding the surrender of any opium"], [48, "16 BREACH OF FAITH. which merchants of their nations might hold in warehouses or in store-ships. Mr. Johnston, the deputy-superintendent of British trade, proceeded to the Bogue, to inspect the delivery of the opium, and the disembarka tion went on so rapidly, that by the 20th April, 10,000 chests had been given up. Notwith standing this, the imprisonment of the foreign merchants continued, the military guards were retained around the factories, and no communi cation was allowed by passage-boats between Canton and the outer anchorages \u2014 in direct vio lation of the agreement ; but the native servants had been permitted to return. Lin continued to make urgent and insolent demands for the bond before spoken of, and Captain Elliot, indignant at the breach of good faith respecting the passage-boats, sent instruc tions to Mr. Johnston to discontinue the delivery of the opium. This had the desired effect ; and on the 4th May, an edict was promulgated by the Kwang-chow-foo, giving permission for the regis tered and licensed passage-boats to resume their voyages, and for the foreigners to take their de parture from Canton, except sixteen of the princi pal British and Parsee merchants, who were or-"], [49, "NEW FORTIFICATIONS. 17 dered tobe detained until the delivery of the whole quantity of opium stipulated for should be com pleted. The trade was at the same time nominally opened, and on the 5th, the Kwang-chow-foo, in person, broke up the line of circumvallation by guards and boats, which had been drawn round the factories ; but the activity of the Chinese authorities at the Bogue, in the con struction of new fortifications, and of booms and chains for the manifest closing of the passage, shewed that the vigorous mind of Lin was evi dently preparing for ulterior proceedings. On the 18th, Lin issued a further edict, ad dressed to the British and Dutch superintendents of trade, to the effect that the penalty of death would be incurred by any parties who should hereafter engage, either directly or indirectly, in the introduction of opium into the empire, and by the crews of vessels employed for that object, concluding with the plausible insinuation that China needed no commercial intercourse with foreigners, and that all were now at liberty to return to their own countries, and to do there what seemed best to them.

On the 21st May, the surrender of the 20,283 chests of opium being completed, the superin tendent issued a further notice to H. B.

An idea prevailed that a considerable portion was preserved, and appropriated, through the cupidity of the mandarins ; but from the state ment of Mr. King, consul of the United States in China, who visited Chunhow, it would appear that little if any escajoed. The spacious and sheltered harbour of Hong Kong became now more than ever the chief re sort of the British and foreign vessels in the Chinese waters, the anchorage being the safest and most commodious known in the neighbour hood of the Canton river, and supplies of live stock and vegetables being readilyobtainable even in seasons of difficulty, owing to its distance from any military station. The hostility, how ever, which Lin appeared determined to carry out against the English was here shortly displayed, in the occupation of the promontory of Cow-loon, (which forms the northern boundary of the har bour,) by considerable bodies of troops, and by the erection of two powerful batteries in positions which commanded the eastern anchorage."], [55, "21 A FRACAS. The assemblage of so many ships at one spot, and the comparative idleness of their crews, led to excursions on shore, and of course to riotous proceedings ; and it happened unfortunately that on the 7th July some sailors entered a village to procure spirits, and an affray occurred in which a Chinese, named Lin Weihe, received injuries which caused his death in a few hours.

During this period of anxiety and danger, a provisional chamber of commerce was formed to concert measures for the common safety, and in its proceedings the greatest fortitude and energy were displayed. By the 17th August every Chinese servant had disappeared, and placards, in large letters, were then carried through the streets and market-places, by Chinese police soldiers, forbidding any person whatever to supply food to the English. On the 20th, the Chinese commissioner intimated to the Portu guese governor, that he should require the latter to withdraw from British families all servants who were subjects of the Queen of Portugal ; and Captain Elliot, perceiving thereby that the continued residence of the British in Macao would compromise the Portuguese with the Chinese authorities, issued a public notice on the 21st, of his intention to leave Macao on the 23rd, and recommending her Britannic Ma jesty's subjects to accompany him to Hong Kong. It may be here remarked that, during this active persecution of the English, the consul of"], [57, "23 DARING OUTRAGE. the United States, together with all the mer chants of that country, were residing in safety at Canton, and suffered no molestation whatever by the authorities, although, by the manner in which their edicts and demands had been osten sibly complied with, the Americans had in no respect a higher claim upon their considera tion than the British. On the 24th, a daring and disgraceful outrage was perpetrated upon the crew of a small schooner called theBlack Joke, which plied between Macao and Hong Kong as a passage-boat ; a Mr. Moss and several lascars, British subjects, having been desperately piked and hacked, and a few killed by a number of Chinese, who boarded the vessel from two or three junks and row-boats, and plundered the cargo, which consisted of baggage and effects. It does not appear likely that this atrocity was committed with the connivance of the government ; but the state of the times, and the blood-thirsty disposition which had been already manifested towards them, induced the British residents to attach some importance to the deed as a warning of the storm which was about to burst forth. During the last few days of their sojourn at Macao, the difficulty of pro-"], [58, "24 ARRIVAL OF THE VOLAGE. curing the necessaries of life had been very great, and on the 25th rumours were afloat that a body of Chinese troops was distributed through the town, prepared for an attack upon the houses occupied by the English, and to guard against this treachery the merchants armed themselves in the best manner they were able, and assem bled on the Praya. The night, however, passed away in tranquillity, and on the following day the whole of the British community finally quit ted the friendly but inefficient protection of their ancient ally, and proceeded, the greater part, to the harbour of Hong Kong, and a few to the anchorage east of Macao, called the Typa. On the 30th H. M. S. Volage, commanded by Captain Smith, came into Macao roads, and im mediately proceeded to Hong Kong, where Capt. Elliot (in the absence of any officer bearing Her Majesty's commission) had appointed Captain Douglas, of the Cambridge, formerly of the East India Company's maritime service, to the tem porary command of the fleet at the anchorage, and had issued orders to the masters of all ves sels in the bay to act in obedience to his direc tions, and in concert for the general safety.

Immediately on receiving a translation of this atrocious document, Captain Elliot called upon Captain Smith to establish a blockade of the port of Canton ; and accordingly, on the 1 1th of September, a public notice (which may be con sidered the first overt act by which a hostile rela tion with the imperial government was acknow ledged) was issued by that officer of a restraint upon vessels seeking egress or ingress, and referring to the gross and inhuman orders of the Imperial commissioner to the inhabitants of the coast, and to the supposed capture or destruction of a boat's crew by the Chinese, as the cause.

The brig was set on fire, the mate and four seamen made prisoners, and the former was subjected to the disgrace of having a heavy chain put round his neck ; the rest were put into a boat without oars or rudder, and suffered to drift away till taken in tow by a boat sent from the nearest Portuguese fort. The alleged cause of this act of violence, the suspicion that the vessel was English and contained opium, so alarmed the Portuguese authorities, that an edict of the senate of Macao was immediately issued, directing an armed vessel to cruise in the anchorage of the Typa, and prevent a similar fatal mistake by seizing and confiscating all ves- sels, of whatsoever nation, anchoring with opium on board \u2014 an empty threat, which was intended only to propitiate the imperial commissioner.

The Chinese Admiral, Kwan, who commanded at the Bogue, replied by a request that the British armed vessels might be removed to a greater distance from the forts, when an answer to the \"chop\" should be speedily presented, which request being at once acceded to, the ships dropped down the river for two or three miles.

But plausible as this view of the subject may appear, and just as it was deemed by many high minded individuals, who ranked themselves against the prosecution of the so styled \" opium war,\" its entire fallacy and evil tendency were equally obvious to all who, from extensive per sonal intercourse with the Chinese, and from the means and opportunities of forming correct opinions upon the subject of our past and pre sent relations with the empire, which they had thereby enjoyed, were well qualified to pro nounce upon the merits of this important ques tion, in its connexion with the war now about to be waged: the opium question should be regarded merely as a spark blown into a mine,"], [71, "MUSTERING THE FORCES. 37 which, during the past half century, the vindic tiveness and insufferable arrogance of the Chi nese government had been gradually charging ; and it can be no more considered the primary cause of the war than can the match, which ignites the train, be styled the cause of the breach made by the explosion. That the quarrel was an unhappy one, and for many reasons to be deeply deplored, does not admit of a doubt, but that it was on our part just and unavoidable, and that the demands of our government were reasonable, and based upon the principle of re ciprocity in commercial intercourse, all must allow, after a dispassionate consideration of all the circumstances of the case. Singapore was the rendezvous of the combined force, forming what was now called the \" Eastern Expedition;\" and so energetically had the mea sures, directed by the ministry, been carried out by the authorities in India, that a compact and serviceable body of troops, mustering about 3600 bayonets, with a due equipment of artillery and other ordnance materiel, and a squadron of three men-of-war and two steamers, had assembled in the roads early in May.

The command of the troops here devolved upon Colonel Burrell, 18th regiment, as senior officer, and Colonel Oglander, of the Cameronians, was second in command. After a detention of three weeks at Singapore, the expedition proceeded and arrived off the Ladrones, near Macao, on the 21st June, the Alligator and Madagascar having preceded the fleet by a few days to carry the intelligence of its approach to Captain Elliot, who was then residing at the Portuguese settle ment. Leaving the transports under the direc tion of Captain Bethune, of the Conway, the Commodore, Sir Gordon Bremer, ran into Macao Roads, with the Wellesley, to communicate -with Captain Elliot, regarding the disposal of the force. It may be easily conceived that the ap pearance of so formidable an assemblage of armed vessels, especially the steamers, was viewed with no little surprise and excitement by the Chinese. On the day following that of the arrival of the Commodore, a public notice was issued establishing a blockade of the river and port of Canton, at all its entrances, to be com menced on the 28th, and specifying, with a view to the convenience of British and foreign merchant ships, certain anchorages of rendez-"], [75, "41 CHUSAN. vous, to which they might be permitted to re pair. On the 24th, the fleet outside the great Ladrones were signalled to proceed to the north ward under the guidance of the Conway, and after receiving this order were directed, in the event of separation, to steer for the southern most island of the Chusan Archipelago, there to await the arrival of the Commodore, with the transports and ships of war. The weather be ing serene, and the wind steady, the whole fleet kept well together, and anchored to the leeward of Buffalo Island, where Captain Bethune issued a circular to the forces, reminding them that the object of the war was to obtain satisfaction, not from the people, but from the government, and exhorting them to adopt, in their intercourse with the former, all means in their power to conciliate their goodwill. The Commodore, with the Madagascar steamer, Alligator frigate, and three transports, with the Atalanta steamer, having on board the two chiefs of the expedi tion and their staff, then proceeded to Chusan northern harbour to reconnoitre. They found the Chinese utterly unprepared for the hostile visit with which they were threatened ; a few war-junks were drawn up abreast of the suburb"], [76, "42 A DEPUTATION. of Ting-hae, the capital, and some soldiers were descried constructing two or three batteries with bags of gunny cloth, or coarse canvas, filled with grain. No fire was, however, opened upon the steamer as she advanced, and even her boats were allowed to row about among the junks, to sound for positions for the ships of war, with out any molestation. On the following morn ing, the Wellesley and several of the nearer ships entered the harbour, dropping their anchors close in-shore, without the slightest attempt to prevent them. The flag-ship was soon, however, boarded by an emissary from the Chinese admiral, seeking to know the business of the strangers, and the reason of their having sought so distant a spot for their visit ; and after returning with the Commodore's reply to their pacific overture, intimation was sent off to the Wellesley, that the Chinese admiral and chief magistrate would visit the English great officers in the course of the day, and confer with them regarding the matters whose adjustment they had come so far to secure. A deputation from the shore accord ingly arrived, consisting of the two principal Chinese functionaries, and a retinue of inferior"], [77, "43 PREPARATIONS FOR ATTACK. mandarins and servants; and the Commodore, having been joined by Colonel Burrell, received them in the great cabin of the 74 with be coming state. They admitted their inability to cope with a force so powerful ; but urged that their duty and allegiance to the Emperor for bade their surrendering the island without offer ing all the resistance in their power ; and finally, they left the Wellesley with the understanding, that if before two p.m., on the day following, no pacific overtures should be made, the town would be forthwith attacked. On the morning of the 5th July, all the trans ports having succeeded in entering the harbour, in spite of the difficulties which beset the pas sage, and which brought many of them into dangerous contact with each other, in the rapid tideways by which the harbour is entered, the troops were prepared for landing, long-boats hoisted out, field-pieces lowered, and every pre paration made for the commencement of active operations ; the men-of-war cleared for action, and the pivot-guns of the steamers trained upon the batteries which the Chinese had hastily thrown up to make a semblance of resistance. From an early hour in the morning, the inha-"], [78, "44 FIRST GUN FIRED. bitants of the town and suburbs, and of the adjacent villages, were seen from the anchorage hurrying out towards the interior in vast num bers, laden with their property, evidently anti cipating the result of the impending conflict, notwithstanding the formidable assemblage of troops which their own authorities were ob served during the day to be forming along the wharfs, and between the batteries, to oppose the landing of the British. At two p.m., no overture for a peaceable occupation of the town having been received, and the display of ban ners along the heights which flanked the prin cipal landing-place, and of troops along the sea wall of the suburb, indicating a determination to resist, a shotted gun was fired from the Wellesley, at a round tower near the water's edge, where some soldiers were strengthening a parapet with sand-bags. It was immediately returned by one from the junk of the Chinese admiral ; and the fire shortly became general along their line of defence, and from their war junks abreast of the town. The first broadside of the Wellesley almost annihilated the wretched craft opposed to her ; and the Conway, directing her guns against some temporary works thrown"], [79, "ENTRANCE TO CHUSAN BAY."], [80, ""], [81, "45 LANDING OF THE TROOPS. up on the slope of a hill to the right of the town, speedily silenced their fire. In a few minutes, the fire of the enemy generally had ceased, save from one junk, which was opposed to the Algerine, and which managed to main tain a contest by far the most spirited of the day. When the smoke cleared away, the junks were seen dismasted, or driven on shore, and the soldiers on the wharfs dispersed. The troops, the first division of whom had been put into their boats previous to the com mencement of the action, were now directed to land ; and the grenadiers of the 18th Royal Irish, and a detachment of Royal Marines, were, in a few minutes after the cessation of the can nonade, formed upon the landing-place, and commenced the ascent of Joss-house Hill. These were the first European troops who had ever landed on the shores of China as conquering invaders. A joss-house, which occupied a com manding position on the summit of the hill to the right of the suburb already alluded to, was taken possession of, and some guns of the Madras Artillery, with a detachment of Sappers and the regiment of Cameronians, defiled through the narrow streets near the water's edge, and"], [82, "46 APPROACH TO THE CITY. emerging upon an open space or plain, partially covered with cultivation, pushed forward until within four or five hundred yards of the ram- parts of the city ; and placing four field-pieces and howitzers in position, as close as the im- passable rice-fields, at this season under water, would allow, threw round shot and shells into the enemy's works, while the Sappers and Miners loopholed and strengthened some farm-houses and out-offices for occupation as an advanced post. For some time, the Chinese maintained a smart fire upon the working parties, and upon the field-battery upon the open ground ; but their powder appeared bad, and their gun- nery worse, for many of their balls fell short even of the limited range required, and such as accomplished the distance whistled wide of their mark. A great show of banners was in the meantime made along the line of rampart threatened by the British ; and a continued din of gongs, and of shouting from the city, indi cated that a serious resistance was intended. Colonel Burrell did not think it prudent to pre cipitate his attack, and the troops were directed to find the best quarters they could in the suburb for the night, and prepare for action early in the morning."], [83, "SAMSHOO. 47 In spite, however, of these precautions, some of the troops, in their search for billets, hap pening to come upon several extensive stores of samshoo, a spirit distilled from rice, and mixed with a decoction of juniper-berry, and some other ingredients of a deleterious nature, drank immoderately of the brutalizing poison, and were found in a state of helpless intoxication. Many Chinese of the lowest class were also found roaming through the suburb in search of plun der ; and before midnight, a conflagration broke out, and consumed so considerable a portion of the suburb, that the 49th Regiment had, in the morning, to make a wide detour to reach the point assigned them in the attack, secure from the burning embers, so dangerous to a column of men with rounds of ball cartridge in their pouches. The approaches to the city gates were reconnoitred on two points during the night by Captain Pears and a party of engineers, and found to present no great obstacle to a coup de main ; but the reconnoitring party, happening to cross the front of an advanced picquet, were fired upon by the sentries, and the out-post, taking up the alarm, opened also with musketry, while Colonel Montgomerie, who commanded the"], [84, "48 FALSE ALARM. troops and artillery, occupying the open ground nearest the city walls, was induced by the rumours brought in by the retreating picquets, to make his men stand to their arms, and the gunners to their pieces, with matches lighted. When morning dawned, Colonel Burrell ad- vanced, with his staff, and a party of the 18th regiment, to reconnoitre the main gate, which was to be the principal object of his attack, when it was discovered that the enemy had abandoned the place during the night, and a ladder having been brought up, two or three officers got over the wall, and removing the bags of grain with which the gates were blocked up, opened an entrance for the leading column. The city was found nearly deserted by its inha- bitants, and the few who remained appeared little inclined to trust to the mercy of their invaders. Their fears were, however, soon allayed, by the protestations of the Rev. Mr. Gutzlaff, who had accompanied the expedition as interpreter, and who immediately distributed and posted up proclamations throughout the city, acquainting the people that the British intended no injury to the inhabitants of the cities and villages, which the course of the war"], [85, "VIEW OF JOSS-HOUSE BILL FROM CHt-SAN H_.HBOI._-."], [86, ""], [87, "ACCIDENT TO THE MELVILLE. 49 might compel them to occupy, but that their only object was to obtain from the emperor redress for many wrongs suffered in by-gone days, and an assurance that the peace and har mony which had so long existed between the two nations should not again be interrupted upon pretexts so absurd and trivial, as well as unjust and despotic, as those which had been advanced at Canton during the past year, to justify the outrageous proceedings which had brought on the present unhappy crisis.

The damage which she sustained was, however, so serious as to compel the admiral to shift his flag into the Wellesley, and to leave the Blenheim, 74, which arrived soon afterwards, to heave down the Melville, and assist in repairing her, an object which was not effectually accomplished until the 1st October. Before the admiral landed, Tinghae was in the possession of our troops, and it only remained for his Excellency to establish such regulations for the government of the island as might best secure the welfare of the people who chose to remain, and the comfort and efficiency of the troops and depots which it was necessary to leave. Colonel Burrell was appointed military commandant, and Mr. H. Clarke, who had been distinguished for his able conduct of the affairs of the East India Com pany in China, after the expiration of their charter, was appointed civil commissioner, an office which he declined, and the duties of both, therefore, devolved on Colonel Burrell.

The letter was received by a mandarin, and detained long enough to admit of the contents being trans cribed, when it was returned to the steamer, with an intimation that the style and subject of the communication were not such as they could venture to expose to the glance of the imperial eye ; the steamer then returned to Chusan har bour. Not so the Blonde frigate, whose com manding officer, Captain Bourchier, had been charged with a similar commission to Amoy, where, on the refusal of the mandarins not only to receive the letter, but to hold any communica tion whatever with the frigate, and on their firing in a treacherous and cowardly manner upon an unarmed boat, which had been sent ashore with Mr. Thom, to endeavour to satisfy them e 2"], [92, "52 BOMBARDMENT OF AMOY. regarding the true nature of the visit, the frigate opened her broadside upon the fort and town walls, and continued pouring her shot against them until all semblance of resistance had ceased.

On the 30th of July, the Admiral and Captain Elliot set sail for the Bay of Petcheelee, having, previous to their departure, proclaimed a blockade of the Ningpo River, and of the line of coast extending northward as far as the Yang-tse- Kiang, whose wide estuary, and the difficult and shifting nature of the banks which obstruct the navigation of its mouths, the Conway, under Captain Bethune, was left to survey and ex plore."], [93, "SICKNESS. 53 Out of respect to the religious feelings of the Chinese, Colonel Burrell did not permit any of the public buildings or Joss-houses in the city of Tinghae to be occupied as barracks by our troops, and with the exception of the 18th regi ment, who were stationed in the large building on Joss-house hill, which had been converted into a strong post of defence, the whole of the force was encamped in tents, exposed by day to the glare of a fierce sun, and by night to the unwholesome exhalations which arose from the damp and reeking soil, and from the paddy fields and channels of irrigation by which they were intersected in a hundred directions.

The flag of Admiral Elliot having been trans ferred to the Wellesley, the expedition to Pet cheelee proceeded northward, and passing the promontory of Shangtung on the 5th August, before the strength of the southerly monsoon had subsided, anchored off the mouth of the Pei-ho, on the 9th, in latitude 38\u00b0 55' north, longitude 118\u00b0 east, but at so great a distance from the shore, that the low mud banks which gird the mouth of the river were barely visible from the maintop of the flagship.

On the 10th, Captain Elliot approached the shore : a strong bar of mud and sand crosses the mouth of the river almost from bank to bank, but having fortunately arrived at the period of spring tides, the steamer, which drew 11^ feet, was enabled on the following morning, at high water, to get safely over the bar, with six inches to spare. She anchored off one of the low forts which ostensibly guarded the approach to Ta-koo, a small town whose pagodas and junk masts became visible to the crew of the steamer a little way up the river's course to the westward. The appearance of this strange craft, propelled by means which must, to the occu pants of the fort, have worn the air of magic, created evident excitement on shore, great crowds assembling on the banks of the river to gaze on the novel spectacle, while horsemen were seen hurrying to and fro along the flats below the forts, on whose mean looking ram parts some troops were also observed collecting."], [97, "57 KEESHEN. The whole appearance of the position and works at the entrance of the river, showed that the visit of the hostile squadron was totally unexpected, and that until the report of its departure from Chusan, in a northerly direction, and of the alarming fact of its having passed the headland of Shang-tung, reached Pekin, the imperial mind had never been awakened to the real nature of the \" communication\" with which the English ministry had favoured his court. Immediately after the steamer had anchored, she was boarded by a messenger from the shore, who informed Mr. Morrison (Captain Elliot's presence, as a matter of etiquette, not being made known) that Keeshen, a member of the imperial cabinet, and governor of the imperial province of Petcheelee, had arrived in the vicinity of Ta-Koo, charged by the emperor to listen to the communications which the foreigners might wish to make, and to receive any letters with which their envoys might be entrusted for the court of Pekin. The tone of this mandarin boded no intention of hostility. The steamer recrossed the bar to join the fleet, Mr. Morrison having signified to the Chinese envoy Captain Elliot's desire that an officer of suitable rank"], [98, "58 PRESENT FROM KEESHEN. should be sent to the flag-ship to receive Lord Pal merston's letter; and further, that the influence of the governor should be exerted to cause proper supplies of fresh provisions to reach the squadron lying at the anchorage, eight or nine miles dis tant. On the 13th, a mandarin of respectable appearance and rank came out in a junk to the Wellesley, attended by several boats, and pre sented to the admiral, for the use of the force, and in the name of Keeshen, a liberal supply of bullocks, sheep, and poultry, an offering of no trifling value to men in such circumstances. This messenger was followed, on the 15th, by an aide-de-camp of the governor, a mandarin of moderate rank, but shrewd and intelligent. His name was Showpei Pih, and he hence earned from the expedition the cognomen of \" Captain White,\" pih signifying white. He was charged by Keeshen to receive the despatch addressed to the imperial cabinet, and was instructed to state that it would be transmitted without delay to Pekin, where no doubt could be entertained that the matters of which it treated would be satisfactorily arranged, and a suitable answer returned after the expiration of ten days, for which period he was commissioned to stipulate."], [99, "59 EXPEDITIONS OF INQUIRY. This proposition was, of course, instantly acceded to, and advantage was taken of the delay to dispatch the vessels of the squadron in various directions, in quest both of geogra phical knowledge, and of the more urgently needed information on the subject of supplies, which, both at the time present and in the event of any future operations in the northern seas, was indispensable. The short cruises made by several of the vessels during this period of delibe ration at Pekin proved exceedingly interesting ; the Blonde, Modeste, with the Ernaad transport, visited the coast of Mantchowria, and besides ascertaining that cattle in abundance were to be procured near the shore, made some valuable observations upon the natural history of that region, establishing the fact of the existence of coal of inferior quality near Fuh-chow, a trading town of that district, and of its having long been a regular article of export from that part of the coast of Tartary.

All the available boats of the squadron were also ordered for service, and strong parties of seamen and marines were \" told off\" for the duty expected in the morning.

It was now produced, and found to contain a proposition from the imperial minister to Captain Elliot, for a conference on shore, when all points requiring investigation could be discussed in a manner far more satisfactory than was practicable in the limited space of an official despatch ; the cus toms of his country, and the peculiar rank which he held, must, he urged, prevent him from visiting the chief plenipotentiary on board his vessel ; but as the position of Captain Elliot, as second in the commission, would not be com promised by waiving the etiquette which could not be disregarded by his chief, and as the inti mate acquaintance of Captain Elliot with the true history of all the events which had led to the present communication especially qualified him to undertake the discussion now solicited, he trusted that Captain Elliot would see no reason"], [102, "62 FURTHER DELAY. to reject his amicable proposal. Captain Elliot immediately consented, and a conference was at once arranged for the 30th, when it accordingly took place. The meeting furnished the first instance of a Chinese dignitary consenting to confer personally upon terms of equality with a subject of Great Britain, and Captain Elliot was received and treated with the utmost cour tesy and distinction by Keeshen, and all the high functionaries who attended him. The conference was private, Captain Elliot being accompanied only by Mr. Morrison, the inter preter, while Keeshen, contrary to Chinese usage, excluded on his part all but his secretary and immediate official attendants. The result of the conference was a further reference to Pekin, and additional delay became thus unavoidable. The scene presented in the interior of the encamp ment, which had been hastily erected for this purpose on the northern bank of the river, between the fort and the water's edge, is repre sented by those present as highly picturesque, although free from everything approaching to unnecessary pomp or ostentation. Two large marquees had been pitched in the centre of an enclosure, formed by canvas screens \u2014 one for"], [103, "63 CHINESE REPAST. the reception of Captain Elliot, the other for the accommodation of Keeshen, in which latter the conference took place. Another range of can vassed dwellings had been erected for the suite, and to serve as a saloon, in which a plentiful and almost sumptuous repast was laid out, consisting of excellent beef and mutton, good bread, birds' nest soup, sea-slugs, and ragouts of comes tibles, whose variety and number gave an air of novelty and curiosity to the entertainment. The marines and boats' crews were, at the same time, well supplied with food in a separate tent. During the conference, parties of officers made attempts to reconnoitre the works and defences of the Chinese up the river. The soldiers, how ever, who were stationed in considerable num bers along the ramparts of the nearest fort, frustrated all their efforts to penetrate beyond the ditch, and it was only ascertained that during the short period which had elapsed since the first visit of the steamer on the 11th, no exertion had been spared by the Chinese to strengthen their fortifications, by repairing the parapets and mounting additional guns and ginjalls to command the entrance of the river.

Amongst the ordnance mounted on the works at the mouth of the Pei-ho, it was observed with some interest that a prominent position in an elevated battery was assigned to six field- pieces of small calibre, which, from the modern and correct form of their carriages, and from the European style of the equipment and casting of the guns, it was con- cluded were the identical pieces presented to the emperor by Lord Macartney, on the occasion of his embassy to Pekin.

At this point of the coast of Petcheelee, a lofty and bold range of mountains, which runs in a northerly direction parallel to the shore for several leagues, abruptly ceases or becomes broken into low undulations of insigni ficant height. Along the summit of this rocky bar rier, the wall was seen to extend, crowning every commanding ridge, and descending the most precipitous scarps, which occurred in the rugged chain over which its course lay, until on reach ing the point where its continuity is broken, it was observed running down to the sea by an almost inaccessible slope, and terminating at the water's edge in a square fort, in which a strong body of troops was seen encamped. No attempt was made to land, but the steamer was moved slowly backwards and forwards in front of the fort, to afford an opportunity of examining as closely as possible this stupendous monument.

On the 8th September, the admiral having returned to the anchorage, the steamer was sent to the shore, according to invitation, to bring off the mandarin, whom we have styled Captain White, with the final reply of the imperial cabinet. This was to the effect, that the emperor being of opinion that the matters in question could be better discussed at Canton, where the difficulties had arisen, had deputed Keeshen to proceed thither, and requested the plenipoten tiaries to meet him at that place. This being acceded to, the fleet left the anchorage on the 15th, steering for the Meaon-taon islands and the promontory of Shang-tung.

The chief engineer, Captain Pears, by direction of Brigadier Burrell, proceeded to scarp away the slopes of Joss-house Hill, towards the city, and to excavate the foundations of a retaining wall, to form the enceinte of a small fort to crown its summit. The batteries were marked out and commenced, but it was soon found that to give the work its proper strength, it would be neces- sary to remove a mass of earth which had at first been considered a portion of the hill, but which proved to consist of a vast accumulation of coffins, built up in tiers with earth and stones, so as to form a mound. As the work was to be completed as speedily as possible, there was no alternative but to cut away the whole of this funereal pile, and in the course of a few days some hundreds of coffins were to be seen either tumbling over the cliffs into the sea, rolled down into the fields at the foot of the hill, or piled up clear of the projected works. Some Chinese at length began to remove them, but so slowly, that infection being dreaded from the mass of corruption which each day's work exposed to view, the sappers employed in building the fort were directed to collect the remnants of mortality"], [116, "70 WRECK OF THE MELVILLE : into a heap, which was then burnt to ashes with the fuel furnished by the coffins which had been their last earthly tenements. During the months of August and September, the Chinese spies, and others in the pay of the mandarins, had commenced the practice of kidnapping, which was, at a subsequent period, carried to a serious extent. Instigated by the large rewards offered by the mandarins at Ningpo for pri soners, whether Europeans or natives of India, the wretches employed in this nefarious pursuit at length laid a plan for the seizure of Captain Anstruther, of the Madras Artillery, in which, unfortunately, they succeeded.

The unmanly barbarity with which this hapless lady was treated, excited, when it became known at Chusan, through the medium of a friend, to whom she contrived to convey a letter, a feeling of deep indignation. Not only was she made to endure the acute suffering of confinement in a cage, not more than three and a half feet in length, during thirty-six consecutive hours, without a moment's respite, but she was ex posed in the market-places of several towns, through which the prisoners passed, to the gaze of the populace, and to the jeers and hootings of a canaille, who, according to the custom of their country, consider any woman who quits her home to appear abroad, save in the seclu sion of a sedan chair, to have lost all claim to the consideration due to her sex."], [120, "72 RELEASE OF PRISONERS REFUSED.

During the absence of the admiral in the north, the operations conducted by Captain Bethune, in the Yang-tse-Kiang, had been suc cessful and interesting. A passage safe for vessels of a certain draught at ordinary, and for the largest class at spring tides, was surveyed and correctly noted on a chart, and the Conway, which was joined by the Algerine, (after a visit which the latter paid to Chapoo, and which produced a smart engagement with a Chinese battery, in which the enemy showed much spirit,) then proceeded up the river, surveying the va rious banks and shoals with which its channel is impeded.

No attempt was made to molest the ships or boats during the surveying operations by war junks or armed row boats ; but whenever want of fresh provisions occasioned a foraging excur sion on shore, the party almost always found their way beset by armed bands of Chinese ; and during skirmishes which frequently took place, some loss on the part of the British was expe rienced. One midshipman, Mr. Harvey, of the Conway, was mortally wounded on shore at the western extremity of Tsung-ming, (now called, in memory of his untimely fate, Harvey Point,) in an encounter with a party of Chinese soldiers who had taken post behind an old junk, hauled on shore to form a sort of breastwork. A sea man of the Conway was killed upon the same occasion.

Vast numbers of lawless ruffians infested the streets of Macao, and the persons of British subjects were in more than one instance assailed. A vague presentiment of an impending attack was felt by all ; and while the movements and preparations of the Chinese forces at CasaBianca and the barrier were watched with much anxiety, the inhabitants of the town, both English and Portuguese, maintained by night strict watch and ward, as though in a beleagured city. At length an incident occurred, which brought mat ters to a crisis. While bathing on the morning of the 6th August, at the point of the coast called Casilha Bay, the Rev. Mr. Staunton, a gen tleman much esteemed by the community, was attacked by an armed party of Chinese, knocked down and wounded by a sword cut, and bound and carried into a boat, which immediately pro ceeded to Canton. A feeling of alarm and indig nation was at once excited among the British when the news of this abduction was spread ;"], [126, "78 CRITICAL SITUATION OF THE BRITISH. and an address was immediately dispatched to Captain Smith, senior naval officer in the south, and then commanding the Druid, to exert his influence to obtain Mr. Staunton's release, or to secure him from coercion or injury ; and at the same time soliciting his attention to a recent edict by the viceroy of Kwang-tung, offering a reward for the seizure or assassination of British subjects, to the gathering of troops about the shores of the inner harbour and barrier, and to the lawless conduct of the desperadoes, among whom the perpetrators of the outrage on the Bilbaino, and of the atrocities committed on the crew of the Black Joke, were notorious, which proved that the situation of the British community at Macao, in spite of the friendly disposition and efforts of the Portuguese to ensure their safety, had become critical and threatening to an ex treme degree. On the following day Captain Smith came into Macao roads in the Enterprize steamer, and cir culated on the 11th a reply to the letter of the English inhabitants, in which he informed them that Mr. Johnston, the deputy superintendent, had already addressed the governor of Macao, soliciting his intercession with the provincial"], [127, "PREPARATION FOR CONFLICT. 79 government to obtain the release of Mr. Staun ton, who, it had been ascertained, was then in the hands of the police authorities at Canton. In consequence of this application, the governor of Macao lost no time in addressing the Taou-tae, or Chinese authority, \u2014 who, strange to say, exercises his functions under the immediate con trol of the provincial government, in the very heart of the Portuguese settlement, \u2014 begging his personal interference on the subject with the viceroy. Yih, the Taou-tae, accordingly left Macao on the evening of the 11th August, for the ostensible purpose of seeing the viceroy, and negotiating for the immediate release of Mr. Staunton. He returned, however, on the 17th, charged with instructions, which he took little pains to conceal, to recommence that system of harassment and annoyance which had in the preceding year caused the expulsion of the British from Macao. There was now but one course to pursue to avert the threatened danger, and this Captain Smith did not hesitate at once to adopt.

Having directed the steamer to proceed with the boats in tow to the northward, so as to land the troops at a considerable dis- tance on the flank of the Chinese position, Cap- tain Smith directed the vessels to anchor abreast of the battery, and open their fire. The result was, that, after about 600 thirty-two pounder shot had been fired, the troops were landed, and the Chinese withdrew from their works, of which we then quietly took possession. But few of the Chinese were killed, and none made pri soners ; and of the wounded scarcely a man was found within the works. However, in its results this little affair was very complete ; seventeen guns were spiked, all the tents, magazines, and store buildings be hind the battery were destroyed by fire, and the"], [129, "BARRIER WALL, MACAO."], [130, ""], [131, "RETIREMENT OF THE CHINESE. 81 war junks, which had for some days occupied a position on the inner side of the barrier, slipped their cables, and ran out of gun-shot into the inner harbour. Thirty or forty of the Chinese were supposed to have been killed or wounded, while of the British, four only were hurt, and none seriously. The affair was witnessed by a vast concourse of people from the adjacent heights, among whom were the principal mem bers of the British community at Macao ; and the Chinese, on the following morning, (the British having evacuated the barrier works on the evening of their capture,) withdrew all the spiked guns and materiel which remained un consumed, to a fort near Casa Bianca, which they now began to repair.

It had been the object of the British govern ment to limit the primary operations of the first expeditionary force to the simple occupation of an advantageous insular position to serve as a depot, and to the establishment of a close blockade of all the more important seaports, a measure which it was expected would cause great distress to the numerous traders of the coast, and to the exporting manufacturers, and thereby induce the imperial cabinet to accede to conditions by which the empire might be re lieved from a scourge so injurious to its welfare."], [133, "THE CITY OF AMOY. 83 The utter fallacy of this popular notion has since been fully established, but a digression, to exhibit the reasons for the innocuous operation upon the people of this extraordinary country, of a system which must elsewhere invariably act as a compression of the main artery of the state, would here be out of place.

The Queen carried a white flag at her mainmast head, and on approaching Chuenpee, where a new work of defence had been recently con structed, she sent a boat with a white flag flying in her stern sheets, in the direction of the Chinese position, with an officer bearing the dispatch of Eleepoo and a communication from the admiral.

Admiral Elliot sailed from Chusan in the Volage, on the 7th December, 1840. Until the latter end of this month, negotiations pro ceeded between Captain Elliot and Keeshen in a satisfactory manner, and from the tenour of some of the communications made by the latter to the imperial cabinet, which found their way into the public prints, it appeared that the policy of Keeshen was decidedly pacific, and that, if left to the dictates of his own uncontrolled impressions and opinions, the diffi culties in the way of a satisfactory accommo dation would be permanently removed ; but, unfortunately, political intrigue was at that time too powerful in Pekin ; numerous partisans of Lin, and many favourable to a war with the hated foreigners, beset the emperor with repre-"], [141, "COMMISSIONER LIN SUPERSEDED. 91 sentations as false as their tendency was evil and seditious.

When the intel ligence of his supercession reached him, he concocted an acute but fanatical memorial to the emperor, commencing in the usual style of degraded mandarins, by praying for con dign punishment as a relief to his over wrought feelings, and ending in an energetic exhortation to use the strongest measures against the English \u2014 to expel them from the"], [142, "92 THE NEMESIS STEAMER. empire, and to sever all connexion with them for ever.

Captain Elliot, in the Wellesley, remained at Lintin, not far from the forts of Chuenpee and the Bogue, supported by a formidable fleet, which had been last joined by the Nemesis iron steamer, commanded by Captain Hall, a vessel destined to be very conspicuous in all the most important achievements of the war.

About 150 were made prisoners, many of them severely wounded, and about 400 dead and dying, lay in and about the fort, when the firing ceased. In one particular spot, where the rock rose with a steep slope behind some military buildings, the corpses of the slain were found literally three and four deep, the Chinese having been shot while trying to escape up the hill, and having rolled over, until this ghastly pile was formed. The loss on the side of the British amounted to thirty-eight men wounded, many of them slightly, by the explosion of a field magazine, which caught fire after the troops had entered the fort. While these operations were being carried on upon the left or northern bank of the river, a squadron, under the command of Cap tain Scott, R. N., consisting of the Samarang, Druid, Modeste and Columbine, proceeded in the direction of the fort of Tycocktow, which is situated on the opposite shore a short distance higher up the river ; and having anchored abreast of a powerful battery, built upon the waters' edge, bombarded it for the space of an hour, n"], [148, "98 BOMBARDMENT OF TYCOCKTOW. when, the fire of the Chinese slackening, divi sions of marines and small-arms men from each ship pushed ashore, and climbing over the shat tered parapet, soon drove the enemy from their works. More resistance, however, was offered here than at Chuenpee, for the Chinese were not forced from their ramparts until the boats' crews had gained their summit, and the bayonet and cutlass had clashed with the spear and the broadsword. Several of the assailants received wounds from the cold steel, a rare occurrence in the Chinese war ; and Lieutenant Bower, of the Samarang, received a severe sword-cut in the knee, while forcing his way over the parapet. The Nemesis had on this day the first oppor tunity of displaying the great utility of small iron vessels of light draught in river service. After disembarking the whole of the 37th regi ment below Chuenpee, she ran alongside the fort, and threw shells into the upper fort, until the advance of the troops compelled the shipping to cease firing, when, taking advantage of her light draught, she ran close up to the sea bat tery, and poured through the embrasures de structive rounds of grape as she passed ; then"], [149, "UTILITY OF SMALL IRON VESSELS. 99 pushing on over the shallows into Anson's Bay, into the midst of the war junks lying at anchor, she threw Congreve rockets with startling effect, the very first having set fire to the largest of them, which blew up, with all her crew on board. Aided by a flotilla of boats from the squadron, she proceeded on her course across the bay, setting fire to junk after junk, until the whole fleet, eleven in number, was destroyed, except two which yet remained unhurt, moored to the shore on the far side of the bay ; but Captain Hall went over, grappled them, towed them off into deep water, and set fire to them, before the Chinese could sufficiently recover from their surprise and consternation, to offer any resist ance to the bold man\u0153uvre. In the meantime, the 74-gun ships proceeded higher up the river, to prepare for the attack upon the defences of the Bogue, as soon as the troops and squadron engaged in the reduction of Chuenpee and Tycocktow had been withdrawn from those forts.

The troops were then all re-embarked, and the signal made for the leading ships to weigh. It had been arranged that the Blenheim should lead into action, and the Queen steamer was accordingly directed to take her in tow, but by some acci dent of eddy or counter-current, or other cause, after being made fast to the steamer, the Blen heim swung round upon the stream, and could not be moved, so that her commander ordered the hawser to be let go, and made sail upon her. The wind being light, but little progress was made, but still she was forging a-head with the whole fleet in her wake, and gradually closing upon the great Anunghoy battery, which formed at that time the main defence of the Bogue, its fire being the first which a vessel had to encoun ter in attempting the passage. The long ex pected engagement now appeared inevitable, and a severe lesson about to be given to the Chinese, who set such store by their enormous granite batteries at the Tiger's mouth ; but be fore the Blenheim had completed her run, and got within range of Anunghoy, a mean-looking boat, rowed by an old woman, pushed out from"], [151, "101 PROPOSITION FOR PEACE. the landing-place, displaying a white flag.

The proposition which the man was com missioned to make was in character and sub stance very similar to the previous communica tions, made in like manner at other places to the plenipotentiary, being nothing more than a request from the Chinese commander-in-chief, Admiral Kwan, on the part of Keeshen, that hostilities might be suspended pending a further discussion of terms for a treaty to be at once entered into between the chiefs of the contend ing parties.

Dupli cates of these dispatches were also forwarded overland by the imperial express, to ensure their speedy arrival and the early evacuation of Chu san, Keeshen at the same time directing Eleepoo to release the prisoners confined at Ningpo, and deliver them over to the ship of war that would be sent to receive them. On the 27th January, the plenipotentiary, accompanied by a numerous retinue, proceeded up the river in the Nemesis, to within a few miles of Whampoa, to hold by appointment a conference with Keeshen, in a pavilion which had been erected for the occasion at a point called Second Bar, where the party were received with every mark of respect and distinction, and entertained with good cheer and with honeyed and wily speeches enough to put to flight any doubts which might yet have remained in the mind of the plenipotentiary.

On his return from the conference, Captain Elliot issued a circular, to inform British subjects that, although negotiations were proceeding \" satis factorily,\" it became necessary to warn those who might purpose going to Canton, that until his excellency should declare that they might do so with safety, the whole risk and responsibility of their own proceedings must rest upon them selves. On the 13th February, Captain Elliot had another interview with the imperial commis sioner, but no direct result affecting the opening of the trade accrued therefrom, although the day agreed upon in the treaty had already passed.

On the 23rd, the first blow was struck, by breaking up a strong force employed in obstruct ing the passage of a channel of the river at the back of Anunghoy, a service which was dash ingly performed by a small force under the orders of Captain Herbert, consisting of the Nemesis and four pinnaces ; the enemy's works, com-"], [161, "ASSEMBLING OF THE FLEET. 111 prising a masked battery and field-work, were carried by the seamen and marines, and about eighty pieces of artillery of various calibre were spiked and untrunnioned without the loss of a man, while of the Chinese about thirty fell. On the 25th, the fleet intended for the reduc tion of the Bogue forts was assembled near the island of South Wangtung, and a close recon noissance having been made of the defences of the enemy, dispositions were made for the attack. Up to the present time the ordinary passage, by which vessels of any considerable burden en tered the Canton River, was that between the islands of North and South Wangtung and the peak of Anunghoy, but it had been for some time known that a safe channel also existed to the westward, and no pains had been spared to render the latter as difficult and dangerous as possible, by bringing the fire of two formidable batteries of forty-five and forty guns, to bear upon it ; the one constructed on the western ex tremity of North Wangtung, the other on the opposite, or right bank of the river.

Owing to a calm which fell soon after day break, and the great strength of the ebb tide, it was not until eleven o'clock that the leading ships of the fleet were able to move into the po sitions assigned to them, so that for the space of five hours nothing distracted the attention of the Chinese from the small battery of howitzers which played upon them ; and it will convey some idea of their miserable deficiency in gun nery, to remark that during all that time, al though many guns in the southern horns of the half-moon batteries on Wangtung bore upon it, not a single casualty occurred amongst Captain i"], [164, "114 NAVAL ARRANGEMENTS.

The advance squadron, in the meantime, consisting of the Calliope, Herald, Samarang, Alligator, &c, passed on to a position which they had been directed to take up to the northward of the Chinese defences, firing their starboard broadsides into the lower Wangtung battery as they passed.

It was afterwards ascertained that these boats, the only ones that had been retained at the landing-place of the island, had been used to bear away the principal officers of the troops stationed there, with their own immediate fol lowers, from the scene of danger, and hence the contumely and revenge so unequivocally ex pressed towards them by the luckless garrison of"], [167, "117 CONFLAGRATION. the forts which they had so ignominiously aban doned to their fate.

Large parties of seamen were employed, under the direction of Lieutenant Johnston, of the Madras engineers, in destroying the long line of batteries at Anunghoy, and on the west bank of the river, for which the large quantity of powder found in the enemy's magazines furnished ample means, and in a very short space of time the"], [169, ""], [170, "THE BOGUE FORTS."], [171, "119 THE BOGUE FORTS DEMOLISHED. imposing granite fortifications, which had so long been the pride and boast of the southern provinces, were crumbled into ruins.

All were glad to turn their backs upon Chusan, and the poor soldiers of the Cameronians, and 49th regiments, as their last companies quitted the shores, where so many of their comrades had found premature graves, could not refrain from giving three cheers of thankfulness at their release from the hateful spot which they were looking upon, they believed, for the last time. After the arrangement of the armistice at Canton, the fleet, with the exception of the few light craft of Captain Herbert's squadron, which were left to protect and watch the fac tories, together with all the transports, save those which had furnished the garrison for North Wangtung, dropped down the river once more,"], [180, "128 IMPERIAL EDICT. and returned to Hong-Kong, where Sir Hugh Gough lost no time in remodelling and re-organ izing the small force, reduced as it now was by the number of invalids whom it had been found neces sary to send to India and to Europe, and by the departure of the regiment of Bengal volunteers from Chusan to Singapore direct. Towards the latter end of the month, the Melville, having completed her term of service, sailed for Eng land, as did also the Samarang, the Madagascar steamer being, at the same time, sent to Cal cutta with despatches for the Governor- General, followed shortly by the Queen, bearing the broad pennant of Sir G. Bremer, who considered it advisable to confer with him upon the subject of the extensive operations in China, which ap peared now to be unavoidable. Early in April, an edict was received from Pekin, conveying the sentiments of the emperor upon the subject of the capture and destruction of the Bogue forts, breathing the direst vengeance against the audacious rebels, whose utter extermination he enjoined upon all his officers and functionaries ; declaring, in the most emphatic terms, that both powers could not stand under the same heaven, and that one of the two must forthwith perish."], [181, "129 KEESHEN DISGRACED.

Many of the British merchants returned to their own hongs, and the factories began to wear the air of bustle and business which had marked them of old. On the 5th, Captain Elliot returned to Canton, and resided in the hall of the British hong until the 17th, before which date he received, through the pre fect of the district, the most satisfactory assur ance, that the recent convention was approved by the new commissioners, Yihshan and Lung wan, who made their entry into Canton on the"], [183, "INDIGNATION OF THE BRITISH. 131 14th.

Towards the middle of April, rumours in Canton gave warning of the storm, which the majority of the British and other foreign resi dents had already expected, and prepared them selves against.

Captain Elliot still continued at Hong-Kong, completing his arrangements for the government and colonization of the island, during his absence in the north, whither it was now decided that the main portion of the force should proceed, to destroy the fortifications of Amoy, and to resume possession of Chusan.

Fire-rafts were pre paring in the creeks above Shaming, and large flotillas of war-boats had been collected, well manned and armed, for the ostensible object of making a descent upon the light squadron of Captain Herbert, which lay at anchor off the factories. Under the influence of the alarm naturally excited by these threatening appear ances, the inhabitants of the city and suburb fled in crowds from the scene of danger, many of the foreign merchants also removing their books and valuable effects on board ship, and the few who continued to reside on shore, keeping themselves in constant readiness to escape from their precarious shelter in the British hongs. On the 21st May, Sir Le F.

Pre vious to their visit, however, the plenipotentiary had recommended all her Britannic Majesty's subjects to retire from the factories before sunset on the 21st, all that had come to his excellency's knowledge having led to the conviction, that the assurances of the municipal authorities of Can ton, and more especially of Yu, the acting kwang-chow-foo, (in a proclamation which he caused to be posted in the British factories and throughout the city,) to the effect that the per sons and goods of all foreign merchants ran no risk whatever, had been made solely with a view to gain time, and to lull the British into a false security. On the night of the 21st, a number of fire rafts were sent adrift upon the cutter Louisa and schooner Aurora, on board the latter of which the few mercantile gentlemen who had still lingered in the factories had taken refuge. As the rafts bore clown in burning masses, the flashes of guns were seen along the suburb, from the great Shaming battery, as far as the Creek factory, near the renowned \"Hog-lane,\" the"], [189, "137 THE SHAMING BATTERY. shot from which hissed around the vessels in a storm, which, had it been better directed, must have annihilated them, as they were for a long time unable to get out of range, owing to the strength of the tide and the want of wind. The Modeste, Pylades, and Algerine, which were lying at anchor in the Macao passage, ran alongside the batteries, and engaged them with as good effect as the uncertain light would per mit, while the boats of the Herald, which came up the river from Napier's Reach, towed the fire-rafts clear of danger to the ships. The Nemesis shortly after pushed close in to the Shaming battery, which was thundering upon the squadron with guns by no means badly served ; and under cover of this, favoured by a slant of wind and a slackening tide, the Louisa and Aurora escaped the threatened destruction, and anchored in the mouth of the Macao pas sage. The Nemesis, meanwhile, was carrying on a singular contest with the Shaming battery ; for her bow-gun having a false tube jammed into the vent, had become for a short time unservice able ; her rudder had got foul, and would not work so as to bring her stern-gun into play,"], [190, "138 THE NEMESIS IN PERIL. and a rocket, laid in the tube at a critical mo ment, when the steamer was exposed to a heavy fire, was some time before it could be discharged, and in exploding it severely wounded Captain Hall, who fired it himself. In this momentary extremity, the marines were ordered to fire at the embrasures, which were distinguishable in the darkness by the flashes of the guns in their recesses, a service which was performed with such steadiness and effect, that the fire of the battery was all but silenced, and time gained to clear the forward gun , and get the steamer again into fighting order. In the morning her funnel and paddle-boxes were found to be riddled with balls, yet, as usual, the casualties among her crew were trifling ; and when day had dawned, the Shaming battery having been deserted or silenced, she pushed up the river, with the boats of the squadron in tow, and entirely destroyed a large flotilla of thirty nine war junks and boats, which was observed lying under the shelter of some large warehouses on the side of the river.

Several valuable stores of cloths, woollens, &c, were, however, discovered, and a gang of ruffians soon issued from the square, laden with the rich spoil. After having been in possession of the factories about two hours, they were dislodged by a strong detachment of Chinese troops, who forthwith completed the work of plunder in which the mob had been interrupted.

The mask being now fairly thrown off, the general and commodore lost no time in bringing the whole of their forces to bear upon the point most favourable for a decisive blow at the city. The plan was to land the troops some distance above the city, clear of the suburb, and perform ing a slight circuit, attack some forts which crowned several eminences commanding the ramparts near the north-west angle, where a wooded height seemed to afford cover enough for a strong division of men, and an admirable position for a battery to play upon the town. Captain Belcher, of the Starling, was selected to ascertain, as a preliminary step, the feasibility of towing vessels or boats from the entrance of the Macao passage across the river to the mouth of a creek to the westward of the town, which service was well performed, in spite of a deter mined opposition to the advance of the flotilla which supported the reconnoissance ; and Captain Belcher having obtained a good view of the adjacent country, by hoisting himself to the top of a junk's mast, returned to the commodore's ship with the satisfactory intelligence, that the troops might be landed without danger or diffi culty up the creek, and that the ground between"], [193, "THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY. 141 the point of debarkation and the forts presented no serious obstacle to the passage of troops and guns.

The force was divided into two columns, of which the right, under Major (now Lieut. - Colonel) Pratt, of the 26th regiment, was directed to land and occupy the factories, and to be guided by the circumstances which might arise as to their future operations. The left column landed at the village of Tsinghae, under the command of Major-General Burrell, and marched on the morning of the 25th in the direction of the heights already selected as the first point of attack. The forts by which they were crowned"], [194, "142 FORTS AT TSINGHAE. were four in number ; and though not remark able for strength individually, formed as a whole a formidable position, as the advance to each was well swept by the walls of the city, or by rising ground which flanked them. Some guns and howitzers having, through most extraordi nary exertion on the part of the artillery, been brought up and placed in position, within 300 to 400 yards of the forts, a heavy fire was opened upon them at about eight a.m., which was returned with considerable spirit for about an hour, when the columns of attack having been formed, the advance was sounded, and the whole of the forts carried at the point of the bayonet. The resistance was at first strenuous, the Chinese troops in some instances even advancing outside the walls, as if to dispute the progress of our troops on equal ground, but none stood the approach of the bayonet long enough to admit of personal conflict, and the slaughter was in consequence inconsiderable. As soon as the forts had fallen, the Chinese garrison opened upon them a heavy fire from their rampart guns and ginjalls, along the whole northern face of the city, and so well-directed and steadily sustained was it, that the British forces, while in"], [195, "143 ENGAGEMENT. occupation of this position, suffered greater loss than had been inflicted in the course of the ope rations by which the forts had been carried. At the point gallantly carried by Captain Bourchier's naval brigade the fire was particularly fatal, several officers and men having here fallen, killed or wounded. The small quantity of ammuni tion brought up was soon expended ; and the fire on both sides slackened towards evening, and ceased at nightfall, leaving the British in possession of the whole chain of heights which command the city on the north-east face, and masters of a formidable entrenched camp a short distance to the eastward, which had been carried in the morning by the 18th and 49th regiments, though not without considerable loss both of men and officers, including a brave and zealous lieutenant of engineers, Mr. Rundall. The want of ammunition prevented Sir Hugh Gough from undertaking any operation beyond occasional demonstrations upon the place on the day succeeding that of the attack on the heights, which was employed in bringing up cartridges and shot, as well as additional nine-pounders and howitzers, from the landing place near the mouth of the creek ; and so strenuous were the"], [196, "144 MODE OF ATTACK. exertions of the artillery, that before nightfall fifteen pieces were in position before the walls, with an ample supply of shot and shells, and some few carcases and rockets. The mode of attack was obvious, as almost immediately op posite the fort which formed the left of the British position, within the city walls, was a commanding hill, crowned by a joss-house and other buildings, which, when in possession of the British, would place the city at their mercy. The attack was in consequence directed chiefly against this hill, one column being ordered to enter by escalade near a high building situated close to the ramparts inside the city, while another made a detour to the north gate, and entered by blowing it open : the two were then to unite in a general advance upon the hill, where the guns were to be planted, and farther measures taken as circumstances might dictate. But the delay occasioned by the want of ammu nition, and the difficulty of bringing up guns over the broken ground which intervened be tween the British position and the place of de barkation, crossed as the line of communica tion was by levels of swampy paddy land and knolls covered with Chinese tombs and grave-"], [197, "HEIGHTS OE CANTON."], [198, ""], [199, "145 CONSTERNATION AT CANTON. stones, frustrated the expectations of the force ; for when upon the point of giving the signal for the artillery to open upon the parapets, a messenger arrived from the plenipotentiary, who had remained on board the Calliope, with a dispatch for Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Le F. Senhouse, acquainting them that hostilities were again suspended, the commissioners and the governor of Canton having proposed terms which his excellency had been induced to accept, in order to spare the assault of the town. At the same time the Chinese were seen crowding on the walls, hoisting white flags and making demonstrations of amity and peace. After the fall of the advanced forts, and the near approach of the British troops toward the walls, the most terrible consternation appears to have seized the inhabitants of the city, who, until they saw the enemy within musket-shot of their defences, had not abandoned all confi dence in their garrison ; but from this time the utmost confusion prevailed, heightened by seve ral desperate encounters between the provincial troops and those of the northern districts, which had recently arrived to reinforce the place ; and in this frightful exigency Yih-shan dispatched L"], [200, "146 PROPOSALS FOR PEACE. the kwang-chow-foo to the vessel in which the plenipotentiary had established his head-quar ters, to negotiate an armistice and to prevent the assault, upon the best terms he could obtain.

The humbling of the provincial capital was deemed incomplete ; and it was contended that, in consideration of the extreme provocation which the treachery of the Chinese authorities and the arrogance of the people had caused, no terms of accommodation l 2"], [202, "148 BRITISH AND CHINESE FORCES. should have been listened to, until the British flag had been planted on the ramparts of the hitherto inviolate city. But the considerations which influenced Cap tain Elliot were of great weight, and may be thus stated. The total numerical strength of the force under arms before Canton, on the morning of the 27th May, did not exceed 2200 men of all arms, while within the city there were not less than 20,000 men, after making a very large allowance for exaggerations by the \" confiden tial agents,\" \u2014 fearful odds to be encountered in the pent-up space of a closely built city, where a knowledge of the localities would have given the Chinese abundant opportunity to molest our troops.

It should, moreover, be borne in mind, that in the confusion which a bombard ment of the town would have created, all public order must have been overthrown, and in all probability the greater part of the city destroyed by fire, and its treasuries plundered by the mob. It appears now to be generally admitted, that the course pursued by Captain Elliot was, under the circumstances, the most judicious which could have been adopted.

This was, of course, successful ; and as soon as the enemy had been dispersed and put to flight at all points, the General, find ing the rain descending in torrents, and every appearance of a tempestuous night, directed a retreat towards the heights occupied by the main body of the army. The muskets of the troops being all furnished with flint locks, had, of course, by this time, become utterly useless, and as the various detachments drew off from the scene of the late conflict, without further attempt to molest them, the Chinese, gathering upon the rear and flanks of the column, harassed them in the most resolute and spirited manner, closing upon the bayonets of the men, and engaging them hand to hand whenever an advantageous opportunity presented itself, as in crossing a stream, or defiling through lanes and village streets.

The sepoys in the meantime contrived to clean out some of their firelocks with rags torn from their turbans and shirts, and loading them under cover of their caps, handed them to their officers, who picked out a for ward man amongst the enemy sufficiently often to deter them from closing. Before an hour, however, had elapsed, the Chinese were observed bringing a small piece of artillery to the front, and fixing its clumsy carriage upon a low emi nence so close to the devoted detachment that every discharge, pointed even by rude and unac customed hands, must have produced fearful havoc in its ranks.

The troops shortly afterwards returned to their quarters in the forts and villages near the heights, and the night was passed without further alarm or molestation on the part of the irregulars ; but on the following morning they were seen collecting in strong bodies, on the hills to the northward and westward, and, as many banners were displayed in their ranks, and a firing of guns and ginjalls was heard, Sir H.

The position in which affairs were left in the Kwang-tung province, was indeed anomalous : a Chinese garrison occupied the island of North Wangtung, and nominally guarded the entrance of the Bogue, while pilot chops were issued to British and foreign merchant vessels, which passed in great numbers to and from Whampoa, where the port dues and exactions of the man darins (called cumshaw, or fee) were paid with as much regularity as before the war, but with this difference, that an additional impost of seve- * The public notices and passages of interest which ap pear in the English newspapers published in China, are translated into Chinese, in Canton, with regularity and with considerable accuracy."], [224, "170 REFUSAL OF AN INTERVIEW. ral hundred dollars on ships of a certain class was submitted to and paid without remon strance ; no blockade was laid on the port, and while war was waged on every other part of the coast, and every effort made to annihilate the resources and distress the revenue of the em pire, exorbitant clues were permitted to be poured into the treasury of its principal port.

The kwang-chow-foo was sent to Macao, to seek an interview with his excellency at the house of Mr. D. L. Burn, with whom he was residing. Sir Henry, however, at once de clined to receive the mandarin, being impressed with the ill effect which was likely to result from any indication on his part of a willingness to listen to negotiations and persuasions, and Major Malcolm, the secretary of legation, much to the astonishment of the kwang-chow-foo, was de puted to convey to him the plenipotentiary's courteous refusal of the interview requested.

A considerable number of Chinese, principally dealers in live stock, bum-boat articles, spirits, and opium, soon began to squat on the shores of Hong-Kong ; and although for many months they constituted about as rascally and vagabond a community as could be found in a similar situation in any part of the world, the peace and order of the infant colony were preserved by the magistrate, Major Caine."], [227, "CHAPTER XVI.

With their usual short-sightedness in such matters, however, the Chinese had entirely overlooked the necessity of protecting their flanks from being turned, and of covering every landing place on which troops might be disembarked, with the power to descend upon their line in a direction which could render the fire of their prodigious artillery and battery entirely futile. n 2"], [240, "182 LANDING OF THE BRITISH.

This duty was gallantly performed, and the enemy were soon in full flight across the low ground which separated their position from the city, leaving a great number of dead and wounded on the field, together with the whole of their guns, tents, and camp materiel. The 55th suffered some loss in their advance up the slope of the hill, and amongst others in their ranks, whose fall on this day was lamented, may be mentioned Ensign Duall, an officer of high promise, who had been recently promoted from the ranks for exemplary conduct and superior attainments, and who had on this occasion, for the first time, the honour of bearing one of the colours of his regiment into the field.

On the right, however, there was some opposition, and the 18th regiment and Royal marines suffered some loss, and had some sharp encounters with bodies of troops, who rallied from time to time in the long battery and turned resolutely upon their pursuers, before the whole line of works could be cleared, and the Joss-house Hill fort gained."], [245, "183 GREAT LOSS OF THE CHINESE. The whole formed an exceedingly picturesque and brilliant operation, and the magnitude of the defences which the Chinese had constructed to repel our attack, and the strength of the force which they had collected to man and support them, proved that the blow was of importance.

Those in the long battery were, however, interred, and the wounded removed into shel tered places, where their hurts could be attended to by the surgeons of the British force. The casualties on the side of the combined naval and military force were trivial.

Immediately after the occupation of Ting-hae by the troops, the Nemesis and Phlegethon steamers were dispatched round the island, to intercept any junks or boats in which the de feated Chinese might attempt their escape to the main, but without success, the troops of the enemy appearing to have melted away after their rout in a manner as complete as it was imper ceptible.

Many of the Chinese soldiery were in the habit of escaping death, by adopting this prompt method of changing their profession.

Early on the morning of the 10th October, a strong column of infantry and artillery was landed upon a sandy beach far to the right or eastward of the Chinese position, and made a circuit round the base of the hills on which the main body of the enemy were posted, so as to get well in their rear, while their attention was diverted by the attack of another column which was landed near the mouth of the river, and by the fire of the men-of-war and steamers, which were anchored as close in shore as the shoaling of the water would allow, in order to demolish the defences of the citadel, and to throw shells into the batteries and intrenchments on the"], [253, "CANNONADE OF CHIN-HAE. 189 heights. A small detachment of sappers and miners, under Captain Cotton, of the Madras engineers, having been attached to Sir William Parker's column, the naval portion of the force was assigned the duty of carrying all the enemy's works on the left, or west bank of the river ; and accordingly, after a brisk and effective can nonade of the works of the citadel, the boats of the squadron pushed in shore with the small arms men and marines, who, scaling the rocky heights on which they were situated, entered by a gate already partially ruined by the well directed fire of the Wellesley, and speedily made themselves masters of the position, from which the Chinese fled as they approached. The scaling ladders were then planted against the ramparts of the city at a point favourable for escalade, and the naval column was speedily in posses sion of the place, no resistance being offered by the enemy, whose discomfiture on this side the river was now complete. In the meanwhile, a dreadful scene of slaughter was enacting on the right bank of the river, where the Chinese troops, retiring before the advance of the centre column, under Sir Hugh Gough, in the hope of retreating across the"], [254, "190 DREADFUL SCENE. river by a bridge of boats which had been left uninjured a short distance up the stream, came suddenly upon the head of the left column, which, having overcome all opposition in its course, had completed the circuit of the hills, and was debouching upon the banks of the river, so as effectually to intercept the retreat of the dense mass which was then crowding towards the bridge. It is not difficult to conceive the scene which ensued. Hemmed in on all sides, and crushed and overwhelmed by the fire of a complete semi circle of musketry, the hapless Chinese rushed by hundreds into the water ; and while some attempted to escape the tempest of death which roared around them, by consigning themselves to the stream, and floating out beyond the range of fire, others appeared to drown themselves in despair. Every effort was made by the general and his officers to stop the butchery, but the bugles had to sound the \" cease firing\" long and often before the fury of our men could be restrained. The 55th regiment and Madras rifles, having observed that a large body of the enemy were escaping from this scene of indiscriminate slaughter along the opposite bank of the river"], [255, ""], [256, "CLOSE OF THE ENGAGEMENT AT CHIN-H\u00c6."], [257, "CLOSE OF THE ENGAGEMENT. 191 from the citadel and batteries which the naval brigade had stormed, separated themselves, and pushing across the bridge of boats, severed the retreating column in two ; and before the Chinese could be prevailed upon to surrender themselves prisoners, a great number were shot down or driven into the water and drowned. The loss of the Chinese was immense in killed and wounded ; a vast mob of prisoners was captured, besides numerous pieces of cannon, many of which were brass, an immense quantity of camp equipage, ammunition, arms, and stores of all descriptions, and a considerable number of junks and armed boats. The prisoners were all set at liberty on the following day, deprived of course of their arms, and some also of their tails, which, though an accident easily remedied by the humblest of their tonsors, (by plaiting a new tail into the root of the old one,) was a mark of disgrace that did not fall to the province of the victors to inflict, and was a wanton outrage on the feelings of the Chinese, which could only serve to exasperate them against their invaders. Sir Hugh Gough, when informed by an officer of what was taking place, sanctioned his inter ference, and ordered that the prisoners should"], [258, "192 DEPRIVATION OF TAILS. be merely disarmed, and released without degra dation of any kind. When, however, this gen tleman, who had followed Sir Hugh Gough in a boat, reached the shore, the last man of the Chinese detenus was under the hands of the operator, a tar, who, upon being hailed to cease his proceedings, hastily drew his knife across the victimized tail, exclaiming that it was a pity the fellow should have the laugh against the rest. On the side of the British but few casualties occurred ; measures were speedily taken to con vert the citadel into a strong post, and an effi cient garrison, consisting of the 55th regiment, with detachments of artillery and sappers, under the command of Colonel Schoedde, of the former corps, was left to occupy it and hold possession of the fortifications of Chin-hae, some commo dious public buildings affording good quarters for the troops, and for a large detachment of fol lowers which it was found advisable to leave behind. On the 13th, the steamer, with the Modeste and Columbine, as a light squadron, advanced up the river towards the city of Ningpo, where it was expected considerable resistance would be"], [259, "CAPTIVES OF THE BRIG KITE. 193 offered, a passage having been first opened through the barrier of piles and the bridge of boats. But the lesson taught to the Chinese troops on the 10th, had been too severe to allow of a rally at so early a period ; and on the approach of the steamers to a floating bridge which connects the city with a suburb on the right bank of the river, it was found that the place had been evacuated. The troops were accord- ingly landed on the bridge without molestation, and the walls having been scaled, possession was taken of the ramparts, and the gates of the city were thrown open. By an interesting coin- cidence, it chanced that the troops were quar- tered, on the night of the occupation, in the identical building which one year previously had contained the captives of the brig Kite; and Major Anstruther, who marched as a conqueror at the head of the Madras artillery into the prison, found the loathsome cage in which he had been tortured, still standing in the yard, and the marks of his pencil still on the walls. It is not undeserving also of record here, that during the tedious incarceration endured by Mrs. Noble, Major Anstruther, Lieutenant Douglas, and the other unfortunates of the Kite, a scheme o"], [260, "\" BLONDEL.\" 194 was proposed to the major by his brother officers at Chusan, for the relief of himself, Dr. Douglas, and Mr. Witts, (who were confined in a prison apart from the rest,) to be effected through the agency of a native of Ningpo, upon whom, from his fidelity in the conveyance of letters and other missives to and from Chusan, the soubriquet of \" Blondel\" had been conferred. The proposal was listened to with gratitude, but refused on the ground that even should success attend the bold attempt, the horrors of imprisonment would be increased towards their fellow captives, whom Blondel (owing to the unfavourable position of their prison) could not undertake to set free at the same time. The sentiment of generosity which dictated this refusal of an offer so tempt ing needs no comment. As the city had been taken possession of without resistance, every precaution was adopted to prevent plunder, while a rigid search was in stituted after public treasure in such buildings as were considered likely to contain the coveted store, that it might be made available as legitimate prize property. No great amount of bullion was, however, found, but several extensive stores of cash, a small thin copper coin, of which 100"], [261, "195 SALE OF GRAIN. equal a dollar, were discovered inside the city ; as, however, there was a doubt about their being the property of the government, some informants alleging that the owners were merchants or bankers of the place, a difficulty arose touching the right of appropriation in the minds of the prize-agents, who had to decide questions of legality in regard to plunder. It was finally settled by taking a portion only, a sort of per centage on the whole, as a tax or insurance, in return for the security in which the remainder was kept under a British guard. A vast quan tity of rice and other grain was found in the public granaries, and as this was not required for the use of the force, whose magazines were already well supplied, it was sold to the Chinese, who were allowed to take away as much as one man could carry for the sum of one dollar, a load which was in many instances almost mira culous, and for which the price demanded was not unfrequently paid in coin of a most doubtful character j several hundreds of counterfeit dol lars were, in fact, received during the sale of the grain. Some serviceable little ponies which were found in paddocks and in stables attached to the o 2"], [262, "196 EMPLOYMENT OF THE TROOPS. barracks of the city, were appropriated for the service of the artillery, and before long were rendered most useful as draught-animals, and for the transport of ammunition boxes and other necessary appendages of a field train. Shortly after the occupation of the town, the light- draught steamers were dispatched up the river to examine its course, to inquire into the con- dition of the province, and to ascertain what indications there might be of the assembling of large bodies of troops in the neighbourhood of the frontier towns. Nothing, however, was dis- covered which led the reconnoitring party to suppose that the Chinese meditated any aggres- sive operations against Ningpo ; and as the chiefs of the expedition intended no further hos- tilities along the coast, the troops employed themselves in constructing fire-places in their barracks and in the guard-houses on the ram parts, improving the windows, planking the floors, and adopting all the measures of precau tion against winter and foul weather which the experience of the older campaigners sug gested. The extensive buildings comprising the resi dence and offices of the Taou-tae, in which were"], [263, "197 FUEL STORE. included the prisons of Mrs. Noble and her fellow-captives, being situated too near the heart of the city to render them a desirable military post in an unfriendly place, they were abandoned, and some joss-houses and mandarins' residences near the north-west angle of the ram parts, were taken possession of as a cantonment for the whole force. The old quarters were con demned as the fuel store for the winter, (a few old bricks, a little wood, and half-a-dozen old Chinese matchlocks, made up an excellent grate in half-an-hour,) and long before the cold season had passed, its beams, rafters, doors, and win dows had been consigned to the fire-places of the barrack-rooms, and nothing but the ruined walls of the capacious building remained. Through the activity of the Rev. Mr. Gutz laff, who was at that time attached to the head quarters of the army as interpreter, and who also acted as magistrate of Ningpo, a very tolerable market was soon established for the supply of the force, from which excellent white bread, beef, kid's flesh, fish, and abundance of good vegetables, were procured up to the period of their withdrawal in the succeeding year;"], [264, "CHAPTER XVIII.

When Sir Henry Pot tinger quitted Hong-Kong, to follow the fleet in its northward progress, he had, in furtherance of the views announced in his public notification of August, directed that, in the event of any demonstration being made by the authorities at Canton which could be construed into an infrac tion of the treaty of May, such as staking the river, renewing the demolished forts, or erecting new works along the banks, prompt measures should be taken to interrupt their progress ; and,"], [265, "199 CANTON RIVER. as a preliminary step, that the island of North Wangtung should be re-occupied, and if a gar rison could, without prejudice to the efficiency of the force at Hong-Kong, be spared for the pur pose, that North Wangtung should be held as a British post, to keep in check any further at tempts that might be made to disturb the tran quillity of the province. In the contrary event, however, of its being found inexpedient to detail a garrison for North Wangtung, the forts and batteries, which the Chinese troops had been suffered to re-occupy, were to be demolished, and the place rendered untenable. Towards the end of September, it was brought to the notice of Captain Nias, of H. M.S. Herald, that preparations were being made on the banks of the two principal channels of the river of Canton, the Macao passage and Junk river, by collecting junks laden with stores and rafts of timber, to form barriers, for the purpose of im peding the navigation, and to construct batteries at various commanding points of the stream. The Hooghley steamer was dispatched up the river to ascertain the truth of these statements ; and the report with which she returned being confirmatory, Captain Nias signified to Major-"], [266, "200 INFRACTION OF THE ARMISTICE. General Burrell his intention of proceeding up the river with the squadron under his command, to carry out the orders of the plenipotentiary ; and General Burrell considering it improper to allow a smaller body than 200 men to remain in Wangtung unsupported, declined to detach from the force under his command any garrison for its permanent occupation. The alternative of its dismantlement was therefore of necessity adopted, and an engineer officer, with a party of sappers and miners, having been attached to Captain Nias' squadron, were conveyed in the Royalist to the Bogue, and landing on North Wangtung, (the garrison of which surrendered without resistance, and were sent on shore,) utterly destroyed, in the course of a few days, the formidable and well-built works which covered it. Captain Nias then proceeded up the river ; and conceiving, from what met his observation in the Macao passage, that the intentions of the Canton authorities were warlike, and that their proceedings amounted, in fact, to an infraction of the armistice of May, he burned and sunk a number of store junks, fired some houses near which stakes were being fixed, and shot a few"], [267, "201 ALARM IN CANTON. persons whom he believed to be implicated in the treacherous proceedings of the mandarins. He then withdrew the squadron, and issued a proclamation to the people dwelling upon the banks of the river, warning them of the conse quences which must ensue to themselves and their habitations, should a renewal be observed of the attempts which he had frustrated. The force, however, returned to Hong-Kong in Oc tober, and the Chinese were left to pursue their operations unrestrained, a licence of which they so ably availed themselves, that, by the end of November, both the channels above alluded to were staked across, and batteries commenced in many places. Considerable alarm prevailed in Canton when the news suddenly reached the factories that a British squadron was ascending the river. The English merchants, who were then residing in imagined security in their hongs, were cautioned by Howqua and others, that their continuance within reach of the authorities might be attended with danger ; wherefore, depositing with the Hong merchants the specie which they chanced to have in their treasuries, and taking their books and"], [268, "202 SMUGGLING. papers with them, they quitted the factories in boats which were sent for the purpose from the merchant shipping at Whampoa, and dropped down the river beyond the barrier of Junk river, which was now rapidly progressing. The Can ton authorities, however, showed no ill feeling on the occasion, and the merchants soon retraced their steps, to carry on, upon their own respon sibility, such trade as the aspect of the times permitted to flow in the accustomed channels. In Canton, at this time, smuggling was car ried on to an unparalleled extent ; chop-boats, with teas and other articles, taking their depar ture, duty free, from the front of the factories, in the most open and unreserved manner. In deed, many eminent mandarins were notoriously implicated in this contraband traffic ; and it was not an uncommon occurrence to hear the names of distinguished functionaries, not excepting that of Yih-shan himself, coupled with such trans actions. Shortly after the return of Captain Nias to Hong-Kong, orders were received from the ad miral, grounded upon the express instructions of her Majesty's government, to prosecute the blockade of Canton with increased vigour, and"], [269, "203 THE NERBUDDA TRANSPORT. to seize all junks found trading with that port. This was a serious blow to Hong-Kong, between which and Canton a coasting and carrying trade had sprung up. About this time, also, a transport was dispatched to the north from Hong-Kong, whose name has since become one of such melancholy celebrity, that a brief descrip tion of her memorable voyage may not be con sidered out of place. Early in September, the Nerbudda transport came in from Calcutta with a large detachment of camp followers, principally \" doolie bearers,\" or carriers of the sick and wounded, and a few men of the 55th regiment, with an officer, who had been left behind in the river Hooghley, in consequence of its having been found that the ship in which they had embarked with several companies of the regiment, was too much crowded to allow of her proceeding to sea in safety. After a few days' delay for watering and pro visioning, she was dispatched to the northward, and in the course of her voyage, when in the strait of Formosa, was overtaken by a heavy gale of wind, which drove her towards the coast of that island, and finally entangled her among rocks and banks, in a position from which it was"], [270, "204 SPRINGING A LEAK. found impossible to extricate her, although she rode at her anchors in good soundings. She had previously sprung a leak in striking against a ledge of sunken rocks, over which she had been driven by the violence of the sea ; and when the storm had abated, and her condition been exa mined, it was found that the utmost exertion would be required to keep the water in the hold below the line of danger. On board the ill-fated vessel there were about twenty Europeans, two or three natives of Manilla, and upwards of 300 natives of India, lascars of the ship, and camp followers of her Majesty's 55th regiment. She was well found in provisions and water, and had a fair supply of small-arms of all descriptions, including percussion firelocks, with which the men of the detachment of the 55th were armed. On the morning following that on which the vessel had been anchored in her comparatively secure situation, the water stood at six feet in her hold, in spite of the constant employment of all hands on board at her pumps, observing which, the whole of the Europeans, including the captain, first and second mates, the officer commanding the detachment of the 55th, and a colour sergeant, and sixteen able-bodied men"], [271, "205 BOLD CONDUCT OF A GUNNER. who comprised it, took possession of two of the ship's boats, and, after having rendered unser viceable the only one that remained, pushed off to sea, and left their hapless and deserted com rades to their fate. As the last boat was leaving, a Manilla man, who had served as gunner on board the ship, pointed a gun at her which he had previously loaded, and swore he would fire, unless they came back to rescue him. They did so, and the gunner sprang into the boat, which, however, was not a second time pushed off, until her crew had destroyed the whole of the ammu nition on board the ship, to prevent the bold example of the gunner from being imitated by some of the unfortunate lascars and followers, whose attempts to get down into the cutter were resisted by fixed bayonets and loaded barrels. After being two or three days at sea, drifted to the southward by the current and northerly wind, the boats were descried by a trading brig, which took their crews on board, and pursued her way with them to Hong-Kong, being at the time either too far to the southward, or unable, from other causes, to retrace her course to Amoy, and o-ive information to Captain Smith of the disaster which had befallen the Nerbudda, and the fate"], [272, "206 THE SHIP ABANDONED. of her deserted crew. On the arrival of the party at Hong-Kong, Captain Nias, the senior naval officer, placed the commander of the transport under arrest, and sent him a close prisoner on board H. M.S. Nimrod, which was immediately ordered to proceed to the coast of Formosa, to save, if it might yet be possible, the hapless beings who had been so cruelly abandoned. The object of the voyage was not, however, accomplished, for, owing to the bad weather which prevailed, or to some other cause which prevented her from approaching the spot more closely, she was compelled first to run for Amoy, to obtain the aid of a steamer, or some light draught vessel which could be steered with safety among the dangers of the Formosa coast. On her return to the neighbourhood of the spot where the Nerbudda had been last seen, the vessel was no longer there. It was afterwards ascertained that the unfortunate crew and Indian passengers, finding, after many days' toil at the pumps night and day, that she must soon sink at her anchors, determined at last to abandon her, and to seek their own safety on the unin viting shore upon which they had so long and so despairingly gazed from her decks.

The natives of the island, however, who had been observed gathering along the beach whilst their preparations for leaving the ship were going on, met them in crowds as they landed, and fall ing upon them while yet struggling in the surf, killed many of their number, and robbed and cruelly ill-treated the survivors, stripping them of all their clothing, and afterwards, under the escort of a body of soldiers, driving them like a herd of swine to the neighbouring capital town of Ty-waaw-foo, where they were confined like felons in the common jails, loaded with irons, and treated with a ferocious barbarity which fitly heralded the dastardly butchery by which, in the succeeding year, they all, nearly 200 in number, perished.

No sooner, also, did the Chinese population of the island perceive that the English were no longer averse to invest capital in the soil, than the example was eagerly imitated, and with such extraordinary celerity were these building operations carried on, that, in the course of two months, the native town, Victoria, which had before presented to the eye scarcely anything but streets and rows of houses,"], [285, "217 TOWN OF VICTORIA. formed of the most crazy, perishable, and inflam mable materials, now boasted at least a hundred brick tenements, besides a spacious and com modious market-place, for which the settlement was indebted to Major Malcolm, secretary to the British legation, (under whose direction the work was planned and regulated,) a stone jail, a wide, excellent road, drains, and bridges, wherever necessary, and an official residence for the presiding magistrate.

A vast number of guns had been mounted on the banks of the Macao passage, the reach by which the Blenheim had approached the city on that occa sion, and also near the junction of the two creeks called Junk River and Fiddler's Reach ; but it appeared, moreover, from reconnoissances made at intervals in steamers, and by information supplied from other quarters, that the object of the provincial authorities was by no means of an aggressive nature, and that, in thus improving their fortifications, they sought only to prepare the city for defence, in the event of the tide of war setting once more towards its gates.

Dams, also, of a novel construction, and not ill-adapted to the purposes intended, were erected across every navigable branch of the main river, at such points as those formerly chosen for the debarkation of troops by the British ; and so effectually did they impede, not only the pas sage of steamers and other vessels, but even the course of the stream threatened at any moment to raise it above the level of the city and sur rounding country, and inundate the whole to a serious extent. These barriers were formed of rows of huge crates or cradles of stout timber, firmly bound with iron. They were constructed on a lofty scaffolding, erected for the purpose at Napier's Point, and carried up to a height nearly equal to the depth of the river, at the point in tended to be dammed ; they were then weighted with blocks of granite, and sunk in lines, after"], [288, "220 TRAFFIC WITH THE CHINESE. which they were filled up to the water's edge with stones small enough to be lifted by a man, and thus formed a very solid sort of rubble wall across the passage, possessing the advantage (when circumstances rendered such obstructions to the navigation of the river unnecessary) of being much more readily removed than those formerly made of sunken junks, as, after weigh ing by hand as much of the stone ballast as could be reached at low water, the crates could be raised to the surface, and towed ashore with facility. An extensive traffic was about this time carried on with the Chinese, in cannon and in muskets and other small-arms, by the Portu guese, at Macao, to whom these unusual articles of commerce were shipped from Singapore in foreign vessels, and were sold at Macao at prices so advantageous, that many were tempted to share in the golden harvest who might have been expected to refrain from thus openly en couraging and arming the enemies of their ancient ally.

In the early part of the year, the Madagascar, Hon. E. I.

The fire it appears originated in the spontaneous combustion of the coal in her bunkers, and her crew were compelled, after fruitless efforts to get it under, to take to the boats and abandon her. Of these boats, only one, containing Captain Dicey, her com mander, Major Grattan, 18th regiment, and some of the officers and crew of the steamer, with the Chinese carpenter, reached the shore, where they were at once seized and thrown into prison.

The provincial government were fortunately at the time too much occupied with the operations about to be undertaken against Canton by the English, to seek to aggravate the feeling of animosity which existed, and they accordingly tacitly suffered the mandarin who had charge of the shipwrecked party to bargain for their release with Jardine and Co., who finally obtained their liberation for a ransom of 4000 dollars, which sum was im mediately refunded on the arrival of Sir Henry Pottinger.

Upon one or two occasions the vigilance of the sentries defeated this plot, but as no proper example was made of these fellows when caught, the system was persevered in to the last, and so bold were their plans, that it became unsafe to frequent any of the smaller streets of the city or suburbs without the attendance of a guard.

Towards the end of February, the Rev. Mr. Gutzlaff received intelligence, through some native suppliers of the market, which was his peculiar care and charge in the city, that some hostile movement on the part of the imperial forces was in contemplation ; but the informa tion was vague, and although it was known that considerable bodies of troops had from time to time arrived in the province from Hang-chow-foo and the westward, no imminent danger was ap prehended. On the 6th or 7th March, Sir Hugh Gough, having occasion to visit Chusan to consult with Sir William Parker on the future destination of the combined forces, quitted Ningpo, leaving the command of its garrison in the hands of the senior officer, Colonel Morris, of the 49th regi ment.

A number of little Chinese boys who were found roaming through the deserted streets of the city, in a miserable and half-starved condi tion, when it was taken possession of by Sir Hugh Gough, had been fed and half-adopted by our soldiers : the little fellows soon accustomed themselves to the habits of the men, and became useful about the barracks in a variety of ways, particularly in carrying provisions for the sup ply of the messes, and in procuring any articles not readily obtainable in the principal market. On the morning of the 9th, however, these boys, who were scarcely ever out of the men's quarters, appeared before their patrons in a state of great alarm, making signs in imitation of the headsman's functions, and of the dis charge of matchlocks and cannon, and repeating to all their particular friends in the barracks the warning, \"Min-ting, leilo ; min-ting, leilo,\""], [299, "231 FANCIED SECURITY.

Fortunately this warning was not lost on the men, and although no orders were issued direct ing more than ordinary watchfulness on the part of the guards, a feeling of unusual alertness and expectation of mischief pervaded all the men on duty that night, especially those at the south and west gates, (which, from their posi tion, are more exposed to a surprise than some of the other entrances of the city,) on each of which a guard of only one subaltern and four teen rank and file was posted, with no point of surjport to retreat upon, in the event of emer gency, nearer, in the case of the south-gate guard, than half a mile. Midnight had passed away without the ap pearance of a foe, and a sense of security was beginning to banish the doubts of the preceding day, when, about four a.m., the sentry on the rampart over the west-gate discerned the figure of a Chinaman advancing along the paved road leading to the outer entrance into the square"], [300, "232 APPROACH OF THE CHINESE. bastion in which the double gateways are situ ated ; he called out to him to \" weilo,\" (go,) but the intruder continued to approach the gates, holding in his hand a substance which resembled a glowing match ; the challenge was repeated, and the man without halting replied, in a firm voice, \"weilo moa,\" (will not go;) the sentry's piece was levelled in an instant, and the man fell. The report of this solitary musket-shot was the signal for a general onslaught, and as the troops turned out of their quarters at the sound of the call to arms, which now resounded far and wide through the city, their ears were greeted by volleys of musketry incessantly rat tling at the south and west gates, and by the booming of heavy guns in the direction of the river, where the Modeste, and the Sesostris steamer, were lying. The suburbs instantly appeared alive with ene mies, who poured down upon the gates in columns of dense array and prodigious length, headed by men whose gallantry and determina tion could not have been excelled.

The guard, which was ably commanded by Lieutenant Armstrong, of the 18th regiment, manned the parapet of the bastion, and poured in upon the dense mass of men below a close and steady fire of mus ketry, which took deadly effect among their crowded ranks, while a few files were employed in throwing over from the ramparts upon the heads of their miserable assailants, the large heavy blue bricks and blocks of granite of which the parapets and revetments are composed, and which were afterwards found to have crushed and mutilated numbers of the enemy in a most shocking manner. But the havoc which was thus taking place amongst them did not for a long time deter them from persevering in their desperate attempt ; and while a few bold men endeavoured to scale the wall, by driving nails into the crevices of the masonry, and so ascend ing, another party having reared a rude sort of ladder against a part of the rampart, clear of the fire of Lieutenant Armstrong's men, their leader, a powerful and courageous man, actually gained the summit. He was not, however, destined to receive the reward of his gallantry, for, being"], [302, "234 SUCCESS OF THE CHINESE. encountered as he issued from an embrasure by a private of the 18th, one Michael Cushion, who had been atoning in a solitary cell near the guard-house, for some undue weakness \" in re gard of\" the strong waters of the Chinese, and had been liberated by the sentry on the approach of danger, the Chinaman's matchlock was in a moment wrested from him, and the butt brought to bear upon his head with all the momentum which the sinewy arm of the son of St. Patrick could communicate to it, felling him to the ground, whence he was lifted by Cushion, and thrown through the embrasure upon the bodies of his comrades who lay crushed and mangled below.

From the south gate the enemy now proceeded in a long and dense column towards the market place in the centre of the town, and finding no obstacle to their advance, concluded their com rades at the west gate had been equally suc cessful, and that Ningpo was once more their own. As they emerged, however, from a narrow street into the market-place, their advance was suddenly arrested by a company of the 49th regiment, which had been detached to reinforce the guard at the south gate. Though taken somewhat by surprise at encountering so dense an array of hostile troops in the very heart of the city, the officer who commanded the company instantly halted, and forming his men across the"], [304, "236 DEFEAT AND FLIGHT. street, opened fire upon the Chinese troops at pistol-shot distance with terrible effect. It was returned for a short time with matchlocks, and an attempt was made to bring a small gun or ginjall to the front, but their men fell so fast under the musketry of the 49th, that the re mainder soon lost heart, and commenced a retro grade movement, which was soon converted into a flight, as our men pressed on them, forcing them from street to street, until they were driven out again through the south gateway into the suburb, when the victorious little band took pos session once more of the bastion, and the gates were closed and secured. A great many of the enemy escaped into the houses and by-streets as the routed columns rushed along, and throw ing away their arms and soldiers' dresses, min gled with the crowd, and thus escaped the fate of many of their comrades, who, having been brought from distant provinces, and unacquainted with the localities of the city, were unable to avail themselves of the ready means of escape which its hundreds of lanes and alleys afforded.

On the river side of the city, the attempts of the enemy were confined to bringing down some guns to the wharfs opposite the anchorage of the Modeste, and firing round shot from them at her and into the city, doubtless in order to dis tract the attention of the garrison, and to cover the advance of several fire-rafts which were sent down the river, through the opening in the bridge of boats, upon the men-of-war and steamers which lay at anchor below. The effect of the rafts was, as usual, nothing ; they were speedily towed away by the boats, and exploded or burnt out clear of the shipping, while the Modeste, whose broadside bore upon the wharfs on which the guns of the enemy had been mounted, soon laid in ruins some of the large buildings in which the enemy appeared to have collected, and promptly silenced the fire which had been commenced. When morning had fully dawned, Colonel"], [306, "238 A SORTIE.

A short time previous to this movement, however, the enemy had begun to draw off from the attack, and a party of artillerymen, under Lieutenant Molesworth, pushed forward a few hundred yards into the suburb, to ascertain the direction they had taken, and see what was going forward. They soon found themselves in front of a dense mass of troops, drawn up along the main street, upon whom Lieutenant Molesworth, although accom- panied by a mere handful of men, instantly opened a smart fire of musketry, which the Chinese re- turned with much spirit, and shewed a disposi- tion to advance upon their assailants. At this juncture, Captain Moore's howitzer came up, and, being run to the front, immediately opened upon the living wall before them with case shot,"], [307, "239 TERRIBLE SLAUGHTER. at a distance not exceeding twenty to thirty yards. The effect was terrific, for the street was per fectly straight, and the enemy's rear, not aware of the miserable fate which was being dealt out to their comrades in the front, continued to press the mass forward, so as to force fresh victims upon the mound of dead and dying which already barricaded the street. The head of the column fell literally \" like the Moor's swath at the close of day,\" and the howitzer only discontinued its fire from the impossibility of directing its shot upon a living foe, clear of the writhing and shriek ing hecatomb which it had already piled up. It had, however, been only fired three times, and the destruction would have been far greater had not the short distance prevented the grape shot from spreading. The infantry party had resumed their platoon firing, the front rank, after discharging their pieces, filing off to the right and left to load and form again in the rear, their places being filled by the next rank, and so on ; by which means such a storm of balls was kept up upon the enemy, that in a short time the street was choked up, and when, for want of a living mark, the men were ordered to advance, their steps fell upon a closely packed mass of"], [308, "240 THE PURSUIT. dead and dying for fully fifteen yards.

The repulse of this bold attack was now com plete at all points, and its results must have been effectual in deterring the Chinese leaders from again venturing on the lair of their terrible in vaders. While on our side not a single man had been killed and only a few wounded, up wards of 400 of the enemy had fallen, consist ing, of course, of their bravest and best.

But the merciless carnage in the street of the western suburb proved too fearful a lesson to be soon forgotten by the Chinese troops : upon no occasion during the war had such terrible slaughter been inflicted either in so short a pe riod of action, or in so confined a space. The corpses of the slain lay heaped across the narrow street for a distance of many yards, and after the fight had terminated, a pony, which had been ridden by a mandarin, was extricated unhurt from the ghastly mass in which it had been en- tombed so completely as to have at first escaped observation.

It appeared, however, from the information given by the prisoners, that the force which had been launched against our position consisted exclusively of men who had never before been opposed to British troops, nor witnessed the de structive effects of musketry and grape-shot. Among their number, also, upon this occa sion, had been a large body of half savage mountaineers, from the country of the Maou tses, who, it is said, have never yet submitted entirely to the yoke of the Tartars ; as a strong proof of which, it may be observed, that this hardy race alone, of all the population of the empire, do not conform to the national cus tom of wearing the long tail of hair, by the compulsory imposition of which the Tartars"], [313, "243 THEIR APPEARANCE. have so strikingly marked their conquest over the southern inhabitants of the empire. Many of these men were taken, wounded, from the pile in the suburb, and attended by our sur geons in the military hospitals. Their appearance and habits seemed ferocious and uncivilized, and the style of their features showed a marked dif ference from that stamped upon the faces of the Chinese, having low, receding foreheads, broad, flat noses, and sinewy limbs, besides other phy sical evidences of a barbarous condition, and an active and muscular habit of body. These men had evidently been highly paid by the imperial government for the work of that night, on the successful completion of which they wrere doubtless to have received still greater rewards, for upon the bodies of the slain were found, besides the long keen knives with which they were all armed, a small pouch, containing almost invariably six dollars of the esteemed pillar coinage.

Mr. Gutzlaff soon contrived to find out, through his native informants, that a strong division of Chinese troops, five to six thousand in number, commanded by a Tartar general, had arrived in the vicinity of Fungwa, and were preparing for a movement upon Ningpo, in"], [319, "249 CHINESE MOVEMENT. concert with a force under the renowned chief, Yang, who had for some time been assembling and forming a camp near the town of Tse-kee, to the westward, and whose numbers had been recently augmented by considerable reinforce ments from the north. Acting upon this, Sir Hugh Gough quitted Ningpo on the morning of the 13th, with a force of about 900 men of all arms, and moved rapidly in the direction of Fungwa, in the hope of en countering the Chinese division and destroying it in detail, before it could effect a junction with Yang or retreat beyond the reach of his own column. The Sesostris steamer, the only one left in the river, accompanied the main column, with some companies of the 26th regiment, and sea men and marines on board, while the general and the remainder of the troops marched along the river's bank. The progress of this expedition was, however, shortly arrested by information received on the road, that the enemy, who had advanced on the 11th as far as a village only seven miles distant from Ningpo, were now beyond the reach of our troops, having retreated the preceding day over"], [320, "250 TAI-SHAM. a high range of hills in a south-westerly direc tion. The troops accordingly countermarched to Ningpo, and there awaited the arrival of the light-draught steamers to transport them to Tse-kee, near which it was understood the enemy were making great preparations to give them battle, in the position which theyhad before occu pied on the heights of Segaon. On the 14th, Sir William Parker arrived in the river, bringing with him the Queen, Nemesis, and Phlegethon, which had been detained by him until that date to carry on some operations against an island called Tai-sham, situated in the Chu san group, north-east of the harbour of Ting hae, a point upon which some troops had been collected for the ostensible purpose of making a descent upon Chusan as soon as the expected success at Ningpo had struck the desired panic into the hearts of the British troops. Informa tion of this hostile demonstration had reached Captain Dennis, the magistrate of Ting-hae, upon whose representation the admiral sent the Neme sis to visit the spot, and make the requisite in quiries.

An attack upon Chusan was manifestly con templated in the plan which the Chinese autho rities attempted to carry through upon so com prehensive a scale about this time, for after the arrival of troops in Tai-sham had been reported, an attempt was made to burn the shipping in the outer and inner harbours by fire-rafts, which were towed round the points of land, and slipped with the tide upon the anchorage. This attempt, like all others of a similar description made dur ing the war, proved utterly abortive ; the flaming rafts having been towed on shore by the boats of the naval squadron and transports, without any accident to the shipping, though a few casual ties occurred among the seamen in the boats, chiefly through explosions of gunpowder on board the rafts. The vessels employed in this instance to set fire to our fleet were better than those usually seen, being large strong boats crammed and piled up with brushwood, straw, oil, and other combustibles, and having chests of"], [322, "252 EVACUATION OF TAI-SHAM. powder at the bottom, to explode and scatter the burning fragments among the ships. Many of these fire-vessels had been prepared at Sin-Kong and Sun-Ka-mun, fishing villages on the shores of Chusan, distant twelve to thirteen miles from Ting-hae, the residence of the commandant of the British force in the occupation of the island. On receiving the report of the Nemesis, Sir Wil liam Parker ordered all the brigs and small-class vessels of war, which were then in harbour, to proceed to Tai-sham to cruise round the island and cut off all communication between it and the main land, his excellency proceeding shortly after wards with the steamer, and a considerable body of seamen, marines, and troops from the garri son, in the confident expectation of finding a strong division of the Chinese army awaiting him, cooped up within the narrow limits of their insu lar position. On his arrival, however, the enemy had dis appeared, and it was evident that they had eva cuated Tai-sham immediately after the departure of the Nemesis with the news of their presence, most probably in consequence of orders to that effect received from Chapoo, after intelligence of the repulse at Ningpo had reached the authorities"], [323, "ESCAPE OF A PRIZE. 253 in that city. At Chapoo, at all events, the fishing boat people and others about the island said they had gone, and by their description it was evident that a great prize had escaped us, the troops having amounted to 3000 or 4000, with some guns, abundance of arms and ammunition, and other moveables of a coast army. Dis appointed in the result of this expedition, the admiral lost no time in reaching Ningpo, that he might be enabled to take part in the opera tions about to be carried on against the Chinese troops in the intrenched camps, and other posi tions, which they had taken up in the open country to the westward of the town. He took with him about 200 seamen and marines, prin cipally from the Blonde and Cornwallis, which, added to a party taken from the Modeste and Columbine, constituted a body of 350 bayonets, which were placed at the disposal of the general, and united to the force which he had withdrawn from Ningpo for the contemplated expedition to Tse-kee, and which, as before stated, amounted to about 900 men of all arms, with four light field-pieces.

The troops moved on in the highest spirits, thankful to have escaped from the life of apathy and in action which they had been leading at Ningpo during the last five months. The country afforded tolerable ground to move over, and the trained ponies of the artillery did good service here in dragging the guns with suf ficient expedition to keep well up on the line of march, sparing the gunners much of the fatigue which they must otherwise have endured. After about an hour's march, the head of the column came within long range of the ramparts of the town, from which a few round shot were dis charged at it without effect, and the troops, halt ing on the fields which spread out before the city in luxuriant vegetation, awaited the order for attack.

It soon became apparent to the experienced eye of the general, that the Chinese leaders expected no serious resistance in the town, and that their main efforts would be directed against his assaulting columns on the right and centre of their posi tion, displaying therein, as usual, their miserable deficiency in the ordinary rules of strategy, and affording additional proof of the pertinacious folly with which they still clung to the idea that their popular system of warfare (that of fighting by demonstration, and expecting victory through the awe-inspiring influence of military pomp, display, and noise, instead of strength of arm and skill at the weapon) could be made to prevail against the spirit and steadiness of disciplined troops.

Had this judicious plan been persevered in, the results of the engagement would have been much more destructive to the enemy, though they could scarcely have proved more brilliant and suc cessful ; for the 49th regiment in the centre, and the seamen and marines on the left, un checked by the heavy fire which the enemy maintained upon their columns throughout the arduous ascent of the heights, speedily gained the summit, and drove the enemy from their intrenchments at the point of the bayonet with"], [327, ""], [328, "HEIGHTS OF SEGAON"], [329, "257 ENGAGEMENT. great slaughter, but not until many officers and men in their own ranks had fallen. The 49th were the first to gain the enemy's position, and the general, who had accompanied them, perceiving that by a flank movement to their left they might cut off the retreat of the Chinese troops, who occupied the hill which the naval brigade was then in the act of ascending, directed the regiment to move down the heights on the opposite side, and throw two companies into the rear of a strong body of the enemy who were observed marching towards the right of their position 3 to support the intrenchment threatened by the advance of the royal marines and seamen, under Captain Bourchier ; the man\u0153uvre was eminently successful, and as the defenders of the hill recoiled from the charge of Lieutenant Elliott's company of marines on the crest of the ridge which they had surmounted, the supporting body, thrown into confusion by the throng of fugitives, halted, opened a feeble fire to their front, and then broke and fled down the slope of the hill, at whose foot the 49th were awaiting them with loaded firelocks. The naval brigade now came pouring down the heights, bayoneting and hewing down all 3"], [330, "258 CHINESE DEFEATED. before them, and the 49th at the same time pressing upon their rear and flank, they soon sank under the murderous fire thus accumulated upon them, but few out of the whole body thus hemmed in escaping unhurt from the field, which was strewn far and wide with their slain. But the object for which the detour of the right column, consisting of the 18th regiment and rifle com pany, had been ordered, was entirely frustrated by the haste with which the advance of the centre and left columns had been precipitated, for on completing their laborious march and ascent of the left extremity of the heights, the 18th found no enemy to oppose them, and perceived that the plain below was covered with fugitives ; they accordingly lost no time in descending, and moved across the fields in the direction of the Chang-ki Pass, to which the main body of the Chinese were endeavouring to effect their es cape. The 26th regiment, which had been left in reserve with the guns, to act as occasion might suggest, now also pushed forward and joined in the pursuit, which was kept up for a considerable distance along the road leading to Yu-yao, the fields on either side being thickly covered with the"], [331, "259 ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE. bodies of the slain. The 18th regiment succeeded in turning a great portion of the retreating mass from the opening to the Chang-ki Pass, and in flicted severe loss upon them as soon as they got them within musket range, discontinuing their chase only when the close of day com pelled them to return to the position which the general had taken up for the night, in the centre of the long line of encampment from which the Chinese forces had been driven. The loss of the British during the engage ment at Tse-kee was, as usual, trifling, and considering the length of time that the left and centre columns were exposed to the enemy's fire, and the rapid manner in which their gin jails were served, appeared truly miraculous : the proportion of officers hurt was great, in consequence of the heavy nature of the ground over which the advance was made, by which they became more exposed to the enemy's matchlock men, and came in many cases into personal conflict with their swordsmen before the columns could close upon their position. In the 49th regiment alone, out of seven casual ties three were officers ; and in the naval brigade, four out of fifteen. s2"], [332, "260 CHINESE FORCE. The loss of the enemy was great: they left upon the field of battle from 400 to 500 killed and wounded, while many more were slain or drowned in the pursuit. A few prisoners were taken, amongst them three mandarins of inferior rank, one of whom stated himself to belong to the imperial guard, of which a detachment 500 strong had been engaged on that day. From information given by the prisoners, and from some returns and public documents found in the tents, the total number of men who stood on the side of the Chinese on the heights of Segaon was estimated at between 7000 and 8000, of whom a great proportion were troops from the northern provinces, men of more hardy and warlike habits, and of greater sinew7 and mus cular power than the ordinary troops of the central and maritime districts : they had never before encountered the British forces, and their confidence in the result of the contest appears to have been unbounded ; for on examining the camp, it was found that the whole of their bag gage, including every moveable article of their kit, had been left behind in their flight, nothing having been removed save the arms carried on the persons of the soldiers. A good deal of sycee"], [333, "261 A WOUNDED MANDARIN. silver was found secreted in the better class of tents, but no military chest was discovered. An officer has recorded, that in crowning the right of the enemy's position the troops mingled with the Chinese, and passed through some lines of tents on the summit of the hill as they drove them out of their intrenchments. In his pro gress he was arrested by the groans of a wounded man, who was stretched on a couch in the corner of a tent ; he gave the poor wretch, who had the button of a mandarin, some water, or performed some kindly office to him which humanity dic tated, and the man, catching him by the arm as he was leaving the tent, pointed eagerly to a heap of clothes near him, and made signs that he should lift them up. He did so, in the ex pectation that he should find beneath some victim of the fray, but to his surprise his eyes fell upon a glittering heap of sycee silver : he looked to the mandarin for explanation, when he ges ticulated earnestly that he should take it, which he accordingly did, and, assembling the men of his company who were with him, shared the prize among them on the spot. They did what they could for the wounded man, and hurried on to overtake the column. When the fight was"], [334, "262 STRANGE WEAPONS. over, the officer went back with a few men to look after the grateful sufferer, when he found the tent consumed, and the mandarin scorched and blackened, and quite dead. Avast number of ginjalls, matchlocks, arrow rockets, and small-arms of all descriptions, with ammunition and military stores in abundance, were collected on the morning after the engage ment, and destroyed, and a few pieces of six and twelve-pound calibre, found on the ramparts of Tse-kee and in the vicinity, were rendered unserviceable. Among the strange and incon gruous melange of weapons and engines of de struction found in the encampment, were eight or nine long brass tubes, cast with a bore for a three-pound ball, having a quantity of strong silk wound round their whole length, and paid over all with catgut. They were not mounted, but ajjpeared as if intended for use after the fashion of ginjalls, upon the ordinary tripod on which that serviceable and destructive weapon is rested when worked.

On the 16th March, the wounded having been sent to the rear under a guard, to be embarked on board the steamers, and the destruction of all the arms and stores collected on the heights being effected, Sir Hugh Gough, having directed the long lines of tents and some buildings which had contained military stores to be set on fire, moved forward with the troops in the direction of the Chang-ki Pass, in which it still appeared, from the statements of the country people, that a strong force remained intrenched, protecting the military chest and main magazines of the army of Che-kiang. On the arrival, however, of the column at the foot of the pass, distant between six and seven miles from Tse-kee, it was found, to the great mortification of all, that the strong position recently occupied by the enemy had been abandoned, although great pains and labour had evidently been bestowed upon it, by throw ing up breastworks and batteries on various com manding eminences, to increase the strength which it naturally possessed, through the rugged and steep features of the hills which lay beneath."], [336, "264 STORE OF BREAD. The retreat of the Chinese had been sufficiently well-timed to allow them ample leisure to carry off all their guns, treasure, and much of their ammunition ; and as no trace of their further movements had been discerned, the general re solved to retire to Tse-kee, to obtain shelter for the troops for the night, which could not be found on the Chang-ki hills. Everything in the pass which fire could consume was destroyed, including a large store of most excellent white bread, baked in regular ration loaves ; and so large was the quantity discovered, that after every man of the force had eaten as much as he could, and filled his havresack with a supply for two days, enough yet remained to satisfy an equal number of hungry campaigners. From this and other circumstances, especially the extent of the position, it was inferred that a very considerable force had been assembled here, and their hasty evacuation of a point which could with ease have been maintained by proper troops against the small force which threatened it, proved how irretrievably their confidence had been lost and the panic which had seized their ranks on the disaster at Tse-kee.

The result was highly satisfactory ; the branches of the canal being found to extend in a line but little broken the whole way, an item of infor mation which might have been turned to im portant account, had it been acquired long before instead of after the lapse of five months since our occupation of the capital, and our nominal control over the eastern portion of the province. The general, with the main body of the troops, reached Ningpo on the 17th, and the men re turned to their quarters.

Un expected difficulties of tides and currents, and of means of supply and transport, had prevented the carrying out of various well-devised opera tions intended against the important and strongly garrisoned town of Hang-chow-foo, the capital of the province, and it was finally resolved by the naval and military commanders-in-chief, that"], [342, "268 SURVEY OF CHAPOO. the town of Chapoo, situated on the east coast, about thirty to thirty-five miles distant from Hang-chow, should become the next object of attack. Accordingly, after considerable delay, the troops were withdrawn from Ningpo, and dropped down the river to Chin-hae, where they were finally embarked on board the transports on the 6th May, 1842. Although the distance does not exceed sixty miles, the voyage occupied nine days. On the 17th, the day following the arrival of the fleet off Chapoo, a reconnoissance was ordered, and dispositions for the attack were made by the admiral and general, which were carried into effect on the 18th, with an alacrity and ardour which speedily resulted in a complete overthrow of the Chinese forces.

The Algerine having anchored with her broadside bearing on the battery which an noyed her, shortly silenced its fire, and having fulfilled the object of examining the sea defences of the place, made sail for her point of rendez vous. On account of the exposed position of Chapoo, the adjoining coast offering facilities for landing troops at many points, and the town itself being commanded by some heights within short range of the ramparts, it was not expected that the Chinese would expose their city to the rigours of war, by attempting any serious resistance. These anticipations, however, were not realized ; and it was at this place that the first instance was offered of the remaikable tenacity with which the Tartars cling to their homes, and pre fer death in its most appalling forms to their surrender to strangers. The town of Chapoo became a Tartar garrison post at the period when the Mant-chow dynasty, having firmly establish ed itself on the throne of the celestial empire, distributed troops over its provinces at all the more important and commanding points.

Contrary to what appears to be their ordinary custom in war, the Tartar troops on this occa sion quitted their city, and took up a position on a range of hills commanding the shore, where it was likely that the landing of the British forces would take place, in the centre of which a strong redoubt and some intrenchments had been thrown up. Adjoining the suburb, which extends between the city and the shore on the east side, is a small harbour, protected from northerly winds and cur rents by a bluff projection of the coast, and on the"], [345, "271 LANDING OF THE BRITISH. south by a sort of mole, on the extremity of which a circular stone fort and some batteries were erected, well calculated to offer serious re sistance to the entrance of steamers and boats into the harbour ; but this support to their defence appears to have been purposely neglected by the Tartar general, who, undismayed by the fatal warning given at Chin-hae, Tse-kee, and other places where the British forces were en countered without the aid of stone walls and batteries, took the resolution of offering battle on ground where British discipline, experience, and mode of warfare, gave a fearful advantage over his own unskilled and ill-armed ranks. On the 8th May, the whole of the troops, supported by a detachment of seamen and marines, landed, and formed in two columns. The right, under the command of Colonel Schoedde, of her majesty's 55th regiment, was directed to turn the left of the position taken up by the enemy, parallel to the shore, and to march by their rear, in the direction of the town, so as to intercept the retreat of the main body posted on the hills, while the left column, com manded by Colonel Morris, of her majesty's 49th regiment, advanced up the heights to take"], [346, "272 RETREAT OF THE TARTARS. the Chinese intrenchments in flank, and drive their defenders into the plain, where the right column was preparing, by a rapid advance, to cut them off from the town. Upon the extreme left of their line, the enemy defended themselves with considerable resolu tion, maintaining for some time a smart fire of ginjalls and matchlocks upon the heads of the advancing columns, until, dismayed by the effects of some shells thrown into their position by the steamers, and by the rapid approach and open ing musketry of the 49th regiment, they broke and ran, descending the slope of the heights, in the direction of the city, and scattering them selves over the fields, where their numbers were soon augmented by the fugitives from the re doubt, and from the centre of the enemy's posi tion, who had been driven thence by the advance of the left column, though not before some re sistance had been made, many of the Tartars encountering their assailants hand to hand, and wielding their two swords (one being carried in the left hand to parry thrusts) with some effect.

While this scene of triumph, however, was enacting, a desperate struggle was still going on in the very heart of the enemy's recent position, from which, to all appearance, they had been entirely driven. The extreme right of their line had been occu pied by a body of about three to four hundred Tartar troops, who, on observing the rout of their left and centre, retreated in good order towards the town, which they evidently ex- T"], [350, "274 TARTAR DESPERATION. pected to reach by the road along which the British left column had made good its advance. On reaching this, however, after descending from the hill which they had occupied, they must have become aware that their retreat was already cut off by the advance of the right column behind the heights, while at the same time the direction taken by the naval brigade, which had landed on the rocky point facing the circular stone battery or mole, showed them that escape through the suburb towards the south was also effectually prevented. Driven to desperation by their situation, with two brigades advancing directly upon them, these brave men never for a moment appear to have contemplated a surrender, but threw them selves into a large building, partly a joss-house, partly a place of abode, situated at the bottom of a valley formed by the slopes of the right ex tremity of the Chinese heights and of a small range of hills between it and the city. So se cluded, however, was the position which they had now taken up, that the main body of the British left column, inclining to the right before they reached the head of the valley, had skirted the base of the low^er range of hills, and passed on,"], [351, "275 CRITICAL POSITION. without being aware of the existence of the body of desperate men whom they had left in their rear. This was the case also with the naval brigade, whose columns passed to the left of the valley, and crossing the lesser range of hills, entered the town at the point selected for escalade by the assaulting columns of the troops, and a clear road was thus opened for the escape of the party in the joss-house, whose triumph would have been justly great had they suc ceeded in availing themselves of the opportunity thus afforded. It happened, however, that a small body of men, who had detached themselves from the British left column, with the intention of crossing the spur of the low range which formed one boundary of the valley in which the Tartar troops lay, inclined to the left when they reached its head, and came suddenly upon the joss-house, receiving at the same time a volley from the matchlocks of a party drawn up in its front. In stantly perceiving the critical position in which matters stood, and the importance of preventing the retreat of the enemy, the detachment, which consisted of no more than thirty men of the 18th and 49th regiments, and sappers and miners, with a few seamen and artillerymen of the Ne- t2"], [352, "276 REINFORCEMENT. mesis, under Captain Hall, closed upon the build ing, and opened a fire upon its entrance, which was briskly returned by the Tartars, whose re peated cheering led our troops every instant to expect a desperate sortie, a step which must have entailed total annihilation upon them if vigo rously pushed. In the meantime, Captain Pears, the chief en gineer of the force, who happened to be with the detachment, dispatched messengers to give in telligence of what was passing in the valley, and to request that a reinforcement might be instantly forwarded from the columns which were hurry ing on to take part in the triumphal progress through the city, their bugles sounding the advance for all straggling parties to come in. Happily a company of the 18th, commanded by Captain Edwards, was intercepted in its advance, and, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Tom linson, who had heard what was passing, it pro ceeded to the valley, and uniting itself to the small detachment blockading the joss-house, formed a body which was considered strong enough to carry the building at the point of the bayonet.

In the interior there is generally a square paved court, surrounded by ranges of halls or rooms, either for the reception of images or idols or for the purposes of habitation, as the case may be, and their fronts, looking into the courts, are usually composed of ornamented trellis work, covered with whitepaper, to exclude the glare of daylight and the night breezes. The Chapoo joss-house was thus constructed, its entrance or hall having a screen of masonry built up to it on the inside, so as to prevent a view of the inte rior court by persons outside the building ; be hind the trellis-work, which has been described, the Tartar soldiers silently awaited the attack of our detachment, and as soon as the leading files and officers had passed through the entrance, and emerged from behind the screen into the inner court, they opened upon them a fire which sent a perfect shower of matchlock balls into their ranks, killing and wounding most of those who had passed the fatal barrier, and amongst them the accomplished Colonel Tomlinson, who"], [354, "278 DEATH OF COLONEL TOMLINSON. was shot through the neck in the court, and ex pired almost immediately. Unable to see the foe who thus dealt destruction to all who set foot within the court, or to return with any effect the fire that was annihilating them, a retreat became unavoidable, and the men of the 18th having borne out their lamented colonel, the detachment was withdrawn to the outside of the building, to prepare for another and less hazardous attack. Soon after this, a party of artillery came up with some rockets, and Lieutenant - Colonel Knowles, who commanded, threw several into the building, but without any visible effect upon the resolution of the Tartars, whose cheers were as loud and as animated as ever. After some further delay, it was resolved to make a breach in the outer wall, near one of the angles of the building, and after a few round shot had been thrown into it from a field-piece which had come up, (Colonel Montgomerie, of the Madras artillery, at the same time arriving on the spot, and assum ing the command of the attack,) a 50-pound bag of powder was placed at the foot of the wall by Captain Pears, and its explosion opened a wide entrance for an assaulting party.

Upwards of three hours had now elapsed since the first shot was fired, and during all this time, though hemmed in, their retreat effectually cut off, and exposed to a continued fire of shot, rockets, and musketry, no token of submission or disposition to surrender had been wrung from the Tartars. But now the resolution of some amongst them appeared to be giving way, as small parties of two and three every now and then sallied through the entrance, and made a dash to escape down the valley to wards the harbour ; but as the British detachment had been considerably augmented by stragglers coming in, the men were too widely spread to admit of their getting away, and the firing which these attempts brought down upon the luck less fugitives suffered scarcely one of them to succeed."], [358, "280 JOSS-HOUSE SET ON FIRE.

Hang-chow-foo, also, had been the professed object of the leaders of the combined force during the period of inaction at Ningpo, which has been adverted to ; but although the result of Major-General Schoedde's reconnoissance was favourable to a movement upon that city, the naval and military commanders-in-chief decided that it might interfere with their ultimate opera tions in the Yang-tse-kiang, and therefore they ordered the re-embarkation of the troops, which was effected accordingly on the 28th May, and in the meantime all stores of gunpowder and arms, together with a few public buildings, were destroyed. The dwellings of the inhabitants of the outer town and suburb were of course ex tensively pillaged, and a great number situated in the neighbourhood of the harbour or eastern suburb were burnt to the ground, partly by the marauding Chinese, whose depredations usually commence simultaneously with the defeat of their troops.

The extent of the town of Chapoo is also inconsiderable, the circuit of the walls not mea suring more than three miles : its form is square, and about one-fourth of the inclosed space is occupied by the Tartar garrison and the government authorities.

Before, however, entering the Woosung river, it was necessary to get possession of the formid able looking line of defences which on either side covered the approach to its mouth.

But not a single flanking defence had been constructed; so that wherever a vessel chose to take up her position, the only guns upon this absurd line of rampart which could be brought to bear upon her, were those immediately oppo site to her overpowering broadside. On the opposite or south bank of the Woo sung river, stood an old fort of masonry, to which some additions had recently been made by carrying a line of earthen batteries round the point formed by the confluence of the two rivers ; but these were incomplete, and but few guns were mounted on them which bore with any effect on the attacking squadron.

The cannonade was kept up by the squadron for nearly two hours, the batteries replying to it at intervals, but latterly with no vivacity or effect ; and as soon as the steamers had completed their task of conducting the men-of-war to their sta tions, they were dispatched to bring up the troops. The Tenasserim was the first that emerged from the smoke that enveloped the fleet ; and while making direct for one of the transports, with her yards topped up, ready for running along-side, signals were descried at the mast head of the flag-ship which at once changed her destination, and turning her head to the east ward, she was soon far distant from the disap pointed tenants of the transports.

Shortly after the long line of batteries had been taken possession of by the seamen and marines, the troops were landed ; and as all opposition had ceased, save at Pow-sham, the greater part were quartered in the joss-houses and public buildings behind the works, while the 26th Cameronians were marched along the ram parts to the left, to dislodge the Chinese who were thought to be still in force in that direction.

The number of corpses of Chinese soldiers found in the works when the troops landed, did not amount to thirty, and as, from the open nature of the country in the rear of Woosung it is not likely that any but wounded men were carried off by their com rades, this number may be considered the maxi mum of their slain, while of prisoners there were none. The loss on our side amounted to three killed and twenty wounded, all belonging to the vessels of war, as the troops were in fact never engaged at all. Amongst the curiosities in the shape of mili tary machines found at Woosung, were two junks fitted each with four paddle-wheels about five feet in diameter, worked by two cranks fitted on axles placed athwart in the fore and after parts of the vessel.

Sir Hugh Gough formed this force in two divisions, of which one, under the command of Colonel Montgomerie, C.B., Madras artillery, was di rected to march on Shang-hae, by the left bank of the river, while the other, under Major-General Schoedde, C.B., 55th regiment, was embarked on board steamers, which had also in tow a light draught vessel of war, and proceeded by the river. The advance of Colonel Montgomerie's column was made without encountering any obstacles from narrow roads and intersecting streams which the sappers and miners were not able speedily to overcome. The inhabitants of the villages which were passed in the route lined the road, to gaze with wonder on the novel sight, especially at the imposing exhibition of field-pieces fully equipped, drawn by horses of a size and strength which must have been here tofore considered fabulous in these provinces, where nothing larger than the stunted Tartar pony is ever seen ; but so little fear did the country people testify of our troops, when they found the most perfect discipline jjrevail in their ranks as they marched past their houses and gardens, that before the column had advanced a"], [381, "301 NOVEL SIGHT. couple of miles, the heavy scaling-ladders had been transferred by the sappers to the shoulders of willing, or, at least, not dissentient natives ; and the drag-ropes of the guns, where an ob stacle in the road rendered it necessary to unyoke the horses, were manned with Chinese labourers, mingled with our artillerymen ; and their merry laugh, as one of their number chanced to lose his hold, and roll over, sounded as careless and joy ous, as if they were amusing themselves with their fellows of the village, instead of aiding in dragging against the city of their rulers those terrible engines from which, on the appearance of Chinese troops in occupation of their vil lages and houses, ruin and death to all they held most dear would be poured forth.

Just below the town, the river, after running for a mile or more in a tolerably straight course, makes a sharp bend to the left, so as to bring a long line of bank at right angles to its former direction. Upon this admirable point for a battery the Chinese had thrown up an earthen parapet, and mounted eighteen guns be hind it ; and had these been worked by the most ordinarily skilful gunners, the squadron could scarcely have made its way past them, until a party had been landed to take the battery in flank. It was placed almost afleur d'eau, and as its fire raked every vessel fore and aft as it ad vanced, the most terrible slaughter would have taken place amongst the troops, who were crowded in the steamers like sheep in a pen, and considerable damage would also have been caused to the masts and hulls of the vessels ; but hardly one of their shot took effect upon anything, the"], [383, "303 APPROACH TO SHANG-HAE. battery being silenced, and the gunners put to flight by a few broadsides from the men-of-war and shells from the steamers, without the loss of a man. In the ardour of the cannonade, however, it was forgotten that, as the land column had com menced its march many hours before, it might rea sonably be expected to have reached the vicinity of the town; and, to the great surprise of the men of Colonel Montgomerie's division, they heard, on a sudden, the report of guns close at hand, and found round shot hurtling over their heads, and fragments of exploded shells dropping near them, where nothing in the shape of an enemy's work was visible. As they moved on, however, a body of 500 or 600 Chinese troops was descried in the open country, hurrying from the battery with which the squadron had been engaged, but they were already too far off for pursuit, and a few rockets were discharged after the fugitives. On the approach of the grenadiers of the 18th regiment to the north gate of the city of Shang hae, a few matchlocks were discharged at them from the walls ; but on pushing forward, the place was found evacuated, and the column marched in without molestation, placing guards"], [384, "304 CHINESE PLUNDERERS. upon the gates, and sending a party to thelanding place on the river's bank, to guide the division of Major-General Schoedde into the town.

On the 20th, the Nemesis was dispatched up the river to reconnoitre, and to penetrate as near as possible to Soo-chow-foo. Captain Hall accord ingly pushed on fully sixty miles, until finding the water regularly shoaling and no indications of a town or its approaches, he returned.

The price which they stated it was sold for was equal to about 25s. per ton, though the quality was not good, and it did not appear to be fit for the furnace of marine steam-engines. The failure of this attempt to find a passage to Soo-chow-foo determined the abandonment of the project for an expedition in that direction, and arrangements were made for withdrawing the troops from Shang-hae, and dropping down the river again, after a few days had been spent in the town, where the heat, it may be remarked, was found more oppressive and enervating than in any other occupied by the British troops during 1842.

A con siderable fleet of trading junks was observed under sail making off up the river, when the leading vessels of the light squadron approached the town, but trade seemed to have been for some time suspended, all trace of activity having dis appeared from the vicinity of the wharfs and landing-places. Connected, however, as it is by an elaborate system of inland navigation with all the princi pal cities of the rich and productive province in which it is situated, among which Soo-chow-foo, the most important manufacturing town of the empire, occupies the foremost rank, Shang-hae must necessarily serve as the entrepot of a con siderable export and import trade, receiving, in exchange for the stuffs, silks, and wares of the province, the cargoes of grain, metals, and woollen goods, brought by the junks from Ja pan, Corea, Formosa, the southern ports, and Singapore.

It was remarked that no British manufactures, excepting clocks and watches, of which a few were found in the houses of the higher classes, appeared to be in use in this city. Shang-hae is apparently a very ancient town, bearing on its walls and buildings, private as well as public, evidence of the ravages of long periods of time. Its ramparts are about four miles in extent, and well built, though they can not be accounted strong, by reason of their in significant height, which renders them easy of escalade at many points. The gateways, four in number, are well placed in square bastions, projecting clear of the main rampart, and having double entrances, so as to isolate the inner gates in the enceinte from the outer opening in the front face of the bastion. About sixteen copper carronades were found mounted upon these advanced works, and, from their being exact copies of a modern 18-pounder carronade, excited some interest.

The new barracks alluded to resembled closely those in the city of Chapoo, having roomy pro portions, as well as spacious cooking-houses and other buildings which would render them fit for the reception of European troops. The soldiers' houses, which were square, and divided each into two rooms, were erected in rows, or streets, with guard and store rooms attached to each, the whole being inclosed by a wall, and entered by a pair of handsome double gates, adjoining which was a roomy main-guard, and in its vicinity were two larger houses, apparently intended for the reception of the military mandarins, or officers of the legion of imperial troops.

In China the business of the pawnbroker is usually carried on with the capital of a number of persons, who form together a sort of bank, or joint-stock concern, which is described by those acquainted with their operation as most lucra tive and extensive in all parts of the empire.

The quantity of goods collected in these es tablishments, judging from those which came under the observation of the force, (and a very destructive observation it usually proved,) is enormous. Wearing apparel of all descriptions constituted the bulk of the stock of this Shang hae concern, and as it had to be cleared out of the way to make room for the soldiers, grievous havoc was of necessity made among the strange collection of odds and ends of which it con sisted.

At Shang hae, however, the tenants-at-will of the pawn broker's shop hit upon an ingenious expedient for converting into specie the collection of \" pledges \" which, though easy of acquisition, were, like others of a different description, ex ceedingly difficult to be provided for. The house was not far from the ramparts, in an adjacent angle of which there stood an old guard-room, or watch-tower ; this they converted into a de pot for silk cloaks and petticoats, and having soon attracted a group of Chinamen to the foot of the walls, they established a regular bazaar, lowering down their merchandise in bales for inspection and tender, and then chaffering for a good price with great skill and acumen.

The laughter and the screaming forth of high and low Chinese, of English and Hindostani, and the absurd appear ance of the descending bundles of indescribables, compensated by the ascending dollars, and indeed of the whole scene, which looked like a fishery for men, with ropes and hooks baited with silk cloaks, was much more ludicrous and amusing than can be conceived from this description, and the writer could not help enjoying a laugh when he heard that the Chinamen, unable to settle the question any more by laying violent hands upon the \"pledges,\" had tried another and more successful man\u0153uvre, by sending up in the bag a number of copper"], [401, ""], [402, "SALE OF PLUNDER AT SHANG-HAE."], [403, "CHINESE MOBS. 319 dollars, mixed with the silver ones.

As it is the duty of the rear-guard to bring up all baggage found lingering on the line of march, it frequently became necessary to press China men, as coolies, to carry on boxes, barrels, &c, with the column ; but so furious did they become at being thus balked of their prey, the already half-gutted houses, that the persuasion of a fixed bayonet was always necessary to overcome their reluctance to take service with us.

The extremes of heat and cold experienced in this part of the country during the year are very great, and as the Chinese have no idea of the use and comfort of a fire, but derive warmth solely from their clothing, and by the exclusion of cold air, they adopt the style of domestic architecture which is best suited to avert what they consider the greater evil of the two, and by making the principal partitions of their rooms and halls with panels which turn on pivots let into the beams at top and bottom, they are able, when the tem perature demands a freer circulation of air, to remove in some degree the closeness of their apartments by taking the panels off their hinges, leaving only the framework of the partition standing.

But it was in the appearance of the banks of the canal and of the buildings which lined and adjoined them, that disappointment was felt. In place of extensive and properly constructed wharfs and landing-places, and of store-houses and shops of a size and capacity commensurate with the extent of the traffic of which Chin keang-foo has been described as the entrepot, the suburb which extends along the western bank of the canal, (the ramparts of the city form ing the opposite one,) although of considerable extent, scarcely contains a single building besides those of government, and two or three houses erected by the Jesuits more than a century ago, and closely resembling English mills or cotton factories, which may be compared in size to an ordinary English two-storied house, while their landing-places and wharfs are so few in num ber, and of such rude construction and in such dilapidated condition, that we were at a loss to conceive from what fountain of the marvellous those travellers' wonders regard ing the vast amount of traffic centering in Chin-keang-foo were drawn. z 2"], [426, "340 EXAGGERATION OF TRAVELLERS.

Before entering upon the narrative of events which exercised so important an influence upon the sentiments and views of the court of Peking, and occupy so prominent a place in the history of the war, let us briefly review the relative situ ation of the two contending forces. The British combined armament, assembled on the 20th July in the river Yang-tse-Kiang, be fore Chin-keang-foo, consisted of not fewer than 12,000 fighting men, of whom upwards of 9000 (marines included) were troops in the highest state of discipline and efficiency, armed for the most part with percussion muskets, and sup plied with an artillery and materiel perfect in all"], [429, "343 THE CONTENDING FORCES. its departments. The naval brigade, in co-ope ration with the troops, consisted of fifteen ves sels of war, five steam frigates, and five light draught iron steamers, on board of which were nearly 3000 seamen, two-thirds of whom were, when required, available for employment on shore. On the other hand, the imperial troops had in their favour every advantage which in warfare upon a great scale must result from the choice of positions and points of defence, the proximity of magazines and reserves, and, above all, from all the animus which is inspired by the circum stances of a contest carried on upon their native soil. From the long period of inaction passed by our force at Ningpo, from the cessation on our part of all attempts to break up their mili tary establishments and harass their defensive posts, and from the experience which the two preceding years of warfare had given to their generals, it was to be anticipated that the impe rial government, so soon as the movements of the British fleet revealed the real nature of the designs of our leaders, would have put forth all those energies and vast resources, the possession of which has been ascribed to the empire by so many"], [430, "344 CHINESE GOVERNMENT. writers, in order to resist or avert the impending crisis. So little, however, did the government ap pear to have expected our attack at the valuable point chosen, and so entirely pre-occupied must it have been with efforts to resist an expected attempt upon the capital, that the defence of the Yang-tse-Kiang was entirely neglected until too late to allow of such steps being taken as might have given them some prospect of a suc cessful resistance to our advance, or have so materially retarded it as to have very consider ably circumscribed the extent of our aggressive operations during 1842. Had the Chinese government really possessed the extensive resources imputed to them, we should surely have found, during the period which elapsed since the entrance of the British fleet into the southern embouchure of the Yang tse-Kiang, (which removed all doubt as to its destinationbefore our arrival off Chin-keang-foo,) efforts would have been made to resist us upon a scale vastly superior even to those exerted at many points on the coast, where the enemy had been prepared for some time to receive our at tack ; and considering the admirable means of transport for guns, stores, and troops, from their"], [431, "EXPECTED DESCENT UPON PEKING. 345 arsenals and depots, both in the north and the south, which they had here at command in the two branches of the grand canal, it may be taken as a proof of the exceeding weakness and defi ciency under which the government laboured, and of the insignificance of their military re sources, that during a period of forty days only two paltry and unsupported batteries had been erected between Woosung and Chin-keang-foo, on banks which afforded many admirable posi tions, where powerful lines of guns might have been brought to play at great advantage upon our crowded fleet, and which might have been maintained long enough to have interfered mate rially with the rapidity of our advance, by ren dering the disembarkation of troops frequently necessary to storm the enemy's works. Information received in the early part of the year, from missionaries, showed that the Chinese considered a descent upon Peking by the Peiho river so inevitable, that since the capture of Ningpo all the energies of the government had been devoted to the construction of obstacles of all descriptions in the expected line of our ad vance, and more especially to convert Teentsin, which may be called the port of Peking, into a"], [432, "346 DEFENCE OF TEENTSIN. defensive post of the first order. Letters re ceived at the time adverted to, from a town on the Tartar frontier, near the Jehol gate of the great wall, stated that prodigious numbers of newly cast iron guns of all calibres were daily pouring into the province of Petcheelee, from the numerous villages in the Tartar country where iron is manufactured, and taking the road to Teentsin, where, according to the description given by the camel-drivers and coolies who re turned by the same route, the most formidable ranges of batteries and intrenchments were being thrown up, and guns coming in from all parts, so that the roads were encumbered by them. This lavish display of confidence in the prowess of their troops, and the adequacy of their means for the defence of Teentsin, and for the repulse of the \" barbarian army,\" was in all probability prompted as much by a desire on the part of their government to sustain the confidence of the inhabitants of Peking in the ability and resolu tion of their rulers, as by a hope of success in the shock of arms with the invaders ; and it seems strange that the imperial court, so wily and astute as they had generally shown themselves, should have so entirely overlooked the naked-"], [433, "347 FIRE-RAFTS. ness which they were thus exposing in the cen tral provinces, by draining them of all their mu nitions and machines of war, when the close proximity of our fleet and army to the mouth of the Yang-tse-Kiang ought to have kept their suspicions constantly alive. After anchoring off Golden Island on the 20th, the first symptom we perceived of anything like a disposition to resort to hostilities was the appearance of a large raft of wood in flames floating down the stream in the direction of the fleet : boats from the men-of-war were soon in pursuit, and the raft, after some trouble, was towed clear of the anchorage, and suffered to continue its course ; this was succeeded by another ; and shortly afterwards two at once were slipped, but the attempt was a very poor one, as they were not chained together to enable them to get across a ship's cable, as was done with those in the Canton river, so that not an accident of any kind was caused by them.

There was something ominous, however, in this silence, which still left a doubt upon the minds of the reconnoitring party as to the fact of the total evacuation of the city by the enemy, and though the impression received by the com mander-in-chief was, that there would be no resistance to our occupation, his excellency's measures were concerted upon a plan which showed that this doubt had influenced him among the rest.

Major-General Schoedde's brigade was directed to land under cover of some steep hills to the left of the town, and take post within gun-shot range of the walls, making a feint to attack them if any troops appeared on them, and engaging their attention to that quarter as much as pos sible, so as to create a diversion in favour of Major-General Bartley's column, which was or dered to land to the right of the town, and to act as circumstances might demand. The bri gade of Lord Saltoun, which was destined for the attack of the intrenched camps, was also directed to land to the right, opposite Golden Island, and await farther orders near the place of disembarkation. From some cause or other, however, our landing on the morning of the 21st was a very irregular operation, many de tachments getting on shore in the middle of the night, and two or three whole battalions never"], [436, "350 LANDING EFFECTED. reaching the shore at all until the business of the day was too far advanced to allow of their services being made useful. One body of men, having been put into the boats of their transport long before daybreak, and finding no boat to direct them to the landing-place, pulled to the flag-ship for information, which was conveyed in a mandate to the officer of the transport, directing him to return instantly to his ship to await the admiral's orders, for acting without which he was informed that the offending trans port would be one of the first dismissed. The disembarkation, however, of the greater part of the troops was effected by seven a. m., without loss or accident, the Chinese general omitting to take advantage of the powerful means to oppose our landing which were at his disposal, and which, owing to the difficult nature of the ground upon which the disembarkation, espe cially of the first and third brigades, took place, might, had they been properly employed, have inflicted severe loss on our force. The landing-place to the west of the town, though decidedly the best which could, under the circumstances, have been selected, was com manded by a number of houses, sheds, and other"], [437, "351 A RECONNOISSANCE. buildings, scattered over the base of a steep hill which skirted it on the left, from which, and from a number of piles of timber and other goods near the water's edge, a destructive fire could have been maintained upon the boats and upon our troops, as they formed in the circum scribed space near the bank, our reply to which would have been made under every disadvan tage and difficulty, while to the enemy, when eventually driven from their posts, a tolerably safe line of retreat lay open through circuitous streets and lanes, where our ignorance of the localities must have prevented a very close or destructive pursuit. As soon as the greater part of the first brigade had effected their disembarkation, and were drawn up at some distance from the timber-yard at which it had taken place, Sir Hugh Gough, ac companied by his staff, ascended the heights overlooking the city on the west side, for the purpose of making a closer reconnoissance, in order to decide upon the final orders to the gene rals of brigade regarding the operations of the day.

The coup-d'\u0153il from the heights commanded as striking and interesting a panorama as it has perhaps ever fallen to the lot of wanderers in strange lands to gaze upon, abounding in all that constitutes the picturesque in a lovely landscape, and presenting features of surpassing interest, both from their novelty and from the historical and statistical importance attached to them. Here for the first time we looked down upon the grand canal, and were able to note the countless off-shoots of that extraordinary and admirable channel of communication, with whose name we had so long been accustomed to associate ideas of all that is enterprising and magnificent, and which is as indispensable to the welfare and in tegrity of the vast empire whose most remote districts it connects, as is the spine to the human"], [439, "353 THE GOLDEN ISLE. body. Beside us rolled the magnificent river whose turbid waters bore along in silence the vast mass of matter, the abraded ruins of the old world, which were to form the foundations of future continents and regions, sweeping onwards majestically through a country so rich and densely clothed with verdure, that, as it lay outspread before us like a map, the eye was unable to em brace all its beauties, so dazzling and brilliant did it appear. In the middle of the stream, about midway between the two embouchures of the river, we saw the picturesque rock covered with buildings, whose roofs of glazed tiles, of a bright yellow colour, combined probably with the former wealth of its temples, gained for it the name of the Golden Isle ; a mass of picturesque and ancient buildings crowned by a tall and elegant minaret or pagoda, which made it a very striking object in the view before us. Another island, much of the same description, situated a mile to the east ward of the town, and which appears to have been separated from the southern bank of the river by the wearingawayof a passageforits water through the rocky channel, of which it formed probably the extremity, is also beautifully wooded, and A A"], [440, "354 SILVER ISLAND. adorned by many handsome and curious temples ; but the term of Silver Island, which is applied to it by the Chinese, denotes their inferiority, both in value and sanctity, to those of the sister island.

Upon a gently sloping and low spur of one of these were situated the two Chinese camps already noticed, contri buting much by their picturesque effect to en hance the beauty and interest of the scene : the dazzling white tents were still standing, and the troops could be discerned walking about within their intrenchments, in a style of insouciance which seemed to betoken ignorance of or indifference to the close proximity of their formidable foe ; and as nothing was observed which denoted a diminution of their numbers since the previous day, or preparations for a retreat, it was resolved by Sir Hugh Gough that no time should be lost"], [441, "355 ORDERS FOR AN ATTACK. in attacking them. Orders were accordingly sent to Lord Saltoun's brigade, directing them to ad vance upon the Chinese position, while that of Major-General Bartley was moved across the heights, and advanced in the direction of the city walls, throwing its right forwards so as to be in readiness to co-operate with the first brigade, should circumstances render it necessary, and to rjrevent the enemy, when driven from their camp, from effecting a retreat in the direction of the town. The brigades commenced their respective movements at about eight o'clock, and as the morning sun shone down upon their long and glittering columns, their colours gaily floating in the breeze, and their battalions equipped and accoutred with all the smartness of a Hyde Park field-day, it was impossible to suppress a feeling of admiration and excitement at the interesting scene of which they formed so brilliant a feature.

Before the brigade got clear of the remainder of the force, and the head of the column had emerged from the mass of suburban buildings which lay at the foot of the heights, the sun, from whose early rays they had been sheltered during the morning, had attained sufficient ele vation to render his beams fierce and distressing, and by the time the whole body had advanced into the open country, they had acquired an in tensity which was not to be borne by any brains but such as were \" native and to the manner born.\" The column, however, passed on, and after a march of three or four miles, came in sight of the object of their endeavours, in whose appear ance a great change had taken place since the time of the reconnoissance on the heights. The whole of the enemy's tents had been struck, and in place of the two distinct encampments, the Chinese were now observed to have united their forces into one dense body, which appeared drawn up behind an intrenchment on a gently"], [444, "358 CHINESE POSITION. sloping hill, with colours flying, and corps ranged according to their dress, as if prepared for immediate action. As our troops advanced by the rough and uneven line of march which led towards the camp, now diving deep into a valley and cross ing low fields and gardens, now ascending swell ing ridges of ground, which brought the column well into view, the Chinese troops, probably well aware of the range of their artillery, took no notice of our approach, until the advance, consisting of the light company of the 98th re giment and a small party of Madras sappers, gained the summit of a gently swelling ridge, forming one boundary of the low valley which separated them from the Chinese position, and on which they were well exposed. As soon as the enemy perceived that they had got this advance-party fairly under their aim, they raised their usual wild yell, and opened a smart fire of round shot and grape from right to left of their line, while at the same time, as if the signal had been concerted, a considerable body of troops appeared upon the brow of a range of hills upon our right, and descending for a short distance towards our line, appeared"], [445, ""], [446, "POSITION OF THE CHINESE FORCES NEAR CHIN-KEANQ-FOO."], [447, "359 AN ENGAGEMENT. to threaten an attack upon our flank, as soon as the advance of our columns should give them a favourable opportunity for acting. The engagement thus commenced, Lord Sal toun's dispositions were well and ably made. Forming the brigade into two columns, of which one was directed to move by the right, to turn the left of the enemy's position, and the other to press upon their right, so as to cut off their retreat, he instructed Major Anstruther, who had opportunely come up with some light field-pieces, to move his guns to the front, and open upon the Chinese intrenchments, while at the same time he directed two companies of the Bengal volun teer regiment to take post in some dwelling houses and gardens, which formed a strong po sition, for the purpose of keeping in check the division of the enemy's troops which menaced us on the ridge to our right. These operations were promptly executed ; and while the attention of the enemy was diverted by the sharp fire kept up on their position by our guns, the 98th, sappers, and 41st Madras native infantry, on the right, and the volunteer regiment on the left, were press ing forward to close."], [448, "360 RAPID FLIGHT.

Thirteen men of the 98th regiment, however, expired before evening from the effects of fatigue and exposure to the sun. From the 2nd and 3rd brigades in the direc tion of the town of Chin-keang-foo, and from the shipping in the river, the report of occasional heavy firing had been heard for some time by the 1st brigade. The 2nd brigade, under the com mand of Major-General Schoedde, landed at daybreak to the east of the city, and taking up the best position which the features of the ground afforded, created as serious a diversion in favour of the attack of the 3rd brigade on the west as was practicable. In order, however, to be pre pared to convert their feint into a real attack, should circumstances require it, scaling-ladders were put on shore with the brigade, as also a supply of eighteen and thirty-two pounder rockets, in addition to the field-pieces attached to it, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Knowles, of the Royal artillery. Here, as on the west side, no opposition was made to the landing, although the boats which conveyed the troops"], [451, "363 AUCKLAND STEAM FRIGATE. on shore had to pass within range of the guns on the ramparts ; and General Schoedde was suffered to occupy a commanding slope within 300 yards of the walls, and to crown it with his troops, without opposition. This indifference or oversight, however, was soon seen to have been caused by the engrossing claims which the formidable body of troops col lecting near the landing-place of the 1st and 3rd brigades, made upon the attention of the garrison, who, until the 55th regiment had occu pied the eastern heights in force, and the artillery and rocket-tubes had been planted upon their summits, appear to have had no distinct appre hension of the approach of danger in that quar ter. They now commenced a smart fire of round and grape upon the hill held by the 55th regi ment, and upon the plain across which the 6th and 2nd Madras regiments were moving, as division after division gained the shore to form under its cover, and some men were shot down in the ranks before shelter was obtained.

From the hill on which General Schoedde had taken his stand a very extensive view of the country on the south and east sides of the city was commanded, reaching indeed as far as the hills on which the Chinese had formed their in trenched camps, so that the whole of the move ments of Lord Saltoun's brigade were distinctly visible, as well as those of the retreating enemy.

Bringing on his riflemen in excellent style, until within pistol-shot of the walls, Captain Simpson judiciously extended them in an irregu lar line so far along the face threatened, and maintained so brisk a fire upon the parapets, that the attention of the enemy was effec tually distracted from the point near the angle at which it had been decided that the ladders should be reared ; and although the party of sappers and miners who carried them had to cross an open space, exposed to the full fire of a face and flank of the works, before the foot of"], [455, "367 TARTAR MATCHLOCK-MEN. the walls could be gained, not a single casualty occurred in their ranks.

Even after the ramparts had been gained, so completely was their attention engrossed by the covering party of our assaulting column, that scarcely a shot was fired at the leading files until a considerable number had ascended the ladders and formed upon the terre-pleine, which was for some distance along the faces of the bastion very narrow, being bounded by a rear wall of brick, running parallel to the parapet, at a distance of from twelve to sixteen feet, and having low walls at intervals, intersecting it at right angles, in the form of traverses.

The slight panic, however, which the surprise of such a movement had caused amongst the Tartars in the bastion, did not endure long. Bodies of troops came along the ramparts to wards the point of danger, and forming in masses on the terre-pleine, and spreading themselves among the houses and gardens below, they maintained so severe a fire upon the assaulting column, which now, divided into two, strove to win its way along either face of the work which it had so successfully entered, that the men began to fall fast, and their advance received at almost every step a severe check, especially upon the left, where Captain Reid, of the 6th regiment native infantry, who commanded after the death of his colonel, (Drever,) who fell under the effect of a coup-de-soleil, after ascending the walls, was not able, until after a desperate struggle and considerable delay, to bring his column round the re-entering angle, where, from the inner wall of the rampart being discontinued, its head, as it emerged from shelter, became exposed to a fire from an extended range of B B"], [460, "370 OBSTINATE RESISTANCE positions taken up by the enemy's matchlock men, and had to fight its way, almost inch by inch, to the nearest gateway, which General Schoedde had opened for the admittance of the 2nd regiment of native infantry, who had been detached from the main column with some rockets, to menace it, and divert the attention of the enemy while the principal attack was going on. Undismayed, however, by the formidable ap pearance of their assailants, whose column (con sisting of the 6th regiment, some men of the 55th regiment, and the rifles, who had mounted the ladders when their duty as coverers had been achieved) now extended along their ramparts in imposing array, and unshaken by the fire from the artillery and infantry upon the gateway, the Tar tar troops for a considerable time clung gallantly to the guard-house which occupied the space above it, and to the parapets of the bastion which covered the approach, inflicting some loss upon their opponents, and defending the wickets which led into the work in the most resolute manner, under a storm of balls which was poured upon them.

The gates were then thrown open, and the 2nd regiment of native in fantry entering, united themselves with the 6th, and the column pursued its way along the ram parts towards the west gate, under the command of Lieut. -Colonel Luard, of the former corps. In the meantime, the advance of the right column, although obstinately contested by the Tartar troops, was gradually made good along the left face of the bastion, on the inner side of whose rampart the low masonry wall already mentioned was found to run, until it became united to the main line of the city wall, narrow ing the level space on the summit of the ram part so much as to ensure deadly effect amongst the crowded masses of the enemy from the fire of our front ranks. The Tartars, however, although suffering so severely, continued their resistance in the most cool and determined manner, now halting to give effect to their matchlock fire, and now retreating slowly and in good order, as our troops pressed upon them. bb 2"], [462, "372 A GUARD-HOUSE. They continued thus falling back until they arrived at a re-entering angle of the works, where a small two-storied guard-house offered a strong and favourable point of defence, the advance to it being swept as well by the fire of the curtain, which here joined the bastion, as by that from the doors and windows of the building. At this point they turned fiercely upon their assailants, and being reinforced by some detachments which came along the ramparts from the westward to succour them, they made a desperate, andfor some time a successful stand, pouring upon the head of the column of the 55th a fire which soon made fearful gaps in their close and crowded array.

This gallant officer shortly afterwards received a severe wound from a matchlock ball, near the guard-house, and the command of the regiment for the remainder of the day devolved upon Major Fawcett. The check experienced by the right column at this fiercely contested point was not of long duration ; the fire of musketry, which had been opened along its flank upon the embrasures in the curtain through which the enemy annoyed our troops with their formidable ginjalls and matchlocks, was soon directed to cease, and Capt. Macleane's grenadiers once more charged into the guard-house, and deluged it with the blood of its brave defenders, the survivors of whom now gave up the post, and retreated along the curtain towards the nearest salient angle, where a considerable body of the enemy were collecting, dragging with them wall pieces taken from the embrasures, which they planted on the ramparts, and pointed down the path by which the advance of our column had to be made.

The inner gates, situated in an archway through the main rampart, were seized by the advanced party of the 55th regi ment, without loss, and a barricade of grain and sand-bags erected within having been removed, the gates were thrown open, and Lieutenants Heriott and Johnston, with some men of the 55th, and sappers, running across the bastion, through the fire of the enemy from the walls, gained the cover of the archway of the outer gates, and be gan dragging away the sand-bags which were piled against them."], [473, "379 FORTUNATE ESCAPE.

They had scarcely passed through the inner gateway, when a dense cloud of dust and smoke rose from the archway which they had quitted but a few minutes be fore, followed by an explosion which shook down the walls of the houses and guard-rooms which occupied the inner space of the bastion, and si lenced for the moment the minor thunders which had so long been rousing the echoes of the sur rounding hills.

Before proceeding with the details of this last and crowning contest of the war, it will be ne cessary briefly to sketch the operations of the 3rd brigade, previous to the successful entrance by the west gate which has been described. After the departure of the brigade of Lord Saltoun, in the early part of the morning, to attack the intrenched camp, the 3rd brigade moved forward towards the town, and halted in a position outside the suburb, which commanded a view of the country over which the 1st bri gade had to advance, and of the ground occu pied by the enemy in their front. It was the intention of the commander-in-chief to keep this brigade in reserve until the result of Lord Saltoun's movement became apparent, or until some demonstration on the part of the enemy should enable him to decide on the point on which its attack might be most favourably di rected. On witnessing, however, the defeat of the Chinese, and their rout from the camp, and the firing which announced that the attack of the 2nd brigade had commenced in earnest,"], [476, "382 A FIRE OF MUSKETRY. Sir Hugh Gough moved the 18th and 49th regiments through the suburb, towards the west gate, which had by this time been discovered, and occupying the houses, which, according to the custom of the Chinese, were built close down to the water's edge, farthest removed from the walls, opened a heavy fire of musketry upon the parapets, whose embrasures bore upon the gateway, while Colonel Montgomerie threw round shot and shells amongst the Tartar troops, who crowded the walls extending towards the southward, and opened upon their assailants as soon as their hostile purpose became apparent. Before, however, this position had been assumed by the British troops, an event had occurred in the neighbourhood of the west gate which might have been attended by the most perilous conse quences to a portion of the force. From our entire ignorance and uncertainty regarding the condition and numbers of the garrison, and the probability of a serious resist ance, it became a matter of some difficulty to assign a place for the disembarkation of the guns, so conveniently situated, that while it might afford due facility for their being landed, should at the same time possess the advantage of a"], [477, "383 THE GRAND CANAL. practicable line of communication for light ar tillery, with the various points at which the guns of the 1st and 3rd brigades were directed to act. In consequence of this, and owing also to some misunderstanding of arrangements, a detachment of artillery, with four field-pieces and howitzers, having had two boats of the Blonde appropriated for their use, in disem barking, proceeded on the morning of the en gagement, under the command of Major Blundell, to the mouth of the Grand Canal, and pulled along its course, with the stream in their favour, towards the city walls, in the expectation of finding a spot on the outer bank where they might conveniently put their guns on shore, and effect a junction, or be prepared to act in co operation with General Bartley's brigade. The silence among the houses on either side of the canal, and the seeming indifference of the enemy to their approach, induced them to continue their course, until, suddenly shooting past the cover of some high buildings which intercepted the view on the side next the city, they found them selves unexpectedly close under the ramparts, with the bridge leading to the west gate directly in front."], [478, "384 A RETREAT. Their advance had been narrowly watched by the enemy, for no sooner had the two boats come fairly within their reach, than every embrasure and loophole which bore upon them sent forth a shower of balls which came rattling about the British detachment, disabling a great portion of their number, and compelling the remainder to provide, with all expedition, for their safety. To pull back out of range was impossible, as many of the hands were hors de combat, and the cur rent ran with great velocity against them ; the leading boat, therefore, pulled for the stone bridge, in hopes of finding shelter under the arch, while the other was under the necessity of run ning on shore not a pistol-shot from the city walls, where the wounded were got out as expe ditiously as possible, and the boat, with guns, ammunition, and arms, left at the disposal of the Chinese garrison. The crew and detachment of artillery retreated through the suburb till they reached the bank of the river, while the party under the bridge, finding their place of refuge too hot to hold them, also abandoned their boat, and taking out their wounded, retreated along the inner or eastern bank of the canal, the enemy keeping up a brisk fire upon them till they got"], [479, "385 A WOUNDED ARTILLERY-MAN. under cover of the houses, but making no effort to cut them off by a sally from the gates, by which, had it been attempted, much loss must have been experienced, and the guns and boats either taken or destroyed. The garrison, how ever, had so effectually barricaded their gates to prevent the ingress of an enemy, that their own egress could only have been effected after con siderable labour and loss of time. As soon as this untoward affair was made known to the admiral, an order was dispatched directing the boats of the Cornwallis to proceed with a strong detachment of marines to recover the abandoned boats, and render assistance to the attacking column at the west gate. The boats, found uninjured save by the enemy's bul lets, were again taken possession of, and a soldier of the artillery, whom it had been found impos sible to remove from the boat in consequence of his leg having been badly fractured by a match lock ball, was found lying, in other respects un hurt, at the bottom, under the thwarts, although he had been drifted about under the walls, ex posed to the enemy's fire for a considerable time.

The report and recommendation of Captain Pears, the chief engineer, who had closely reconnoitred the approaches to the bas tion, and the appearance of the outer pair of gates, decided his excellency to effect an entrance by blowing the latter open, and escalading the inner wall of the bastion, should obstacles be still found to interpose. An explosion-party was accordingly formed, and a strong detach ment of good marksmen was thrown into the small shops and houses clustered round the foot of the bridge on the suburban side, to drive the enemy from their embrasures, and keep down their fire while the powder-bags were being carried forward. The brigade was at the same time formed in close column of sections in the streets of the suburb, in readiness to charge through the gateway when the bugles should sound the advance.

The result of the explosion was most successful, the gates being torn from their hinges and blown backwards several feet into the archway, without being at all shattered ; and the storming column, though advancing through a blinding cloud of smoke and dust, found their footing as sure and free from hindrance as upon the paved road outside"], [482, "388 THE GARRISON REFUSE QUARTER. About the time when the 3rd brigade rushed through the west gate, the party of marines, seamen, and artillery, who had come up to the scene of action in the boats of the Cornwallis, having landed with one scaling-ladder on the opposite bank of the canal close under the right flank of the gateway bastion, escaladed the wall near a small postern which communicated with the work, and although the first man (a marine) who mounted the ladder, was shot through the head, and others who followed were wounded, their lodgment on the ramparts was soon made good, and the gallant remnant of the enemy who yet continued their hopeless and desperate resist ance refusing to surrender or accept quarter, perished by the ball or the bayonet. The con test being now terminated by the destruction of the west gates and the annihilation of the brave garrison of the bastion, the 2nd and 3rd brigades were directed to take post at the various gates of the town, and to occupy such quarters as were available for the night.

All now appeared at rest within the walls, the heavy firing on the east and west faces had en tirely died away, save where here and there a stray shot might be sent after a fugitive, or, upon speculation, amongst suspicious-looking build ings ; and people were beginning to enumerate the losses of the day, and to congratulate them selves that, heavy as was the list, its total had not been greater or more fatal, when suddenly the attention of all was arrested by the report of a heavy volley, followed by a sharp, steady, rolling fire, which seemed to proceed from a considerable body of men in conflict.

It appears that, after being driven from the ramparts and gateways, the Tartars withdrew in a body into the quarter of the city where the public buildings and their own barracks and dwelling-houses were situated.

The grenadiers of the 18th, rendered furious by the loss of a favourite officer, Captain Collinson, who was shot dead on the rampart just before the charge, pressed hotly on the Tartars, and made great havoc among them ; but ignorance of the localities put an early stop to the pursuit, and the survivors of the melee escaped through the adjacent houses and narrow streets, but only, as was afterwards ascertained, to meet a more ignoble death at their own hands.

Armed parties were sent out shortly after daybreak, to patrol the Tartar quarter in search of concealed soldiers, and to destroy the arsenals and depots of military stores, while fatigue detachments of sappers and miners were em ployed in collecting and interring the dead, from whose remains, owing to the excessive heat of the weather, the most noisome exhalations were already rising.

It was evident, from circumstances that came to our knowledge, after the capture of the place, that the confidence of the Tartar general in the strength of his defences, in the valour and prowess of his men, and the skill with which his dispositions had been made, continued un shaken up to a late hour on the day of the assault, although, at the commencement of the attack, some dissatisfaction among the garrison, or dis inclination for the fray, appears to have been manifested. This was inferred from the fact, that both at the east and west gates, the two"], [496, "400 PUNISHMENT FOR TREACHERY. points of the city on which our main attacks were directed, the bodies of two soldiers were placed in an exposed situation, (as if to serve as an example to their comrades,) with their arms tightly pinioned behind them, and their throats cut or their heads laid open by the stroke of a sword. One man of the four had apparently been put to death in the most barbarous manner, his arms having been hacked in a series of gashes from the wrist to the shoulder, and the counte nance of the unfortunate wretch being fearfully distorted by the agony he had endured. To the offence of cowardice before the enemy the Chinese military code awards death in a simple form only ; it is therefore probable that this man had been endeavouring to excite the garrison to abandon the place, or had been guilty of some other grave act of treachery. From information given to our interpreters, by shopkeepers and others dwelling in the sub urbs, subsequent to the assault, it appeared that for many days previous to the arrival of the Bri tish fleet off Golden Island, the Tartar general had made every preparation for our attack, closing the gates, suspending all traffic on the canal, forcing the inhabitants within the walls to be-"], [497, "TARTAK SPEARMEN"], [498, ""], [499, "401 FORAGING. take themselves to the interior of the province, levying contributions of poultry, pigs, and all descriptions of provisions from the surrounding country, for the supply of the garrison and of the force encamped in the position carried by Lord Saltoun. So completely had this drained the villages for miles round the city of all such supplies, that, during the week spent by our army in occupation of the place, the utmost diffi culty was experienced in obtaining the common est necessaries, and the most practised foragers harried the neighbouring farms and every other spot that promised a supply, with little success. Had the Tartars possessed any practical ac quaintance with the science of military defence, the indomitable determination of their chief, and the devotedness and skill in the use of their arms, of which such proofs were given by his men during the various conflicts of the 21st July, must in all probability have ensured a far different result to the contest. The escalade of General Schoedde's brigade could scarcely have suc ceeded, had the Tartars who lined the parapets of the square eastern bastion been aware of the mode of attack about to be adopted, for the lad ders attached to the brigade were only three, and D D"], [500, "402 TARTAR IGNORANCE OF the parapets were so high above the terre-pleine of the rampart, that half a dozen matchlock-men might have coolly picked off each of their assail ants, without being themselves exposed to any fire, while the great muscular strength of the Tartars must have ensured the destruction of such as leaped unhurt upon the rampart. The advance up a ladder, even by the readiest of troops, is necessarily slow, each man occupying a space in his ascent nearly equal to his own height, and being unable to pass the uppermost rungs until his front file has stepped upon the wall, so that, where moderate determination and coolness are displayed by the defenders, this mode of attack ought never to succeed unless many ladders are used, or the parapets previously beaten down by round shot, to expose the enemy on the ramparts to the view of the covering party below. The Tartars also neglected to take ad vantage of an admirable little work which flanked the spot where the ladders were raised, at a dis tance of only thirty to forty yards, and which afforded such safe cover to a small body of men for whose use niches were constructed in the masonry below, with narrow loopholes bearing upon the foot of the ramparts, that a constant"], [501, "403 MILITARY SCIENCE. and deliberate fire might have been maintained upon the assaulting party. At the western gate, also, instead of clearing away the houses which afforded cover for the light infantry of the third brigade, and enabled them to keep down the fire of the garrison while the powder-bags were being carried over the bridge, (which ought to have been done, to the distance of a good musket-shot in all directions) not a single building which intercepted their view of the advance of an attacking column was removed either from the banks of the wet ditch or canal, or from the bridge itself, along each side of whose roadway ran a row of single- storied shops, in the fashion of some ancient bridges in England, through which, if necessary, the sappers could have worked their way by cut- ting through their thin partitions, so as to have brought the bags up to the gates, without being for a moment exposed to the enemy's view. It was ascertained by some returns found in one of the military offices of the place, that the Tartars inside the city did not exceed 2300; and as it is not probable that any of these had ever before witnessed the imposing array of a disciplined army, the brilliant spectacle presented by the d d 2"], [502, "404 GENERAL HAILING. pouring forth of nearly 9000 well-equipped and fully-armed soldiers, from the vast fleet which covered the river beneath them, might well ex cite dismay in the hearts of those who looked down from the insecure and precarious shelter of their narrow ramparts upon the formidable co lumns advancing for their destruction. For some time after the capture of the city, the fate of the brave General Hailing, who had so nobly conducted its defence, was uncertain : his body could not be recognised among the slain, and none of the wounded Tartars who had been removed to our hospitals had seen him since the last desperate stand made by the rem nant of the garrison among the gardens and in- closures. At length, however, Mr. Morrison, the interpreter, discovered a man who had acted in the capacity of secretary to Hailing, secreted in an out-house of a building in the Tartar quarter, and from him he elicited the particulars of the fate of this gallant man. After haranguing his troops, he had mounted his horse, and placing himself at their head, led them to the ground upon which their despe rate attack upon the 18th and 49th regiments was made : thence seeing that the main defences"], [503, "405 A FUNERAL PILE. of the town were in our possession, and that the day was irretrievably lost, he returned to his house, and calling for his secretary, desired him to bring his official papers into a small room adjoining an inner court of the building, where deliberately seating himself, and causing the papers writh a quantity of wood to be piled up around him, he dismissed the secretary, set fire to the funeral pile, and perished in the flames. In the apartment where this strange example of barbarian heroism had been enacted, Mr. Mor rison found, among some heaps of ashes and half-consumed wood, evidences of the awful sacrifice which had been so determinedly con summated, amply sufficient to corroborate the tale of his informant : the skull of the general was yet unconsumed, and the bones of the thighs and feet, though partially calcined, re tained enough of their original form and appear ance to be recognised. The floor of the room was paved, and the flames had consequently not extended beyond the pile of fuel.

The mission, however, proved thus far fruitless, that although several buildings well situated as posts of defence were discovered, no body of armed men was seen during the ex cursion. The country to the southward of Chin-keang foo was found to stretch away in a vast and fer tile plain, after passing the high range of hills which runs nearly east and west across the pro vince ; but the same observation which the ap pearance of the banks of the river towards the eastward had elicited, was here again called forth by the strikingly disproportionate amount of the villages and inhabitants, compared with the great extent of land capable of cultivation which met the eye in all directions.

The portion of this great national work which fell under our observation on the southern bank of the Yang-tse-kiang was not calculated to im press us with any very exalted idea of its mag nificent proportions and extent ; it had no tow ing-path, was, in many parts, of inconsiderable breadth and depth, and was, moreover, traversed by a stone bridge, whose dimensions showed that none but junks of small size could be employed in its navigation. The whole surface of the pro vince is, however, covered with so comrdete a net work of canals, that it is difficult, when looking down upon it from the summit of the Che-keang hills, to trace the grand trunk on the southern side of the Yang-tse-Kiang ; but on the northern, the scene is widely different.

The level of the country slopes towards the north, as it re cedes more and more from the river. No cur rent was found to affect the waters of the canal, at two or three miles' distance from the river, whence it would appear that the northern branch has no other main communication with its stream than that which opens into it above Golden Island. Off this embouchure the Calliope frigate was anchored to prevent any intercourse between the northern and southern banks of the Yang-tse kiang ; and the reconnoissances made in boats at various times by Captain Kiiper, her com mander, proved how effectually the whole traffic of the inland provinces had been stopped by this first blow of the campaign.

Terror and dismay seemed to have spread universally among the peaceful and industrious inhabitants, who appa rently expected that the dreaded fire-ships would shortly carry ruin and desolation among their farms and villages. The great object of the campaign of the Yang tse-Kiang had thus been acconvplished. The empire was severed in two, and the utter inca pacity of the government to defend its people, and to avert from them the calamities which their rulers had vainly assured them could never be carried beyond the shores of the maritime districts, had now been amply and fatally demon strated at a spot, from which, as one of the main foci of communication with the centre of the empire, the dangerous truth must soon radiate, and be understood and discussed in every obscure village community of its remotest provinces.

Some of these interested us by their European style of architecture, and their unusual height of three stories. It was sup posed for this reason, and from their standing apart from the Chinese suburb, that they had been erected by the Jesuits at the period when their influence at the imperial court enabled them to make endeavours to improve the arts and customs of the Chinese.

No description, indeed, can convey an adequate idea of the utter desolation, ruin, and abomination, which it presented on the seventh day only of our occupation after the troops had withdrawn from their quarters near the gates.

Revolting, however, as the scene was in the city, that presented by the suburb was a hun dred-fold worse, for there, from its great extent, and the endless ramification of its lanes and alleys, it was impossible to maintain the least check upon the maraudings alike of friend and foe, and the jurisdiction and sphere of utility of the active and able Sergeant Baxter, the provost marshal to the force, were in consequence ee 2"], [520, "420 CARGOES OF \" LOOT.\" bounded by the city walls.

The surrounding coun try is undulating, and is intersected by abrupt and lofty ridges in a manner exceedingly pic turesque, presenting one vast extent of unvary ing green, quite dazzling to the eye ; not that"], [534, "430 PICTURESQUE LANDSCAPE. the cultivation of its level tracts could be con sidered remarkable for richness, or for that ela borate agricultural industry which we had been accustomed to witness in the districts near the thickly-peopled coast to which our opportunities had been hitherto confined ; indeed, a great pro portion of the land whose level admitted of pro fitable, dry cultivation, appeared left to waste, or rather to the bounty of nature, whose lavish hand had clothed its slopes and hills and dales with a garment of the most luxuriant vegetation ; trees also were not wanting to complete the ex ceeding beauty of the landscape, but, as usual, they were of stunted growth, and displayed but few characteristics of their ancestral forest race, whose habitat seems in this country so remote from the haunts of man. The waters of the Yang-tse-Kiang at this point of its course had worn for themselves a wide passage through a spear of hills, formed of an cient volcanic rock of a soft and porous charac ter, leaving on either bank an isolated mass of undulating ground, which on the south forms the extremity of the tongue encompassed by the city walls, and on the north is broken up into a number of minor ridges, forming a sort of amphi-"], [535, "431 ENVOYS FROM ELEEPOO. theatre, which the Chinese of former days con verted into a fortified inclosure ; and a wall still exists in tolerable repair, running along the sum mits of the hills, and descending to the bank of the river at either extremity, from whose form and outline it may be conjectured that it was in tended to repel aggressions from the hordes of the north, at a period when Nanking was the capital of the empire and the residence of the dynasty of the Mings, while yet the Chinese were an unconquered and a tail-less race. On the 9th August, the promised communi cation of Eleepoo, regarding the powers with which he was vested by the emperor, was made on board the Queen to the secretary of the Bri tish plenipotentiary, and proved, to the surprise and indignation of his excellency, to be altogether insufficient to warrant him in suffering farther delay in the operations against the city, for which the two commanders-in-chief were fully pre pared. The envoys of Eleepoo were therefore dis missed, with the assurance that the morrow should see the British troops arrayed before the walls of Nanking ; and the resolution which his excellency had thus been compelled to adopt"], [536, "432 PREPARATION FOR HOSTILITIES. was communicated without loss of time to the general and admiral, with a request that hosti lities might be resumed forthwith. In pursuance of this intimation, the Corn wallis moved on the following morning into a position from which the northern angle of the walls could be battered by her broadside, and the Blonde frigate was towed down the creek, until her guns bore upon the point which the admiral had selected for breaching and enfilad ing the battery which covered it, and over which the white flag yet floated. Though both ships were brought by this change of position within close range of their guns, the Chinese abstained from any demonstration of hostility, and the seventy-four and frigate anchored and prepared to open at day-break next morning, without a shot having been fired on either side. In the meantime, Lord Saltoun's brigade was put on board steamers, and towed on the even ing of the 10th to the lower extremity of the creek, where they were disembarked, and occu pied for the night some joss-houses and other buildings in the vicinity. The transports, containing the horses of the Madras troop of light artillery and the ponies"], [537, "433 TARTAR FORTRESS. of the foot batteries dropped down to the same point, and the banks of the creek displayed on the following morning a scene of the most animated and exciting bustle, as horses were brought on shore, guns landed and mounted on their car riages, and ammunition and stores prepared for service with a dispatch which to the un initiated observer would appear magical. By Mr. Morrison's Chinese sketch of the city, it appeared that at the south-eastern angle there stood a fortress, partly independent of the main line of defence or enceinte of the place, in which, as at Chapoo, the Tartar troops were quartered aloof from the populace, whom it was their business to overawe and defend. Separated on two sides by ramparts drawn within those of the body of the place, this Tartar garrison is yet exposed on the south and east to a direct attack, by gateway, mine, or breaching battery, from its having on those faces but one line of wall, in common with that of the city. From the reconnoissance which had been made, these walls were judged far too lofty to be reached by our scaling-ladders, but the gate ways being situated in tunnels carried through the masonry, without returns or bastion-de- F F"], [538, "434 TAIPING GATE. fences, as at Chin-keang-foo, offered an easy means of access by a powder-bag operation, and the dry, firm appearance of the surrounding country, through which the paved-road appeared to extend the whole way from the landing-place to the city, promised facility in the operation of transporting the few eight-inch howitzers, suffi cient for a breaching-battery. To assist in rendering practicable the breach proposed to be made by the broadside guns of the Cornwallis, Colonel Montgomerie was di rected to land four howitzers, to be placed in battery near the mouth of the creek, and General Bartley's brigade was detailed to form the storm ing column, supported by a battalion of marines and seamen, to carry the breach on the following morning, and then to proceed by the ramparts towards the Taiping gate, on which Lord Sal toun's brigade was in the meantime to make a feint, throw it open for their admittance, and, the forces being united at that point, to proceed against the Tartar citadel. Captain Pears, how ever, the chief engineer, having landed under the walls on the evening of the 10th, to mark out the site of the proposed battery, made his way on to the foot of the escarp, to ascertain the na-"], [539, "TAIPING GATE, NANKING."], [540, ""], [541, "435 EXAMINATION OF THE GROUND. ture of the ground over which the assaulting column would have to move on their way to the breach. This reconnoissance led to a discovery which put a stop to further proceedings in the quarter selected ; for, intervening between the bank of the river and the ramparts, Captain Pears found a wide and deep ditch, a branch of the creek in which the Blonde lay anchored, which it would have been impossible to cross save by boats or by a flying bridge ; the project was therefore abandoned, and Sir Hugh Gough, sending direc tions to Lord Saltoun to co-operate with him in a reconnoissance on the following day, landed on the morning of the 1 1th with an escort, for the purpose of maturing a new plan of attack. In the meantime, Lord Saltoun's brigade moved in a southerly direction, by the paved-road from the village near the creek, preceded by an ad vanced guard of rifles, supported by two of Major Anstruther's guns. Several positions well cal culated for defence were passed on the march, but the enemy attempted no molestation, and we learned from the village people, a few of whom yet remained in their fields and dwellings, that all the Tartar and Chinese troops, including a f f2"], [542, "436 MAKUR-KEOW. considerable body -of cavalry, recently arrived, were quartered within the city, and had no in trenched positions or camp beyond the walls. The brigade halted about three miles from the gate, and found commodious quarters in the ex tensive village of Makur-Keow, where also Lord Saltoun established his head-quarters, and Sir Hugh Gough returned to the shipping to make arrangements for the disembarkation of the third brigade, and to request the admiral to dispatch a steamer to Chin-keang-foo, to bring up the flank companies of the three regiments left there, which, from the statements of the country people, and from the appearance of countless tents along the ramparts of the city and Tartar citadel, his excellency judged would be more serviceable here than at the mouth of the grand canal. The view obtained from an eminence near the walls during the reconnoissance of the 11th proved highly satisfactory, as to the feasibility of the projected assault on the Taiping gate : the approach, which was by a broad paved causeway, elevated many feet above the broken ground near the foot of the walls, appeared to be flanked by only one insignificant work, and an excellent"], [543, "437 RUSTIC CURIOSITY. cover for riflemen was observed close up to the gateway, where, besides thick clusters of trees, tall shrubs, and grass, several small houses, had been left standing. The road was so broad and straight, that a field-piece could be run along it with ease until within a short distance of the gates, which a few round shot would in all pro bability bring down, even if barricaded in their rear before our advance took place. At the time of our inspection they were still open, and people, apparently refugees from the neighbour ing villages, were passing in, with their move ables on their heads and shoulders. The appear ance of the reconnoitring party excited no par ticular attention ; the soldiers crowded to the parapets and gazed through the embrasures, but no sign of hostility or suspicion was made ; while the people of the villages, instead of testi fying alarm, left their fields to crowd round the troops, and examine their dress and arms with rustic curiosity. During the 11th and fol lowing day, the artillery were engaged at the landing-place, (Ma-tam-keang,) in getting some nine-pounders and howitzers on shore, and by the evening of the 13th, a formidable park of all calibres and descriptions had been formed at the"], [544, "438 THE HORSE ARTILLERY. village where Lord Saltoun's head-quarters had been established. For the first time also since their arrival in China\u2014 a spectacle certainly never before wit nessed in its territories \u2014 the troop of horse artil lery, from Madras, having brought their horses and the whole of their splendid equipment on shore, without any accident, marched from the creek and joined the force concentrated round Makur-keow, where they found excellent sta bling in some farm buildings, and abundance of forage and litter in the barns and storehouses, which had been deserted on the approach of the 1st brigade. The efficient condition in which this fine troop, after a confinement on ship-board of nearly four months, under all the disadvan tageous circumstances necessarily resulting from the unfavourable temperature and the novelty of the duty, took the field before Nanking, elicited much admiration from the force. The promptness of the plenipotentiary's move ments produced a marked effect upon the coun cils of the Chinese authorities, and a secretary of Keying, a mandarin of high rank, lately ar rived from Peking, to co-operate with Eleepoo in the commission for the \" settlement of the"], [545, "439 VISIT FROM A MANDARIN. affairs of the foreigners,\" was immediately sent to the Queen steamer, to intercede earnestly for a delay in the progress of the British troops, until time had been given for the imperial autho rity to be received.* Major Malcolm informed the messenger that the fiat of the plenipotentiary was unalterable, that the progress of the British general could only be stayed by the production of the required imperial authority, and that the misery which Eleepoo in his letter deprecated as awaiting the noble city for want of a simple document which would be sent from Peking the instant the court were informed of its necessity, could only be averted by their compliance with the demand of which they had already had full and timely warn ing.

Their polite proposal was immediately acceded to, and the Cornwallis selected for their recep tion ; and on the 20th August, the principal officers of all branches of the combined expedi tion having been summoned to do honour to the occasion, Eleepoo and Keying, together with the viceroy of the province, and a retinue of civil and military mandarins, came off and presented themselves at the gangway of the flag-ship, to tender their first overture for a friendship and intercourse which the habits and prejudices of ages of bigotry and undisputed dominion had, until this memorable epoch in their history, taught them to scorn and reject with contumely. How striking the contrast between this scene and that enacted at the mouth of the Pei-ho but two years before, when the commissioner, Kee shen, declared it to be utterly impossible for him to compromise so far the dignity of the celestial empire, as to go on board a barbarian ship to visit a foreign plenipotentiary !

The 22nd, however, proved tempestuous, and the plenipotentiary, in consideration of the age and infirm constitution of Eleepoo, post poned the meeting until the 24th, when it took place in due form in a joss-house of no great pretension outside the city walls. As the per mission to attend upon this occasion was not restricted to particular grades, a great assemblage of officers of all arms took place near the ap pointed spot, although the distance by land from the head-quarters of Lord Saltoun's force was considerable, and the day intensely hot ; and about noon, the plenipotentiary, admiral, and general, having arrived from their vessels, the whole party proceeded in boats up the wide creek. On arriving at the joss-house, the British chiefs were received by a party of mandarins, and conducted across an outer court between the ranks of a detachment of soldiers, drawn up in the form of a crescent, without any arms save"], [551, ""], [552, "CHINESE SW0ED3MAM"], [553, "445 CHINESE MUSICIANS. the spears to which their banners were attached, and these latter were displayed in great numbers. The troops selected for this duty were not Tar tars, who had probably been expressly spared the humiliation of this ceremony, as they still wore the garb of mourning (a white dress) for their friends and relatives who fell at Chin-keang foo. Behind the plenipotentiary's party, as a guard of honour, marched the magnificent gre nadier company of the 18th Royal Irish, whose appearance contrasted strangely with the un gainly dress and almost ludicrous style of the imperial soldiery, who gazed upon their new allies with undisguised astonishment. A most curious band was drawn up in an inner space, and when the plenipotentiary made his appear ance from the outer court, three guns, the usual Chinese salute upon all occasions, were fired, and the note of welcome was taken up by the band instruments, whose music was not, how ever, very melodious. The imperial commissioners now came forward to receive their distinguished guests, and ushered them into an inner apartment, where seats of honour had been ranged for the principal parties, the whole assemblage following. A repast a la"], [554, "446 CHINESE REPAST. Chinoise was spread in several rooms, comprising an infinite variety of delicacies, as curious as difficult to be described, and the ceremony of the meeting was soon brought to a close, the conversation between the commissioners and the plenipotentiary being confined to common- place matters, and avoiding all reference to busi- ness. At Eleepoo 's particular desire, Major Anstruther, of Ningpo celebrity, was introduced to him : when in charge of the Che-keang pro- vince, this imperial commissioner had shewn much kindness to the gallant officer during his imprisonment. The mandarin, Chew, who had on many occasions diversified his unsavoury prison fare by piquant courses from his own table, was also present, and with great cordiality greeted his old friend, who had won his heart by presents of some of his admirable sketches. As the interview drew to a close, the band of the 18th regiment having finished a capital repast of mutton, beef, bread, vegetables, &c, with which the mandarins had regaled them in a gallery of the building, struck up our national anthem with startling emphasis. In an instant the outer hall was deserted ; the Chinese officers, high and low, red buttons and white, all rushed out of the joss-"], [555, ""], [556, "CHINESE SPEAEMAST"], [557, "447 EFFECTS OF MUSIC. house, and crowded round the musicians, listen ing to the air with pleased attention ; some even, whose place was near the august person of Eleepoo, slunk off towards the point of attrac tion, to share in the wonder which the novel sounds of civilized music excited in the gaping crowd. It was amusing to observe the serious interest with which some of the mandarins and soldiers inspected the piled muskets of the guard, and gazed upon the figures and accoutrements of the grenadiers. When the magnates of both nations issued from the hall into the open space, and were received by the guard of honour with pre sented arms and colours lowered, the band once more making the walls of Nanking re-echo the national air, the scene was exceedingly striking. Before quitting his distinguished entertainers, who accompanied him to the outer entrance, where again a salute of three guns was fired, Sir Henry Pottinger intimated his earnest desire to meet them again at as early a period as con venient, for the purpose of discussing with them in person matters connected with the pending treaty requiring explanation and careful and calm consideration. The commissioners readily"], [558, "448 MEETING APPOINTED. assented, and appointed the 26th for an inter view, within the walls of the city, pointing out, at the same time, the gate through which the plenipotentiary should pass. On the day of the meeting, a detachment of the Madras horse artillery escorted Sir Henry Pottinger, and some led horses were taken to the city gates for the use of his suite. They were received in the residence of a mandarin, in the heart of the city, in the most unostentatious manner, which seemed a good earnest of their peaceful intentions. There were but few of our people present, except those of his excellency's suite ; but it was remarked, with some surprise, that the meeting, although of such vital interest to the nation and its government, was not re garded as private or exclusive by the Chinese, who crowded into the apartment, and were suf fered to listen to all that passed, which they did with the most profound attention and eager interest. Among other important topics dis cussed, was the opium trade, upon which sub ject the plenipotentiary had prepared a paper for the information of the commissioners, displaying great knowledge of the subject, and pointing out that the only course remaining for the emperor's"], [559, "449 INTERIOR OF THE CITY. adoption was to permit the traffic by barter, under regulations so stringent, and at the same time so liberal, that the temptations to smuggling would be removed, and much of the profligacy produced by the contraband system be thereby obviated. The party who entered the city upon this occasion saw but little of its interior. They de- scribed the streets as narrow, and the houses, for the most part, mean ; but as all shops and dwellings were closely shut, and the streets blocked up by barrier gates and endless crowds of astonished lookers-on, the idea which they were enabled to form of the famed city was derived through means too imperfect to furnish a correct picture of its features and peculiari- ties. The beautiful Arab horses of the escort attracted great and undisguised admiration, and the troopers who remained outside in charge of them were overwhelmed with good treatment and civilities by the mandarins, who crowded about the horses, and examined them minutely with the utmost astonishment and delight. Sir Henry Pottinger subsequently proposed to the commissioners to forward to Peking, as a pre sent to the emperor, two teams of whites and G G"], [560, "450 THE TREATY SIGNED. greys, from the troop \u25a0 but whether from a fear of incurring suspicion of bribery in their public capacity, or from an idea that the horses would form but intractable members of the imperial household, the rare and valuable gift was re spectfully refused. On the 29th, the treaty of Nanking was signed on board the Cornwallis. . The commissioners came in plain attire, but attended by a numerous and gorgeous retinue, composed of the elite of the vice-regal court of Nanking and of the mili tary force of the province. Eleepoo appeared so infirm, that he was with difficulty led up the ladder to the quarter-deck of the seventy-four ; and he was supported by his attendants in a tottering state into the cabin, where the ceremony was performed. Copies of the treaty had been prepared in Chinese and English, and a royal salute was fired as the last received the needful authentication, the imperial flag flying the while at the main, and the British ensign at the mizen of all the ships of war. The health of the Queen of England (and, singularly enough, not that of the Emperor of China) was then drunk in cherry brandy, and the august party broke up. The day following Sir Henry Pottinger published, for"], [561, "451 ARTICLES OF THE TREATY. the information of the combined force, a sketch of the leading features of the treaty, with an assurance of his entire confidence in the sincerity of the imperial cabinet.

The village of Makur-Keow, in which the greater portion of the troops were quartered, was interesting, as it contained a number of houses, evidently the country residences of men"], [566, "454 CHINESE HOUSES. of opulence and rank, whose construction and furniture were perfectly new to the majority of us. The one occupied by Lord Saltoun, the staff, and the engineers, was on so extensive a scale, as to cover a space of 2500 square yards, exclusive of stables, and a spacious farm-yard, cow-house, granary, &c. ; while another, occu pied by the artillery, was still more extensive. The style in which these maisons de campagne are built is peculiar, but like every thing and usage adopted by the Chinese, it is admirably suited to the climate, under whose influences their habits are formed : every mansion is surrounded by a high wall without windows or openings, except the doors for entrance, and within this enclosure are open spaces or quadrangles, round which the public apartments and dormitories are built, opening into the area by lattice-doors, which in the hot weather are removed alto gether, and in winter are replaced by others having the upper half formed of split oyster shells to admit light, and exclude snow and rain. Excepting the roof and outer enclosing wall, the houses of the Chinese are made entirely of wood. Trellis-work covered with a delicate"], [567, "455 SKILL IN CARVING. gauze is used for partitions, and the com munications between the apartments are pro fusely ornamented with carving. In the house occupied by the artillery brigade, some of the richest and most tasteful specimens of this beautiful art adorned what had been the ladies' apartments : one group, the admiration of us all, forming a passage between two of the 'Mragrant\" apartments, (as the rooms of the women are called,) consisted of imitations, in a rich dark-coloured wood, of an avenue of young bamboos, their graceful branches entwining over head to form the arch, and their taper stems encircled by creepers, which clung to them in the most tasteful and picturesque manner con ceivable. The same skill in carving is displayed in the decorations of their beds, the frames of which are formed of heavy solid panels, richly inlaid and bordered by fine fret-work of vine or lotus leaves, curiously distributed ; they appear, indeed, to bestow more care upon the ornaments of this article of furniture than upon all the other decorations of their dwellings, fitting them up with rich hangings and fringes, and suspend ing from all projections in their frames large bullion silk tassels of the most gorgeous hues."], [568, "456 SILK MERCHANTS. It may easily be conceived, as the troops had little to do while quartered before Nanking, and as their mischievous and marauding propensities were confined by the provost-guard to the limits of the walls within which their particular billet lay, that the mansions appropriated by the ad vance-brigade were thoroughly ransacked before they came again into the peaceful possession of their owners. So rapid had been Lord Saltoun's advance towards the walls, that the inhabitants of Makur- Keow, when first apprised of the close proximity of their invaders, by the appearance of the dark uniforms of the rifles among their out-buildings, had only time to close their doors and make their escape towards the city by back-ways, car rying with them, of course, very little of their moveable property, and leaving their clothes, furniture, and valuables, to the rapacity of the in vaders, and of their own more desperate country men. The majority of the proprietors of these large houses appeared to be silk merchants or manufacturers, as many looms, some in employ ment and with the web in progress, as also a considerable quantity of raw silk, were found in the out-offices. Those who know the usual"], [569, "457 THE PORCELAIN TOWER. value of this costly production, will be shocked to learn that hanks of it were twisted together by the men, and used as swabs to dry the floors of the barrack-rooms. Large stores of coal were found in most of the principal houses, piled in the English manner, its use being evidently con fined to the kitchen. Under these circumstances of idleness and ennui, the Porcelain Tower became, as may be supposed, the great point of attraction to the whole force : its approach from the camp lay through a remarkably picturesque and interest ing country, winding along by the curious paved road leading to the Taiping gate, and branching off, about a mile from that point, towards Chin keang-foo, until it came close under the walls, near a remarkable orillon flank, which seemed to have been constructed to cover a curtain, at whose foot some broken ground offered many accessible points for escalade. Near this flank, and close to the Taiping gate, we found a salient angle of the ramparts, which could have been mined with ease and security, as no fire, except from a piece in the embrasure imme diately over the angle, could have injured the party working below."], [570, "458 CHINESE TOMB. From the orillon the road runs parallel with the walls of the Tartar city until it reaches a rising ground opposite the principal gate, where is situated a magnificent Chinese tomb, repre senting the raised cenotaph usually seen in their burial places ; the style of architecture is mas sive and striking : it is situated at the extremity of a fine broad road, enclosed between the ram parts, which is paved with large smooth slabs of a dark-coloured limestone, of which material the building itself is constructed.

The cenotaph, as far as we could ascertain, was a solid mass of marble, no opening being visible save at the foot of the building, where a spacious tunnel commenced, passing through to the opposite side, at a high angle leading to flights"], [571, ""], [572, "MONUMENT NEAR NANKING, SUPPOSED TO BE THE TOMB OF THE MING8."], [573, "459 MARBLE MONSTERS. of steps, by which the summit was gained ; the whole edifice, and the paved arena and ramparts adjoining, bore evidences of great antiquity, and appeared so entirely out of keeping with the Chinese buildings at the entrance of the main inclosure, that we all concluded they had been the work of an era far more remote than any to which the known history of China refers. The country around is covered with fine rich grass, and along this, in the direction of the principal gate of the Tartar city, we were much interested by a most singular avenue of quadru peds and monsters of all known and unknown descriptions, carved in a rude style out of solid blocks of marble, of such enormous size as to fill us with wonder regarding the means by which they had been moved from their native quarries. This strange collection comprised gigantic horses, elephants, zebras, camels, lions, &c, all in a fair state of preservation, the figures of which were disposed after the manner of the celebrated alley of the sphinxes at Luxor; and from the long rank grass which buried many of them to half their height, the sunken state of others, and the presence of large masses of marble in the vicinity, which had evidently formed por-"], [574, "460 HALL OF ANCESTORS. tions of former buildings, we judged that the whole must, at some remote period, have com posed a magnificent temple, in honour, perhaps, of their gods, or of some renowned and ancient dynasty.

It was quite empty when our party took possession of it for the night, save a few drums and images, and in the centre a raised and inclosed sort of altar, on which was a shrine and image of the Queen of Heaven, but which, being the only boarded place in the hall on which our carpets could be laid to protect us from the chill of the pavement, was speedily appropriated for the more mundane pur pose of a dormitory for a dozen tired wonder seekers.

The 29th August, therefore, had no sooner passed than large parties were made up to penetrate to the famed pagoda, the pride of the land of porcelain, renowned for so many generations in Chinese history. The Chin-keang-foo ponies were put in almost hourly requisition, and fortunate was the man who could make interest with the officers of ar tillery, who had charge of those brought up the river to drag the guns, to obtain a \" mount\" upon the memorable occasion of a visit to the tower of Nanking.

The gates were open when we first came in sight, but no sooner was the ap proach of the \"army\" descried from the ram parts, than the people who had been lingering along the causeway by which we advanced were seen to hurry forward through the portal, the great doors were shut, and the bastion above was in an instant bristling with soldiers. \"We rode up to the gateway, to show them that we were bent on no hostile errand, and made use of all the signs and speeches of amity that wre could recall to mind, but our new friends surveyed us with but little demonstration of a desire to recipro cate our amiable sentiments, and two or three malignant scowls, from fair moustached Tartar faces, which filled an embrasure above our heads, induced us to believe that the commissioners had had reason on their side, when they recom mended to the plenipotentiary to direct his people to avoid the gates, and make no attempt to enter the city, lest some of the Tartar garrison, who had lost friends or relatives at the dread"], [583, "467 SURLINESS OVERCOME. storming of Chin-keang-foo, might be excited by the presence of their destroyers to commit some deed of vengeance and violence. We over came their surliness, however, sufficiently to induce them to throw us down a piece of burn ing match to light our cigars, and then, leaving them our blessing, we followed the track along the ditch of the city, which appeared to lead in the direction of the tower. Passing along under the walls of the Tartar quarter, we observed that the most active prepa rations had recently been in progress, even as we had suspected, up to the hour of our arrival, to resist the attack of a besieging force, and from the way in which they had cut away the earth wherever an undulation in the surface reduced the height of the walls by a few feet, it was evident that the escalade lesson at Chin-keang foo had not been lost upon them, though the ge neral who survived that day, in his report to the emperor of the loss of the city, described the \" barbarians\" as coming over the walls upon long sticks, in a manner which could not be under stood, and which it was not possible to with stand. The appearance of the ramparts from the path, which we followed through fields and h h2"], [584, "468 THE RAMPARTS. plantations, at about half a mile distance, was strikingly picturesque ; their great height and venerable hue, and the abrupt manner in which their lines projected, forming a feature of great beauty in the interesting landscape before us. The garrison had evidently expected our attack at the very point where it would have been made ; for we observed that the parapets along the whole line of the Tartar rampart had been repaired and strengthened with sand bags and earth, and that the buildings in the immediate neighbourhood which could have afforded cover to an assaulting column, had been pulled down. Yet at the Taiping gate, the most vulnerable point of their line, huts and trees had been suffered to remain, in numbers sufficient to screen a couple of companies of riflemen ; so that it would appear that the Chinese cities, when menaced by an enemy, are left to the ingenuity of particular officers, whose genius can only be brought into play upon the defences of certain portions intrusted to each, while the adjoining parts may be neglected and exposed, through the ignorance of the chief to whose charge they may happen to have been confided. But so extensive a rampart as that of Nanking,"], [585, "469 A STONE BRIDGE. nearly twenty-two miles in circuit, could scarcely by any means be rendered inaccessible. The road at length brought us to the bank of a fine broad canal, which washed the Tartar ram parts, and appeared to throw out several large branches into the extensive suburb. We crossed this by a bridge of four arches, not made of flat slabs of granite, like almost all the bridges in the south, but well turned in cut-stone, in a style equal to the bridge across the Grand Canal at Chin-keang-foo. After passing the bridge, a wide sheet of water spread out from the ramparts to a considerable distance to the eastward, and here, for the first time, we saw the Chinese truly \" in their habit as they live;\" the surface of the water was dotted in all directions with passage-boats, crowded with people proceeding to and from the country; with flower-boats, from which the sounds of that most extraordinary of all con trivances, a Chinese band of music, informed us of the noon-day revelry of their tenants, and with cargo-boats and junks of all sizes and de nominations, except the war-junk, for of this class no vessel of any kind was ever seen in the Yang-tse-Kiang, except the miserable attempt at"], [586, "470 LIFE IN CHINA. a paddle-boat found at Woosung. At the landing place for passengers by the ferry-boats, situated at the end of the main street of the suburb, we found life in China exhibited in all its originality and drollery. Strings of donkeys, to be hired for a few copper coins, crowded the street in one direction; wheelbarrows, of an extraordinary but useful build, plied for fares in another ; itinerant barbers, with their small shaving apparatus on a stand, importuned for customers among the stools ranged along the sides of the street ; while venders of confectionaries, prints, and chattels of all kinds, hawked their goods about and jostled each other in the roughest style of a busy English town, but at the same time with a degree of good humour and fun which would make our countrymen losers by the comparison. The appearance of our party attracted a con course of wondering spectators, but although they lined the street and narrowed the space through which we had to pass, incommoding us in our progress, not the least attempt was made to molest or annoy us in any way. The terror of the women at our appearance was the most ludicrous sight ; for if a stray fair one chanced to emerge from a by-street or shop as we were"], [587, "TERROR CAUSED BY THE PARTY. 471 passing, she would turn and fly down the street as if we had personated the powers of darkness ; and even the men, when they came upon us in the same sudden way, showed by the aghast expression of their faces that we presented to the Chinese a spectacle quite as wonderful as any which we sought amongst them. Emerging from the suburb, the road led us again into the open country, which is laid out in pleasure-grounds and patches of cultivation, sur rounding detached houses, and we saw in the distance several considerable villages, and many striking pagodas and minarets on the summits of the low hills which shut in the view in the direction of the Porcelain Tower, which was at last discovered by our impatient party, rearing its elegant head high above the surrounding joss-houses and buildings. We passed several large country houses on our way, like those of which we had become \" tenants-at-will\" at Ma kur-Keow, but the doors were all fastened, and the proprietors, if they still trusted themselves outside the ramparts of the city, gave no token of their presence. The road now lay parallel to the lofty southern wall of the city, and after traversing another"], [588, "472 ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER OF narrow bustling street, a short turn to the left brought us into a large inclosure flanked by a handsome edifice, into which access was gained by several large flights of steps. Here we dismounted, and ascending the plat form, passed through the building, and stood at last under the Porcelain Tower of Nanking. So many different conceptions have been formed of its style and architectural character, that the impression, created by a first view, in the minds of the spectators, must have varied according to the anticipations which each had conjured up ; hence descriptions of its beauties by different narrators scarcely agree in more than one point \u2014 that the tower, in all respects, in position, form, material, and decoration, is essentially Chi nese, forming a monument so truly typical of the style of architecture which has so long dis tinguished them from all other nations, as to be well worthy of the high consideration in which it is held by the natives, and of the place assigned to it in the annals of this portion of the globe. Disappointed as I had been with many sights and scenes in China, whose beauty and rarity had been dwelt ujjon in such glowing terms by former travellers, here I felt that my most vivid and"], [589, "473 THE PORCELAIN TOWER. highly-wrought imaginings were far transcended by the superb reality. The tower stands in the centre of an elevated quadrangle, whose inclosing Avails are formed by the front elevations of seve ral large temples and halls, raised upon a base ment story, representing its pedestal, from which it rises to the height of nearly 200 feet, in nine elegantly and justly proportioned stories, con structed in an octagonal form. The principal material is porcelain ; for, although it is only used to make an outer casing and an inner lining to the walls, it still forms the chief constituent of the fabric, and is the only substance which meets the eye. The central mass of the walls is common clay bricks, set in mortar ; the por celain, in the form of a plinth of pure white, glazed on the outer surface, and of the regular standard dimensions, but with a deep key or shoulder cast on its edge, to maintain its hold in the wall, is built in on the outer and inner faces of the edifice, so as to form an entire casing, and to exclude from view the inferior material. On the platform of each story, there are four doors, corresponding with the alternate octagonal faces, opening upon a terrace, which runs round the tower, bordered by an elegant balustrade of"], [590, "474 DECORATIONS OF THE TOWER : green porcelain, fancifully diversified with figures of different hues, and paved with flat square tiles. The doorways are set in a frame of glazed tiles, brown, red, green, and yellow, according to the figures or plants represented ; and although, per haps, grotesque and striking, rather than tasteful or pleasing, on a close inspection, they contri bute much to the beauty of the tout ensemble. Overhead, the doorways are finished by a gothic arch of moulded tiles, set in large masses, each weighing thirty pounds and upwards ; and a short roof of the same material, brilliantly glazed and coloured yellow, projects over the summit of each story, terminating at the angles with that peculiar upward curve, which characterizes the roofing of all Chinese edifices, and having on their extreme points a bell of about eight inches in height, and six in diameter, suspended by a twisted wire. On each of the eight faces there is also a lantern suspended, made of thin lamin\u00e6 of oyster-shell, set in a light wooden frame, which, according to our informants, is illumi nated on gala occasions by the priests who have charge of the pagoda, producing an effect which we could well imagine must be most brilliant and extraordinary. On the highest story of all,"], [591, "475 ITS STABILITY AND ANTIQUITY. is placed a lofty cowl or pyramidal structure of tiles and wood-work, terminating in a richly gilt pine-apple, which has been pronounced by many writers, deceived by its beauty, to be solid gold. Long chains of brass, ornamented with nume rous balls, descend from this crowning decora tion down to the roof, passing through a number of concentric rings of metal, which are carried round and round the apex of the pagoda in a singularly fantastic manner. The building is strengthened by a gigantic spar or tree, which passes, as far as we could ascertain, down a con siderable portion of the centre, in one entire piece, receiving, in a mortise at the foot of each of the nine stories, a set of stout radiating frames, which support the floor and staircase, and add strength to the adjacent walls. The wood-work has the appearance of great age, but no material decay or failing is visible in any part of it, nor in the body of the work itself, although, from the lines of new cement here and there in the outer and inner facings of both porcelain and brick and glazed tiles, we were led to suppose that repairs are continually going on. The view from the summit was extensive and interesting in the extreme, commanding the"], [592, "476 VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT. whole circuit of the walls of Nanking, from the Lion Hill, at the water's edge, abreast of which the Cornwallis and Blonde were anchored, to the south gate, opposite to which, at about 300 yards' distance, on the suburb side of the ditch, the celebrated tower is situated. The appearance of the city, however, was somewhat disappointing, \u2014 fully four-fifths of the space inclosed by the ramparts revealing to us only a tract of cultivated land, instead of the teeming mass of buildings which we had been led to expect. The principal quarter of the town, that at least which contains the greatest number of houses, is the south-wrestern, contiguous to the gate facing the Porcelain Towrer, and from this point it extends in streets and scattered groups of buildings towards the Tartar city and Lion Hill. To judge by the number of tents along the walls, and encampments in various parts of the city, the numerical strength of the garrison must have been very great ; but, from former expe rience and knowledge of the ruse to which the Chinese often resort, that of erecting empty tents, and lines of sham batteries and intrench ments of mats, in commanding positions, we set"], [593, "477 HANDSOME EDIFICES. down fully one-half of the canvas barracks which met our view, as of the buckram-suit class. One or two handsome edifices were discerned in the middle of the city, especially one, the roof of which, covered with imperial yellow tiles, ap peared perfectly enormous, extending in length, as far as we could judge, more than 300 yards, with a span fully fifty. It was raised upon a high platform, ascended by long flights of steps, and surrounded by a broad canal, over which several considerable bridges were thrown ; and, from the wide space left clear of buildings all round it, we concluded that it was the imperial palace, or principal edifice of the ancient capital. Except barracks, few public buildings could be seen in the Tartar city, save in the inner fort a walled inclosure, wherein several ancient look ing buildings, probably the relics of the palaces of the Ming emperors, appeared to be preserved as residences for high officers. The total stillness was painfully striking, as we looked down over the wide expanse of dingy roofs and narrow streets and canals of the vast city. Not a sound arose from its closely crowded houses ; and from the absence of the busy hum, which we had naturally expected to hear from its po-"], [594, "478 DESCENT FROM THE TOWER. pulous thoroughfares, one might have supposed that its only living tenants were the soldiers who had scowled upon us from the walls, and the ponies which we saw in droves careering along its grassy plains. It seems probable, indeed, that a great majority of the inhabitants had quitted their abodes for a more secure retreat in the interior of the province, before our arrival under the walls, warned by the fate of Chin keang-foo, that the courage of their Tartar de fenders and the strength of their most esteemed fortresses could no longer avert the destruction which menaced them. After sating ourselves with gazing at the splendid panorama, of whose beauty I have not the power to convey anything like an adequate idea, we descended the tower, and making our way with difficulty through the dense mass of people who crowded the wide arena, and blocked up every avenue by which it was approached, we got into the main street of the suburb, and walked up to the gates, which we found fast closed. As we wandered about its streets and lanes, which were of a very poor and mean de scription, we were struck with the free and easy, and at the same time happy readiness with which"], [595, ""], [596, "l-O-ECELAIN TOWER, NANKING-"], [597, "479 MEMENTOES OF THE VISIT. the Chinese adapt themselves to the circum stances of the hour, and lose, in the engrossing cares of their own busy life, all interest and curiosity about the novelties which chance may obtrude upon its even course. After they had stared at us for an hour, as we stood in the most favourable position for exhibi tion on the balconies of the Porcelain Tower, and had ascertained that we bore no resemblance to the horrible images with which the name of the \" barbarians\" had been associated in their minds, the inhabitants of the suburb returned at once to their peaceful occupations, and where, a few hours before, we had found only a deserted street, with shops half or wholly closed, we now beheld life and activity in every rood of its length, its pavement crowded with bustling artisans and traders, and its workshops resounding with the clatter and hum of industry and business. We made many zealous efforts to pick up mementoes of our visit to the memorable tower, but beyond a few tea-pots, of a very common description, of brown-coloured earthenware, and some fans, we met with but little success, all articles of any value having been removed from the shops to some more secure retreat. In the neighbour-"], [598, "480 \" ABBOT OF THE MONASTERY.\" hood of the tower, however, our party was more successful ; many invaluable specimens of its materials were obtained, \u2014 some, I blush to record, extracted from the sacred fane itself, and some purchased, on quitting it, from the priests in the lower story. About eight or ten days after the first visit to the tower, when the majority of the sight-seers of the expedition had completed the pilgrimage to its shrine, the \" Abbot of the Monastery\" (as we had styled him) came on board the Queen, to make a representation to the plenipo tentiary, that ruthless men, armed with mattock and crow, were destroying the pagoda, and not satisfied with the small specimens which the earlier visitors had brought away, were carrying off boat-loads of tiles, so that the greater part of the upper story had already disappeared. Vexed that such an outrage should have been perpetrated, especially at a time when the ut most forbearance should have been exercised towards the people we had humbled, and with reference to a monument so valued by them, Sir Henry Pottinger, yielding to the impulse of the moment, wrote an angry letter to the two commanders-in-chief, calling upon them to exert"], [599, "481 RESTRICTIONS. their authority to put a stop to proceedings so much at variance with the character which the British forces should by every means have striven to establish. In consequence of this, the Vixen steamer, which lay at anchor in the mouth of the creek, by which the south-western angle of the city was approached from the river, received strict orders to allow no boats whatever to pass which did not bear a permit, signed by the admiral, which orders were so rigidly obeyed, that on several occasions parties of officers were turned back who had provided themselves with passes from the general only, and these then made a detour by land round the city, through Lord Saltoun's village, a journey of fully fifteen miles, returning by the creek in some Chinese boats. The writer did not again visit the tower, but he was told by others who inspected it a few days after the publication of Sir Henry's letter, that the extent of the damage done to the upper story was by no means so great as had been described by the \" abbot,\" and that it ad mitted at all events of easy and speedy repair. It is an undeniable fact, that on our first visit to i i"], [600, "482 DAMAGING THE TOWER. the tower, the bonzes, or priests, soothed by the dollars which were pressed into their not unwil ling hands, viewed with complacency the small chippings (then made only in obscure places, such as behind the staircase leading from story to story) which were carried on inside the build ing, while they openly dealt in pictures of the edifice, and in specimens of the yellow and red glazed tiles used in its construction ; and it is therefore fair to suppose, that when they found the amount of largesse diminish, after the visits of the richer portion of the foreigners, to an amount which made it no longer worth their while to run the risk of odium among their own people, for having connived at the \"desecra tion,\" they came forward with their complaint in so public a manner, solely with a view to screen their conduct from the Nanking authorities. A short time before the force broke up from before Nanking, the commander-in-chief strongly animadverted in general orders on \" the desecra tion of the Porcelain Pagoda by some person or persons unknown.\" Our guest, Captain C , of the French frigate, of whom mention has been already made, had directed his pinnace to await orders"], [601, "483 RETURN TO THE CAMP. at the landing-place near the tower, and several of us joined the agreeable Frenchman, giving up our ponies to others of the party, but before it broke up we assembled round a board, spread in an adjoining building, and partook of a repast, served a la minute by our Indian attendants, in a manner which can only be understood by those who have witnessed the skill of these people in furnishing dishes out of the most scanty ma terials. The voyage down the creek was exceedingly interesting, as it completed an entire circuit of the city w^alls, and displayed some very pic turesque scenery. The stream passes close to the ramparts the whole way, and the water is deep throughout, having three stone bridges of five and four well turned arches, admitting the passage of the largest ships' boats. The walls bore marks of recent repair all along the line by which we passed, and one gateway, un favourably situated for defence, had been built up with masonry evidently within a few weeks.

Before the official announcement of the overtures for peace, we had been obliged to resort to foraging parties, on account of the scarcity of fresh pro visions : we were thus led to explore the country between Nanking and Chin-keang-foo, which are twenty-eight miles apart, and found that, for a very considerable distance, there was a good paved-road, \u2014 running from Nanking due east, \u2014 which was perfectly practicable for guns and military carriages. At a distance, of about five or six miles from the Taiping gate, we dis covered the commencement of the clay-slate, a regular killas, splintery and much altered at the spot by contact with a dyke of hornstone, which formed the backbone of a neighbouring ridge, but readily recognised at a short distance beyond. The scenery was generally very beau tiful, and our exertions to procure provender were usually crowned with success.

This unfortunate regiment had suf fered much on their voyage from England in the Belleisle, (an old seventy-four, converted into a troop ship,) from the heat and confinement of the orlop deck, as they mustered 720, with sixty artillerymen, stores, guns, arms, provisions, &c. and 100 women and children. The latter were left at Hong-Kong when the expedition pro ceeded to the north ; but the spectacle presented on board the Belleisle, in the Yang-tse-Kiang, was one of great misery, and it seems a great price to pay for the convenience of transporting so large a body of men in a single bottom. The guns and 98th regiment were moved off first, and having, been got safely away, the re mainder of the infantry were marched down to the landing-place on the bank of the creek, but the iron steamers were not in readiness for our embarkation, and much confusion ensued. We were obliged to bivouac for the night on the sides of the road, leaving the baggage in the"], [607, "\"THE EMPEROR'S PRESERVE.\" 487 centre, and on the following morning the steamers made their appearance, and the entire brigade was embarked before dusk. The Belleisle, in tow of a steamer, was imme diately sent down the river, in order to remove her unfortunate occupants as fast as possible from the baneful influence of the temperature ; but the greater number of the transports did not quit the anchorage for several days after the re embarkation, and the Chinese took advantage of our detention to bring alongside the vessels boat loads of rubbish, such as old blue jars and tea pots, for sale as curiosities, it must be confessed with great success. A few excursions were made to the oppo site bank of the river in search of game, at a place called \" The Emperor's Preserve,\" which is a space inclosed by a fortified wall, to the water's edge, giving the idea of an ancient point of defence to the passage of the river, but a few quails and magpies were all that rewarded our efforts ; the ramble, however, was interesting and agreeable.

At length, however, we all got into Chusan harbour, without greater damage than loss of jib-booms, running rigging by getting foul of each other, and of anchors, cables, and hawsers, by getting aground. On our way down the river, we anchored off Chin-keang-foo for a couple of days, and paid a visit to the scene of the exploits of the 21st July. A small Tartar garrison had been put into the city, to restore something like order amidst the hideous mass of crumbling ruins which we had left it, and of which we found that General Schoedde's brigade, in occupation of the heights, had taken no notice, further than by occasionally marching a company through the breach to make the circuit of the ramparts. The desolate appearance of this unfortunate city was painfully striking.

The hungry dogs, too, had been disturbing the graves of the slain, and dragging forth the corpses, which now presented objects too revolting for description. In other places, outside the walls, where Chinese soldiers had been buried, we found that the natives them selves had performed the loathsome office of exhumation, removing the bodies in coffins into the interior, of course without molestation from our people, one of whom told us that it was difficult to conceive how those whom they de lighted to honour could be distinguished from the humble matchlock-men, as decomposition had proceeded so far that the corpses were re moved piecemeal. Returning from our ramble, a friend, who had been with the occupying force, led us a short detour into the country, to see some exceedingly curious monuments which stood on a gently rising ground by the side of a village road, and which had either been recently erected or reno vated since the destroying visit of the British force : their form was very peculiar and pictu resque, without much elegance. They were com-"], [610, "490 A CAST-IRON PAGODA. posed of two high shafts of stone, placed like the jambs of a tall door, and united at the top by a cross piece, into which was let a small slab of a most beautiful cerulean blue, in the field of which was an inscription in letters inlaid with gold. Several grotesque ornaments in stone were appended to the bases and capitals of the pillars supporting this entablature, and nume rous other slabs were introduced between them in a manner difficult to describe. On the heights east of the town is a venerable old joss-house, built in a style differing a good deal from that which is observed in their more modern temples. It has long, monastic-looking corridors or cloisters, and contains a number of monuments and ancient relics, well worthy of inspection. Among these was a pagoda of nine stories, formed of cast iron, a miniature, of course, of one of the regular religious edifices, but not by any means a small one, having a height of about twenty-five feet, and a girth of sixteen to eighteen feet at the base. It had been cast in segments, like the column in the Place Vendome, each forming a story of the building, the figure being octagonal, with well-turned gothic-looking arches on each face.

This tower may be accounted one of the many proofs seen, during the progress of the expedition, of the very early knowledge which the Chinese possessed of the art of casting iron. There had been an intention of sending this iron pagoda to England as a trophy, and a scaffolding of strong spars had actually been commenced for its removal, but the peace put a stop to the proceeding, and also prevented the dismemberment of the library on Golden Island, \u2014 a prize which was intended for the recesses of the British Museum.

About the time of the entrance of the Yang tse-Kiang by the expedition, a number of Ca tholic missionaries took advantage of the general confusion, and of the temporary dispersal of the mandarins, to follow in our wake, and effect a landing on the banks of the river, for the purpose of penetrating, in the disguise of Chinese, (being accompanied and directed by native converts, brought up in the institution of the Propaganda,) into the heart of the em pire, to carry out those projects, and fulfil those sacred vows, upon which their lives are so devotedly staked, and so often sacrificed. On the 12th and 14th October, the fleet of transports got under weigh, in two divisions, and proceeded with the commander-in-chief to Hong-Kong, the admiral remaining with the Cornwallis and a squadron of men-of-war and steamers, after having dispatched the Blonde, Herald, Modeste, and Columbine to England with the six millions of dollars which had been paid in the Yang-tse-Kiang.

The whole of the captives had been butchered, except about six Europeans and three natives of India, who were reserved for a fate still more cruel.

The plenipotentiary acquainted them, in this address, that, for the barbarous outrage at For mosa, he had demanded from the emperor the fullest and most ample satisfaction which it was yet in his power to render ; requiring that the authors of the base and false statement, through which his imperial majesty had been induced to sanction the execution of the helpless victims of the Nerbudda and the Anne, should be forthwith \"condignly punished,\" their lands and personal property confiscated, and the proceeds made over to the British government, for the use of the families of the unhappy men who had fallen."], [623, "SATISFACTION DEMANDED. 499 With all this concession, his excellency added, he was not prepared to say that the result, to which the deplorable event tended, might not be far more serious than was at present contem plated, extending even to a renewal of those hostilities which had recently been brought to so auspicious and welcome a conclusion ; for the circumstances of the case bore the stamp of atrocity and barbarity, in a form so repugnant to the feelings of a civilized people, that it was im possible to predict the consequences which might follow the announcement in Great Britain of the horrid event, whose record had so disgraced the annals of the Chinese empire. The tale of the Formosa massacre had been related to the plenipotentiary at Amoy, by the survivors, who had been sent over to the British squadron lying there in October, after intelligence of the treaty of Nanking had been authentically communicated from Peking. Extracts from the journals of Captain Den ham, of the Anne, appeared afterwards in the Macao newspapers, and as they embraced all the events of his dreary captivity, they may be here briefly narrated, as they were described by one of his crew, a Swede, whose escape in For- K k 2"], [624, "500 NARRATIVE OF A PRISONER. mosa from the very jaws of death was all but miraculous. This man had been seized with the rest of the crew of the Anne, and carried to the capital of the island, where they were all thrust into the same prison, in which, to their surprise, they found nearly 300 natives of India, the surviving lascars and passengers of the Nerbudda, con fined in cells, containing from fifteen to thirty each. There they were subjected to the most rigorous and cruel treatment, supplied with no covering to protect them from the cold, in lieu of their own clothes, which had been stripped from their backs wffien they were seized, except some common Chinese dungaree jackets and trowsers, often beaten severely with the bamboo, and for their daily subsistence allowed only a small string of copper coins, of which a thou sand equal a dollar only, with which they had to purchase their wretched food, from venders of rice and vegetables, who were suffered to enter the prison yard once a day for the purpose.

Captain Denham, himself, was more than once severely bambooed, upon the occasion of an absurd and groundless suspicion that he was plotting an escape from prison ; this cruel punishment was inflicted with such barbarity that fragments of flesh were cut away from his thighs at every blow of the bamboo. The miserable Indians of the Nerbudda, upon whom the severity of the winter fell with the most cruel effect, from their being entirely unaccustomed to a cold climate, against which they had not even a warm gar ment to protect their attenuated frames, suffered most awfully, and many of course sank beneath the accumulation of hardships heaped upon them. It was the fortune of war that they should so perish, and it is unavailing now to de plore the miserable fate which befel nearly every one of them, but it will appear a peculiarly hard and cruel one, when it is remembered that these unfortunates had been brought out from their"], [626, "502 PRISONERS LABELLED. native country, not as regularly enlisted fighting men, bound to obey the call of duty, whither soever the summons bade them hasten, but poor washers, sweepers, hospital-assistants, and palanquin-bearers, tempted by the high wages offered them, and induced to accept the propo sals of their government, through their ignorance of the climate and peculiarities of the country they were to serve in, and through their un bounded confidence in the ability and inclination of their employers to protect them against all mis fortune and oppression within human control. The narrative of the Swede proceeded to say that things went on in the same weary way, di versified occasionally by visits from mandarins, and by examinations, through a linguist, of the European and principal Indian prisoners, until, as well as he could reckon, about the 10th or 12th August, when one morning, at the hour for the distribution of their daily pittance, the gaoler entered their cells, accompanied by two or three police soldiers, bearing a bundle of small paper labels, on which was inscribed a word in the Chinese character, and proceeded, after issuing the copper coins, to paste one of them upon each man's dress ; they then left the cells, and shortly afterwards the prisoners were let out"], [627, "503 DRAUGHT OF SAMSHOO. into the court-yard, to purchase food for the day. The Swede, having had his suspicions ex cited by the novel ordeal of the tickets, des cried, in a distant part of the yard, a long line of bamboo chairs, with carrying poles, ranged along the wall, and near them a number of sol diers and coolies. His mind misgave him, he says, when he saw this, and, impressed with a vague presentiment of impending calamity, he fortified himself against its shock upon the Dutch principle, and accordingly spent the whole of his day's allowance upon a large dram of samshoo, which he drank off at a draught. After their morning meal was finished, a party of soldiers, entering their cells with the gaoler, led them forth in detachments, and seated them on the chairs, after apparently ascertaining that the designation on the label upon each dress cor responded with a similar ticket attached to the chairs. The whole of the captives of the Ner budda and Anne were thus disposed of, except Captain Denham, Mr. Rolfe, the chief mate of the latter vessel, and four seamen and one lascar, with the lerang and tindal* of the Nerbudda, who were locked up in a separate cell, while * The lerang is a sort of boatswain among a lascar crew, and the tindal is next to him in authority;"], [628, "504 PROCESSION TO EXECUTION. their hapless companions, after being marshalled by their guards in the order of a procession, were raised in their chairs upon the shoulders of the coolies, and carried through the gates of the town into the open country, attended by a strong posse of soldiers, with executioners and others, bearing placards and instruments of punishment. After proceeding a distance of two or three miles, they came in sight of a place inclosed and sur rounded by a vast concourse of Chinese, from the midst of which the clangour of drums and gongs announced that the meeting had for its object some grand ceremonial. But little time, however, was given for speculation upon the fate which awaited them, for the chairs having been set down in a row outside the mob of spectators, the three or four who came first in the line were taken from their seats, their wrists, which had been bound together before them, set free, to enable the executioners to pinion their victims by the shoulders behind their backs, and in this condition they were hurried through the gazing and excited multitude, which with loud shouts opened to give them passage into the arena be yond, where the closing ranks of the mob shut them out from the anxious gaze of their com-"], [629, "505 HORRID BUTCHERY. rades outside. After a short delay, the guards issued again from the inclosure, and bore away another party of captives, and it soon became evident, from the gonging which was set up on the appearance of every fresh band of victims, from the excited gestures of the spectators, and from the blood-bespattered garments of the sol diers who escorted them, that a scene of ruthless slaughter was enacting in the midst of the con course of savages, whose shouts of exultation and mockery struck terror and dismay into the hearts of the wretched survivors. Section by section they gradually disappeared, until, out of the whole 300, the Swede with three natives of India alone remained ; and when at length the guards returned for these, the Swede abandoned all hope, and resigned himself to his fate. The soldiers untied their cords, and then commenced trussing them for their horrid butchery, but the poor Indians, who had witnessed in agony the abduction of their fated comrades to the dread inclosure, whence none had returned, resisted the efforts of the executioners in the most strenuous manner, throwing themselves upon the ground, and filling the air with their lamentations and cries for mercy. The Swede, on seeing this, spoke to"], [630, "506 DESPERATE ATTEMPT. them in their own language, and exhorted them to submit to the will of their murderers, pointing out to them that the probable consequence of their resistance would be that they would be hacked to pieces instead of \" dying genteelly,\" as he expressed it ; and approaching them, with the consent of his guards, he managed, partly by persuasion and partly by force, to get them bound : at that moment he himself stood unfet tered, and the thought flashed across his mind that the opportunity was propitious for making one desperate effort for life. It appears that the man possessed considerable skill as a tumbler, and labouring still under the excitement of the samshoo, and of the desperate circumstances in which he stood, he burst from the soldiers, bounded through the throng of spec tators, and stood in the inclosure a free man. A hasty glance showed him that at one end, upon an elevated platform, there was seated a great mandarin, who had evidently been presiding over the scene of blood ; he accordingly ran towards him, and throwing a summerset upon his hands, alighted at the footstool of the chief, and stood upon his head before him. He then prostrated himself at his feet, and uttered loudly all the"], [631, "507 ESCAPE FROM DEATH. honorific and laudatory Chinese words which he could call to mind, and by signs and exclama tions exhorted the mandarin to spare him. What happened after this he but indistinctly remem bered, but the result of his singular feat was, that the mandarin, whether sated by the blood on which he had gorged his senses during the long hours of this horrible massacre, or struck with compassion for the Swede, ordered him to be removed from the inclosure, and when the man recovered the use of his understanding again, he found himself once more alone in his cell. The intention of the Formosa authorities, it was supposed, had been to send the captives re served from execution over to the main-land, either for public exhibition at Hang-chow-foo or at Peking, or else to subject them to a more ignominious or lingering death by torture ; their gaolers indeed gave them to understand that it was with this object their lives had been spared ; and upon being asked why Mr. Gully had not been set apart in the same manner, they an swered by repeated questions about his rank and position in his own country, and showed an anxiety to be assured that he was the son of a great mandarin."], [632, "508 THE SWEDE AND HIS COMPANIONS.

They did not, however, reach that port for some time, as the junk took them, in the first place, to a desolate island in the Strait of Formosa, where they remained several weeks, owing, as it seemed, to the dread the Chinese sailors had of venturing in the presence of the British squadron, and when at length they made their appearance on board the frigate commanded by Captain Chads, they were in a state of such misery and destitution, as to excite the compas sion of all who beheld them, and to arouse their indignation against the merciless tyrants under whose cruel yoke they had suffered such an ac cumulation of ills. It may be conceived how intense was the feeling excited amongst the force and the British community generally, by the re cital of this sad history ; indeed, we could not avoid a regret, however unavailing, that a por-"], [633, "509 AN IMPERIAL EDICT. tion of the force had not been directed to touch at Formosa, on its way to the north in June and July, and obtain the release of the captives by force. It was generally believed that this in human massacre had been sanctioned by the cabinet of Peking, under feelings of revenge and animosity which the accounts of the slaughter of the Tartars at Chapoo had excited among the chiefs of their proud and vindictive race, aided by the assurances of the viceroy of Formosa, Takungah, a Tartar general, that the captives had been taken in a hostile attempt against the island. On receiving the startling and vehement ad dress of Sir Henry Pottinger on this gloomy sub ject, the emperor at once issued an edict, com manding Eliang, the governor-general of the Fokien and Che-Keang provinces, to cross im mediately over to Formosa, to make secret in quiries for the purpose of ascertaining whether the foreigners who had been put to death by Takungah were really \" people in distress,\" of which the edict stated there could be no doubt that proof would be elicited during the investi gation ; and if this should be established, that the great emperor, to show the entire impar-"], [634, "510 COMMUNICATION FROM ELEEPOO. tiality and justice with which he conducted his rule, would assuredly have Takungah sent as a prisoner to Peking, and punished with rigorous severity. At the same time the grand council of Peking forwarded a \" secret communication \" to Eleepoo, directing him to see the rjlenipoten- tiary, and explain to him the course which the emperor had adopted. As this communication was specially forwarded to the plenipotentiary by Eleepoo, his excellency addressed to that functionary an immediate reply, couched in re- spectful yet dignified terms, pointing out that although he should never think of impugning the right of the emperor to intimate his pleasure to his own subjects in any form and language he thought proper, he could not, as the edict had been officially communicated to himself, pass over an expression containing the assumption that the celestial dynasty governed all foreigners without its pale, without remarking that the Queen of Great Britain acknowledged no supe- rior or governor but God.

After an insignificant fight in the streets, the lascars were worsted, and retired before the mass of their opponents into the factories, where they found shelter within one of the hongs, the doors of all of them having been closed as soon as the coming storm was perceived.

Sir Hugh Gough immediately expressed his intention of remaining off the factories in the steamer for their protection, and sent off a dis patch to Hong-Kong, to inform the authorities there of the apprehensions entertained of a second outbreak more serious than the first.

The report of Eliang respecting the Formosa massacre has been made public by the emperor, and is very satisfactory, so far as the degrada tion of the blood-thirsty governor, Takungah, is announced ; he is ordered to repair to Peking, to be there handed over to the board of punish ments : all the persons who had received medals or decorations for the part they had taken in the dreadful affair, are ordered to restore them. Thus the emperor has given an early proof of his sin cerity and good faith."], [647, "521 POSTSCRIPT. A subsidiary treaty has been concluded by Sir Henry Pottinger, giving to other nations the same privileges of trade with the Chinese as those secured to us by the treaty of Nanking. Our commercial relations, under the new con sular establishments, are not as yet proceeding in a very satisfactory manner, \u2014 the Chinese appearing disposed to resort to their old practices of extortion, which will require very firm resist ance. The old Hong merchants at Canton do not like the new arrangements, and come forward tardily. One of their number, the celebrated and wealthy old Howqua, has died, leaving an enor mous fortune. The commissioner Lin is also no more ; the emperor has paid a high-flown tribute to his memory. The unhealthiness of our new settlement is now the subject of great anxiety. The Chinese have an apparently insurmountable dread of the effects of its climate ; they consider the water pernicious, and will not resort to the island. Among our own people, several have succumbed: the able and enlightened Mr. Morrison, of whom mention has been so frequently made in the pages of this narrative, and who had been appointed Chinese secretary to the government"], [648, "522 POSTSCRIPT. of the island, together with Captain De Haviland, 55th regiment, and Mr. Foote, deputy-com missary-general, have, I grieve to record, fallen victims. Mr. Gutzlaff has been appointed secre tary in Mr. Morrison's stead. This grave sub ject of climate I must not enter upon ; it is en gaging the most serious and anxious attention of the authorities, who will no doubt be prepared with a proper and well-digested report to be laid before parliament at the ensuing session. Reader, I respectfully bid you farewell. I have been relieved from my duties at the settlement by the arrival of Major Aldrich, of the Royal En gineers, who has been specially appointed by her Majesty's government to superintend and carry out all the necessary works and fortifica tions on the island.
