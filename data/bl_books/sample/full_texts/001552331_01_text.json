Though the Nature of Comedy be not the fame with Tragedy, the end of it is ; for Inftru6ion is the part of both, as man may be difciplin'd under feveral School mafters. \u00bb The word Comedy was derived from the Greek word k\u00bb/V<*, or more largely underftood by the An tients of a Play reprefenting humane life and man ners ; whereas the bufinefs of Tragedy is in a high er nature to difpofe and elevate the intrigues of paffi ons and affeaions ; I mean fuch as depend on Ambiti- b on,"], [22, "PREFACE. on,Revenge, Love,Honour, and the like, aftdfo detea their vices accordingly. As it is the duty of Comedy to do the fame, in thofe that come neareft our Morali- ties, though it muft be granted that the reprefentation of Tragedy, cannot be fo univerfally praaicable (and confequently not of that benefit to mankind) becaufe its concernments, and aaions, are more fublime, and feparated from the univerSality of men, rather fit only for the ear of Princes, (who are very often the greateft number of chafers in a Tragical Fable) then for a lower degree of Perfons; which fhews us, that Comedy hath fome merit above it, in that it is of a more univer- fal nature. Upon which occafion our famous Johnfon well obferves, that Lyfipptts was not able to form with his Graver,or Apelles to Paint with his Pencil,thofe life ftroaks and touches, that true Comedy reprefents, in refpea of the various affeaionsof the mind, in behold- ing the infolence of fome in joy, the melancholy fret- ings of others, the raging madnefs of fuch as are un- done with love, avarice, riot,tortur'd with expeaation, confum'd with fear, &c. as he gives the example, and to whom we are obliged for fo many excellent Drama- tick Charaaers tothispurpofc. And as Tragedy requires a ftrong intrigue and Plot (\\ wifh it were more obferved now adays) as being the reprefentation of higheft paflions, and aaions ; fo Co- medy in' like manner would abound with all delightful variety of both, by which we behold the humours, and inclinations of men, in due elevation, and magnitude; not that it is requifite that all the charaaers in a Play (hould"], [23, "PREFACE. fflfcould be equally great, or manage alike the main drift of the Drama, (as lines drawn from the center of ajcir cle, have an equal extent within its circumference) but rather receive a becoming proportion, which is indeed the Golden Rule to be obferved in Plays, and requires no lefs the invention, and skill of the Poet to make it praaicable ; for as in Mathematical Operations, there is nothing more hard then to be cunning in the Symme try of lines, and figures they exprefs ; fo the Poets difpofition of his charaaers, ought in as high a degree to be proportionable to that body of thought he de figns for them. This is that which enobles Language and Wit, giving to both a decorum on the Theater; for though the Mufes prefcribe few rules, they abhor irregularity, and licenfe, 'tis their fublime inftinft, where their excellencies meet in any, as is divinely ex prefled by Ovid. Sedibus tether eis fpiritns Hie venit. And as Lipftus affirms-, Scio Poetam neminempnejian tem fuifje, fine parte quadam uberiore divine mentis.

The fame may be affirmed of his Cynthias Resells, where Cupid, Mercury, and Eccho have parts, or fome- what more extraordinary in his Devil's an Afs, where the grand Demon, and a leffer, are made charaaers, as Satyrical Refleaions on Vanity and Vice, to be cor- reaed by them ; which fliews, that the truth or poffibi- lity of the charaaers, is lefs to be confidered, then the Morality they aim at. Et hercule omnis falfa di- cendi ratio in eo eft, ut aliter quam eft return verumqm dicatur, as Quintilian obferves. As the chief end of Comedy is improvement of manners, fo the mirth arifing thence, is to entertain our paffions, and affeaions with delight proper there unto ; wherefore to make laughter the chiefeft end of Comedy, is to impair its more fuperiour efteem, fince what is ridiculous, is not therefore Comedy. If a Clown"], [26, "PREFACE Clown were {hewn in a Ladies Gown, or a Sca ramuchio that provokes laughter, no otherwife then by making a wry face, or gefture, he muft ftrangely participate of vulgar folly, that woul'd call either of thefe the parts of Comedy, fince they work nothing on the affeaions, no more then a man can be faid to laugh properly without mirth, or be fick, and have no difeafe.

No lefs doth this French Mode of entertainment on our Theaters, vilifie mirth, and countenance for the moft part debauchery, where it is frequent to obfervs, the waiting womans intrigue is to Pimp for the Ma dam, and the Valet de Chambrc for the Mounfieur he ferves,"], [27, "PREF ACE. ferves, which performed witsh fome eafe in the compafs of five Aas, they go to bed likewife for their labour; the reft of the charaaers have commonly fo little to fay for themfelves, that a man cannot difcern a Fan taftick Fool, or Clown, otherwife then by their Ha bits or Geftures.
