He was as eager in his attach ment to English literature as I was to that of Italy ; and by rendering each other mutual as sistance in our pursuits, we soon became inti mate friends. His literary taste, however, was principally directed towards poetry, while mine is attracted much more by compositions in prose. Signor Volpi was a person of a wandering turn of mind ; and, perhaps, had he attached himself to one pursuit, instead of many, he might have done something to make himself remembered : but he had an equal liking for the three sister arts, and was to be found at one time painting pictures, in the style of the old Italian masters ;"], [14, "PREFACE. VI at another, engraving on copper ; and again, he would occupy himself with musical composition. Literature, however, as it gave him less manual trouble, claimed most of his attention, and he wrote English verse with remarkable facility. A few of us were in the habit of meeting in the evenings, and holding literary conversations, at which such of our coterie as were authors used to recite their productions. It was on one of those occasions that Signor Volpi communicated to us the plan which he had formed of publishing in Florence and Rome an English annual miscel lany, nearly similar to those which have since become so popular. He thought that when so great a number of English of the higher classes resided in Italy, such a publication would be likely to have considerable success. This pro jected work was to have been exclusively poeti cal, and was to consist of productions contributed by various travelling authors, whilst its embel lishments were to have been designed and engraved by the editor. It was to differ from"], [15, "PREFACE. VII its rivals in this respect, also, that each volume was to contain at least one poem of some length, and to consist of two parts ; the one to be en titled ' The Romantic Annual,' while the other was to bear the title of ' Metrical Memorials of Momus and his Merry Men.' When he was asked why he had chosen to unite such incongruous materials, he replied by a quo tation from Ariosto : \u2014 Signor, far mi convien come fa il buono Sonator, sopra il suo strumento arguto, Che spesso muta corda, e varia suono Ricercando ora il grave, ora l'acuto. \" One soon gets tired,\" said he \" of too much sentiment, or too much fun : it is, therefore, better to chequer our annual pages, as the days of the year are diversified, with alternate smiles and tears.\" As my friend had contrived to become ac quainted with several eminent English poets, he had been, as he assured us, very successful in obtaining from them materials for his projected work, as will perhaps be seen in the following"], [16, "PREFACE. VIII pages. He told us that, amongst others, Lord Byron had very kindly given him two Tales ; with an injunction, however, not to publish them as his compositions. It appeared that Signor Volpi was one day expressing the great admiration which he felt for the early produc tions of his lordship, and had alluded to the \u2022 Giaour' in particular, regretting that the noble author had latterly relinquished writing those impassioned tales which had first w-on for him his great literary reputation. He told us that, in reply, Lord Byron had exclaimed : \u2014 \" WTiat ! would you have me replunge into barbarism, after having become a civilized author ? I have had a letter from Murray this very day, asking me to write something in the old style : but the fellow,' continued his lordship, \u2022 shall not in duce me to tickle the ears of the groundlings any more in that way.' He then told my friend that he had a juvenile production of his in that style, lying by him, which he thought might take well enough, though the story of it was"], [17, "PREFACE. IX extravagant ; but that he would not administer to the bad taste of the English Vandals, by allowing it to appear. After some entreaty, however, he was induced to give the manuscript to Signor Volpi, for his intended Annual, on obtaining a promise that it should not appear with the name of the real author. Subsequent ly he gave him also a comic tale, which he had caused to be published in England anonymous ly, like ** Don Juan,' and which had been recog nised as his by only one of the critical journals. This tale was entitled ' Giuseppino,' and was reprinted, (I believe, as Lord Byron's,) at Phila delphia, in the year 1822. It now appears, with many additional stanzas by my late friend, un der the title of ** Gad do.' The noble lord said that as it was not universally received as the twin-brother of ' Beppo', he had determined not to acknowledge it, supposing it to be very infe rior to its precursor. These facts were, I con fess, communicated to me, and to one more person, as a secret ; and, if Lord Byron were"], [18, "X PREFACE. still living, they should remain undivulged. But I consider it to be my duty, under existing circumstances, to afford the public whatever in- formation I possess with regard to the author- ship of ' Arnaldo', and ' Gaddo'. It shoidd, at the same time, be remembered that I do not assert any thing, on this subject, positively : nor do I pretend myself to be able to form an opinion with regard to their authenticity. I have merely reported faithfully what I remember to have heard from the former possessor of the manuscripts from which the present volume has been printed. I will even say that I have sometimes felt doubts as to the truth of his statement ; for my late friend, though a man of strict veracity in all serious matters, was a very jocose personage, and as he had, evidently, an impression on his mind not quite favourable to my acuteness in guarding against what is called mystification, he may possibly have only amused himself in passing on me a harmless forgery.

XI having joined one of the late expeditions to the Peninsula, he was killed in action ; having first left his papers in my care, and constituting me sole heir of these, and of a few valuable pic tures, which were his chief possession. As to the ' Tale of Troy,' and the two poems which follow it, I am at a loss to know by whom they have been written. In speaking of them, Signor Volpi said : \" Ecco ancora tre bizzarrissime composizioni di quell' ammirabil burlatore il signor Tommaso Ood.\" This may have been some English name mispronounced : I have appended it, however, to the rhymes in question. Another poem, ' The Griefless,' given with the letters J.

Our Signor paid the town of Bath a visit, (Some persons there repaid him,) while, with wiser eye, He looked about him : but, alas, where is it That Cupid can't intrude his magic vizor, eh .? When did he fire at any mark and miss it ? \u2014 Oh, sooner than I'd face that fellow's fire, I'd even dare O'G n M n's ire."], [163, "GADDO 111 LXIV. Ugh, I must think no more of this ! \u2014 Where was I ? Saying that folk at Bath wrere sometimes amorous, By Cupid or cupidity made crazy ; (Especiady if creditors grew clamorous ;) And, therefore, Hymen there is no whit lazy, And, like a little Cyclops, Love doth hammer us ; But, when his flames consume Eve's sons and daughters, How can they- ever quench them with the waters ? LXV. So felt the only daughter of a widow, W7ho, having lately come to quaff those famous Waters, as by some doctor she was bid do, Abode, as chance directed, in the same house That Gaddo, on his first arrival, hied to, Because 'twas situated near a game-house. This widow was not beautiful nor healthy, But every one declared that she was wealthy."], [164, "GADDO 112 LXVI. The daughter was in person more engaging. Her eyes, indeed, had not the softest lustre, But a bold sparkle, which appeared as waging Battle to all men's eyes that might accost her ; And, when the warfare of stout looks was raging, Not even the steadiest starer could disgust her, But when she chose, and she would choose, to eye you, Her ocular words were mostly, ' I defy- you!'

Such w-as the natural language of her glances ; Nevertheless, she had the needful art To know that meek expression but enhances The power of brightest eyes against a heart ; She showed great tactics, then, in her advances, Was sentimental, flirtish, grave, or smart, According to the temper of the squire To mar whose singleness she might aspire."], [165, "GADDO 113 LXVIII. Her figure was in no degree too slender, Yet, though quite energetic, not unpleasing ; It seemed more fit for one of masculine gender ; Therefore you'd all suppose that I am quizzing, When I assure you that her health was tender. She sometimes had a cough so very teasing That, when her mother and she coughed together, The hearers used to say their lungs were leather. LXIX. But though her person was not very slight, 'Twas merely plump, not Flemishly attractive ; Her gait was of the dancing kind, as light As if 'twere learned in France from the most active ; Her eyes were clearly black, and darkly bright, Seeming to know their twinkle wras effective ; Her face was much more comical than tragic, And would induce one to believe in magic."], [166, "144 GADDO LXX. Poor lady ! 'twas surprising she should be So sick at one time, and so wed another ; Should, in a morning, look quite fud of glee, And bark, at eve, as if about to smother. Her age was but approaching twenty-three (Some doubted this account,) and though her mother Had several thousand pounds in store to give her, She had bad symptoms both of lungs and liver. LXXI. This circumstance attracted the attention Of our outlandish man of rank and fashion, WTho, on the strength of title and pretension, Resolved, at once, to entertain a passion For his fair neighbour; and 'twas his intention To be possessed of the aforesaid cash, on Her dying soon, as every one expected; Nor was his humble servantship rejected."], [167, "GADDO 145 LXXII.

LXXIII. He owned that his estates had been embarrassed, Though matters now were nearly set aright : That creditors, (he damned them all,) had harrassed Him much : but all his prospects now were bright, As an old uncle, who was living far east, (A bishop,) should before long bid good night To his large purse ; nor had he any person But his dear nephew to bestow that curse on . i."], [168, "146 GADDO LXXIV.

LXXV. At least 'tis certain that, if she did tell, No one pretended to be much the wiser ; But, I suppose, she kept the secret well, For she was bribed, unless report belies her ; Nor could she hope, by blabbing, to compel Her mistress, (an incorrigible miser,) To thank her : yet, she had a wish, no doubt, To let her knowledge, even for nothing, out."], [169, "GADDO 147 LXXVI.

W7hen Earth was young, He had been of the sons of high renown, One of most wondrous deeds, a vanquisher Of tyrants, and a law-giver whose thoughts Were mightier than a giant-host to guard His birth-land strongly, \u2014 such an one as he Of Thebes, \u2014 a worthy of the first pure time. He found the place where, once, his home had been ; Where, once, a mount, clad with far-spreading forests, Reared its huge head, in lasting snows arrayed, High as the summer-clouds. All round its base, Of old, were many cities, and that height Was of fair isles and peojded lands the wonder. He sought that mount, and found it not. Its place Was empty.

With speed unspeakable, He overpast the rueful realm, and all The bounds of the vast wilderness, and came Among the dwellings of the quick, where now The ancient cities were, even in the place Which wide and pathless forests had o'erspread, When he had last been in the upper world. There the all-wakeful voice of crowds was heard, Where erst the wild birds warbled, in the glades Of an untravelled land of sylvan gloom, Through whose thick coverts all wild woodland things Fearless rejoiced, together.

English literature has been already, in some degree, enriched with one translation of the Comedy of Dante, and has also received the worthless addition of one or two loose and tumid paraphrases of the entire or of a portion of that first great poem of the middle age. Of these latter I shall scarcely say more : but it is requisite that I should enter into a minute examination of the plan and execution of the former ; and, however invidious the task may appear, I trust that I shall be able to prove the defects of that version to be very great, not withstanding the favourable reception which it has met with, at least from the reviewers. To me it appears to be an imperative duty of a translator to copy, as far as possible, not only"], [326, "PREFACE. 4 the imagery of his prototype, but likewise to convey as clear an idea of the manner of his original, especially if that manner be remarkably appropriate to the subject treated. Now there never was an author whose manner was more peculiar to himself, or more fitting for his sub ject than that of Dante to his own ; and I think every person of taste who is acquainted with the great poem of the Florentine, will readily ac knowledge that the tertian rhyme in which it is written possesses a solemn harmony and gran deur of cadence which impart, as it were, an oracular dignity to the verse ; and that this is, of course, the best form which the poet could possibly have selected in the composition of his sacred allegory. In this respect how has his copyist acquitted himself ? He has chosen to translate the poem in question into blank verse ; thereby relinquishing the task of accurately pre serving one of the principal features in the style of that work. If he lias, in some parts, preserved the pure gold of that costly shrine, it will be"], [327, "PREFACE. 5 found that he has, in many places, defaced the imagery, in flinging away the gems which adorned it. There is, besides, another quality in the poem of Dante which should, I think, have prevented his translator from making such a choice. It is, most truly, a Gothic poem ; in other words, it is completely characteristic of the middle age in which it was produced, when all poems of all kinds were written in rhyme, and long before the invention of blank verse in modern lan guages. If an Italian were to render the poetry of Chaucer or of Spenser into versi sciolti, I imagine that his bad taste in doing so would be very evident to his English readers ; and yet the different kinds of rhyme in which those poets have written, are much less fitly adapted to the subjects they have chosen, than is the tertian rhyme to the subject of Dante, whose poem bears the same relation to the classic remains as a Gothic cathedral has to a Grecian temple. It was, probably, the great difficulty of this intri-"], [328, "PREFACE. 6 cate species of rhyme which deterred Mr. Cary from endeavouring to bring the great Tuscan before us, clad in the dark but embroidered garments which he wore, rather than in a scanty and inappropriate imitation of the classic robes of antiquity ; one, in fact, not possessing the ample folds and graceful flow of the ancient, nor the rich adornments of the romantic garb. And I confess that, even after I had versified some cantos of the following translation, I was, from the same consideration, about to relinquish the task which I had undertaken, when I was urged by particular circumstances to proceed as I had commenced. In doing so, I have been really surprised to find the obstacles to my attempt disappear in a great degree. The late Mr. Hayley paraphrased the first three cantos of the Hell ; and these are, perhaps, almost the only endurable things which he has written : \u2014 the list of proper names, however, in the fourth, fortunately frightened him, or we should probably have had a Dante de safacon."], [329, "PREFACE. 7 A Mr. Boyd also kindly offered to the English public a wordy paraphrase of that author, in a stanza of his own invention. There is, however, in his attempt, so heavy a preponderance of Mr. Boyd that the bard of the Inferno sunk with him to a depth seemingly as great as that which he had described, and was again in the company of the damned : yet I doubt whether those at tempts would not be as attractive, to most read ers, as the far more accurate but rhymeless version of Mr. Cary. Indeed, I understand that this latter is, by many persons, considered to be inferior to its unwieldy rival, although it has had a much larger circulation. Thus far as to the fitness of blank verse, with regard to Dante. I now beg to say that I con sider such verse as intrinsically unpleasing, ex cept in a certain class of subjects, by no means extensive. It is truly appropriate in the great work of Milton : but we must recollect that this is written on a classical, and not a Gothic model. Still it cannot be denied that Paradise Lost,"], [330, "8 PREFACE. wonderful as it is, has not as many readers as are attracted by poems in rhyme of infinitely less excellence. Rhyme is, in truth, an essen tial part of poetry, in most of the modern languages, and very rarely to be dispensed with ; some of these even reject blank verse altogether. In our own, Homer has been splendidly para phrased by Pope, and faithfully translated by Cowper. The exquisite taste of the former di rected him to write in rhyme ; the latter chose blank verse ; and, faithful as his version is, it is absolutely neglected, while the harmonious work of Pope is still the delight of every lover of poetry. Had Cowper written in rhyme, (not couplets, however,) I think he would have suc ceeded. I will dare to say that Mr. Stewart Rose, when he undertook to transfuse the Furioso into English, never thought, for a mo ment, of executing his task in rhymeless verse. Had he chosen such a medium, he surely could not have produced a translation of almost un equalled merit, as he has done."], [331, "PREFACE. 9 Such are the considerations which convince me that Mr. Cary has, in this respect, signally failed in one great requisite of a translator ; namely, taste. There are yet other serious de fects which I am compelled to point out, that I may prove to my readers the fact, that no good translation of Dante has yet appeared in our language. The principal of these defects ap pear to be a want of accurate acquaintance with the Italian language, and a still greater want of poetical feeling in Mr. Cary which has made him fail most remarkably in rendering the best passages of the Florentine ; together with a harshness in the wording of his verse, and a great inversion, and absence of natural flow in his sentences. There is also, not seldom, a looseness in his mode of translating which, I think, approaches too nearly to paraphrase. I am quite prepared to prove these charges by quotation, and shall confine my remarks to the first five cantos of the production in question, quoting with the original."], [332, "PREFACE. 10 The first error which we meet is the fol- lowing : \u2014 Alhor fu la paura un poco queta Che nel lago del eor m'era durata, La notte ch' i' passai con tanta pieta. Then was a little respite to the fear That in my heart's recesses deep had laii All of that night so pitifully past \u2014 Pieta signifies a pang, but pietd means pity ; which I suppose made Mr. Cary give so pitiful a version of this passage. The next, however, is far worse. He intended to translate the noble simile : \u2014 E come quei che con lena affannata Uscito fuor del pelago alia riva Si volge all' acqua perigliosa, e guata. And as a man with difficult short breath, Forespent with toiling, 'scaped from sea to shore, Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands At gaze. Did Mr. Cary wish us to think that the poor man was asthmatic before lie got into the sea ? If not, he should have collocated his words very differently. There is not in the original a word"], [333, "PREFACE. 11 about difficult or short breath ; nor does it de scribe the man as forespent with toiling ; nor say that he gazed at any wide waste. Dante says, if I mistake not : \u2014 And as a man escaped unto the shore From out the deep, with faint and panting breath Turns to the perilous water, gazing sore. I have thus ventured to quote my own at tempt at translation, merely to shew how much more poetry would be found in a far more literal version than that of my predecessor. The next mistake is as follows : \u2014 Ed una lupa che di tutte brame Sembiava carca con la sua magrezza E molte genti fe gia viver grame. A she -wolf Was at his heels, who in her leanness seemed Full of all wants, and many a land hath made Disconsolate ere now. Dante understood his own allegory too well, to bring Avarice at the heels of Pride : neither does he describe her as full of want ; (perhaps Mr. Cary is a native of the sister-isle ;) nor speaks he of a disconsolate land. Molte genti"], [334, "12 PREFACE. means ' many folks ;' the Italian gente having a much more restricted meaning than the Latin gens. I venture to quote my own version of this passage : \u2014 And next a she-wolf that, with cravings sore, Seemed heavy-laden in her meagreness, And which gave many a one to want, of yore. The above is, I believe, better poetry than Mr. Cary's, simply because it is very nearly literal. Soon afterwards, Mr. Cary tells us that Dante contrived to fall and step backward, at the same time. The poet himself seems to have known that people, while falling, generally lose their feet. \u2014 e. g. Mentre ch' i' rovinava in basso loco. While to the lower space, with backward step IfeU. Again, we find these lines mistranslated. Dante says of the she-wolf Avarice : \u2014 Ed ha natura si malvagia e ria, Che mai non cmpie la braroosa voglia, Et dopo '1 pasto ha piii fame che pria."], [335, "PREFACE. 13 Molti son gli animali a cui s' ammoglia, E piu saranno ancora, infin che '1 veltro Verri, ehe la fara morir con doglia.

He will not life sustain By earth or its base metals, but by love, Wisdom and virtue, and his land shall be The land 'twixt either Feltro. The word nazione does not, here, mean 'land,' or nation,' but 'birth;' formed, I believe, from the adjective ' natio,' 'native.' The ugly image introduced by the translator is not in the original. I have marked, in italics, the words which are unauthorised. In Canto II. we have this line which, even in Mr. Cary's metre, seems singularly harsh : \u2014 Yet clothed in corruptible flesh, among, &c. This does not to me sound very Miltonic"], [336, "14 PREFACE. We next find the following mistranslation : \u2014 Come falso veder bestia quand 'ombra. recoils like a beast, At some false semblance, in the twilight gloom- Quand' ombra does not mean ** in the twilight gloom,' but ' when he starts,' or * takes um brage.' The ancient poet says, characteristically, ' there is a gentle dame in heaven who be wails,' &c. Donna _ gentil nel ciel che si compiange. but his copyist says : \u2014 In high heaven a blessed dame Resides, who mourns with such effectual grief. A pleasant residence certainly for any lady ! There is no ' effectual grief in the text. These lines appear to me to be rendered in a very common-place kind of style : \u2014 Di cui la fama ancor nel mondo dura, Et durer<_, quanto '1 moto lontana. whose fame Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts."], [337, "PREFACE. 15 thus I have, perhaps, been more correct : Whose fame endures, on earth, and shall endure As long as motion swayeth matter on. Mr. Cary thinks fit to pronounce the name * Beatrice' as in Italian. I should really think this name to be sufficiently known in English as that of one of the characters in a play called ' Much Ado about Nothing :' accordingly I have given it as English. The next error which we meet is in these lines : \u2014 Non odi tu la pieta del su' pianto Non vedi tu la niorte che'l combatte Su la fiurnana ove 1 mar non ha vanto. Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail, Nor mark the death which, in the torrent flood, Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds ? The word pieta again misled the translator : and besides, Dante said : ' Dost thou not see the death which he combats ?' and did not say that the flood was ' swoln mightier than a sea.' Shortly afterwards Mr. Cary uses the word #"], [338, "16 PREFACE. ' voyage' to denote a journey by land of which Dante speaks. There is considerable meanness in the version of this line : \u2014 Dunque che e ? perch., perche restai ! What is this comes o'er thee then ! Why, why dost thou hang back ! We now come to the awful opening of the third canto, with the very emphatic repetition of the same four commencing words in the first three lines, thrice. Per me si va nella citta dolente , Per me si va nell' eterno dolore ; Per me si va tra la perduta gente : Ginslizia mosse '1 mio alto fattore. Feccmi la divina protestate, La somma sapienza e '1 primo amore. Through me you pass into the city of woe ; Through me yon pass into eternal pain ; Through me among the people lost for ave. Justice the founder of my fabric moved ; To rear me was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Here the too great emphasis of the four words repeated thrice is avoided ; and we are told that"], [339, "PREFACE. 17 the Creator had a task to perform. Dante says no such thing : he speaks also of primal and not of primeval love. Next we find this line mistranslated Su la trista riviera dAcheronte. Beside the woeful tide of Acheron. The true English of it is : \u2014 Upon the dismal shore of Acheron. but Mr. Cary thought, it seems, that riviera meant ' river,' in this place, as it often does, but not always. The last four lines of this canto are also badly done into English. The fourth canto is made to open with the following specimen of indifferent grammar and exaggeration : \u2014 Broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself As one by main force roused. Risen upright, &c. It certainly requires a little main force to pro- nounce this last line. The original words per forza merely signify ' per force.' Dante describes Virgil as turning pale, and as # 0"], [340, "18 PREFACE. saying that it was with pity that his visage was so painted .* \u2014 L'angoscia delle genti Che son qua giu nel viso mi dipinge. the anguish of that race below With pity stains my cheek. Thus we see that Mr. Cary supposes the colouring of pity to be a stain. Such is the dif ference between a poet and a proser : the latter cannot see the delicate painting of the former : Ci vidi venir un possente Con seguo di vittoria incoronato. I behold a puissant one arrive Amongst us, with victorious trophy crowned. Dante does not speak of a trophy, which ge nerally consists of a pile of arms, but of a ' sign' of victory. This sign, according to the com mentators, was the cross. I am convinced, how ever, that they are mistaken, as in that case the poet would have written ' col segno ;' and that the crown which Dante meant was that of thorns."], [341, "PREFACE. 19 There are two mistakes in the version of the last four lines of this canto : \u2014 La sexta compagnia in due si scema, E vegno in parte ove non e chi luca. In two The six associates part And to a part I come where no light shines. The meaning of the poet is : ' the company of six lessens by two And to a part I come where there is no one who can shine.' Mr. Cary seems to have been there, too. In the fifth canto the Tuscan asks Virgil Maestro, chi son quelle Genti che l'aer nero si gastiga . Instructor, who Are those by the black air so scourged ? I protest I should not think a scourge of black air a very hellish instrument of torture. Gastiga simply means ' chastiseth ;' \u2014 and all chastise ment is not scourging, either with black air, or with birch. The next is a mistake of a kind which appears strange enough, coming from the pen of any # 3"], [342, "20 PREFACE. person even slightly acquainted with classic fable :\u2014 e vidi '1 grand Achille, Che con amor al fine combatteo. Arhilles who with love fought to the end. The text means, very differently, ' fought at last.' In his version of the exquisite simile ' Quali colombe,' &c. Mr. Cary would have been un wontedly correct, had he not rendered I'alialzate by ' wide wings,' instead of ** wings outspread.' Who ever before heard of the wide wings of a dove ? such an expression may be applied to those of an eagle. The celebrated passage describing the love and woes of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta is very poorly and weakly given. The Edinburgh reviewer said that Mr. Cary had not rendered it with his usual felicity. What that felicity is, I am unable to discover. The following appear to be examples of signal"], [343, "PREFACE. 21 infelicity, and yet there are worse in many other parts of his translation : \u2014 Amor ch'al cor gentil ratto s'apprende Prese eostui de la bella persona Che mi fu tolta, \u2014 Love that in gentle heart is quickly learnt Entangled him by that fair form from me Ta'en in such cruel sort, \u2014 Thus the emphatic word costui is rendered by the feeble word ' him ;' as if Dante had written prese lo, instead of prese costui. Caina attende chi n' vita ci spense. Caina waits The soul who spilt our life. ' Caina awaits him who quenched our life,' is the true English of this line. I need not of course remark how skilfully the word 'quenched' is used to convey to us the image of two souls burning with passion. Not more happily des criptive is that beautiful line of Shakespeare : \u2014 Put out the light ; and then, put out the light.

Surely ' whereby and how' would sound better. Dubbiosi desiri means timid or misdoubting desires ; \u2014 and the correct in terpretation of the words A che e come, is ' ivherefore and how. ' Had Mr. Cary con sulted any Italian dictionary he would have dis covered this in the first page. nessun maggior dolore Che ricordarsi del tempo felice Nella miseria.

Thus, I have noticed the more conspicuous defects in the first five cantos of the work under consideration ; and I feel convinced that, were I to extend my researches, I could quote a very tiresome catalogue of errors from those which follow. Perhaps, however, enough has been done to prove that a tolerably good translation of the Comedy is still a desideratum in our lan guage. To some it will, doubtless, appear that I have been rather writing a severe critique on my predecessor than a preface for myself: but a very little reflection will shew that such a cri tique, if called for, is the best medium, in fact, that I could choose whereby to introduce my own attempt to the reader's notice, and to give an as surance that I myself have some of the requisite"], [346, "PREFACE. 24 information to guide me. He who is able to discover and point out the faults of another may, reasonably, be expected to do better himself. If Mr. Cary be not a good Italian scholar, nor much of a poet, he cannot have given an appro priate English dress to the greatest bard of Italy, and the one most difficult to translate. A very fine article on Dante appeared some years ago in the Edinburgh Review ; which gave, incident ally, much praise to Mr. Cary. The writer of it, however, did not seem to have looked so closely at the version as he did at the ori ginal ; and I have only attempted to do what he has left undone. His principal object appa rently, was to produce an eloquent essay, with out being very minute in his criticism. This, indeed, is the great defect of modern critics, that they are generally much more intent on shining themselves, than on showing whether the author under consideration has shone, or not. For my part I can truly assert that I have not given to the work of Mr. Cary a more strict examination"], [347, "PREFACE. 25 than I am willing, nay, anxious to abide for my own. It now only remains that I should submit to the judgment of the reader, the plan on which I have myself proceeded in endeavouring to translate so great and so obscure a poem as that of Dante. In the first place, I have chosen his own appropriate mode of rhyme ; and though it is, in English verse, one of the very greatest difficulty, I trust that I have given a far more faithful echo, not only of the thoughts, but of the actual words of Dante than has hitherto been produced in our language. The poverty of this language in rhyme, has sometimes, but at long intervals, compelled me to adopt a kind of termi nation to my verse, resembling that which the Spaniards call asonancia, and which is common in their poetry, and in that of the old Irish. This species of rhyme only requires that the vowels of words should be the same, and not their final consonants : e. g. marsh, dash ; noon, gloom j &c. In couplets, this license could not certainly"], [348, "PREFACE. XXV1U be endured : but I think it quite allowable in tertian rhyme; especially as many of our received rhymes are, in fact, only assonances, and not very close ones neither. For instance, earth, forth ; heaven, given, &c. Even in the \u2022 Rape of the Lock,' the most polished poem of our most cor rect and tasteful poet, we find such rhymes as the following : taste, repast ; remained, land ; break, neck ; hair, sphere ; &c. Those I am far from considering as a blemish. Assonances, however, are not unknown in English, as they occasionally occur in our beautiful old ballads; I quote an example from the \u2022 Flowers of the Forest :' I've heard them a lilting, at the ewe milking, \u2014 Many others might be added. In a very few instances, I have even introduced rhymeless lines, rather than be untrue to the sense of the original, and I may say in excuse of this practice, that a similar licence was adopted by Mr. Camp bell in his justly admired verses on Hohenlinden, without being ever censured, or even remarked"], [349, "PREFACE. 27 as a fault. It is highly probable that not one reader in a thousand would discover such an absence of rhyme, during perusal, if not made aware of it otherwise. As Dante is an ancient poet, and as his great work is perfectly characteristic of his age, I have chosen not to modernise it, nor to put forth em bellishments of my own in his name, but to adopt, in my version of it, as nearly as I could the lan guage and manner of our old followers of the Muse. Accordingly, I have occasionally used words and phrases that are long obsolete ; thus endeavouring to preserve, in some degree, the venerable air of the great Tuscan. For the same reason, I have given, not only line for line, but, when possible, word for word with the original ; nor have I sought to strengthen Dante where others have deemed that he stood in need of their powerful assistance.

The reader will now judge whether my pre tension to greater fidelity is well founded or not ; but I hope that none but critical Italian scholars will consider themselves capable of deciding the question. Even the clever writer in the Edin burgh Review, before alluded to, has shown that he mistook the sense of one passage which he quoted, viz : \u2014 Che come vedi ancor non m'abbandona. This should be a warning to others. If I have committed any considerable mistakes in the ex ecution of my task, I shall not seek to excuse them by saying that I have had to choose amongst a variety of readings.

The editions from which I have translated are that of Aldus, 1515 ; and the one called the ' cat edition,' Venice, 1564 ; with the commentaries of Landino and Vellu tello, together with the admirable one of Rossetti, who as a commentator on the Comedy is with out a rival. Between those, or any other good editions of the Divina Commedia there is very little variation. I have added a brief commen tary, in which I have advanced some new inter pretations of passages that appeared to me to have been misunderstood by previous commen tators, while I have selected from the latter such elucidations as seemed worthy of approval. For reasons which will be immediately obvi ous, I may remark that the foregoing preface was written in the year 1831. Since that time Mr. Wright has published his version of the Tuscan ; and his labours have obtained a critical notice in either of the leading Reviews.

In the Quarterly, he is advised not to proceed further with his version. Thus it would seem that there is still room for another candidate who may be ambitious of the high honour of representing Dante. As to my own opinion, judging only from the specimens given by the Reviews, I must say that, though Mr. Wright has by no means reached the standard of excellence which I would myself endeavour to attain, he has nevertheless produced a work very creditable to his taste, and much superior to any previous translation of Dante which we possess.
