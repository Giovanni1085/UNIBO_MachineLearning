THE diaries here printed are in six separate parts, five of them being the property of Malcolm H. Angell, Esq., of Etna, Bergen County, New Jersey, while the other (Part Two) is the property of a descendant of Colonel Angell in Rhode Island. The pages on which the entries are written are about three and one half inches wide by six and three quarters inches long. The sections or parts of the diary vary as to the number of pages, and are stitched together without covers. Their general appearance is indicated by the sac-simile page accompanying this work. The whole diary has been carefully transcribed and copious notes added. It is hoped that these annotations will add to the interest of the diary itself, and be found useful in identifying and describing persons and places briefly referred to by the diarist. In preparing the great number of notes which is contained in the work, I have been aided by many persons, but to name all would be beyond the possibilities of this preface; to all such persons, however, I return grateful thanks.

He received more than the usual education afforded the youth of that period, for his mother had been a teacher in one of the country schools and was thus able to give her son many advantages of learning. He seems to have been con versant with scientific subjects, was particularly fond of natu ral history, and in his later years made many notes on this branch of science as he travelled through sections of the country on public business. He is also said to have been an enthusiastic student of astronomy. At the very beginning of the troubles with the mother country Israel Angell took an active part. When the army of observation was ordered raised by the General Assembly of Rhode Island in 1 775, he was commissioned Major of the regiment commanded by Col. Daniel Hitchcock.

There is a letter yet preserved among the manuscripts of the Rhode Island Historical Society written by Israel Angell to his brother, dated at Prospect Hill, Dec. I, 1775. It gives a clear idea of the character of the man who was des tined to bear so conspicuous a part in the struggle for inde pendence, and for that reason it is here printed : Prospect Hill, December the ist 1775.

Upon the death of Colonel Hitchcock the command of the regiment was given to Angell, his commission beinj dated Jan. 13, 1777; this position he held until the First and Second Regiments were consolidated. In August, 1777, his regiment was at Peekskill, N.Y., from which place he wrote the following pathetic letter to the Governor of Rhode Island:"], [20, "XII CO ION EL ISRAEL ANGELL.

To his Honour ye Gov. & Council State R. I. Colonel Angell participated in the battles of the Brandy wine and Red Bank and was with the army during the terrible winter of 1 777-1 778 at Valley Forge. His regiment bore a conspicuous part in the battle of Mon mouth, and soon after this engagement he with his regiment was detached from the main army and sent to Rhode Island to unite with General Sullivan in the operations against the enemy at Newport, R.I. For distinguished services at the battle of Springfield, June 23, 1780, he was the subject of special mention by General Washington in a letter to Gov ernor Greene ot Rhode Island. Upon the consolidation of the two Rhode Island regi ments Colonel Angell retired from the position he had held so long. Bv the Act of Congress of Oct. 3, 1780, this was not to take effect until the first of January following, but it seems that it was some months later than this before he wrote in his diary that his days as a military commander ceased.

His tavern was a popular place of resort and was widely known for its excellence and hospitality. Late in life he moved into the town of Smithfield, where he died May 31, 1832, in his ninety-second year. He is described by one who remembered him as of \"medium height, light complexion, auburn hair surmounted by a wig, blue eves, a strong Roman nose, and straight as a ramrod.\" ' Colonel Angell was three times married and is said to have contemplated a fourth venture when death terminated his lite. - In love and in war Colonel Angell was a conspicu ous figure. 1 Statement in a sketch of the life and services of Col.

Israel Angell's Battal ion (Rhode Island Colonial Records, Vol. VIII., p. 11), and he was among the officers recommended by General Washington to the Rhode Island General Assembly for the new establishment of the Continental Army, in the same month and year.

He served with Colonel Angell's Regiment throughout the war. In 1791 the Rhode Island General Assembly appointed Col. Jeremiah Olney and Capt.

His residence, at the corner of Washington and Greene streets, has recently been demolished in order to place the new Public Library upon its site, a fate most certain to have been pleasing to one of his refined literary taste and public spirit.

Horatio Rogers, in his explanatory chapter to Hadden's \" Journal and Orderly Books, 1 776-1 778,\" discusses the office and its rank in the British army, and as the American army was organized on practically the same plan, his statements apply equally well. \" Each of the three field officers,\" he says, \"was supposed to command a company, so that a regiment of ten companies would have but seven captains; but as the colonel rarely or never served with the regi ment, there was an officer styled a captain-lieutenant who com manded the colonel's company. Prior to 1772 this was a distinctive grade between lieutenant and captain; but in that year an order was issued giving a captain-lieutenant the rank of captain; though the ' Captain-Lieutenant and Captain,' as he was afterwards desig nated in the Army Lists, was always the junior captain.\" Such was William Littlefield, of Angell's Regiment, in 1779; unlike the prac tice in the British army, Colonel Angell served almost continuously with his regiment. 1 Mutinies among the Continental troops were not of infrequent occurrence. The troops were mostly incited to this disorder by the lack of pay and rations.

William Turner, who lost his life during Philip's War, while in command of a volunteer company at Turn er's Falls. His paternal great-great-grandmother was Elizabeth, daughter of William Sabine, a Huguenot refugee of wealth and culture, whose name appeared upon the Rehoboth records as early as 1643. His grandfather, Samuel Miller, was a large landed pro prietor, and was among the first in Warren to engage in ship build ing. The Miller family were prominent members of the social, political, and religious circles of their native town, and gave their name to one of its principal streets. At the outbreak of the Revolution General Miller and his brother, William Turner Miller, at once embraced the cause of liberty, and throughout the war both labored diligently in defence of their country. In 1775 Nathan Miller was chosen Commissary to Gen eral Hopkins' troops. In 1777 he was appointed a recruiting offi cer. In 1778 he became a member of the Council of War. In the spring of this year, he, in connection with Le Baron Bradford, Samuel Pearce, Samuel Brown, and Cromwell Child fitted out the privateer sloop \" General Stark,\" of fourteen guns, which captured two or more prizes, though eventually falling into the hands of the enemy. During the battle of Rhode Island he was in command of a regiment.

Hewas appointed Brigadier in 1777 and served in that capacity in the battles in which Burgoyne was defeated and captured. He soon afterwards joined the army under Washington in Pennsyl vania. He was in the camp at Valley Forge, and with his brigade was among the first troops that commenced a pursuit of the British across New Jersey in the summer of 1778. He fought gallantly in the battle of Monmouth which succeeded. He commanded a brigade of light infantry in 1780, in which service he died, near Hackensack, in New Jersey. His funeral was attended by Washington and Lafayette and a long line of subordinate officers and soldiers. On account of the vicinity of the enemy the usual discharges of cannon were omitted. Rev. Israel Evans, Chaplain to the New Hampshire brigade, de livered a funeral discourse. General Poor was buried in the churchyard at Hackensack, where a humble stone, with the following inscription, marks his grave : \" In memory of the Hon.

Governor Arnold's History of Rhode Island, based upon a careful study of documents in the British State Paper Office and in the Rhode Island State Archives, supplemented by in vestigations at Paris and The Hague, has from its publication been the authoritative history of the State. Genealogical students will find in these volumes the names of over fifteen hundred persons prominent in Rhode Island affairs. This work is of much more than local interest, as the experi ment of religious liberty here tried gives to this history an im portance far beyond the narrow limits of the State. \" One of the best State histories ever written is S.

Compiled by EDWARD FIELD, A.B., Member of the Rhode Island Historical Society, and one of the Record Commissioners of the City of Providence. Cloth. Octavo. 60 pp. $1.00, net. The \" Tax Lists of the Town of Providence \" is a compilation of original documents relating to taxation during the Adminis tration of Sir Edmund Andros and his Council, 1686-1689. It comprises copies of warrants issued by order of the Council for the assessment and collection of taxes, the tax lists or rate bills prepared pursuant to these warrants, the returns made by the townsmen of their ratable property, and the Tax Laws enacted by Andros and his Council. All of these, with the exception of the laws, are here printed for the first time. Among the rate bills is the list of polls for 1688, which con tains the names of all males sixteen years of age and upwards living in Providence in August of that year ; practically a census of the town. For the genealogist and historian this volume con tains material of the greatest value on account of the great num ber of names which these lists contain, besides showing the amount of the tax assessment in each case. The returns of ratable property form a study by themselves, for they tell in the quaint language of the colonists what they possess, and therefore shed much light on the condition of the times. For a study of this episode in New England Colonial History this work is invaluable. The index of all names contained in the lists and text is a feature of this work.

They come from a surprising variety of sources, natives and foreigners, governors and clergymen, soldiers and geog raphers, Quakers and Catholics, French offi cers and American travellers.
