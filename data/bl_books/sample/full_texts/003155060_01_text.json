A Recitation for the Infant School. By C. B. Shuttleworth. Come, children dear, God's gifts tell o'er, More precious they than earthly store ; Their rightful use is God's intent, To guide, to guard, to teach they're meant But wrongful use should be our shame, A disgrace e'er to Christian name. 0 let us then each one review, And give to each its duty true. First, then, two eyes, two clear pure eyes ; Aloft we know their place implies, Like warders high on castle height, They're there to warn or guide aright ; Not fixed ; that they may look around And learn what lore in Nature's found. 0 pure-lit Eyes, at evil sight Close up, and be as darkest night. And next, two ears, two list'ning ears, To warn ere Danger's self appears ; Beceptive too of music heard In wind, or brook, or singing bird, And rightly us'd to catch the tones Of loving friends, or sorrow's moans. 0 Ears, attun'd to heav'n-born sound, Be deaf as stone when oaths abound."], [14, "6 y Next come two feet, two tripping feet, For Eyes and Ears companions meet To go, to come, or rest at will : And well do they their office fill, When swift they speed to others aid, Or visit those on sickbed laid. 0 willing Feet, do ne'er obey When Eyes or Ears would guide astray. See now two hands, two clever hands ; \u2014 To toil, their duty foremost stands, But not alone ; a nobler use Is theirs \u2014 the captive's bands to loose, The sick to soothe, the weak protect, And Age's tott'ring steps direct. 0 skilful Hands, do nought that's mean, Nor lend your aid when wrong is seen. And last, one toDgue, one two-edg'd tongue Utt'ring words or right or wrong. Two eyes, two ears, two hands, two feet, Four twin-like pairs we see complete, While tongue is single and unique, And why ? To do twice that we speak. 0 dang'rous Tongue, be prompt to cheer, But dumb for evil speech or jeer. o \u00a3be Birtbba\\> Cafcc. Dear Granny has sent me A large currant cake, Because it's my birthday: \u2014 And all her own make !"], [15, "7 It's covered with sugar, With love-knots and spice ; Come then and enjoy it, Let's each take a slice. Dear Granny has written : \u2014 (To all here I know), \" I hope when you look at This cake white as snow, Fair, shining, and sparkling, And fit for the Queen, You'll, dears, aim at being, As spotlessly clean. \" And Bweet as the sugar That crusts it around, And gay as the flowers By which it is crowned ; And I hope,\" adds dear Granny, \" That each little heart Will be pleasant and good as Our cake's inmost part.\" Please fetch a knife, Harold Ah ! there falls a plum, And citron as big as Daddy's broad thumb ! They're p'raps like the kind words Dear Granny would say \u2014 That the lips of good children Let fall day by day."], [16, "8 Now hand round the slices, Save crumbs for the Dicks, And a bit for dear doggie Who thanks by his licks ; And keep some for Elsie At home in sad pain, I'm sure she will like it When quite well again. \u2014 o sIDop. Poor Mop, he had a wounded paw, Oh such a sight you never saw, T'was swelled and hot, and gave such pain, That scarce he could from groans refrain. (Boo-oo-oo.) A passing boy shouts out, \"What fun! This dog is lame \u2014 let's make him run, Tho' not on four legs, yet on three, For that a comic sight will be ! \" (Clap hands.) Poor Mop limps off: \u2014 \"0 hard of heart, That boy does act a cruel part \u2014 He mocks at suff'ring \u2014 laughs at woe ; Were he in pain \u2014 I'd not do so.\" (Boo-oo-oo.) But says this tender girl, \"Poor pet \u2014 What's hurt your paw? well do not fret ; Could I but help you, I would stop But as I cannot \u2014 good-bye, Mop.\" (Kiss hands.)"], [17, "9 \" She might have tried to do me good, Poor Mop, he moan'd in bitter mood. \"Soft words will never heal a sore \u2014 But they are cheap \u2014 kind deeds cost more.'

Why here's a thorn! And see, too, bow your flesh is torn : Be brave, dear dog \u2014 I'll surgeon act, And carefully the thing extract. (Steady ! Steady ! now it's out.)

Then off we set down Cuckoo Lane, Dear mother was our guide, And bid us o'er and o'er again, Not wander from her side. Now Flo, she did as she was bid, By mother close she stay'd, But I, behind some hawthorns hid, And to the brook I stray 'd. I saw a splendid dragon-fly Like flash of purple flame ; \u2014 What happened next? why bitter cries Of terror and of shame. I fell upon the marshy bank, And soil'd my best of frocks, And in the long grass wet and rank I drench'd my shoes and socks. Then mother came, \"Oh naughty Bose, Your feet are soak'd with dew ; You've stained your frock, and scratched your nose, And see, you've lost your shoe ! \"Where? in the brook? It grieves my heart My Bose should act like this ; You now must lose the apple tart, And Auntie's loving kiss.\""], [19, "11 > Then home I went, both sad and grave To be in such disgrace ; Till mother came, and pardon gave, And kissed my tearful face.

One day there was a village feast, The Whines were both invited \u2014 But they must bring a shilling each, They told Gran so \u2014 delighted."], [20, "12 Then Granny peep'd inside her purse, And shook her head quite sadly ; \" Alas ! my dears, I've none to spare, Or you should have it gladly.\" \"Now Gran, why not?\" Will Whine, he said \" I'm sure you've lots of money ! \" \" Yes, just for rent, and coals, and food ; No more at present, sonny. \" How foolish 'twas to give you pence To comfort you when crying ; [they're spent Had I but saved them \u2014 (all sigh, and p>ause) alas ! And so there's no use sighing.\" Then Will and Winn look'd very blue O'er all the money wasted, And sigh'd to think of pleasure lost, And cake and tea untasted. But from that day they ceased to hope For pence to stop their whining ; And tho' they had few sweets 'tis true, Much less was their repining. For rainy days they learnt to save, Like bees do store their honey, And when they'd grown up, Will and Winn Had always lots of money."], [21, "13 r Mipe sour Sboes.

(Impressively) Please wipe your shoes. Young Jem one day in haste went out, And walked in all the mud about ; Then home he came and in he ran, Oh ! such a dirty little man, Nor wiped his shoes upon the mat; Ah ! Little children, think of that, Nor wiped his shoes. His mother then, poor thing, looked sad, \" Oh Jemmy, why so careless, lad ? I fain would rest and have my tea, But there ! (point) What work you've made for me Ah ! Little children, think of that, He hadn't wip'd his shoes. Jem blush'd, look'd down, shed tears, and sigh'd, \" I'll clean it, Mother dear ! \" he cried, \" I'll wash myself, and scrub the floor, And ne'er again come thro' the door, With shoes unwip'd upon the mat.\" Ah ! Little children, think of that, And always wipe your shoes."], [22, "14 a Ibastp Stone. A little boy sat on a bench To rest his weary feet, For many a mile he'd walked that day, And rest to him was sweet. Now close at hand, some wearied birds Were bathing in a pool, (wings, They div'd, and splash'd, and dress'd their And drank the water cool. Then Tom took up a jagged stone And said, \"I'll have a fling;\" The aim was true, tho' many flew, He wounded one poor thing. \"A prize,\" cries Tom, and up he sprang, \"Oh would there had been twain,\" \u2014 When all at once a sudden blow Turned all his joy to pain. \"I'll pay you out,\" screams angry Tom, \"Whoever you may be! \" \u2014 Then back he fell both sick and faint, For sorely hurt was he. A shadow fell across the path, There stood a stranger nigh, Who did his best to bind the wound And Tommy's tears to dry. \"My lad,\" he said, \"the heavy stone From yonder quarry fell \u2014 I'm glad to think it did small ill, Your head will soon be well."], [23, "15 \"But how about the stone you threw, Which hurt the poor young bird?\" \"Oh that! I did it just for fun\u2014 Or sport's the proper word.\" \" Some call it sport,\" the stranger said, \"But well, I'm sure it's wrong To take for naught a harmless life And hush a joyous song. \"I watch'd that little flock of birds, As wearied with their flight, They bath'd within the sparkling pool With innocent delight. \"And when I saw one wounded fall, My heart with grief was stirred ; I ran to put it out of pain, And then your scream I heard. \" My boy, you sat down here to rest \u2014 Why then God's birds destroy ? Why could you not their wise ways watch, And love to see their joy? \"You moan and cry because you're hurt \u2014 Like pain your victim bore.\" \"Oh sir!\" cries Tom, \"I never thought; I'll stone the birds no more.\" \"Pray keep that vow,\" the stranger said, With smile both kind and grave, \"Show mercy, boy, to helpless things, And you'll be truly brave.\""], [24, "16 Daffooils. Sad little May was lying Upon a bed of pain ; Just when the early spring-tide Soft breath'd on earth again. And she must lie and suffer, Nor could her anguish hide, While all her merry playmates Were sporting far and wide. One day when she lay weeping, Said mother with a smile, \" Dear May will pray for patience \u2014 'Tis but a little while.\" Then mother took a flower, A yellow daffodil \u2014 It came from yon green meadow Which lies beside the hill. She laid the dainty blossom Beside the sobbing child, Whose eyes shone bright with gladness, While fretful looks grew mild. \" A daffodil ! \" she cried \u2014 \"A daffie dear, I know You come from that sweet meadow, Where early violets blow."], [25, "17 \" The daffies there are dancing And nodding in the breeze, And giving sweetest honey To all the busy bees.\" \" Yes, May, the fields are golden With daffodils in bloom, But all the snowy winter They lay in deepest gloom. \" Till came the bright sun calling, When at his voice they rose, And putting on fine raiment Forgot their prison woes. \" So you, my May, are waiting \u2014 By suffering here made wise, Until the Sun of Bighteousness, The Christ, shall bid you rise.\" \u0152be Cbristmas \u0152ree.

The tree that blooms at Christmas, Is called the Children's tree, It shines with dazzling tapers, And presents fair to see. In honour of the Christ Child, We burn those tapers bright, In token that His soldiers Should armour w7ear of Light. In honour of the Christ Child, So holy and divine, Y/e'll daily fight dark evil, That He in us may shine. In honour of the Christ Child We'll still for others care, And all our Christmas blessings, With poorer neighbours share. \u0152be Collie ano tbe png. \" I suppose that all day you lie cosy and snug,\" Said a shepherd's poor dog to a lady's fat pug, As he went to his work on a winter's morn cold, And met Sir Pearl out in his coat green and gold"], [27, "19 \" Oh, dear, yes,\" said Sir Pearl, \" for I generally sleep On a mat soft and warm, and within doors I keep Till the weather is sunny, and the roads clean enough, For I never walk out when it's muddy or rough.\" Thus haughtily answer'd the dainty-fed pug, With a sniff, as he gave a contemptuous shrug : \"What a contrast to me,\" thought poor Collie, footsore, \"For my bed is dry heather, and of food I need more. \"And I'm out on the mountains howe'er the winds howl, In all sorts of weather, be it fair, or it foul.\" \" Ah, but I,\" said the pug, \" in a carriage and pair, Drive along the green lanes to enjoy the fresh air. \" Though it bores me at times in a wearisome way, Yet it breaks the monotony of sleeping all day.\" \"Alas !\" said the collie, \" no time I can spend In sweet sleep all the day, for my sheep I must tend.\" \" Indeed, \"yawned the pug, \"then I'm glad I'mnot you! Well, I think I must go my dinner to view ; D'ye know, I can't eat if it's not to my mind !\" Then off waddled Pearl somewhat short in the wind. \" Ah, well !\" sigh'd the collie, \" and I, too, must go, To seek that lost sheep on the moor in the snow ; One blessing is mine, that I always can eat, Whatever is given, and think it a treat. \" And I must say I like this fresh morning breeze, For my coat is so thick that I know I shan't freeze ; No ! I don't envy Pug and his smart gilded suit, Nor his mat, nor his fat, nor his carriage to boot.\""], [28, "20 Thus each went his way, and in less than a year The pug grew so stout that he couldn't see clear ; He wheez'd and he puff'd as he lay by the fire, Till his friends were rejoiced to see him expire. But Collie lived long and had excellent health, Won love and esteem \u2014 they are better than wealth ; And when he grew old and his work days were past, Was cherished and watch'd o'er and lov'd to the last. From Pearl and from Collie this lesson we learn, 'Tis happier far, one's own living to earn, Than to lie by the fire, and snoring grow fat, No creature was made just only for that. \u0152be ifoy anb (Trow. On a bough Sat a Crow Among a grove of trees ; She sat quite still, And in her bill She held a bit of cheese A Fox came by And soon his eye Spies Crow among the trees, And very much Fox long'd to touch The piece of Stilton cheese."], [29, "21 \" You pretty Crow,\" He says, \" I know There's music in your tongue ; For in the spring, I'm sure you sing A very pretty song.\" Crow clear'd her throat To sing a note, The flatt'rer, Fox, to please.

Then Fred the big umbrella took, And hurried through the street. Splash, splash, thro' every puddle went, And wetted well his feet. The poor umbrella fared but ill, With Fred, the careless boy, He held it so (Extend the left arm and perform the action of turning something round), he whirl'd it round, As though it were a toy. T'was balanced on his finger tips, And next upon his nose, The while on Freddy's velvet cap, The rain all spatt'ring goes. T'was held aloft to catch the breeze, Which turn'd it outside in, And Fred on reaching home again, Was soaked quite to the skin. Part III. His mother put him straight to bed, So very damp was he, Nor did she let him up that night, Tho' Auntie came to tea ;"], [31, "23 And with her brought a nice plum cake, And sweeties not a few, Besides these goodies, so I'm told, A pocket knife quite new. But Fred you see had spoil'd his clothes, And got himself wet thro', And minding not his mother, broke Her large umbrella too. (It is suggested that an umbrella drill should follow this recita tion, showing how Fred should have held the umbrella according to the different quarters from which rain may come.) Zbe Cat ano tbe slDonfcey.

How wrong was he \u2014 How cowardly ! I hope you think so too, To ask the cat, To do just that, Which he \u2014 Pug \u2014 dare not do. J. M. IIeathcote Zhe Broom.

Another young Pug, He rode on a dog, Drest smart in a red velvet coat, An apron before, And white frill he wore, Tied carefully round his small throat.

The Bullfinch is seen When thickets are green, And then she'll delightfully sing ; We may see her at rest On her soft mossy nest, While she sits on her eggs in the spring. In winter she feeds On berries and seeds, And no longer sings in the wood ; When the spring comes with joy, Many buds she'll destroy, For she likes them so much for her food. How gaily she's drest When she has on her best, Blue-grey is the top of her back, While her breast is light red, And the crown of her head Seems just like a night-cap of black. She always looks neat, And is loving and swejt When she lives in a cage and is tame ; She'll pipe a gay tune If taught to sing soon, And when called will chirp to her name. J. M. Heathcote.

Some little children daily tread O'er rugged mountains steep, Or thro' the town, or by the shore, Where salt waves foaming leap. But Bose and Katie walk'd to school, Two miles across the fell ; Yet in their seats ne'er sail'd to be At first stroke of the bell. Part II. But once there came a dismal day, How keen the icy blast ! When tracks were rough, the \" sun was hid, ' And snow fell thick and fast. Kate shiver'd \u2014 wept. \" Now, what's all this ?\" Said Bosie, pushing Kate ; \" Step out, child, do \u2014 you slug, you snail \u2014 I vow I won't be late.\""], [36, "28 Now Bose was ten, and tall and strong, While Katie was but four, Nor was it meet for tiny feet, That day to cross the moor \" I cannot walk so fast,\" sobb'd Kate, \" Please, Bose, I must sit down.\" \" Sit if you will, you'll sit alone,\" Said Bose with angry frown. Then off she flew, reached school in time To gain the early mark ; Brighter than hoar-frost shone her face, That dismal day and dark. Part III. \" Kate stay'd at home, then ?\" teacher asked, \" That's best for her, I'm sure.\" \" No ! Kate is coming, teacher, soon ; I left her on the moor. \" She crept along like some old snail, I really could not wait ; When she sat down, I just ran on, For fear of being late.\" \" What ! left poor Katie all alone, On such a snowy day ! Oh ! Bose, but that was cruel, dear ; What if she lose her way !\""], [37, "29 Part IV. Then teacher quickly sought a guide Across the moorland bleak, And out they set in eager haste Poor tiny Kate to seek. On, on they went thro' blinding snow, And fought the icy wind, Both looking round with anxious thought, How Katie they might find. They found at length the little maid, A sorry sight to see ; Her eyes were clos'd, her limbs were stiff, Nigh unto death lay she. Then teacher took her in her arms, To shield her from the storm, And took her home, and gave her wine, And rubb'd her dry and warm. Part V. At length with look of utter dread, With blue eyes open'd wide : \" I must be late \u2014 I've lost my way ; Do, Bose, come hack !\" she sigh'd. Then teacher call'd the thoughtless Bose To see the fright'ned child ; \" How could you leave this little one Upon the moorland wild?"], [38, "30 \" She might have died there all alone \" \u2014 Then Bose wept long and sore. \" Ah !

What's the reason that the needle Always turns one way ? The Magnet won't allow the point-end In one place long to stay. East or west it will not rest, And from the south it flies ; But look now when it reaches N. How quietly it lies. While in motion, on the ocean The ship reels to and fro ; When the sailor roams afar from home, And winds tempestuous blow; The Compass shows the way to go, And guides from shore to shore, And never minds the stormy winds, Tho' loud and wild they roar.

The wild wind as an echo sough'd, And windows drummed and rattled loud ; How latches danced, and shutters bang'd, And church bells in the steeples clang'd. How then the wind retired to bring A greater strength upon his wing, And shouted with his mighty voice, Till all that felt it had no choice, But each must shriek, or sing, or moan, Or howl, or whistle, pipe, or groan.

Cong's travels. Part I. Our Tony once a journey took, To such a funny land, Where happy pigs were dancing jigs While puss-cats play'd the band. * A Persian tuned the gay guitar, The horn a French cat blew ; The Tabby striped, they gaily piped, The black cats drurn'd tattoo."], [54, "46 *3 Now Tony's greatest joy was this \u2014 - To give dumb creatures pain ; To make them feel, and hear them squeal, Made Tony laugh amain. Part II. \" I'll pull those piggies' curly tails, I'll hunt those cats,\" said he; \" Ha, how they'll yell, and fly pell-mell, What jolly sport for me.\" But all fell out quite unlike this, No pig or puss turn'd tail ; They swell'd in size 'fore Tony's eyes, And then his heart did quail ! Each pig became a savage boar, Each cat a tiger wild, With leaps, and bounds, and roaring sounds They sprang towards the child. Then Tony felt half dead with fear, Yet strove to fly apace ; In vain he flew, they would pursue, Yea, one and all gave chase. Part III. No chance had he in that strange land, With pigs and cats thus rare ; Still on they came, like scorching flame, He felt their eyeballs glare."], [55, "47 And what befell poor Tony then ? Too surely he was slain ? Not so, my dear (it may seem queer), He got safe home again. * Now Tony knew how fearful 'tis To flee from mighty foes ! Thus since that day no pig nor cat In fear of him e'er goes. * For he will do no cruel deed, Nor, heedless, life destroy; He's kind to all the weak and small \u2014 Bird, beastie, girl or boy.

One day by chance, In his gay dance, He fell from a chestnut top ; A little boy Ban up with joy, And took, and shut him up. He call'd him Struts, And gave him nuts, And often kissed him too ; But the squirrel In the barrel So unhappy grew ! He never could Forget his wood, Where he was young and free ; And the happy frisks, When in spite of risks, He had his liberty. J. M. Heathcote"], [57, ""], [58, ""], [59, ""], [60, ""]]
