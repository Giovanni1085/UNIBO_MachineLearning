Worthy Sir3 %/* As to the affair mentioned in yours; it hap pened long before my time. I have therefore been obliged to confult my clerk, and another perfon in the neighbourhood for the truth of that melancholy event. The hiftory of it is as follows. TH E family name of the young man was Wrightfon; of the young maiden Railton. They were both much of the fame age; that is growing up to twenty. In their birth was no difparity: but in fortune, alas! fhe was his inferior. His father, a hard old man, who had by his toil acquired a handfome competency, ex pected and required that his fon fhould marry fui tably. But, as amor vincit omnia, his heart was unal terably fixed on the pretty young creature already named. Their courtfhip, which was all by Health, un known to the family, continued about a year. When it was found out, old Wrightfon, his wife, and particu larly their crooked daughter Hannah, flouted at the maiden and treated her with notable contempt. For they held it as a maxim, and a ruftic one it is, that blood was nothing without groats. The"], [16, "The young lover fickened, and took to his bed a bout Shrove-tuefiday, and died the funday fennight after. On the lafl day of his illnefs, he de fired to fee his Miftrefs. She was civilly received by the Mother; who bid her welcome when it was too late. But her daughter Hannah lay at his back; to cut them off from all opportunity of exchanging their thoughts. At her return home, on hearing the bell toll out for his departure, fhe fcreamed aloud that her heart was burfl, and expired fome moments after. The then Curate of * Bowes inferted it in his regi fter, that they both died of love, and were buried in the fame grave, March 15. 1714.
