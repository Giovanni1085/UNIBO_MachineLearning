All motion, if we err not, owes to light Its primitive and first-born impulse ; else Would matter rest inert, nor will to move. Light first disturbs the gravitating force, And turns the sleep of nature from its bed. For while it covets needful nourishment, And denser substance penetrates with ease, Motion is thus produced, nor falls to rest While this great fount of quickening life remains To hold the pulse of nature to its beat.

Nor did the solar light which gilds our sphere, Rise in that hour alone, but every star And light which vivifies th' ethereal space, Distributed throughout creation, all Received their origin in that first hour, And from one universal mass of fire, Both sun and stars successively arose. For light by antecedent birth was none, Else darkness had not reigned ; but till that day, Light ne'er in effluence spread its dawn around, Nor poured its beauty through the universe. The first great day was thus proclaimed on high, With evening and with rising morn ordained ; A day unparallelled in splendour, called Day by peculiar privilege, with night Contrasted in discrimination just.

The angel-host, with reverence and awe, Beheld, astonished ; and though great themselves, And high in power compared with feeble man, Might see the throes of nature with alarm, Unknown what changes might affect their state.

The nature of this firmament, which men Call ether, mortals cannot hope to know ; Save that its pure translucid parts permit The radiant heat and light of sun and stars Freely to pass, nor offer to the earth Perceptible resistance in its orb Of yearly revolution.

For though this mystery may appear obscure, Scripture indubitably proves its truth. Divide, he saith, by firmament between, The waters underneath from those above ; Such waters, therefore, constitute on high Part of this vast creation, and surround, As with an outer atmosphere, the whole. Waters above the firmament exist, Whose wide circumfluence girds the space within, And holds the universe in unity, A sphere of many spheres absorbed in one.

Next in the distance from the central sphere He placed sweet Venus, evening's lovely star, And brightest of the planetary tribes ; Which seen before she dips the horizon, seems Like a small moon, herself the loveliest moon That girds the sun around, hence Venus called.

In beauty Venus shines ; in greatness Jove. Four moons attend his wandering path to light The dark obscure, that both the face reversed, And that presented to the solar day, May shine illuminate. These moons revolve With rapid whirl, while slow the sire proceeds.

Scripture, 'tis true, affords no certain grounds Concerning the celestial impulses, But leaves to man full liberty to solve Such philosophic questions as he may.

Nor did th' objections which thus interfered With nature's sweet simplicity, suggest A plan less inharmonious to the mind.

And thus the Papal powers arrayed their force, To sanction darkness, and repress the light ; Freedom of mind deemed heresy at Rome, Save what the will pontifical prescribed. And while the principles of heaven-born truth Are most congenial to the quickening growth Of free inquiry and expanded thought ; A narrow and mistaken policy,"], [80, "64 CREATION. Misnamed religion, has too often checked The progress of them both from Roman zeal. The Papal bulls Copernicus defied In the dark grave when first his system rose, Alike removed from envy or applause, Yet leaving light to dawn with his demise, He first with aid of mathematic laws, Deduced and proved the movements of the earth Around itself, and round the solar orb, In daily and in annual motion free. Thus by two simple principles, with ease The prime phenomena were plainly seen Of astronomic wonder. Need was none Of epicycles strange to occupy The void of slow invention. And the scheme Of Ptolemaic skill at length appeared, Nought but a splendid error to the mind. Simplicity, which nature loves, soon lent Full approbation to the rising truth.

The apparent circuit of the sun alike, No more that luminary's speed requires, In periods of irregular advance. The globe terrestrial more minute than he, With readiness relieves the solar flight, And takes its annual journey round the sire. The sun thus constant to the central point, And unremoved, is soon discerned to form The centre of a system in himself.

Viewed from the earth, th' apparent movements seem Irregular. The planets first advance From west to east in th' order of the signs, Then pause awhile in stationary rest, And then in movement retrograde appear, As though reversing nature's general law. But these things happen as th' alternate round Of opposition or conjunction falls ; And though at first inexplicable, yield To simple rules which science pleased approves.

Hence every planet to its neighbour seems Approaching or receding in the orb, As relative position month by month, Exhibits each in different points of heaven. And hence while movement retrograde appears, 'Tis but the quicker flight of one advanced, The true and not th' apparent impulse guides. And thus the system forms one mighty whole, Of planets, comets, satellites or moons, Which move in unity around the sun, While the small moons or planeteens revolve, Alike obedient round their central spheres.

At first the planetary orbits seemed, To fond imagination's quick conceit, Of circular formation ; circumscribed Around the sun, some little way removed Below th' immediate centre. Here well-pleased Illusive fancy would have left her search Quiescent, if the penetrating eye Of observation, had not scrutinized, Beneath the surface that conjecture scanned. The eagle-eye of Kepler first perceived, That circles suited not the real course, Wherein the planetary bodies moved. He found the orbits were of oval shape, And hence deduced that most important law, That every planet's path is an ellipse. Discovery thus so quickened his research, That other most efficient laws he found ; And by comparing periodic times And distances, among the heavenly tribes, A strict analogy throughout the whole"], [85, "69 CELESTIAL.

Wisest of uninspired mortals thou, In whom intelligence and truth sublime, Shone with peculiar lustre ; in whose mind Dwelt an unparallelled sagacity, Which caught with ease the hidden thoughts abstruse, And penetrated nature's secret paths With depth of view and skill superlative ; In whom inventive genius quick supplied The fruits which common minds alone acquire, By study and laborious industry ; And who absorbed in contemplation deep, Didst patiently explore the realms of light, And read the book of high Omnipotence,"], [86, "70 CREATION.

Hence by a strict comparison between The lunar deviation toward the earth, And that spontaneous force invisible, Which pondrous bodies to the ground impels ; Compared together, it appeared that each Resulted from the same original, Observant both of one propelling power.

Of earth assembled in a sphere compact. Being discerned alike to turn the moon, Deflected from a rectilineal course, And by a gravitating tendency Thus drawn aside and bent towards the earth ; Was soon perceived with movements similar, To influence the planetary spheres ; And by a great and universal law, To hold the parts of nature firmly bound, In uniform obedience to its power. All circulating spheres in orbits moved, Owe their activity to two great powers. For since a body by a single force, Choses a straight and undeflected path, Reason requires that a sphere when moved In path circuitous, receives at once The compound action of a two-fold power. Hence science proves that two prime forces move, The spheres revolving round the solar world ; And when we seek the nature of these powers, The comets best illuminate their laws. For when these wandering orbs with upward flight"], [89, "CELESTIAL. 73 First disappear amid the ethereal vast, And then with sudden revolution turned, Downward descend toward the realms of light ; The ascending and descending flights describe Successive action of alternate force Impulsive various, and distinguished each According to the alternate rise or fall. Hence in the falling impulse we descry An influential gravity, endued Toward the central luminary swift. This the great law which Newton first supplied, With eagle genius and inventive mind. But when ascending with opposing whirl, These bodies upward rise propelled on high ; A Primum Mobile we need t' explain, The first commencement of the erratic speed, And teach the cause of this ambiguous flight. This principle in brief ourselves have shown In treatise philosophic. The success Or failure of the attempt we freely leave To judges competent to try such themes. K"], [90, "CREATION. 74 The thoughts of high philosophy combine But feebly with the sweeter strains of verse, Or meditation of poetic mind.

But poet's pen is pleased with freer flight, And while the themes of glorious liberty He treats rejoiced with animating song ; He scorns to forge those shackles for himself, Which he would gladly loosen from the world. Not that poetic page is therefore void Of truth, of law, or reason's voice sublime. The aboriginal and native tongue Of truth and wisdom, inspiration's mind, Was poetry at first. The muse was tuned With music, and the voice of minstrelsy Gave to the song of wisdom fire from heaven. True poetry's the language of the skies.

Not that we undervalue the results Which sound philosophy and science yield. But they who deem all knowledge ill-defined Save what is capable of linear proof, And mathematic demonstration sure, Err equally with those who needless deem Such demonstration, complicate, yet true. Two laws or principles of motive force, Spontaneous hold the planetary tribes, In their dependent revolutions round The central luminary. Both proceed"], [92, "76 CREATION. Spontaneous from the solar sphere itself. For when the wandering bodies first recede, Ascending freely from the central orb, A force proceeding from the sun repels Their perihelion flight to distant parts. Again a force attractive draws them back From their aphelia ; and returning now With seeming gravity towards the sun, Attraction from the centre draws them down, With swift descending impetus regained. As when a ball or stone with upward flight, Is hurled impetuous through the yielding air, It climbs aloft far as the impulse drives, Then wearied falls and turns again to rest. The same two forces, whatsoe'er they be, Attractive and repulsive in their kind, Reason affirms retain the universe, The stars and spheres that fill celestial space, In one great globe compacted and combined.

The elements with raging heat intense, Will be dissolved and melted into flame, And all the spheres return to one great fire.* * The argument on the non-habitation of the spheres, has been introduced rather to show what may be said on the nega tive side of a question usually received in the affirmative, than from any certain conviction on the subject in the mind of the author.

On thee, O woman, I will bring the curse"], [251, "TERRESTRIAL. 235 Of multiplied conception, and with pangs Of travail and of sorrow shalt thou bear More than thine hands can nourish or support. And thou, O man, in labour shalt thou toil, And in thy sweat shalt earn thy daily bread ; Cursed is earth for thee; with thorns o'ergrown, And thistles, it shall hardly yield thy wants, Until thou turn to dust, who thence wert taken.\" Then with a voice of terror, which amazed And sore distressed the fallen first-born pair, He bade the angel drive them from the seat And centre of their first enjoyments ; thence To wander in the wide and far-stretched field Of nature, banished, never to return To that fair garden of their pristine joys, Of Eden's lovely paradise debarred. Thus fell the first-born pair, and thus drew down Th' Almighty curse which grinds us still to dust, And by transgression of God's sole command, Subdued the family of man to death. But who shall sum the evils which have hence"], [252, "236 CREATION. Oppressed mankind with multiplied distress, And trace to fatal curiosity The fruit of knowledge both of good and evil ? In this sad knowledge the sole cause behold, And in neglect of the Almighty will, See the sole origin of sin and death. Behold in this the cause of war and strife, The source of violence and cruel hate, Of rapine, murder, and oppressive power, Adulterous love, and every foul desire. In this perceive the bondman's slavish yoke, The prisoner's fettered limb and galling chain. All wickedness from hence derives its birth, All punishment in this obtains its power. In this the arm of strength receives its right, T'oppress the innocent, and wrong the weak. The widowed heart here drinks its cup of wo, And orphan'd babes hence date their helpless state, The poor in this their poverty derive, And hence the meagre morsel toil supplies. Whate'er of wretchedness man tastes on earth, With death to consummate and end the task"], [253, "237 TERRESTRIAL. Of life's temptations, is the debt of sin, The growth and fruit of disobedience all. In power, in pride, in vanity and lust, In covetous desires of worldly gain, In worthless search of greatness or of fame, Or whatsoe'er the favourite passion be ; In these each sows the seeds of future grief, Disease or pain which must hereafter come ; And hence their several sorrows all obtain, With many an aching heart and falling tear, And many curses on the first-born hour, Or wish impatient for a speedy death. But wherefore woes and troubles ? Could not God Have framed his plan exclusive of its worst And darkest shades, and made at once a world Perfect and free from blemish or defect ? When God made all things he pronounced them good, And all things free from evil were produced. But from the first it pleased Him to design, That in probationary state on earth"], [254, "238 CREATION. Man should his weary pilgrimage perform ; And life a chequered course of change and chance, He gave to educate and prove his sons For heavenly state in everlasting life. Hence the sad trials which the good endure, And hence the punishment which sinners meet, The countless evils which experience brings T' afflict mankind, are hence interpreted. Lend but the mind to understand this truth, That God will give to each with equal hand The recompense of evil works or good ; View but the life to come with single eye, And this its transitory path esteem, Where all but run a race, and are to win Or lose according to their varied paths In sin or righteousness ; that evil thence Is but the scourge which brings us to the task Of labours, which by nature we refuse ; And thus we learn that evil tends to good, That sorrows and temptations are the course Appointed by the only Good to bring, Whether the sinner to humility,"], [255, "TERRESTRIAL. 239 Or saint to high perfection, like his Son ; And though mysterious still which ever way We view the origin of evil, thus We learn to bow beneath its powerful sway, And kiss the hand that chastens man for good. Come, then, and bow the willing mind to bear The light and easy yoke which God designs To prove his sons, and fit them for a state As far above this poor and earthly life, As earth is far beneath the stars of heaven. One hath he sent commissioned by himself, Bearing the stamp and signature of God, On his great embassage, to lead the way, And ope the portals of Eternity. One hath he sent, whose high transcendant love Beams with such force in his majestic mind, As should persuade us to embrace his laws, And meekly follow what he meekly taught. Who in full sacrifice of life out-poured, To testify his tender care of man, Proved such compassion and such grace divine, As should infuse in us an equal love"], [256, "240 CREATION. And willingness to serve his glorious cause. Who sole hath overcome our mighty foe, And opened paradise regained in heaven. From whom alone the wounded conscience finds The balm of consolation here on earth. Through whom both sin and evil lose their sting, And ' death is swallowed up in victory.' Look to the end to which creation tends, And in the change which this life terminates, Behold not evil, but a blessed hope Of rest, for such as seek that rest aright. And in the new creation yet to come, Shall be explained whate'er of mystery dims Creation as at present seen ; when clouds Which now obscure the sight shall disappear, And dissipate in endless light, and life Begin and end in immortality.
