Borne on ambition's wings the Bard aspires To scale the empyrean fields of fame, There 'midst his tuneful art's creative sires To hang his laurels, and enshrine his name, Yet oft detraction foils his fond desires, Or the stern Critic's curb constrains his rising fires. Much wiser He, who conscious of the light Divine, that animates his frame of clay, Draws round the genial flame the garb of night And keeps it veiled like vestal charms from day Shunning the tempting, but the dangerous height, Where meteors rise to set, ephemeral as bright."], [12, "IV W Nor need a churlish pride the shroud maintain, Nor Fancy's every impulse be repressed. Some chosen few \u2014 may share the social strain, To some the song of love may be addressed; Responsive still to every kindred breast, And giving life and home new poignancy and zest Such was the Poet's unpretending lay, Which friendly care would rescue from decay, Nor drag with zeal profane, into unsought-for day. H. H"], [13, "ODES TO THE RAGAS, BHAIRAV, FIRST R AG A. ARGUMENT. The Rdga Bhairava is described in the following lines, as he is represented in the Rdga Mdlas of the Hindus, with the emblems and attributes of the god Siva, from whose mouth he is supposed to have proceeded; the form he wears is that of the deity in his state as an ascetic, smeared with ashes, and having his hair braided into the Jafd, whilst the Ganges meanders through his tresses ; his forehead is ornamented with a half-moon, and one hand wields the T risul or trident, whilst the other holds the Damru, a small hour- glass shaped drum ; his neck is entwined by a serpent and the chaplet of skulls worn both by Siva and his terrific consort, compleats the decoration of this musical personification. ed. ED. Bhairav at Siv's creative voice appears, The three-ey'd god's majestic form he wears. With holy ashes spread, as camphire white, The Devta stands reveal'd to mortal sight. n"], [14, "2 His braided tresses bind his awful brows, From whence the sacred Ganges ever flows, And in the bosom of her hallow'd flood, Bears plenty, joy and universal good. Round his blue neck, in qjany a spiral fold, A living serpent twines its scaly gold : Mysterious emblem of perpetual youth, Great attribute of everlasting truth ! Full on his lofty front, serenely bright, A crescent sheds around its silver light, A massive trident in one hand he rears, A mystic Damru in the other bears. Twelve ghastly heads of human victims strung, Low on his breast in dreadful order hung, And round his throne at S'iv's command repair The guardian spirits of the flood and air."], [15, "3 COSHAC, SECOND R AsG A. ARGUMENT. This Rdga is more usually termed Mdlava in the Sanscrit lists, and Mdlcaus jit Hindi i the martial character given him in the following lines, is the creation of the poet, founded on the usual representa- tions of him, as a young athletic man clad in blue garments and wielding a club. ed- ED- Coshac appears with conquest on his crest, And every virtue glowing in his breast, Glitt'ring in arms, he calls his martial bands, And nations rush to bear his high commands ; His fatal standard to the winds unfurl'd, Blazes portentous o'er a guilty world. As bursts the thunder from the darkened skies, United shouts of gen'rous ardor rise, His eye beams valor, and the peopled plain, Is agitated like the stormy main ; b 2"], [16, "4 ij Slaughter and waste, black ministers of fate, Like tygers train'd the dreadful signal wait, Fear flies before and terror clouds the earth, As the thick gloom that gives the tempest birth. Giant ambition proudly daring stands To stem the torrent, with his hundred hands : He seems a tow'r on some fair mountain's side, Rais'd in the insolence of wealth and pride, Which in the front of an impervious wood, Frowns o'er the ocean and defies its flood, But frowns in vain : as waves by waves impell'd, Incessant legions pour into the field. Shock succeeds shock, 'till fate, resistless fate Calls the fell tyrant from his dream of state, And like the raging storm's collected gust, Hurls all his pageant glories in the dust. Rocks, hills and caves the flying crowd receive, Rocks, hills and caves but feeble shelter give, 'Till Coshac speaks the great and gen'rous word And bids the host \"of heroes sheathe the sword."], [17, "5 HINDOL, THIRD RAG A. ARGUMENT. The character and attributes of this Rdga, which are of the most joyous description, are faithfully given in the ode; the representa- s tion of the swing in which he is seated with a favourite damsel, always occurs in the delineations of him, and the amusement itself forms one of the most popular recreations of the Hindus. The s'yle of music personified by this Rdga and its divisions, is appropriated technically to the season of spring. E\u00a3. Beneath a swelling dome's majestic height, With golden stars and fretted glories bright, 'Midst chrystal columns of the purest ray, Whose lustre emulates the blaze of day ; Where emerald wreaths with living verdure crown' d, In mimic foliage twine the shafts around, Where the bright ruby never-fading glows, And mocks the transient splendor of the rose."], [18, "6 Hindol in regal majesty appears, A god's immortal form the monarch wears. Celestial youth, upon his blooming face Hath lavish'd ev'ry elegance and grace. Sweet are his notes, whene'er he chaunts his song, The soul of music dwells upon his tongue. The fawns erect their ears and gather round Drawn by the pleasing sorc'ry of sound. The warbling Shama list'ning from the spray Learns the wild sweetness of her morning lay. His flowing robes a fragrance round dispense, That fills the air and quickens ev'ry sense, Far richer than the musk-deer's costly spod, Or rich Chambeli s aromatic oil. A thousand virgins fairer than the morn.

The name of this Rdga, ' the In/lamer,' indicates his character, and is common to him, and to the god of love Ca'mabe'va, with whom he seems to be in a great degree identified; he is supposed to be the descendant of the sun, and the plastic power of that planet is blended in the description, with the properties of Eros, or the divine love, of the Greeks, who was so important an agent in the creation and preservation of matter. The hot season and hour of noon are the seasons appropriated to the performance of this style of music, and according to a well known story, its execution in a contest be- tween two eminent musicians in the time of Aceer, had very nearly set all Hindustan on fire, had not the catastrophe been prevented, by a seasonable exertion of the talents of one of the rivals, whose performance of the next Rdga brought down a timely shower. ed. 1.

ARGUMENT. Me'gh-Malha'r, the cloud-compelling Jove of the Hindus,\\s described in this. The whole is allegorical : he is the bridegroom of the earth ; his complexion dark, like the body of a thunder-cloud ; his robes white, like the edges of the cloud opposed to the sun's rays; light* ning is his diadem ; and the songs of the seven notes of music, (per* sonified,) are the thunde'rs which shake the universe. The Chdtecs are birds attendant upon him, who are supposed to be fed by the drops of falling rain. The lotos an aquatic flower, is his throne ; and the bow of Indra, to which his eye-brows are compared, is the rain-bow. Swell the pious note of praise, Songs of grateful transport raise, Till drooping groves and thirsty plains, Exulting hear the welcome strains : Rising winds, and black'ning skies, Thunder rolling from afar, Flashing fires of various dyes, All, the god's approach declare :"], [25, "13 Raise again, O Earth ! thy head, Haste, prepare the nuptial bed, Put forth all thy verdant pride, The bridegroom seeks his mystic bride.

Rous'd at his voice, in dignity supreme, Ganga pours forth her fertilizing stream, From lofty Himala's impervious woods, She summons all her tributary floods; A thousand torrents, rush at her command, And spread their treasures o'er a grateful land. The seven notes around him wait, Blest companions of his state, Each a blooming youth appears, Fairer than the morning's beam; Each a golden goblet bears, Fill'd with life's eternal stream.

ARGUMENT. The Rdgini Asdvari is supposed to possess the power of charming serpents with her melody; and the pictures of the Ra'g Ma'la, represent her as of exquisite beauty, with loose hair and naked to the waist, round which she wears a skirted zone of peacock's feathers ; she holds a serpent in each hand, and the antelopes and fawns at- tracted by the charms of her voice, are gazing upon her with earnest attention. A liberty has been taken to suppose she is employed by the gods, to charm the enormous serpent Ananta from the great deep, for the purpose of transporting the vast mountain Mandar to the ocean. Vide Wilkins's notes to the translation of the Bhagwat Gita, respecting the churning of the ocean, to obtain the Amrita, or butter of immortality.

This humorous composition is addressed to the monkey deity of the Hindus, the son of the wind, and friend and ally of Ra'machandiia, whom he accompanied with an army of monkeys, in that prince's invasion of Ceylon to recover his wife Si'ta\", carried off by Ra'va- u'a, the ten-headed sovereign of hand. Hanuma'n with his mon- keys, is fabled to have thrown into the sea, the rocks that are found in the strait, between Cape Comorin and Ceylon, for the passage of Ra'ma's troops, and they thence are termed Ra'ma's bridge by the Hindus ; the Musselmans call them Adam's bridge : in a secret ex- pedition to Lancd, Hanuma'n was taken prisoner, and condemned to be burnt, but he effected his escape when the flames had scarcely caught hold of his tail, with which he set fire on his flight, to the cjry ; he then bounded to the snowy mountains, to a peak still called Bender-puch'h, or monkey's tail, where he extinguished the com- bustion, by plunging the tail into the snow : most of these circum- stances are alluded to in the hymn, which is also in part a parody ,on Sir Wm.
