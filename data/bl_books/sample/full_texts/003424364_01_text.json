Printed by Jordison & Co., Ld., Middlesbrough, December 4th 1894"], [4, "THIS! PLOT The scene of the opera is laid in the Kingdom of Goa in India, during the sixteenth century, when the Portuguese forces are threatening the land. A young Princess, Nemea, cousin of the king, is rescued from drowning by a fisherman, Zephoris, who, after bringing her safely to land, discreetly retires on the approach of her friends, and she is lost to him for a time, although his short acquaintance has been sufficient to make him fall deeply in love with the young lady whose life ho has saved. The Prince Kadoor, who is a suitor for her hand, is somewhat of a traitor, and being desirous cf usurping the throne of Goa, employs a fisherman named Pifear to help him in an intrigue with the Poituguese for the deposition of the King. He learns that the Princess Nemea is determined to wed her rescuer, whom she can only recognise by his knowledge of what passed between them when she was saved from drowning. Kadoor learns from Zephoris the whole story, and is determined to make use of it, and declare himself to be the hero of the adventure. His words, however, appear unconvincing to the fair Nemea, but she is constrained to believe he is her rescuer, and reluctantly consents to be his bride. Afterwards we find the King and his cousin strolling by the sea shore, and they come upon a sleeping fisherman, who has traced on the sand at his head the words, \" If I were a King.\" This is none other than Zephoris, and the King thinks it would prove a diversion if he were made to believe himself a king, and, causing a potion to be administered to him, transports him in a somnolent state to the Palace, where, on awakening, Zephoris finds himself in the position of a King receiving the adulation of his subjects. He is, of course, quite bewildered, but finding that his slightest wish is obeyed, and all his commands promptly attended to, begins to realise that he must be a king indeed. Nemea approaches, and is imme diately recognised by him as the maiden he had saved from the sea, and he is on the point of disclosing his share in the affair when the Princess is adroitly withdrawn by Kadoor, whose plans only narrowly escape frustration. Zephoris, by his knowledge of what was passing between the Portuguese and the traitors around the throne, is able to save the State by countermanding certain orders given by Kadoor ; and, declaring his part in the rescue of the Princess, is assured of the return of his affection by Nemea, and, as King, announces his betrothal to the Princess. The real King, however, now thinks his joke has gone far enough, and by administering another potion, has the soi-disant monarch transported back to his humble hut by the sea shore. His comrades hear him declare he is a king, and think him mad, but presently the Princess comes on the scene, and mutual explanations culminate in a renewal of their declarations of love. Kadoor, now at his wits' end, demands the death of the fisherman for his alleged betrayal of the kingdom to the Portuguese, but Zephoris is able to show that Kadoor is the traitor, and by the help of his accomplice, Pifear, who admits his share in the plot to sell the kingdom to the invaders, brings the guilt home to him. Kadoor is then compelled to relinquish his command of the army, which is given to Zephoris. The young fisherman returns victorious, and is eventually rewarded with the hand of the fair Princess Nemea,"], [5, "KING FOR A DAY. Scene \u2014 The Sea Shore of Goa is discovered, together with people who are starting to fish. Act 1. CHORUS. The sun shines bright let us sail away ; And profit by this lovely day, Our gladsome strains that sill the air To distant shores tbe waves will bear, (Enter Pifear). Pif Zephoris, Zephoris, where is Zephoris (to the Fishermen Have you not seen him ? Omnes No, No ! Pif Oh Brahma 1 what bad luck. Omnes Why not fish without him ? Pif Without him it's quite impossible, Omnes Why ? Pif Because he couldn't fish without me ; Omnes What a funny thing. Tell us why, pray, tell us why. Pif Then listen : \u2014 SONG.\u2014\" For Worth and Singleness of Heart.\" For worth and singleness of heart, No better comrade, could be found, Then good Zephoris \u2014 for my part I feel, to praise him I am bound. Yet of my help he hath great need, His net he foolishly neglects, E'en ot chance luck he takes small heed, And all the finest fish ejects, He seeks for coral, and for pearls This seems to be his only aim, Back to the deep all else he hurls ; Ah 1 poor Zephoris, who's to blame ? He's comely and he's well disposed, But lacks in energy of mind, To me his thoughts seem all foreclosed, As fisherman he's too refined, He's timid \u2014 shy, and ill at ease When mixing with our village folk, The girls Zephoris \u2014 try to tease With them, he's a standing joke, For making love I'm bound to say He'll play a sorry part, Or, rather, I that part must play To win for him some maiden's hea"], [6, "2 Pif But who comes here ? It is Zizel. 'Tis the coastguard of our co?st, he is bard, cruel, and UDJust, and should he find us here, blackmail he'll make us pay, come \u2014 let's away. (Enter Zizel, the coastguard). Zizel 0 stop there, stay, my little lambs. Before you go to fish, you must, first answer me; everyone shall have their turn, so I'll begin with thee. Pif Even a helpless lamb, it struggles to be free. Zizel Every one shall have their turn, so I'll begin with thee, for what thou'st done 'tis surely clear. Thy punishment should be severe, If I judge wrong the charge deny, If I judge right at ODce reply ! A crime like thine deserves a fine. No answer yet ! 'tis well for tbee, That thou hast first to deal with me. Pif I do protest, I've done no wrong. Zizel Perhaps not as yet, but I'm sure, Thou wilt 'ere long ; So 'tis my duty to impose on thee a fine ! Now pay the fine ; should 'st thou fail, then away to the jail. (Pifear gives him money), (to Zelide) 'Tis now your turn. Come here, my pretty oue. Zelide Ob, dear me ! Zizel Of a dreadful oflence (Enter Zephoris). Back, I say ; Omnes Zephoris ! Zephoris (to Zizel) Old maD, by my faith, if crime enormous there be It is this shameful trade carried on by thee ; Zizel Young man refrain thy fiery speech, Remember thou too art within my reach. Zelide Wreak thy wrath upon another, But in pity spare my brother. Zephoris My sister ! cease to implore him, Plead no longer ! Not on his mandate my safety depends, For our great Brahma, whose arm is stronger, Will ne'er irjure the brother who his sister defends. Chorus and All \u2014 Cease to implore, &c. Zizel To prison thou must go, so come along with me I Oiines To prison ? Zelide My dear good sir, Oh, do be lenient now, For I most solemnly doth vow My loving brother ne'er so base would be, To raise his hand to injure thee. Zizel Guards, stand aside ! my duty I'll fulfil, Against this man we've no ill will ; First I'll hear the reason why She the charges doth deny (Zelide puts apiece of money in his hand)"], [7, "3 Zizel T'is well I find we're of one mind ! (Zelide puts another piece in his hard). That likewise I prize, give me another; (puts another piece in his hand). That exonerates thy brother, For thy good reasons Zephoris is free. You see my duty I fulfil, For justice never bears ill will; * Take my advice, fishermen, Avoid, if possible, the lion's den, For myself I really have done well. Chorus \u2014 The Sun Shines bright, &c. (Exit all. Zephoris, Zelide, and Pifear remain). Zephoris Stay, Pifear, I wish to speak to you. Pif To me ? Zephoris And also to you, my sister, (he takes their hands) Zelide What canst thou have tu say to me ? Zephoris You cast down your eyes, you blush, tittle sister, you know what 1 have to say to you. Pif But I have not blushed ; I have not cast down my eye3 : I don't know what it is you have to tell us. Zephoris Well, well, I will tell thee all, my friend \u2014 There is a beautiful girl who is foolish enough to be in love with you ; Pif You call that foolish ? I think it is a matter of taste ; Zephoris However to me any weakness of heart is excusable, for does not my love overcome my reason ? So you have but to ask and I will give you her hand. Pif Her hand, but what with it Zephoris Ab ! you wish to know how much money we have ? Very well, ask Zelide, for she holds the purse ; Pif Oh ! tell me, Zelide, how much is in it? Zel (lowering her eyes) Nothing ! We have nothing ! Zeph Nothing, Zelide ? But what has become of that left us by our father ? Zel Until now, I have kept silent, for fear of troubling you, my brother, but to-day I do not wish to deceive anyone, and I will tell you the truth ; Zeph Speak Zel For a long time, dear Zephoris, your fishing has been un- fortunate, and you have returned home so sad and downcast, that I could not reproach you, and I used piece by piece all the money that our father left us. Zeph Oh, pardon me, my dear Zelide ! pardon me ; Zel It is not your fault, if the fish don't come into your nets. Pif The fish ! Why if they come into his nets, he throws them out ! Zel Does he ? Pif He won't have anything to io with whiting, he despises the mullet, and throws the turbot back into the sea. Zel Can it be true ? Pif What he wants is coral, or a bank of lovely pearls, or \u2014 he is a fool in short !"], [8, "4 Zel Enough, enough. Then, brother, she whom ycu love is rich? Zeph I don't know. It was on a beautiful summer evening, and while wandering alone on this shore, suddenly I heard a cry of despair, and saw a young girl drowning. I jumped off a high rock into the sea to help her, and soon, the poor girl was safely in my arms. For a long time I straggled against the current which was running with great force, but at last I brought her safely to this spot, and on these sands I placed her. Ashamed of my appearance, I ran away to hide myself, for I wished to spare her all embarrassment. Zel And have you never seen her again ? Zeph Never. Whether she is of humble birth like you, my sister, or whether she is noble, I don't know. SONG. \u2014 \"Angels dwell beyond the skies.\" I cannot tell from whence she came, Nor yet her origin, or name ; I saved her from the raging sea, And this is all that's known to me. I saw her face, 'Twas full of grace, Her eyes were bright, With Heavenly light. Whether a being of the earth, Or whether one of noble birth, All this to me can only seem The recollection of a dream. I seek for her, both far and near, Sometimes with hope \u2014 sometimes with fear, This ring which from her finger fell Which I have guarded safe and well : Like compass true Might be a clue, To her I seek \u2014 It seems to speak, For when I sigh it seems to say \u2014 In seeking \u2014 seek not far away ; Then quickly other thoughts arise \u2014 For angels dwell beyond the skies. Zel Alas, poor Zephoris, where will your love lead you 1 Zeph Oh, a hundred times I have tried to forget it, but could not. Day and night her image is ever before my eyes. Pif Shut your eyes then ! Zeph But my dream is over now. Fond hopes, away ! I wish to regain that which my selfishness has made you lose. In two ' months, I will have refunded all that our father left us. In two months you shall be united. Zel My dear good Zephoris (embraces him). Pif My dear brother-in-law (embraces Zeph. awkwardly, Zeph. repulses him). Zeph Come, let us go. Pif I cannot leave ; I have to wait here for a customer. Zeph To whom you sell fish ?"], [9, "5 Pif No, he is a lord for whom I carry letters ; love-letters I suppose, for which he gives me two pieces of gold. Zeph Love \u2014 or treason, who knows ? Pif Treason ! Zeph I distrust the honesty of this lord ; however, it is your affair. Pif I see my customer coming, so good-bye, \u2014 Farewell (Exit Zel and Zeph). (Enter Kadoor.) Kad Thou art punctual ! It is well, but remember to be silent. Pif I will, my lord, mute as a fish. Kad Very good, for if thou speakest a word I will cut off thy head. Pif (aside, trembling) Cut off my head 1 Ah, Zephoris said truly, this looks like treason. Kat> If thou servest me with discretion I will pay generously. This letter will be the last : and for this I will give thee three pieces of gold. Pit (looking at gold) Three pieces of gold ! Zephoris deceived him- self, he must be a lover. Kad Stay, thou wilt take it to-morrow, when thou goest with the other fishermen. Pif Certainly, \u2014 -then to-morrow the fair lady will have the letter, for it is for a fair lady ? Kad Thou hast guessed rightly, but not a word. Pif Not a single word. (Exit Ptf.) Kad. All goes well. This fisherman is a fool. He has not the least suspicion of the important mission with which I have charged him. Sleep od in luxury, insolent King, thy enemy waits. But whom have we here? 'Tis the King and our beautiful cousin. They will suspect something. I must keep to the plan and must see that all is right. (Exit Kadoor.) Scene 2. \u2014 The Palace Garden of the King is revealed with the Portuguese tleet in the distance. Chorus\u2014\" All praise to Brahma.\" All praise to Brahmin \u2014 honour be To him who show'rs gifts on thee, Behold the royal diadem ! Beset with many a precious gem. The golden crown thou weareth now 'Twas he who placed on thy brow ; 'Tis Brahmin who thy course directs, 'Tis he who thee from harm protects, Who 'neath a sky so clear and blue Gives thee this brilliant retinue. Enter King aud Semea from Palace. Kino Let's rest awhile beneath these trees T\" enhale the freshness of the breeze, The pure air from the seas. Nemea How beautiful is nature here Reflected in these waters clear, How beautiful is nature hero displayed."], [10, "6 Kino Glorious is nature in this grand display, Before it all my greatness lades away. What sayest thou, my pretty cousin ? Nemea Oh, mighty King, by right divine, This people \u2014 kingdom\u2014 all are thine. Then why so much humility ? For thee the streamlets gently flow, Making sweet music as they go ; Our garden yields the choicest flow'rs, To deck thy palace and thy bow'rs. Those stately palm trees tow'ring high Are planted there to charm thine eye ; The rose aud jessamine in bloom Exhale for thee their rich perfume ; The ships that hither treasures bring, All these are thine, oh mighty King ! King Not so, my charming little elf, Methinks thou dost deceive thyself ; The streamlets that so gently flow, Making sweet music as they go \u2014 The stately palm trees tow'ring high, Spreading their branches to the sky \u2014 The rose, the jessamine's perfume, Each fragrant herb, each flow'r in bloom, Brahma provides \u2014 not for the King, But for Nature's fairest Queen. Chorus. \u2014 \" All praise to Brahma,\" &c, and Exit. Enter Kadoor. King Ah, it is our good cousin ! I was surprised at not seeing you amidst the lords of our court. But the presence of Nemea reassures me, and I just said to her : \" Princess, as thou art with me, we Bhall not be long before we see the Prince Kadoor.\" KXD The flowers ever attract the bees ; Nemea And the wasps. Kad (with anger) Princess, thou do\u00bbst not like me, and perhaps it would be wiser to renounce all idea of an alliance. Nemea I will tell thee frankly. Prince Kadoor, my heart I no longer possess. King Thou lovest another ? Kad (with eagerness) And who is this man Nemea I don't know. Kad But, Princess \u2014 Nemea Listen, and thou shalt learn all. Some months ago I had a fancy for bathing at a place close by here. Suddenly an unknown current carried me away. I struggled, I screamed, and finally sank under the waves. When I came to myself I was lying on the sands. I asked my attendants who it was that saved me. They said, \" We have seen no one ; you must have been rescued by a messenger from heaven, who has vanished on our approach.\" King Kadoor, do you believe that Brahma sent a messenger ? Kad I, thy Majesty ?"], [11, "7 Nemea Oh, I don't believe that Brahma sent a messenger. My rescuer may have come from a boat I had seen at a distance. Kad If that is the only obstacle, Princess, I will dare to pre- dict that he who keeps silent now, from motives of discretion ; will remain silent, out of respect for us, when we are married. Nemea So be it. He will not make himself known ; but, if I discover him, I shall break with you. Kad Then, Princess, this is your decision ? Nemea Yes. If he who saved me, comes to me and repeats to me the words I cried out in my despair when I was drowning, I will give him my heart and hand, if his Majesty permits it. Kino (icith feigned severity) And if I don't, Princess ? Nemea Then, your Majesty, I will withdraw my hand. King (laughing) I understand. Nemea Is not that the Royal yacht I see in the distance ? King Yes, Princess. Nemea If your majesty likes we will continue our walk, while we wait for the yacht. King Very well. Will yon accompany us, Kadoor ? Kad No, your majesty, I have some orders to give ; I will at the same time see the royal rowers. King Your hand, Nemea. (As they are going off] Zephoris and Pifear enter at back. Zeph. seeing Xemea, utters a cry, and comes jront as if in a dream.) Zeph Great heaven, it is she ! Kad What does that fellow say ? Pif She whose life you saved ? Zeph Ah ! it is no illusion. Kad (to Pif.) Get thee to thy boat, fisherman, and on behalf of the King, go on board that yacht thou seest yonder. Pif The King ? The King sends me on a message. Oh, my fortune is made ! Exit Pifear. Zeph My lord, will you deign to say who that lady is, so richly dressed, walking yonder? Kad It is the Princess Nemea. Zeph A Princess ? Kad Why that question ? Zeph Pardon me, my lord, you could not understand [he wishes to el de him.) Kad (holding him back) Thou deceivest thyself, I understand thy emotion, and I know that thou didst save the Princess when her life was in danger. Zeph Who has told you ? Kad The Princess herself. Zeph She ? Kad And is it true that thou didst save hor ? Zeph Yes, my lord. Kad How long ago ? Zeph It will be eight months to-morrow. Kad And when thou badst rescued her from death \u2014 where didst thou carry her ? Zeph I carried her here."], [12, "8 Kad Here ? But tell me the words she cried out when she- thought herself lost. Zeph Ah, well do I remember tbem. She cried : \" My mother, my mother, from heaven above, protect me ! \" Kad Marvellous 'tis thou, 'tis thou who her life has saved, 1 will tell Nemea that I have found thee, and I can tell thee that she hopes thou wilt fulfil her wishes Zeph Speak, my lord, what does she wish ? Any desire of hers will be to me like an order from the king. What does she wish ? Kad - That thou shouldst promise, never to tell anyone, that it was the Princess whom thou didst save, also that thou should'st never attempt to approach her, in short, that thou shonld'st never let anyone know, that a common fisherman held her in his arms for a single instant. Zeph Oh my dream, my beautiful dream ! It has all passed1 now. Kad Dost thou consent to take this oath to me ? Zeph Say to her, my lord, that the Princess Nemea has nothing to fear from the poor fisherman Zephoris. Hear my solemn oath 1 I swear, my lord, to he silent for ever. Kad And never to approach her! Zeph (with an effort) \u2014 and never to approach her. I swear it by Brahma, who hears me. Kad Very good (offers purse) I will tell her thou hast sworn,. and will add, thou hast received thy reward. Zeph Yes, my lord, I have received my reward, a thousand'. times more precious than this which I refuse. Kad What ? Zeph This lady so noble, and so haughty, I have held in my arms. Her proud heart has beaten against mine, and when I snatched her from the jaws of death, my lips dared to press her forehead ; tell her this, my lord, and she will under- stand that I have been well rewarded, and that I have no need of your gold. Exit Zeph. Kad He dares to brave me, so much the worse for him, but he will keep silent. He has sworn, and Nemea will yet be mine, but that man's oath is not enough. Well \u2014 he must be got rid of. The king and princess, \u2014 now, to enact my part (he seems to think deeply). Enter King and Nemea King Still here ! Kad Your Majesty \u2014 pardon \u2014 I \u2014 Nemea In what grave reflections were you plunged ? Kad I was dreaming, prince ; of all you said to me just now Nemea And you thought ? Kad I thought that he who saved your life, would be foolish to keep silence any longer. Nemea You know him then ? Kad 1 know him. Ni- .ea Oh ! tell me his name, I pray you.
