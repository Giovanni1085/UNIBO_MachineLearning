In this situation stands New South Wales. Circumnavigators have fre quented it, and the Public have been favoured with the Accounts of Individuals who have resided there, but no prior attempt has been made to produce a Complete History of the Country itself, from its Discovery, and an Account of its Inhabitants, their Customs, and Manners, accompanied with, an Historical Detail, of the proceedings of the English Colony, from the Foundation to its Present State."], [58, "PREFACE. That such a Work must prove acceptable to the World in general, but particularly to his fellow Countrymen, the Author is well aware ; and as his residence in the Country, enables him to add considerably to the vast fund of know ledge already ascertained, he trusts, that his endeavour to furnish A Complete History of New South Wales, will meet with gene ral approbation. If in the perusal, of this Work, the refined mind finds but a few mo ments pleasure, in following the interesting Narratives respecting the Natives or Colonists ; or if he is beguiled of one tear of sensibility, in commisserating the sorrows or sufferings, of his innocent or guilty fellow creatures, the end of the Author will be answered : for though, alas ! he has formerly wandered in the paths of error, he trusts, that now he has felt the kind hand of patronizing favour, he may be looked upon as a Man endeavouring to bo well, and hopes the promotion he has received, will be the means of enabling him to effect, some good in the remnant of his life, to counter- balance that proneness to evil which is ever, too attendant on the Human Creature."], [59, "INTRODUCTION. Ihe important advantages, which will conti nually result to the Mother Country, from New South Wales, renders it of sufficient consequence to make the slightest information sought after with anxious avidity \u2014 nor is it a matter of surprise. \u2014 The Climate is healthy, the Soil good, and the very Bowels of the Earth is fraught with inexhaustible treasures ; it con tains Iron, Copper, and Coals; while the exterior abounds in Wood, and the Fruits, which are vari ous, reach the summit of perfection, these ad vantages will accelerate the growing importance of the Trade and Commercial Interest of the Country, while Bays and Harbours offer their sheltering protection to Ships. Yet considerable as these advantages are, they are very far surpassed, by the School the English Colony forms, for the Correction of those un fortunate Human Beings, who, urged by various depraved motives, forfeit the protection of the Laws they have failed to observe ; it is much to be lamented, that the number of Objects thus"], [60, "INTRODUCTION. exiled is so great, while it is highly honourable in a Government to afford, even these outcasts, an opportunity of being serviceable to the state, and by their own good conduct, ulti mately to themselves. \u2014 To the original Projec tor of the Colony, (Lord Sydney) the Public are under great obligations, and no doubt can now arise of its success. \u2014 Though it must prove painful to observe, that many sent to New South Wales, continued incorrigible \u2014 yet, on the contrary, some in the infancy of the Colony, will be found reforming rapidly, and the penitence of a few, cannot be but accept able to Man, since in Heaven there is joy over even one sinner that truly repents. In executing the History of New South Wales, I shall avail myself of all my materials, under a regular series of Chapters ; first tracing the Discovery, then the Nature, Customs, and Manners of its original Inhabitants, from that I shall proceed to the Plan for settleing the Co lony, its Foundation and Progress to the present Ti'me ; and lastly, the Natural History of the Island, thus endeavouring to present a Complete Whole."], [61, "THE HISTORY OF NEW SOUTH WALES. CHAP. I. In contemplating the origin, rise, and fall of nations, the mind is alternately filled with a mixture of sacred pain and pleasure. And while the \" minds eye,\" views the prosperous state of this infant country, it can hardly refrain, taking an excursive glance at the United States of America, and at the same time, find itself, obliged to acknowledge, that it must prove equally great, and ardently hope, it will prove abundantly more grateful, to the mother coun try. The beautiful and fertile island of New South Wales, is ascertained to be the largest in the world, and formerly supposed to be part of that imagi nary continent, called Terra Australis Incognita, lies between 10 degrees 50 minutes, and 4S degrees South latitude, and between 110 and"], [62, "HISTORY Ot1 6 153 degrees 30 minutes East longitude, ex tending^ all as much, as the whole continent of Europe, the Eastern coast running not less than 2000 miles in length from North-East to South-West. Its dimensions from East to West has not been so accurately ascertained. The Dutch navigators who chiefly explored the Island, called those parts first, discovered Eendraght {Concord) Land, which was the name of the ship that first made the land, in 1616, 24 degrees and 25 degrees South. Two years after wards, Zeachen discovered another part of the coast, in 15 degrees South, who named it Arnheim Dieman, though this was not the same part that received the name of Dieman's Land from Tasman, which is the extremity Southward, in latitude 43 degrees. Jan Van Edelsgave in 1619, has given his own name to a Southern part. Dampier coasted the Western parts in 1687, and again in 1699; from this period it was visited several times, by the Dutch and others, but nothing* of any conse^ quence transpired till in 1770, when the cele brated Captain Cook, explored the country, and called it New South Wales ; however, the shortness of his stay precluded him from making any thing more than general observa tions, though Sir Joseph Banks, (then Mr. Banks,) discovered such an ample field for botanical researqh, that one part, in compli ment to him, was called Botany Bay. \u2014 It will not be requisite to relate here, the remarks made by Captain Cook, as we shall incorporate"], [63, ""], [64, "AMALE r JFJEMAI\u00c6 NATIVE , -^Hyft*d.iror.-iJi<90!t.tyIl\u00a3.Ji}rtes. Ha/zrnoster How"], [65, "new south wales. 9 his with all other information through the course of the work. Therefore shall now pro ceed in the proposed plan ; first with the Nature, customs, and manners of the natives. Both the male and female natives, are not generally tall, and very few of either sex are well made, their limbs are long and thin, the exercise they take, and the poverty of their living, must be the cause, for the climate is particularly fine. But the limbs of those who reside in the woods, exceed in length those on the coast ; for these suffer very great difficul ties to procure food, while those on the coast draw from the never-failing ocean an ample supply of fish ; but the inhabitants of the \u25a0woods have to hunt and climb trees for animals and honey ; enabled by the parental hand of providence they effect this, with little labour armed with a stone hatchet, they cut a notch in the tree big enough to place the ball of the great toe, which done, they take the first step, embracing the tree with one arm, and holding the hatchet in the other, in this situation the next notch is cut higher up, for the other foot to rest on, and proceeding thus they reach as high as they wish, which is often from eighty to an hundred feet. The features of the men >.*-."], [66, "10 HISTORY OF are hard and disgusting, and the bone or reed they wear through the nose, added to the busby hair of their heads and beards, render them almost horrible. The females have a small portion of that delicacy the more refined females of civilized nations justly boast; indeed, even the blush of shame has been seen, on the dark cheeks of a female native of New South Wales. Their eyes are sunk in the head, and covered with thick eye-brows; their noses are flat, with very wide nostrils; their eyes are particularly good, and forms to them the greatest acquisi tion, for if short sighted, they could not avoid the spears which would otherwise Wound, if not kill them. Their mouths are wide, and lips very thick ; their teeth are in general white, sound, and even. Some of them have promi nent jaws, and one of them, called old We rahng, might with great ease pass for an Orang- Outang. Both sexes rub fish-oil into their skins, which with the heat of their own bodies, produce a stench which by no means accords with the refined ideas of decency ; but this is used to guard against the musquitoes some of which sting with severity ; however in this, as in all other parts, some are more beastly than others, and it is by no means uncommon to see the entrails of fish frying upon their heads in the sun, till the oil runs over the face and body. This unguent is deemed by them of so much"], [67, "11 NEW SOUTH WALES. importance, that children even of two years old are taught the use of it. The natives of this country have various ornaments ; with gum, they fasten to their hair, fish-bones, birds' feathers, slips of wood, dogs' tails, and the teeth of the kangaroo ; those on the South of Botany Bay, plat the hair with gum, like pieces of rope, and, occasionally, they daub themselves' with red and white clay, the latter previous to dancing, and the former to battle. The forms of these imagined ornaments are governed by the taste of the person ; and really, those who excel in this plastic art, look like spectres. Scars are by both sexes deemed highly orna mental, inasmuch, that they are proud to have wounds made with shells, and as they keep these open the flesh grows up on each side, and then suffering it to skin over, it forms the honourable badge of a wale or seam. This operation is generally performed when young, and though for many years they continue full, in the decline of life they become nearly invi sible. The hole, which is bored through the nose, between the age of twelve and fifteen, is only used on particular occasions to put the reed or bone in ; this ceremony is generally confined to the male, though there are instances of the females undergoing the same mutilation. The women suffer another operation when in fants, which is the loss of two joints of the little finger on the left hand, this is effected by a hair being tied round the joint, which stops the circulation, when the part drops off in"], [68, "12 history op consequence of mortification; very few indeed escape this loss, and those few who do, are treated with contempt. The men too suffer a privation, most of them lose the right front tooth, which operation is attended with numerous ceremonies. The principals who perform it, come from Cam mey-ray, armed with shields, clubs, and throw ing sticks, painted in the form of their tribe; the ground selected for the business is pre viously cleared in an oval figure of about 30 feet by 20, and this mystic spot is called Yoo-lahng : the operators arrived, take their position at one end of it, and at the other end the boys, generally to the number of from 14 to 20, and of various ages, who are brought by their friends or relations to undergo the ceremony, which initiates them into the liber ties of men, as soon as they are capable of per forming the duties. The ceremony then begins, from the opposite end of the Yoo-lahng, the armed party advance, singing and clattering their shields and spears, and with their feet kicking up dust enough to hide and choak every body around them ; on nearly reaching the children, one of the armed men steps forward, and seizing a lad returns to his party, who hail him by a shout, showing at the same time, a de termination to keep and protect the victim ; in this way the whole are taken and seated on the opposite end of the Yoo-lahng, each with his legs crossed under him, holding down his head. and clasping his hands. Miserable as this situ-"], [69, ""], [70, ""], [71, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 13 ation must be, it is not to be altered during the night, and till all the ceremony concludes, no refreshment is to be given them. \u2014 As the natives are well aware, that the knocking out the tooth is attended with considerable pain, the performers of the mystic rites have cunning enough to impress on the minds of those about to suffer, that on their being deli vered of a bone, for which farce they conceal one in a girdle, that the operation will be ef fected with a proportionate degree of ease, as they suffer the greater degree of \"pain. Thus one falls on the ground, and draws himself into every form that ideal pain can invent, and while in this state, some dance, some sing, and some beat him, till he produces the won derful bone that is to perform the operation with little or no pain. This closes the first act of the farce, and with it generally closes the day. Towards sunrise the next morning, the party advance into the Yoo-lahng, shouting, and running three times round it. The operators now parade round the Yoo lahng, on their hands and feet like dogs, with a wooden sword in the girdle, which from the position it takes behind, serves to represent the tail ; this is meant to endow them with the good qualities of that animal. The next cere mony is, one brings into the circle a kangaroo made of grass, and a. second a load of brush wood, and it is not unusual for him to have 6ome in his nose. These are laid at the feet of the young men, and the bearers retire. By this"], [72, "14 HISTORY OF form they are supposed to have the power of killing the animal given them, and the brush wood is the retreat of the kangaroo. \u2014 The following scene is to shew them one of the exercises, hunting the kangaroo ; for this pur pose they leave the boys some time, and taking off the sword, or dog's-tail, they fasten some long grass to the girdles, and approach the circle as a herd of kangaroos, jumping* along to the music of a shield, beat with a club. On reaching the Yoo-lahng, they pass the boys, then throwing away the grass tails, each takes up a boy and carries him off to the next scene, which is opened by several laying on the ground. The boys are then made to stand together; at each end sits a man on the stump of a tree, with his arms extended : as the boys make towards these, the men begin to stare and loll out their tongues ; the boys are now led over the men, who then make a noise like thunder at a great distance. This is meant to make them brave men. The whole party then stop and the boys are set down. At the same time the performers, arm with spear and shield, the whole then poise and present their spears, at every third stroke which one gives his sheild with a club, who stands in the centre. This is to shew the use of the spear to the youths. The scene that follows, is the ceremony of knocking out the tooth. A native sits on the grass, and a lad is seated on his shoulders. Now the mystic bone is produced to lance the gum, for which purpose it is made"], [73, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 15 sharp ; a stick is then with great ceremony cut at some distance from the end, and laid on a tree, then three aims are taken before it is struck, when the gum is cut, the operator puts the sharp point of the stick on the tooth, and with a stone in the other hand, after making three aims, he hits the stick, and out falls the tooth, generally as perfect as if drawn by a dentist. The lad is then taken away, that the gum may be healed by his friends, Avho dress him as he must for some time appear; which dress, consists of a girdle a wooden sword, and a ligature round his head ; for that day, he must neither eat or speak, and his left hand must be kept up to his mouth. It is deemed honourable to bear this operation without any sign of dissatisfaction, but for fear all should not have fortitude enough to bear it, the assistants make a great noise. It is curious that the sufferer adds to his own name that of the person, on whose shoulders he sits to have the operation performed. The ceremony being ended, and the youths all dressed alike, they sit down, and on a sud den given signal, they rise and rush into the town, which is just by, and drive every body before them. These are now allowed to use the spear and shield, and accepted as men. One good quality these people certainly pos sess, which is, that if a man and his wife, on anv occasion quarrel, no one takes the least notice of it, each present minds his own business without casting even a luok, at the wrangling"], [74, "HISTORY OF 16 pair. This is, perhaps, one of the best lessons these savages afford to civilized society ; and in this instance, the children of nature shew more sense than those of refinement. The men fish with a fish-gig, or spear, which they are very dexterous in the use of. The fish gig is about twelve feet long, which they can lenghten by joints, according to the depth of the water. At the end they have two, three, or four barbed prongs, with a hook of a fish or other bone ; sometimes, in fine weather, a man will lay across his canoe with his face in or near the water, and his fish-gig ready for darting : thus they watch for prey, and seldom miss their aim. The women are employed in the canoes with lines and hooks ; the lines are made of the bark of trees, the hooks, like those used by the men, are made of bits of shells and birds talons, in one of their miserable canoes, which is seldom more than six inches from the surface of the water, washing the edge nearly in surf, which would frighten many seamen in a good vessel, the youngest child, if very small, lies in its mother's lap, from whence it cannot fall, though she is busy fishing, as she sits in the bottom of the canoe, with her knees up to her breast ; thus, between her knees and body, the child is secure. The men also dive and procure fish from the rocks under water, where they often remain a considerable time ; when rising to the surface they throw on shore what they have gained, to a person who attends to dress it by broiling on a fire kept ready for the purpose."], [75, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 17 They have a curious way of catching birds. A native, will in the heat of the sun lay down as if asleep, holding a bit of fish in his hand; the bird seeing the bait, seizes on the fish, and the native then catches it. The spirit of retaliation, and ideas of honor they entertain, produces some singular circum stances, of which the following is one : A native of Botany Bay had been beaten by two natives of another tribe, one of these was in return to be beaten by him ; for this purpose a party attended over night at the edge of a stream, near the settlement, to dance, which they continued doing till past twelve o'clock : the man who was to be beat danced with the rest, and then lay down among them. The next morning, while he was asleep at the foot of a tree, the one who was to beat him and an other armed with spears and clubs, rushed on him; one threw his spear at him, but missed his object, when the other gave him two blo-ws with his club. This awoke him, he got up, but being unarmed, he sorrowfully hung down his head ; no more blows were given, and his enemy wiped the blood from his wounds *with some grass : after this they were friends, for having satisfied his revenge he forgot the injury he formerly received. The great trouble they have in obtaining fire makes them seldom be without it; when it so happens, a number seat themselves in a circle, and as it is a work of great labour each takes a i>"], [76, "18 HISTORY OF turn when the other is tired. It is performed by fixing the cylindrical piece of wood in a hollow made in a plane, the round part is then twirled round swiftly between both the hands, sliding them up and down, and thus it goes round till the wished-for fire is produced. The men often singe the beard, which is deemed one of the most painful operations they can undergo. These people, whose natural capacity so little can be urged in favour of, display in some cases extraordinary ingenuity, for various figures have been discovered, cut on the surface of large stones, representing themselves in dif ferent attitudes, their canoes, fish, and animals; and when that rudeness of the instruments, they must necessarily have used is considered, they exhibit perhaps, generally speaking, as strong likenesses as many portraits painted by our own artists in England. The natives had no conception of boiling water originally, for when the crew of a boat were boiling- some fish, a native, while our people were at a little distance, put his hand in to get some fish, and was of course scalded, and much astonished. Both the male and female natives are particu larly filthy in their food, indeed they care not what they devour, even the vermin from the head and maggots from trees they deem a great relish ; and not content with what may come in their way by chance, they throw pieces of"], [77, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 19 wood at the end of a line into the water to catch worms, maggots, and other vermin. Though a trivial offence in their ideas jus tifies the murder of each other, they highly reprobate the crime, wheji committed without what they esteem a just cause, and the relations of the slain seek redress by retaliation. The colour of the natives, is by no means uniform, some are of a copper colour, while others are perfectly black, but so filthy are they in their persons that their appearance is gene rally that of dirty black; when first born the skin is of a red hue, which in a few weeks turns to the colour of the parents, and then it never changes again. DWELLINGS. Those who repose on the soft pillow of ease will doubtless pity the situation of these savages, to the regular-built house, the protecting door, and the refreshing bed they are equally strangers. The miserable huts in which these people exist are made of the barks of trees, placed with both ends on the ground. Those near the coast are larger than those in the woods, which are generally formed only of one bark, and shelter one person, while the large ones hold five or six. At the mouth of each dwelling is, in most cases a nest of insects, drawn together by the bones and remnants of their food, and close to the hut is the fire which renders it smokey. Accidents by fire are frequent, many burn"], [78, "HISTORY OF 20 their toes and legs while asleep, and so very difficult are they to awaken, that a child is often seriously burnt while sleeping in the arms of the mother. Excavations in the rocks, also serve them for dwellings, which affords them protection from both wind and rain ; in these caves they mix without discrimination, and if undisturbed enjoy the comforts of sleep. These people certainly, have fewer ideas of building any place to shelter them from the weather than any savages ever discovered, for those who build the bark huts, are very few compared to the whole. Generally speaking, they prefer the ready made habitations they find in the rocks, which perfectly accords with the roving manner in which they live, for they never stay long in one situation, and as they travel in tribes together, even making the bark huts would engage them more time than they would be happy on one spot. CHILDREN. Among the natives of this country, neither the midwife, or man-midwife, would find any employ, for females receive no assistance, and women only are suffered to be present, as the children are suffered to come into the world by the efforts of nature, and if is by no means un common to see the woman a few hours after her deli very walking about as usual. The new born infant is carried about a short time by the mo ther on a piece of bark, till it acquires strength"], [79, "21 NEW SOUTH WALES. enough to set on her shoulders with its legs round her neck, and lay hold of her hair to keep itself up. The children are named after some fish, bird, or beast. At an early age they have the ornaments of the hair added to them, as well as those of clay on the skin. JUVENILE SPORTS, The sports of the native children are minia ture exhibitions of the exercises of men, from an early age they practise the throwing the spear and defending themselves from it ; and almost from eight years old till they realize the scene, they amuse themselves with stealing the females, as their fathers have formerly their mothers, and treating them little better. These are the sports of the youths ; but they are em ployed assisting in fishing and the chase at an early age. Children feel themselves capable of receiving an insult, for even if at play a blow or push of greater force than seems requisite is given, they return one of the same kind with an equal spirit of retaliation as the men. The children have a talent for mimicry, in which they take great delight ; the air of a soldier, the importance of an officer, the skulking way of lazy convicts, indeed every thing that passes they mimic with great exactness, and if they succeed in endea vouring to please, and draw forth the smile of approbation, they laugh themselves immoder ately."], [80, "HISTORY OF 22 DISPOSITIONS. Lavater himself would undoubtedly have been at a loss to assign, any general national character in a case like the present, for the dispositions of these people are paradoxi cal ; they are brutal and generous, selfish and liberal, revengful and forgiving, jealous and unsuspecting, courageous and cowardly, open and cunning ; with all these powerful opposi tions it is hard to give any general idea of na tional character, at least any of a favourable kind. Their partiality to revenge by murder, must ever be detestable to refined nations, as well as the cruel manner in which men behave to the women ; yet they have constancy to en dure pain, and courage to fight either singly or in the field. There is little reason to suspect they were honest before we came among them, or if they were, they (like too many others, when opportunity offers) soon became expert theives. No strangers to falsehood and its effects on the minds of others, they endeavour to impress all they say as truth, by earnestly wishing us to believe that all we hear from others is false. They are not insusceptible of friendship or of sorrow, but neither is lasting ; even the love of themselves extends no further than the present instant, they know not of to-morrow. They eat and sleep, they awake and seek food, though it is not uncommon to make the female sit in"], [81, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 23 their canoe to catch fish while they sleep : thus at once shewing their absolute power and indo lence. The kind submissive way in which they be have, on meeting any of our people armed, would make any stranger think himself among his friends, but if he meets the same people, when without arms, he is nearly sure of being killed. They have some little knowledge of astro nomy, but of the form of the earth they have none; and the sun they imagine returns by night from the journey of the day. The respect they pay to old age, from what ever cause it may arise, is a credit to them, and they carry this to a great height if the object happens to be blind, for in that case nobody is suffered to stand before him, and when rowed in a canoe, the rower is obliged to sit behind him. Taking them thus, \" with all their imperfec tions on their heads,\" we have a right to presume that when equally enlightened, they may be come equally possesed of those refined qualifica tions, which at present, render Europeans their superiors. DRESS. The females at an early age wear a little apron, made from the skin of the opposum, or kangaroo cut into slips, and hanging a few inches from the waist; this they wear till they grow up and are taken by men, and then they"], [82, "24 HISTORY OF are left off: this is truly savage. It is curious that those parents who think any clothing de cent for their children, should afterwards suffer them to go in a state of nature by setting the example themselves. The men and women seldom wear any thing on them, and though clothes have often been given them, they are always thrown away. Some few who are in the habit of being much among us, do now tie a kind of bandage round the waist ; but these are so few as by no means to entitle them to be considered as any thing more than a nation of nasty naked savages. PROPERTY. That happiness is obliged to result from pro perty, is by no means true, for few savages have less to call their own, than those of New South Wales, and yet they are perfectly happy; this arises from only seeking what is requisite to satisfy na ture, and any thing more they will not keep; thus the property these people possess are their canoes, spears, shields, clubs, hatchets, fish-gigs, and lines ; but some have informed us of hereditary property which they have retained undisturbed. The Goat Island, (called by them Me-mel,) close to Sydney Cove, was said to be the pro perty of Ben-nil-long's father ; on our settling there he called it his, and took great pleasure in being there with his wife."], [83, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 25 LANGUAGE. The impossibility of giving any perfect idea of a savage language induces me to abandon such an attempt, but as many of the natives' words must of necessity be introduced, they will be explained as they occur. | The language certainly affords to the ear in many cases an agreeable harmony, and as they generally suit their \" actions to thejr words,\" they are more intelligible than might be ex pected, it is however to be lamented, that in these endeavours to be understood, they too often lay aside \" the modesty of Nature,\" and thus they disgust and please at the same in stant. The natives imitate any thing said by the English very correctly, indeed so much so, that they have even sung songs after our people, though on the contrary we do not find it an easy task to imitate them. WEAPONS. Weapons for offensive and defensive war fare, as well as for fishing and the chase, have at all times been found with savages. . Spears, throwing sticks, fish-gigs, shields, and clubs are their weapons. E"], [84, "26 HISTORY OF Of the spear they have eight sorts, exclusive offish-gigs, for each of which they have a sepa rate name, differing only for the purpose of distinguishing the number of barbed points. In the use of these, they are very expert, often biting the object they aim at, from a dis tance of 50, 60, and 70 feet The throwing stick, is used in discharging the spear. This instrument is from 2 to 3 feet in length, with a shell on one end, and a hook on the other. They have two sorts of shields, one made of bark and the other of solid wood. Of clubs they have various sorts, some are very large and long, which strike with such violence, as often to fracture the skull, and always bring a woman to the ground. The stone hatchet must by no means be for got, as this has proved the most dreadful to our people. The stone which forms the head is fastened to the wooden handle with gum. Their instruments are generally ornamented with carved work, executed in the best stile they are capable of, and painted with red and white clay in the same way, as they decorate their persons. FUNERAL RITES. Among every class of human beings, death has a serious effect on the mind, and every na-"], [85, ""], [86, "VJWoadihorptJo."], [87, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 27 tion, either civilized or savage, has a ceremony particularly solemn for the occasion ; whether this arises from the knowledge of revealed religion with the enlightened, or from the finer feelings of a savage, who knows that he can enjoy no future comforts, with a person he may have been accustomed to live, it is equally entitled to our respect, for it has an almost equal effect on the mind, and I am confident, that the heart of a savage in New South Wales generally feels an anguish on such occasions that would do infinite credit to a polished European. Those who die young, are consigned to the grave, but those who have passed the middle age are burnt. Previous to the body being either buried or burnt, it is carried about in a canoe on mens' shoulders, preceded by others who carry tufts of grass in their hands ; the head of the corpse is carried foremost, and when it passes any hut the deceased has been accustomed to frequent, a child is taken up in the arms of a man and pre sented towards the corpse as a mark of respect. When the body reaches the place of interment, it is deposited in a grave about six inches deep, strewed with grass and leaves; on laying the corpse in the grave great care is taken to place it so that the sun may look at it as he passes. The grave is then covered in, and boughs and grass laid on the top, and over that they lay a logos wood. Thus every rite performed, some of the men lay an injunction on the women to"], [88, "28 HISTORY OF prevent their eating any fish or meat that day. During the whole ceremony, the name of the deceased is never mentioned, and the night after, two natives sit up to watch the grave. And when the body is to be burnt, the cere mony is the same till it reaches the grave, in which is laid twigs and brush-wood, large logs being piled round it, about three feet high ; some grass is spread over the pile, the body is then put on it, with its head to the North ; logs of wood are then placed over the whole, which is instantly set fire to and consumed. The next day the ashes are raked together, co vered with mould, over which is placed the bark of a tree. They have a truly horrid accompaniment to these ceremonies, when a mother leaves a young child, and no one can be found to nurse and suckle it, which is, for the father, or nearest re lation, to place the child in the grave directly after the mother, and dashing a large stone on the infant, the grave is instantly covered up by the natives, and thus both are burnt together. To this cause may be partly assigned the great want of population among the natives. This cruel ceremony is however never per formed if any nurse can be found, or any person will engage to become its father, though its real father is alive: a man thus agreeing to become a father to the child, in case of the mother's death, reminds me nearly of what we call godfathers, only with this truly essential"], [89, "NEW SOUTH WALES. ' 29 difference; that the savage godfathers, as I shall call them, of New South Wales, really do their duty, while the European godfathers, like greater savages, let them, generally speaking, take their chance in the world. GOVERNMENT. The natives live in a state of Nature and acknowledge one authority. They are divided into families, and the senior exacts compliance from the rest. This was soon discovered after our arrival, for when we met a family unknown to us the oldest advanced to speak to us, and to these old men they apply the name of (Be-anna) or father, by which name they called Governor Phillip, and all those, they saw our people pay obedience to. When any of these elders came among us, itwas instantly wispered, with an eagerness which drew our attention, and im pressed on our minds au idea that we beheld .some one of consequence. Each of the families into which the natives are divided, have a nominal place of residence though they seldom stay long tbere at one time, and from this is derived the tribes name. The tribe of Cam-mer-ray, is the most power ful and numerous, obliging the others to do as they like ; the}- are more robust than the others, and it is this tribe who are the operators in ex- trading the tooth, from the natives."], [90, "30 HISTORY OF All Teat contests are decided, when these persons of the Cam-mer-ray tribe are present. Yet all this respect, the other inhabitants pay to those of Cam-mer-ray, seems to arise from their vast superiority of numbers ; and this is not the only part of the world where numbers have gained power over few; but seldom are they like the Cam-mer-ray tribe content, with the tribute of a single tooth from each of the van quished. RELIGION. Most countries have a religion of some kind, but the inhabitants of New South Wales have naturally none; they have no ob ject on their minds that impels them to, good actions or deters them from bad ; they have aeon fused idea of a future state, but- it by no means affects their actions. Some think they goover the great water, meaning the sea, when they die, and others expect to go to the skies where they came from, and that in the shape of little children, in which shape they will re-appear in this world at some future time. That they well know the differ ence between right and wrong, as far as concerns this world, is evident, for if any body does them an injury the exclaim wee-re (bad) ; but if any person does them a service bood-jer-re (good). This proves they not only understand a differ ence, but have words to express it."], [91, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 31 DISEASES. In all ages diseases have been the compa nions of mortals, and the natives of New South Wales have their share ; most nations have their cures, and all attempt to cure the maladies by which they suffer. A pain in the belly, they cured formerly by breathing on the hand to warm it and applying it to the part affected, singing a suitable song to the occasion, and keep ing the mouth near the affected part, frequently stopping to blow on it, and making a noise, after blowing, like the barking of a dog ; but our settling there rendered this useless, as tincture of rhubarb saves this trouble. In 1789, a disorder in appearance like the small-pox, raged with incredible violence. Some Gentlemen of the colony took a native to the beach to find his former companions, and so much, did his agony and expression affect them, that it will never be effaced from their minds ; with an anxious eye he searched round every cove, no print of a human foot was to be seen on the sand ; the caves in the rocks Mere now the tombs of the dead, and not one living soul was to be seen \u2014 all had flown \u2014 in the silent agony of grief he lifted up his hands, and then exclaimed, \" all dead ! all dead !\" and in mournful sorrow again hung down his head, nor did he lift it up again during the excursion."], [92, "HISTORY OF 32 This poor fellow at length suffered the fate of his companions, for on some of the natives being brought to the Colony, he caught the disease and' died. With such violence did this disorder rage, that the country seemed desolate, and one whole tribe of natives were swept off except three persons. It is remarkable that though Sydney was full of children at that time, and they visited those natives that were ill, not one caught it. Those on the coast have a disorder very much like the itch, sometimes it is very general ; in 1791, it raged so much that many came to the colony in a shocking state, and every native seen, had it with more or less violence. The venereal disease, there is every reason to imagine they were not ignorant of before they knew us, but if they were, our arrival will account for its appearance shortly after, though every care on the part of the Governor was taken to prevent it. However an inter course between the people soon took place, a native woman had a child by a white man; but perceiving the child incline more to Avhite, than the colour of her other children, she held the little unfortunate over the fire in the smoke, rubbing dirt and oil over its body, to give it the wished-for hue. When they have a pain in any part, they tie a ligature very tight round the part, and thus stopping the circulation of the blood, give ease to the part affected."], [93, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 33 SUPERSTITION. That these people should be superstitious must be naturally expected; they are certainly superior to brutes, and all those in the interme diate steps from ignorance to knowledge must ever be so, and perhaps there are many who value their own refined knowledge, that are not totally free from this weakness. The Cam mer-ray car-rah-dy (priest) who performed the operation of producing the bone in the tooth drawing ceremony, would alone establish the fact, but others as strong can be produced. A native who had been wounded by a spear met with one of these conjurors before it was well, who made him believe he had still the barb in his side ; however to shew his vast power, he pretended to take out what was not there, and sent the poor fellow away satisfied with his great importance. One of the female natives who lived in the Colony had been out and returned ill, though nothing seemed to be the matter with her; but she said one of the Cam-mer-ray women had made water in a path, she was obliged to come over, and this made her ill ; however it had such an effect on her weak mind that she did not recover, though Mr. White kindly bled her in the arm ; but the disease which superstition caused was overcome by the same weakness, which was effected by her being placed on the -f*"], [94, "34 HISTORY OF oround, and a string tied round her head, the other end of the line was taken by a girl, who rubbed her lips with it till they bled ; this she spit into some water on one side of her, while the poor girl round whose head the string went, imagined it came from her, conveyed by the string. They never broil fish at night, because they think the wind will blow a contrary way to what they want it. They will not whistle under a rock, having a tradition, that some of the natives did, while feasting under one, and it fell from a great height and crushed them to death. After these it is hardly requisite to say, that they believe in spirits. An apparition, they say, advances slowly, with its hand in a line -with its face, and seizes the person it intends to visit by the throat. The repository of the dead, and even the darkness of the night are too powerful for their fears. Those indeed who can encounter these seem ing perils, are esteemed proper persons to be come Car-rah-dys. The shooting of a star, and thunder and light ning they fear much. LOVE AND MARRIAGE. Those who delight in sentimental love tales, will probably be disgusted with the male na-"], [95, ""], [96, ""], [97, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 35 tives of New South Wales, for their conduct to women renders them considerably inferior to the brute creation ; indeed nothing but having promised to give a faithful account of all their customs, induces me to state what 1 now find become my duty. Strangers to the finer passions, they seek only the gratification of their brutal desires, yet like other savages they have customs peculiar to themselves on these occasions. In obtaining a female partner the first step they take, romantic as it may seem, is to fix on some female of a tribe at enmity with their own, this done, the lover, as we must now esteem him, seeks to find his intended unprotected by her friends, when he steals upon the unsuspecting woman. The monster then stupifies her with blows, which he inflicts with his club, on her head, back, neck, and indeed every part of her body, then snatching up one of her arms, he drags her, streaming with blood from her wounds, through the woods, over stones, rocks, hills, and logs, with all the violence and determination of a savage, till he j-eaches his tribe, when a scene takes place with the relation of which, I shall neither stain my pages, or offend the reader. The woman thus violated becomes the wife of the ravisher, and is admitted into her husband's tribe. The tribe of the female, by the favourite plan of retaliation, redress this outrage, but the female herself seems contented, and seldom leaves her husband or his tribe for another."], [98, "36 history of The women are kept in the greatest subjection by the men. Isa tribe is travelling and meets any of our people, the women are made to re tire to a distance, from which they are not suffered to advance till ordered ; and on any oc casion the slightest offence given to the husband is punished with the blow of the club, which never fails to cause a stream of blood, and very often a fractured skull : yet this inhuman prac tice appears rather to strengthen the wife's at tachment than weaken it, and the very wounds are shewn as marks of honour. In some very few cases, the wives return this usage, and after such an engagement they live together the same as before. The analogy there is between savages and the lower classes of people in all countries, is here too obvious to escape attention. The men do not confine themselves to one wife, but the women revenge this by retaliation, and often by murder. That the females are not devoid of art, the fol lowing anecdote will form a pleasing illustra tion: A female fell in love with the greatcoat of the Governor, and used a variety of means to obtain it; she first danced, playing many antic tricks ; this not effecting it, she attacked the Governor with tears, and this failing, she ceased and then became as merry as any around her. Though chastity is not one of the virtues they boast, there are some few who seem ashamed to"], [99, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 37 be naked before us \u25a0 though when among the natives they are indifferent in this respect. That even genuine love in all its native purity has been discovered among them, the reader will be convinced by the following little narrative, which happened in the neighbourhood of Paramatta, and I am well acquainted with the young man, who belonged to a tribe near Paramatta, he was about twenty three years old, had two sisters, one about twenty and the other only fourteen. One day when he returned from hunting the kangaroo, his sisters did not meet him as usual on his approach to the cave, so imagining they were gone to procure water or roots, he without going in, being fatigued, sat down at the foot of a tree to wait their return. The sun was now withdrawing itself, and the dark mantle of night with rapid strides began to cover the horizon ; now the vivid lightning with its forked forms bespoke the impending storm ; in a few moments the rain poured ra pidly down and drove my hero from the foot of the tree to his cave, but scarce had he reached it before another flash of lightning shewed to his distressed eyes the form of his youngest sister bleeding on the ground ; troubled as he was before at the warring of the elements, his agony was now increased ten-fold ; kneeling down he endeavoured to make her rise; but alass ! she was incapable of hearing him, for she was senseless: discovering this he hastened to procure a little water, and as he washed her face with it she returned to life. \u2014 \"Oh ! my dear"], [100, "history of 38 brother, cried she, our sister is torn from us, and I narrowly escaped being murdered for try ing to prevent it; the wretch after beating her with his club, caught up one arm to drag her out of our cave, and I laid hold of the other to detain her, but the instant the brute saw this, with one blow of his club he knocked me to the ground, where you have now found me.\" As she ended this narrative the tears run down her cheeks, and her brother could not refrain ac companying her, meditating revenge, and plan ning its execution ; they passed the night in me lancholy conversation, and soon as the returning sun enabled them, they sought together the tribe of the offender. After a journey quick ened by haste to revenge, they reached the neighbourhood of the tribe they sought; when at a little distance, t.he saw the sister of the very savage who had stolen his sister, she was leaving her tribe to pick up some sticks for a fire ; (this was indeed a fine opportunity for revenge) so making his sister hide herself, he flew to the young woman and lifted up his club to bring her to the ground, and thus satisfy his revenge. The victim trembled, yet knowing his power she stood with aH the fortitude she could, lift ing up her eyes they, came in contact with his, and such was the enchanting beauty of her form that he stood an instant motionless to gaze on it. The poor thing saw this, and dropped on her knees to implore his pity, but before she could speak, his revenge softened into love; he threw down his club, and clasping her in his"], [101, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 39 arms vowed eternal constancy ; his pity gained her love, thus each procured a mutual return. Then calling his sister, she would have exe cuted her revenge, but for her brother, who told her she was now his wife. On my hero asking after his sister, his new wife said she was very ill but would soon be better; and she excused her brother because the means he had taken were the customary ones of procuring a wife : \" but you,\" said she, \" have more white heart, (meaning he was more like the English) you no beat me ; me love you ; you love me ; me love your sisters; your sisters love me; my brother no good man.\" This artless address won both their hearts, and now all three live in one hut, which I enabled them to make com fortable, within half a mile of my own house. I have taught all three to read decent! y, and hope they will continue to cherish those seeds of virtue I have laboured to impress on their minds. This little anecdote I have given as the young man related it to me; it affected me much, and perhaps I have lost much of the simplicity. The females of New South Wales are in many cases found to be at the head of the quarrels, and in these they mix with the men and do their part in the battle, indeed on some settled contests the women begin the affray. It is lo this fondness for masculine avocations, that must be attributed the many quarrels which continually happen among them."], [102, "40 HISTORY OF .CHAP. II. To carry into effect the sentences of Criminal Courts, which assigns to convicted guilt, a tem porary or total exile from the country whose laws it violates, the \"English Government deemed New South Wales a proper spot to found a Colonial Establishment for the purpose. In the year 1786, the Commissioners of the Navy contracted for a number of vessels to convey convicts to Botany Bay. The ships for the transports were properly fitted up, and the store ships had provisions for two years, and tools of every description put on board. Capt. Authur Philip hoisted a pendant on board the Sirius of 20 guns, 520 tons burden, lying at Deptford, on the 24th of October, John Hunter Esq. was appointed as a Second Captain to her, for as Capt. Philip was to hold the high office of Governor over the intended Colony, a Second Captain was requisite to command her in his absence. As the Sirius was going on particular service she was not confined in her establishment, having 2 captains, 3 lieutenants, a master, purser, surgeon and two mates, a boatswain, gunner, and a detachment of marines. The Supply brig was commissioned as an armed tender, commanded by Lieutenant"], [103, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 41 Henry Lidgbird Ball. The Sirius with this ship completed their equipment, and droped down from Deptford to Long Reach, on the 10th of December, and there took in powder, guns, and other stores. Some transports here joined them, and on the 30th of January, 1787, on the ar rival of orders, they sailed for Spithead, but owing to foul weather did not reach it till the latter end of February. On the 5th of March the orders for embarkation arrived, and then to join the other ships at Mother-bank, after tak ing the convicts and troops on board. On the 7th of March, Capt. Phillip came to command his fleet, at the Mother bank, wishing to lose no time as the wind now served. The signal for sailing was made on Thursday the 10th; some of the men wishing to be paid up to the time of their sailing, demurred to proceed, so that Captain Phillip ordered such as refused to be put on board the Hy\u00e6na frigate, and to have in exchange the same number of her crew, and as she was to accompany the fleet to a given distance, they might be re-exchanged. This obstacle being removed, and the crews of the Sirius and Supply having received the usual two months advance of wages, the men of war and some transports got under sail to drop down to St. Helen's and proceed to sea, but were un able to pass through the needles till the next morning.

All the transports as well as the ships of war, were stored in every part with provisions, im plements of agriculture, clothing for the con victs, &c. &c. To prevent any separation, Capt.

On the 1 6th they cleared the Channel. Four days had not expired from leaving the Channel, when a mutiny was discovered, by one of the convicts. Capt. Phillip ordered the two principles to be brought on board the Sirius, where they had two dozen lashes each. The Hy\u00e6na was now sent off with letters for England, but the five men lent for those left behind, chose rather to proceed with the fleet than return. On the 24th they made the latitude of Cape Ortugal. The Supply was now ordered to' keep six miles a head in the day, and two during the night, as they expected to see land the next day, which proved the case, as early next morning the signal to that effect was made by her, and at noon they were by the rocks called the Deser ters; and on the 31st off the Canary Islands, distant about three leagues from Madeira. On the 3d of June they saw the Island of Teneriffc a-head, and at seven in the evening the fleet came to an anchor in the road of Santa Cruz. While we lay here, one Powers, a convict, made his escape from the Alexander in a small boat; he was however retaken and kept in irons. Hav-. ing finished getting provisions and water, on the 10th the fleet got under weigh, on the 15th they crossed the Tropic of Cancer with a Steady wind. On the 14th of July the fleet crossed the Equator, in the 26th degree of East"], [106, "44 HISTORY OF Longitude ; and only two accidents happened in their passage to the Brazils, a seaman fell overboard and was drowned, and a female con vict was killed by a boat falling off the booms. On the 2d of August the Coast of South Ame rica was in sight, and on the 4th they anchored within the Islands at the entrance of the harbour of Rio de Janerio. The passage from Teneriffe, though a long one, was attended with no disease. During their stay here the convicts had an allowance of rice, oranges, and vegetables, and every care was taken to enable them to with stand the scurvy; and during the whole passage the Rev. Mr. Johnson performed duty every Sunday. On Tuesday, the 4th of September, the Har bour-master took charge of the Sirius over the bar, from this to Friday, the 14th, the wind blew hard, when it became calm till the 16th, and then it again sprung up, but by the Lady Penrhyn and other transports inattention to sig nals we could not make sail in time. On the 19th a convict was drowned by falling over board. On the 4th of October thirty convicts were reported to be ill, some of them danger ously. Four seamen from the Alexander, were sent on board the Sirius, for having: entered into a combination to release some of the convicts, while the ship should be at the Cape of Good Hope. On the 13th, the fleet came to anchor in Table Bay ; on the 15th Governor Phillip, and the principal Officers went on shore, to pay their respects to the Governor of the Cape of"], [107, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 45 Good Hope, and to procure those stores, seeds, &c requisite. While the fleet lay here the car penters prepared as many stalls for the reception of cattle as room could be found for, and on the 8th of November, 3 mares, 3 colts, 1 stallion, 7 cows, 1 bull, 1 bull-calf, with a good assort ment of sows, boars, goats, ewes, and rams, &c. were received on board the various ships as live-stock for the Colony. During this long stay, the whole fleet had the benefit of fresh provisions and vegetables. Every article wanted being now procured, on the 12th, by signal, they all weighed anchor. For some time after they left the Cape the wind blew fresh. Captain Phillip on the 16th made known his intention of leaving the fleet, and going forward in the Supply, that he might arrive in time to fix on, and clear, a proper spot for the settlement, previous to the arrival of the remainder of the fleet. In consequence of this determination, on the 25th, Capt. Phillip went on board the Supply, and with the Alexander, Scarborough, and Friendship transports quitted the fleet. On the 4th of January, 1788, the Si rius made preparations for falling in with land. On Monday the 7th, about ten in the forenoon, the fleet was 17 leagues from the South Cape of New Holland, and at five minutes past two the signal for seeing land was made. The Mewston and Swilly Rocks soon became visible, and the fleet with fair weather stood along shore, distant only about three miles from New Holland. The land now appeared high, rocky, and barren."], [108, "46 HISTORY OF Over the South Cape it seemed woody, the coast was irregular, with low points forming creeks and bays. The Golden Grove in the night of the 9th shipped a sea, with a confused heavy swell, though it was a calm at the time, which circumstance has occurred to other ships in nearly the same situation. On the following day, at two o'clock, a squall took the Sirius, and did her considerable damage. The slowness of their progress along the coast made it the 19th before they reached the Red Point. In the even ing* they saw the entrance into Botany Bay, but too late for the transports to enter that night. Before morning, however, the whole fleet was carried Southward as far as a clump of trees called Post- Down-Clump; but as a breeze sprung up, they soon regained the lost distance, and at ten minutes before eight in the morning the Sirius came into Botany Bay, and by nine o'clock all the transports were safe at anchor. This voyage, on the termination* of which many doubts must have arisen on the onset, was providentially compleated in eight months and a week, during which time the fleet sailed 5021 leagues, and at length rested, only a few days sail from the antipodes of their native country, and during the whole passage only 32 died, though many were sickly on leaving England. But the good quality of the provi sions, the great care taken by Mr. White, aided by the refreshments received at Rio de Janerio and the Cape of Good Hope, rendered the fleet healthv. 2"], [109, ""], [110, ""], [111, ""], [112, "War i cfihorpr^ /c .

Governor Phillip had not lost an* instant from the time he arrived, in searchingfor a proper spot to found the settlement; but to all he had yet seen there were many objections ; indeed, a place could hardly be found big enough for all to sit down. The shore round Point Suther land was good, but there no fresh water could be found except what came from a marsh. Port Jackson and Broken Bay were now to be exa mined, for which purpose the Governor with Capt. Hunter, Captain Collins (the Judge Advo cate,) a Lieutenant, the Master of the Sirius, and a few marines, embarked in 3 boats. The Governor leaving- orders for clearing* the ground at Point Sutherland in his absence. These 3 boats presently drew the attention of the natives, who as they went along the coast, shouted \" warre, warre, warre,\" (that is go away, go away, go away,\") though, those about Botany Bay by no means looked on them, as enemies either of their country or themselves. The coast round Port Jackson promised little, but disappointed them, by soon shewing, a fine harbour capable of affording ample security for a large fleet. On one of the coves of this, it was resolved to fix the Colony, aud having examined it, the Governor and his party returned to Botany Bay. Lieut. King, in the absence of the Governor, found nothing to induce the latier, to alter the"], [114, "48 HISTORY OF determination he had made to fix at Port Jackson, and the removal would have taken place the next morning, had not two strange sail appeared about day light ; these surprized us, till we ascertained they were the Boussole and Astrolabe, on their return from a voyage of discovery from France, under M. de la Perouse. As Capt. Hunter was -working the Sirius out of Botany Bay as M. de la Perouse entered, they had hardly time to speak. Gover- nor Phillip, with a party of artificers taken from the convicts and seamen of the Sirius, and a few marines, arrived at Port Jackson on the 25th, and on the next day, ground enough was cleared to encamp the Governor's guard. The convicts landed that morning near a stream of fresh water, at the head of a cove. On this first inhabited spot, from that time tranquillity ceased, and the foundation of a new country usurped the seat of silence. The whole party that had arrived, were assembled this evening on the point where they landed, on which was erected a flag-staff, the Union- Jack was dis- played, and the marines fired several vollies; between these, the healths of the Royal Family, and success to the New Colony, were drank by the Governor and Officers, and to conclude the evening, the Sirius and convoy, arrived from Botany Bay. Thus closed the voyage to New South Wales, with all the good fortune that could be wished, and with considerably more than might reasonably be expected. Next day the disembarkment commenced, and continued"], [115, "49 NEW SOUTH WALES. till all the convicts and troops were landed. The confusion that must take place on such an occasion, is hardly to be described, for literally speaking, every man stepped outof a boat into a wood ; various parties^ were variously em ployed, few were seen, but most heard ; some clearing ground, some pitching tents, others bringing up stores, in short, confusion was the order of the day ; but as the woods were felled, and ground cleared, the encampments regularly extended, the whole bore something like form. The Governor's house, which was made of canvass, and brought over on purpose, was put up on the East side of Sydney Cove, and a small body of convicts were placed in tents near it. The marines were placed at the head of the cove, and on the West side the main body of convicts. The women disembarked on the 6th of February, when every person belonging to the settlement landed. Tents were provided for the sick, which number we found with concern increase ; the scurvey and dissentry now broke out and several died. Wild celery, spinage, and parsley grew about the settlement, which all were glad to use in their messes. The live stock was landed, on the East point of the cove, when having cropped the pasturage, they were removed, to the head of the adjoining cove, which was cleared for a farm, to be under the direction of a person, the Governor brought out. His Excellency ordered some ground on the East side of his house, to be cleared for the n"], [116, "50 HISTORY OF purpose of receiving the plants, &c. from Rio de-Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope. They were then brought on shore, and in a short time every eye was gratified with seeing the fig, orange, pear, grape, and apple take root in New South Wales. The Governor ordered his Majesty's commis sion, which appointed him to be, his \" Captain General and Governor in Chief, in and over the Territory of New South Wales and its Depend encies,\" to be read in public, together with the Letters Patent for establishing Civil and Cri minal Courts in the territory, which was now found to extend from Cape York, the extre mity of the coast to the North, in the latitude of 20\u00b0. 37'- South, to the South Cape, the Southern extremity of the coast, in the latitude of 43\u00b0. 39'. South, and inland to the Westward as far as 135\u00b0. of East longitude, comprehend ing all the islands adjacent, in the Pacific Ocean within the latitude of the before mentioned Capes. The ceremony of reading these instruments Avas performed, with great dignity, by Captain Collins, the Judge Advocate, after which the Governor addressed himself to the convicts, and assured them, that he should ever be ready to encourage those who might deserve it ; but, on the contrary, those who acted in opposition to propriety, Mould inevitably meet the punish ment they deserved ; nor did he close without shewing them, how much it was both their duty"], [117, "51 NEW SOUTH WALES. and interest, to forget the ways in which they had lived, and to become good, honest, and industrious members of the community. At the end of his affectionate address three vollies were fired, after which he received the honours due to his rank on the parade, and entertained all the officers and gentlemen of the settlement under a tent pitched on purpose. On mustering the convicts in the morning, nine were found absent, for notwithstanding every care that could be taken, so ignorant were they, that fearless of danger, some of them intreated, but in vain, to be taken on board the French ships in Botany Bay. For want of proper persons being sent out to act as overseers, the convicts could not be kept to work, as those who overlooked them, were only such convicts as behaved well on the voyage, so that having participated in the vices of others, they had neither inclination or power to exact obedient conduct. Thefts now began to be discovered, and many tools secreted ; these evils resulted in a great measure, from the sailors bringing spirits on shore, which even punishment could not prevent. The Criminal Court, was assembled on the 11th of February, for the trial of prisoners. One for an assault, was sentenced to have 150 lashes ; the next for robbing another convict of biscuit, was to be confined on a rocky island for a week, on bread and water; and the third, for stealing a plank, was sentenced to receive 50 lashes, but was pardoned."], [118, "52 HISTORY OF It is too frequently found that mercy is abused, and that a merciful judge encreases the number of criminals ; this was shortly ex emplified, for in less than a month four more were tried for a still greater offence, which was robbing the store of provisions ; thus at once destroying the support of the whole, and at the very time, when the officer and the convict had the same allowance of provisions. The charge being proved, one man, James Barrett, suffered death, his confederates were banished, and one sentenced to have 300 lashes was pardoned, and one who was tried the next day was pardoned on condition of becoming executioner to the colony.

ThisCourthas likewise a power to grant probates of wills and administra tion of personal estates acquired in the country. The Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Judge Advocate are constituted Justices of the Peace, and the Governor is empowered to make such other persons Justices of the Peace as he may think proper. Augustus Alt, Esq. Surveyor General, was the first sworn into this office, to sit with the Judge Advocate and determine on, and punish such causes as were of two little importance to bring before a Criminal Court. Besides the other powers of the Governor, he was Vice- Admiral of the territory, aud could as semble Courts Martial, and confirm and set aside sentences. Capt. Collins, the Judge Ad vocate to the Settlement, had also a Avarrant giving him the same important office to the marine detachment. The Lieutenant Governor is Judge of the Vice- Admiralty Court, for the trial of offences committed on the High Seas."], [120, "54 HISTORY OF Thus, effectual means were provided to punish offenders, and as the various Courts could be assembled when wanted, that loss of time and labour was saved, which would otherwise have taken place. The allowance of provisions was now the fol lowing weekly ration, to each male 7lbs. of biscuit, lib. of flour, 7lbs. of beef or 4lbs. of pork, 3 pints of pease, and 6 ounces of butter ; and two thirds of this quantity to the female convicts, which ought certainly to have af forded of itself perfect security to the store ; but the Government had to deal with those who no consequences, would deter from the commis sion of crimes, and who no reward could induce to do right. As the safety of the stores, constituted the preservation of the colony, ground was cleared and houses began to hold them. This was done by the convicts, and as a temptation to work they had a quantity set them, which done, they were allowed time to collect materials to build huts for themselves, but this few profited by, prefering idleness, and many thinking to escape if they could get on board, daily visited the ships of the French in Botany Bay; but M. de la Perouse gave no countenance to their re quests, but threatened to drive them away by force. In February the Supply sailed from Port Jackson, as the Governor was instructed, for the purpose of growing flax, to form a settle-"], [121, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 55 ment at Norfolk Island, on which expedition he sent Lieut. King, first making him a Justice of the Peace, as Commandant, a surgeon, a petty officer, two soldiers, nine male and six female convicts, and two persons who boasted a knowledge of the flax dressing business. They had likewise tools, farming implements, and provisions for six months. The situation of Norfolk Island is in latitude of 29\u00b0. South, and in longitude 160\u00b0. 10'. East of Greenwich. Lieut. Daws, of the Marines, was by the Board of Longitude ordered to make observa tions in New South Wales, for which purpose the Board sent out proper instruments, and shortly after their arrival an observatory was begun, under this Gentleman's direction. On a survey of the harbour being made by Captain Hunter, it was found to exceed the extent imagined to the Westward, and the country was found to be even better there than near the settlement. During this survey Capt. Hunter saw many of the natives, who left him in a friendly way, as he treated them with his usual cheerful manners. Least the loose way in which the natives left their spears, fish-gigs, and other little property about, should tempt the convicts or others to make free with any thing, the Governor strictly ordered no one to take them, as it was his earnest wish, and constant endeavour to keep up a friendly intercourse with them. During the first six weeks of our residence, we received a Visit from only two natives, who came and staid"], [122, "56 HISTORY OF a short time, every thing they saw they admired, and on giving each a hatchet, we found they understood the use of it. It is to be lamented that the orders of the Governor had little effect, for the convicts lost no opportunity of taking all they could find from the natives, which made them resist an attempt a boat's crew made to land in one of the coves, and shortly after a few landed on Garden Island, where a garden was making, and watching their opportunity, ran away with the tools of our men, who then sired at them, and hitting one with small shot, the axe was dropped, but with the rest they escaped. M. de la Perouse likewise was obliged to fire on the na tives, for annoying his people while on shore. These circumstances attributed to the termina tion of that intercourse Governor Phillip was so desirous to cultivate. Several couples signified their wish to marry, and they were never refused, unless proof was given that either had a husband or wife living on leaving England, and some expecting to have received a portion of liberty for marrying, finding themselves disappointed, wished to be restored to their former state. Important as the business was in which the whole colony was engaged, divine service was regularly performed on Sundays, all the con victs attending, and a detachment of marines with their arms; and it was with pleasure ob served, that all behaved with the greatest attention and respect."], [123, ""], [124, "Jiti MiirtAJLl6qgJyM*Xltl**.

In the beginning of March, the Governor took an excursion for a few days, under the idea of finding several spots of good land, near Broken Bay, but without success. The weather became now equally averse to labour and health, the sick list amounted to 200 ; for the reception of these a building was erected, one ward for the troops, and a second for the convicts. Barracks likewise were beg-an for the detachment, but all building was retarded, by the bad quality of the wood, which was both shakey and rotten. The French now departed from Botany Bay, but previous to their sailing buried the Abbe L. Receveur, not far from where their tents were erected, and on the tree at the foot of which he was laid, were nailed two pieces of board, with the following inscription: Hie jacet L. Receveur Ex F. F. Minoribus Galli\u00e6 Sacerdos. Physicus in Circumnavigatione Mundi Duce D. de la Perouse, Obit Die 17 Feb'. Anno 1788."], [126, "58 HISTORY OF When these boards fell down, Governor Phillip had the inscription engraved on copper, and put in the same place. A wharf was now began, for landing goods, and the ordnance, which consisted of two brass six pounders on travelling carriages, four iron twelve pounders, and two iron six pounders, were brought on shore. The transports which were chartered for 'China began to clear. A gang of convicts Avere employed about the head of Long Cove to make bricks, near which tAvo acres of ground Avere cleared for such officers, as wislied to raise grain for their stock, as no grants of land were to be made, until an account of the country had been taken. That necessity Avhich obliged them to suffer the live stock to range about the tents, Avas the cause of great inconA'enience, for the hogs in particular made way into them, and destroyed every thing they met Avith. These damages were at first made good from the store, but, that opening the door to impositions, an order was given, to kill any hog caught so trespassing. The main street for a town was marked out of extensive dimen- sions. The Supply' returned from Norfolk Island on the 19th, after an absence of 4 weeks and 6 days. She reached the island on the 29th of last month, but in consequence of the great surf they could not land till the 5th day after, and then could not pitch a tent till they had cleared the ground. The bay he landed in, and fixed the settlement, he called Sydney Bay, and the t/wo small"], [127, "59 NEW SOUTH AVALES. islands at a little distance, he named Phillip and Nepean. The soil at Norfolk Island was very rich, but the landing dangerous at Sydney Bay, as it is exposed to Southerly Avinds. The flax plant, Avhich Avas the object of this expedi tion, and which Capt. Cook remarked to grow spontaneously, had not been discovered by Lieut King when the Supply sailed. Lieut. Ball after he left this harbour, soon discovered au uninhabited island, smaller than Norfolk Island, abound ing with turtle and fowls, which were so tame that some of the crew approached near enough to knock them down Avith sticks, this place Lieut. Ball called Lord Howe Island. The pines on Norfolk Island grow to an immense \u2022size, one measured nine feet round, and an other 180 feet in length. The Scarborough, Charlotte, and Lady Penrhyn transports Avere cleared and discharged. Several of the con victs came in from the woods Avounded by the natives. One of the wounded had been em ployed cutting rushes for thatching, and an other avIio Avas not Avell, had been collecting vegetables. All our people denied giving any cause, but as they well knew the conse quence that would result from offending the natives, there could be no Avonder that they denied it, for the Governor had made known, that any one, giving them offence, should be subjected to a prosecution. There can be no doubt but our people gave the first offence, for the Governor on his return from his excursion about Broken Bay, found the natives very shy,"], [128, "60 HISTORY OF instead of coming to him Avith that confidence Avith Avhich he had formerly inspired them Avith. At length one came to him, and informed him by signs, that he had been beaten by some of our people, this and their running away, Avere strong proofs of the truth, added to Avhich 11 canoes full of natives, passed the Sirius, and on our boats going near them, they paddled off. The Avater, that had supplied the settle ment, Avas found to be only a drain from a SAvamp, it Avas therefore requisite to\" let it remain Avithout cutting the wood round it. April now commenced, and the Avinter Avas approaching, every hand was put on the buildings, even the ships' crews helped, except those Avho brought the cabbage trees, to assist in making huts, a row of Avhich were began on the West side for the female convicts. Distress Avas now very universal owing to the scurvy. A Avoman con vict Avas accused Avith stealing an iron, Avhich was found on her, being left alone she hung herself, but Avas discovered and cut dovvn in time to save her life. Thefts continued to be continually commit ted, but they became fewer, as, the Governor assured the convicts that instant punishment should attend all future convictions ; and had the sailors not continued to bring spirits on shore, their conduct as well as the convicts would have been more to be commended. The venereal disease Avas discovered among the convicts, Avhich made the Governor order, that any person having it, and concealing it,"], [129, "61 NEW SOUTH WALES. should receive corporal punishment, and have short allowance of provisions for six months. The ordnance of the colony was now placed under the direction of Lieut. Dawes, and a re doubt was began by him. In the course of this month the stock of sheep suffered much by the dogs of the natives, at one part 5 ewes and a lamb, were destroyed. May, like every other month in the infancy of the Colony, was marked by crimes, a youth of 17, James Bennett, was tried and convicted for breaking open a tent, and stealing above the amount of 5s. he confessed many crimes after conviction for this, and to idleness and bad company attributed his ruin. With a view to make a deeper impression on others, he was instantly executed. On the 5th, 0th, and 7th of this month a transport sailed for China. On the 8th, likewise, sailed the Supply for Lord Howe Island, in quest of fowl and turtle, as a change of diet was thought the best means of resisting the rapid progress of the scurvy. The Governor wishing to ascertain the state of the live stock, desired a general return ; the amount of which was, 5 cows 29 sheep 18 turkies 2 bulls 19 goats 35 ducks 1 stallion 25 pigs 29 geese 3 marcs 49 hogs 122 fowls 3 colts 5 rabbits 87 chickens A bricklayer, being discovered among the convicts, a number of men were put under him to build brick huts. On the 15th, a stone"], [130, "62 HISTORY OF house was began for the Governor. In the course of this month the store house was com- pleted and a road to the wharf. On the 2 1st, in the evening, a convict was brought to the hos- pital, dreadfully wounded by some natives with a barbed spear, which entered between his shoulders, and went three inches deep into his back. He said, that while in a cove at some distance, he was suddenly wounded by a spear, when his companion ran away, and that the natives then came and stripped him of his clothes, but did not take them away. In a few days the other man's clothes were brought in, torn with spears, and covered with blood, leav- ing no room to doubt of his fate. On the 25th the Supply returned from Norfolk Island, being unable to procure any turtle ; but while absent, they saw a rock which Lieut. Ball, from its shape, called Ball Pyramid. A soldier and sailor were tried on the 26th for assaulting and wounding James M'Neal, a seaman belonging to the Sirius. This happened on Garden Island, they all three lived in one hut, and having re- ceived their week's spirits they got drunk and quarreled. The assault being proved, each received 500 lashes. The 50th of this month, the bodies of two convicts were brought in, the head of one was beaten to a jelly, and the bodies of both, had many marks of spears. It was found on inquiry, that these men had stolen a canoe from the natives, for which they suffered with their lives. The natives them selves came about us as- usual, and sbme who"], [131, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 63 went near the Sirius were shaved ; when they landed on the Western point, they examined every thing, and went away very friendly, taking no notice of the murders, and seeming to fear no resentment ; but the Governor thought it necessary to avenge it, so he set out with a strong party well armed, and landed were the bodies were found, then proceeding across the country to Botany Bay, he saw on the beech upwards of 50 canoes, but no natives near them. However, in a cove between Bo tany Bay and Port Jackson, he fell in with about 300 natives of both sexes, and a friendly intercourse took place, but nothing which could tend to discover the murderers. His Majesty's birth-day was kept with all the honours the colony were capable of shewi ng ; the Sirius and Supply fired several vollies, and in honour of his Majesty's second brother, the Governor fixed the boundaries of the first co unty on the island, and named it Cumberland Co'slnty. Each person in the colony drank his Majesty's health, and those sent to the rocks a.s a punish ment, received a free pardon, That vicious minds, never lose an opportunity of taking au advantage is universally admitted,, and the little liberty allowed the convicts this evening, af forded them an opportunity of plundering many huts and tents. An officer on going to his tent, found a convict, who he was obliged to wound with his sword before he couVl secure him. For tunately two were detectedi and executed, but one of these was out of 'the way for 19 days,"], [132, "64 HISTORY OF secreting himself by day. and coming at night to the colony to rob the huts and tents. Economy is one of those virtues which could hardly be expected to reign among convicts ; they were so destitute of it that they would not manage to use their provisions so as to last the week, but by devouring the whole in the beginning of the week, were totally without for the latter part. One of these improvident men made his week's allowance of flour (which was at that time 8lbs.) into cakes, and eat them at one meal. The consequence was, he was taken both senseless and speechless, and next day died. A convict, to whose care was entrusted the cattle, let 4 cows and 2 bulls stray away, and did not inform the Governor of the loss for 2 days, every exertion was made use of to recover them, but after a fruitless search for many days, they were given up as lost. As the weather became colder, the fish deserted the coast so much that few were to be caught, and from this cause the natives suffered so much, that one old man was found nearly starved to death. On the 22d a slight shock of an earthquake was observed, it lasted two or three seconds, but was so slight, that many did not feel it. The Prince of Wales, Alexander, Borrowdale, and Friendship, com pleted their stores, and sailed for England on the 14th of July, and on the 20th the Supply sailed with provisions for Norfolk Island. Two transports now only remained, and every pre paration was making for clearing and discharg-"], [133, "65 NEW SOUTH WALES. ing them. A cellar was made, to receive the stock of spirits from on board the Fishbourn, and the provisions from the Golden Grove were placed in the large storehouse. As many accidents happened by fire, an order was issued to prevent chimnies being built in those huts that were thatched. When our people were fishing, it was by no means uncommon for some of the natives to come down and help them haul the seine, for which assistance they \u25a0usually had a share of the fish given them. However, one day, driven by hunger or some less honest motive, they came and took more than half what was brought on shore ; they were armed, and had a party in the rear with spears poized, ready to throw if any resistance had been made; but for the future a petty officer was ordered to go with every fishing boat down the harbour. Notwithstanding all the orders, that could be given to prevent offending the natives, they had, in toto, no effect on the con victs, for in direct opposition to the Governor's regular orders, they would wander about, often only two together, and even singly. On the 27th, as two convicts strayed in this way, the natives made signs to them to go back, which they did, but ran different ways, the natives seeing this, threw spears at them ; one es caped, but the other received two spears, on which, he swam over the bay, and said the natives laughed at him. t"], [134, "66 HISTORY OF The beginning of August was so very rainy, that all building, and indeed labour of every kind was suspended, and considerable damage was done to the brick-kiln, which fell in, a quantity of bricks were spoilt, and the very roads were unable to be passed. Till the 14th, when the weather changed, no work could be done. During the unfavourable deluge, thefts were frequent, a sheep, intended for celebrat ing the Prince of Wales's birth day, was stolen, and notwithstanding the Governor offered the reward of emancipation for the discovery, it was without effect ; but the Prince's birth day was observed by a cessation from labour, and the colours Avere displayed at the flag-staff, on this and all other birth-days of the Royal Family. A party of natives, on the 21st, landed from five canoes, . near -where the observatory was building, while some engaged the workmen and officers, the others endeavoured to take away a goat from the hospital, but being re sisted by a sailor, they held their spears at him till he retreated, then killed the goat, and putting it in a canoe, bore towards Long Cove. The Governor followed them, and got up with some of the party, but neither could meet with the offenders or the goat. The Supply, on the 26th, arrived from Norfolk Island, with accounts that the flax plant had been discovered, and was growing luxuriently, but the wheat seed was found to have been heated on the passage, and would not vegetate."], [135, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 67 One of the most artful convicts, amused the settlement at Sydney Cove, with an account of a gold mine, he pretended to have discovered, and offered to conduct an officer to the spot A boat was got ready, but on landing at the place, he prevailed on the officer to send away the boat, and afterwards left him, and arrived at the colony, some hours before the officer, saying he sent him for a guard, but before that gentleman returned, he escaped into the wood, and did not return till next day, when he had 50 lashes for the imposition; however he per- sisted that he had discovered a metal, of which he produced a bit. The Governor returned about this time from an excursion, and on hear- ing his tale, ordered him to be again taken down the harbour, and told the man, that if it turned out a deception, he would put him to death. This saved more trouble, for the man confessed he had invented the tale to im- pose on the crews of the Fishbourn and Golden Grove, who under the idea of having gold dust from him, would let him have cloathing, &c. and the specimens exhibited, where made from part of a brass buckle and a guinea, the remains of which he produced; for this trick he had 100 lashes, and wore a canvass frock with an R cut and sewed on it, to render him a more conspi- cuous rogue than the rest; but so ignorant were many, that they believed he had really dis- covered a gold mine, notwithstanding his con- fession, and the reward he highly deserved, justly obtained, and still publicly wore."], [136, "68 HISTORY OF Those who were imprudent enough to exceed the limits laid down, without taking arms, continued to be molested by the natives. In the course of this month, a straying convict, was beaten, stripped, and would have been mur dered by them, had they not been alarmed by a musquet going off, on which they left him, and his clothes as fast as they could. September arrived, and the -wheat sown at Port Jackson seemed to promise as little as that at Norfolk Island, therefore the Governor ordered the Sirius, to the Cape of Good Hope for seed, and as much flour as she could stow for the use of the colony ; that she might bring a greater quantity, her guns were landed on the the West point of the cove : the Golden Grove was also ordered to prepare for taking stores, provisions, and convicts to Norfolk Island. A house for the stores of the detachment being now finished, they were landed from the Sirius, and placed in it. A boat of eight oars, and another of sixteen, sent out in frame, were now put together. The only cow left went mad, and was obliged to be shot, though with calf. The Golden Grove, on the 2d of October, re ceived thirty-two convicts, a party of marines, and two seamen from the Sirius on board, for Norfolk Island ; and the Sirius sailed the same day for the Cape of Good Hope, from which time, one pound of flour was deducted per week from those who received the full allowance, and two thirds of a pound from those at a shorter allowance, and thus it was to continue till the"], [137, "69 NEW SOUTH WALES. return of the Sirius, but by this deduction labour was not affected. Some convicts were employed in procuring timber to form a bridge, over the stream at the head of the cove. A party of Natives, on the 24th, met a stray con vict, and threw spears at him, but luckily without effect. On having information of this, the Governor went with an armed party, and hearing some natives in the bushes sired among them, being determined, they should keep from the colony. The Governor, in one of his excursions, discovered some fine land at the head of the cove, which, from its form, he called the Crescent, and having determined to six a settlement there, on the 2d of November he went to mark out ground for a redoubt and other buildings, and on the 4th 20 convicts, who understood the farming business, were dis patched to him. This spot was named Rose- Hill, and the earth being of superior quality to that about Sydney Cove, and free from rocks, it promised well for the encrease of grain. The Golden Grove returned on the 10th with very favourable accounts from Norfolk Island ; Lieut. King wrote that his people were healthy, vegetables and fish were in abundance, that his gardens flourished, and the grain last sown pro mised a fine crop. On the 19th, the two store ships sailed for England, by which the Gover nor sent home dispatches. The redoubt began in July was this month completed, and two pieces of ordnance mounted in it. The convict who fabricated the story of the gold-mine, had"], [138, "HISTORY OF 70 for some time been observed to have become very lazy, and to neglect his work; and at length he was convicted of house-breaking, and suffered death. Before he was turned off, he mentioned two women, who received the pro perty he at various times stole. These were afterwards apprehended, and one of them made an example of ; her head was shaved, and a canvas frock put on her, with R. S. G. (re ceiver of stolen goods) painted on, and was to be punished, if ever seen without it. It Mas hoped, that shame would operate on some of the convicts at least, for of many no good could be expected, they were too callous, for any thing human to reform, and so lazy that no more work could be obtained from them, than just enough to prevent that punishment, which was the reward of total neglect. At length the Go vernor, ordered, that those who did not do the work allotted them should only receive two thirds of the allowance of provisions. On the contrary, there were some few convicts, whose conduct was marked by obedience and atten tion, but these never associated with the vile ones. So eager, was one of the convicts, to return to England at the end of his time, that he sold part of his provisions from time to time to other convicts, to get money for his passage, and at last he died for want, leaving behind him a whole week's provisions intended for sale. A boat-house was began under Mr. Ried, the carpenter of the Supply, to build boats, &c. with the timber of this country. A landing"], [139, "71 NEW SOUTH WALES. place was formed on the East side of the cove, and on the West side a powder magazine was marked out, to be built of stone. The Gover nor determined, to procure one or two natives and bring them to the settlement, for the pur pose of learning the native language, that by a capability of conversing, both parties might acquire a proper knowledge of the other, and know their friends and enemies. Accordingly, on December 30th, Lieuts. Ball and Johnstone seized a young man and brought him to the Governor, who had him clothed, and a light iron put on his wrist, he was then committed to the care of a convict, who could be well trusted. A hut had been prepared, and in this he slept well, all the first night, and made no attempt to escape. Thunder, lightning, rain, and hot weather closed the year, yet these violent commotions of the elements, by no means gave the most judicious an unfavourable opinion of the climate; neither did the frequent enormities, committed by the more depraved part of the convicts, make the enlighted part of the colony despair of eventually effecting all the good which could be rationally expected."], [140, "HISTORY OF 72 CHAP. IV. Idleness, the mother of all vices, held art absolute sway over the convicts, but this was not the only evil to be complained of. Thefts, which may be called the children of idleness, were no strangers to the colony, one com mitted a robbery, and fled to the -woods, but came every night to rob the tents and huts, and once effected a robbery on the pub lic store, however he was taken, tried, and hung. Another for stabbing a woman with whom he lived, was sentenced to have 700 lashes, half of which he had at the time the other was executed. When one of our boats went down the harbour with convicts to cut rushes, some natives stole three jackets, on the discovery they were pursued, when they left their canoe, and landing ran into the woods; but our people, notwithstanding the continual orders, to touch nothing belonging to the na tives, retained the canoe, on seeing which they threw a spear and wounded the cockswain. The young native that was taken to the colony in December, was now taken down the harbour, and conversed several times with his friends, but had no wish to leave the settlement. To prevent the convicts practice of selling their"], [141, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 73 clothes, the Governor ordered, that any person buying them, should on information be obliged to redeliver them, \"and lose the money they might have given for them. At the end of February, the detachment took possession of their barracks, and a brick guard house was began. At Rose-Hill the ground was being cleared, but the labour of removing the timber when cut down, very much retarded the progress of our people. One of the convicts, in March, strayed away to the woods, to obtain a herb called by us the sweet tea, and he was murdered by the natives. The brick-makers gang, to which this man belonged, determined on revenge, and arming themselves with sticks, proceeded against the natives, but met a larger number than they expected, who threw spears at them, and killed one man and wounded six. On this, a well armed party was sent out, who found the body of the man, and a boy whom they had wounded and nearly cut his left ear off. Notwithstanding this party suffered so much, by going without orders against the natives, the Governor determined to punish them, and ordered those not wounded to have 150 lashes each, and as soon as the others re covered, they were to have the same. Six soldiers were discovered, in a plan they had long executed, of robbing the store, by means of a false key, which breaking in the lock, led to a discovery, and the six were tried and hung. In the mean time Norfolk Island escaped an in- i."], [142, "74 HISTORY OF surrection. The Supply returned from there on the 24th. On Thursday, the 26th of February, early in the morning, a hurricane visited the island, several pines of 180 feet in length and upwards, were blown down, and from then till noon the wind increased, with torrents of rain. A very large oak was blown on the granary, and dashed it to pieces, breaking several barrels of flour. At noon the storm was so violent, that it blew up more trees than 50 men could have felled in a fortnight, and the gardens both public and private were destroyed. Lieutenant King's people were in good health, and he re tained the same good opinion of the climate, he entertained at first ; for the internal defence of the island he had formed the free people into a militia, and general satisfaction was visible in every countenance when the Supply dropped anchor in the cove. The Governor ever anxi- ous to discover all that could be of use to the Islands prosperity, directed in the beginning of April, a survey to be made of a large bay on the North shore, in consequence of which, a suffi cient depth of water was discovered for foreign ships to anchor in. The Governor called it Neutral Bay. Early in this month the people gave information, that on going to the harbour they found the caves silled with dead bodies of the natives. The cause of this was disco vered on bringing two men, a boy, and a girl to the colony, when it proved to be the small pox. The two men were overcome by the"], [143, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 75 disease too much to recover, but the boy and girl did very well directly. The native who resided with us, said whole families were killed by it, and that many to avoid it, flew to the woods. When the boy recovered, he was taken by Mr. White, the surgeon, of whom the boy was very fond, and the girl was taken by the clergyman's wife. From the time the children came to us, the native who lived in the set tlement was very attentive to them, and, as was feared by every body, he caught the infec tion and died. At five in the evening, on the 6th, after an absence of seven months and six days, the Sirius from the Cape of Good Hope anchored in the cove. She arrived at the Cape on the 2d of January, and sailed on her return on the 20th of February. In a gale she suffered much damage. She brought 1 27,000 weight of flour for the settlement, and twelve months provisions for her crew. The latter end of May several convicts reported they had seen the body of a white man in a cove at a distance; a muster was called and no one found absent but a black named C\u00e6sar, who had absconded from the service of an officer, and taken with him a gun, an iron pot, and some provisions ; in the course of a short time, however, he was caught, and' as the idea of death seemed to have no effect on his mind, the Governor ordered him to be kept at work on Garden Island in fetters. The King's birth day was celebrated with every possible respect on June 4th, 1789, and in addi tion to the ceremonies of last year, the ordnance"], [144, "76 HISTORY OF of the colony was fired for the first time, and in the evening, some of the convicts were suffered to perform the comedy of the Recruiting Officer. On the following day Lieut. Creswell, with a body of marines, sailed in the Supply for Norfolk Island. The Governor returned on the 14th of July, from a second excursion up the river Hawkesbury, in which he was im peded by a shallow just above a hill, he ealled Richmond Hill. Two years had now elapsed, and several convicts claimed the privileges of free men, but by some accident the proper papers for ascertaining the facts, had been left in England, and though no profit hardly could arise from the freedom being granted, they were anxious for it, so the Governor directed the Judge Advocate to take the affidavits of those who could swear their time was expired, and recommended them to work for the public till the papers left in England should arrive, The live stock of the colony now became an object of attention, it was observed, that all the animals kept for breeding brought forth a greater number of males than females, as in a litter of twelve pigs, nine were males, and only one kid out of seven was a female, and it gene rally happened in the same proportion. This circumstance was of serious consequence, for it threatened to retard the time when the assist ance from the mother country could bedispcnsed with. From Lieut. King, at Norfolk Island, the Supply brought dispatches, saying 17 acres of ground had been cleared, that he was erecting"], [145, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 77 a store-house, and had made a road from Sydney to Cascade Bay, and a cotton tree was discovered. The continual depredations committed in the colony, drew every good mind to consider some mode of relief, and at length a plan was pro posed by one Harris, a convict, for a night watch, to take up such as might be out after a given hour, and to be assisted by the military if wanted, this proposal was accepted by the Governor, and adopted on the 8th of August. On a survey of the Sirius, she Mas found to want considerable repairs, which commenced directly. As Henry Hacking, who was suffered to go into the woods to shoot fowls, was thus employed, a stone was thrown at him with great force, and on looking about, saw about 40 natives in the hushes, wishing to get rid of them, he presented his piece several times, but instead of going away they followed him, on Avhich he fired, and on discharging a second time, they went away. The purser of the Sirius, who was cutting wood, received a visit from a few natives, who hid his axes in the bushes, but finding he missed them, they ran off, and left two children behind them, which the purser, Mr. Palmer, detained till he recovered the property lost. The corn promised a grateful return at Rose-- Hill, where an emu was killed, which on being opened contained 50 eggs. In October a vessel was launched, which was employed in taking provisions, &c. to Rose-Hill. It was now dis-"], [146, "78 HISTORY OF covered that the store was infested with rats, and on removing them, eight casks of flour were found destroyed. In the beginning of November, the quantity of provisions issued to the males in the colony was reduced one-third, except spirits. This measure was adopted from the uncertainty of hearing from England, it was however found requisite to issue this ration of provisions on Saturdays and Wednesdays, to make them last the proper time. Captain Hunter, on the 7th of November, brought the Sirius into the cove perfectly re paired and fit for sea. The supply on the 11th sailed for Norfolk Island, and was to call at Lord Howe Island in quest of turtle. By the activity of the watchmen, a female convict was taken up for house breaking, and received sen tence to die, when she pleaded being with child, but a jury of women pronouncing otherwise she was executed, and previous to being hung, ac knowledged she only said she was so, to save her life. One of the colony boats caught as many fish in the seine as would have served the whole settlement a day, had it not burst, and a boat belonging to the Sirius caught near fifty large fish, which were called light horsemen from a bone that grew out of the head like a helmet. On the 25th of November two natives were secured, they were known by the children, who informed them of the safety they were in, but being dissatisfied, one effected his escape with an iron on his ancle, and the other was detected"], [147, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 79 when going to follow the first. This month a brick-house was began for the Judge- Advocate, and in December the harvest was got in; at Rose-Hill it produced 200 bushels of wheat, 35 of barley, a few oats, and a small quantity of Indian corn, all of which was reserved for seed, and 25 bushels of barley was produced from a small spot of ground called the Governor's Farm, at Sydney. The Supply returned from Norfolk Island on the 21st, in her visit to Lord Howe Island, 18 turtle were turned, but as several died on the passage only four could be left there. A few days before Christmas a cab bage was cut at R,ose-Hill, that weighed 261bs. On the 7th of January, 1790, the Supply sailed for Norfolk Island, with convicts and stores, as Lieut. King wished more hands to be sent to him. A convict, whose term the Governor was convinced had expired, signified a wish to be- come a settler, and as he had been bred to the business of a farmer, and by his good conduct and industry while in the colony, manifested a strong desire to return to a good line of life. The Governor ordered two acres of ground to be cleared, and a hut built for him, and supplied him with tools, seed, and live-stock, that he might commence farmer. Anxiety now became seriously visible, for the flour brought from England was expended, and only that, procured from the Cape of Good Hope remained. On the South head of the harbour a flag-staff, was erected, and a hut for those who attended it. This was meant to serve as a signal for any"], [148, "80 HISTORY OF vessel that might arrive, and that the settle ment might learn when any came in view. Fish was often caught in great abundance, and one nio-ht, enough was taken to afford two pounds to every person in the settlement, which was given them exclusive of the regular provisions. The Governor directed boats to go out three times a- week to fish for the public, and the produce was of great service. C\u00e6sar, who was sent to Avork on Garden Island, effected his escape, and got to Rose- Hill, from Avhence he returned on the 30th very much wounded by some natives; but he said he had discovered the cattle lost from the colony, and in endea vouring to drive them before him, the natives threw spears at him. From his known character this was paid no attention to, but he was secured and taken to the hospital to be healed of his wounds. On the 10th of February, a signal was made from the flag-staff, every mind was big with expectation in full hopes of hear ing from England, but it proved oply the Supply on her return from Norfolk Island, being unable to bear up to Port Jackson she had gone to Botany Bay. Lieut. King informed the Governor that his wheat had returned 20 fold, and his people were healthy, and that the gardens flourished. The soil at Norfolk Island bearing such an evident superiority over that of the settlement, determined the Governor to send a number of convicts there, with two com panies of marines. A month passed in making preparations for their departure. The weather"], [149, "81 NEW SOUTH WALES. was very bad, the rain poured down in torrents, doing great damage among the huts of the convicts. The allowance of spirits which had hitherto been half a pint a day, was on the 1st of March reduced to half that quantity. On the 3d, two companies of marines, with their officers, the Lieutenant-Governor, and a sur geon, embarked on board the ships Sirius and Supply. On the following day, 1 16 male and 68 female convicts, and 27 children, were put on board. C\u00e6sar was one of the male convicts, who the Governor pardoned ; and one of an opposite description, for his conduct had been so good as to raise him to the privileges of freedom, and he was now sent as an assistant to a medical gentleman at Norfolk Island. The Sirius and Supply sailed on the 5th. Capt. Hunter left at the South Head, the gunner, a midshipman, and six of the Sirius 's crew. Those who remained at Sydney had all the Governor's attention, he visited the huts left empty, by those gone to Norfolk Island, and gave them to those whose huts -were in a miser able state, and that this kindness might not fail to have some good effect, they were told, that unless, both the huts and gardens were kept in a good state, they would be turned out, and that they might have time to do this, Wednesday afternoon and all Saturday was allowed them. On the 27th, a still shorter ration was found requisite to be adopted, and 4lbs. of flour, 2-ilbs. of pork, and l-j-lb. of rice, was all that could be allowed per week, fpr each M"], [150, "82 HISTORY OF person. This consequently affected the capa bility of working so much, that it was ordered to begin work at sun- rise and end at one o'clock, allowing a little time for breakfast; and the afternoon was allowed them to receive their provisions and work in their gardens. The same regulations were adopted at Rose-Hill, and the night-watch was urged to be very active. The little live-stock now began to be an evil, for those to whom it belonged, being unable to keep them regularly fed, suffered them to range about, and as they did consider able damage in the gardens, the Governor ordered them to be kept up at night, for if caught in any garden they should be forfeited. On the 3d of April it was directed, that all the fish caught should be issued at the public store, at the rate of ten pounds of fish to two pounds and a half of pork, for in the present state of affairs the smallest saving was an object. The want of supplies from England, threw a gloom over every person in the settlement, which was materially augmented by the loss of the Sirius, on the reef at Norfolk Island, this nearly banished all hope, as it was to this ship going for provisions, that all looked for relief. Every exertion was made to save the ship, with out effect, but no life was lost, and the major part of the provisions on board were saved. After the loss of the Sirius it was found requi site to proclaim martial law; and that two keys should be made to the public store, one to be kept by Capt. Hunter in behalf of the seamen, and the"], [151, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 83 other by some person on the part of the military, and the next day the troops, seamen, and con victs, being informed of the resolutions, shewed their satisfaction, by passing under the colours displayed on purpose. The Supply brought the Commandant of Norfolk Island, and up wards of thirty persons lately of the Sirius. Thus situated, the Governor called a council, when the dreadful situation of the colony was viewed, and it was agreed, that even the small ration of provisions must be reduced to all but children under 18 months. All private boats were to be given up for the public use, to be used in fishing, and men were to shoot for the benefit of the colony. The fishing boats not succeeding in the fishery at Botany Bay, were sent to Sydney with considerable success, but as the men employed were not found trust-worthy, an officer accompanied them. On the 7th, four hundred pounds weight of fish were caught and issued ; but from that day, during the month, so little was caught, that all the private boats were returned, and the men employed in them taken to the boats of government, and the shooting proved ineffectual ; necessity became pressing, and the colony had to deplore the non-arrival of stores from England. The only means left Avas to send Lieut. Ball, in the Supply, to Batavia, to get eight months' provisions for the ship, and hire another to assist in bringing to the colony 200,000lbs. of flour, 60,000lbs. of pork, 80,000ibs. of beef, 70,000lbs. of rice,"], [152, "84 HISTORY OF with necessaries for the hospital. Distant as the period must be Avhen these could arrive, they were the only ones to be depended on. She sailed on the 17th of April, and could not be expected to return in less than six months. What tender anxiety must every one have felt when this vessel sailed ; every hope rested on its success, and as the mast-head became invi sible, a prayer for her safety must have burst from every heart, and a tear thrill from each eye on losing the object of its attention. Notwithstanding the distressed state of the colony, care was taken to reserve 300 bushels of wheat for seed, and the Governor Avith his usual Consideration of the public good, gave up 300 weight of flour, which Avas his own property, and received only the same ration for himself as the soldier or the convict. Thus the hut of the convict and the goverment-house knew alike the miseries of want. But though distress reigned universally, it was not possible to pre vent thefts A female convict coming from Rose-hill A*/as robbed of seven days' ration, and as the state of the store Avould not afford her loss to be made good, she Avas left to the charity of the rest, Avho had themselves by far too little to empower them to Avork. An old man, who came to the store for his day's alloAvance, ex hausted with hunger and Aveakened by age, was carried to the hospital, where he died the next day ; his stomach was opened and proved empty, and it appeared, on inquiry, that having nothing to cook his little provision in, he was"], [153, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 85 forced to pay for the loan of one by a part of it, but when he could not afford to do thus, he was obliged to eat them raw, Avhich caused indi gestion, and killed him. At Rose-Hill no misconduct was found among the convicts ; a kangaroo was caught there which Aveighed 180lbs. The native dogs grew troublesome, as they came in numbers by night, and killed several hogs. The colony now became in want of salt, so two boilers Avere erected to boil salt Avater, and by this simple means Avas obtained a supply of that useful article ; and as the fishing tackle began to decrease, a rope-maker, (a convict,) Avas put to make lines from the bark of a tree, like the natives. The little labour that could be ob tained from a starving people, was applied to getting the ground at Rose-Hill and Sydney ready to sow. On the 3d of June, every heart was delighted by the long expected signal for a ship in sight at South head, and though it blew very hard, Captain Tench, and the Go vernor's Secretary, with Mr. White, went off at great risk, and reached the ship in time to give directions for her being placed in Spring Coa-c. She proved to be the Lady Juliana transport, from London, last from Plymouth, from whence she sailed on the 29th of July, with 222 female convicts on board. It was now found that the not hearing from England arose from neglect, delay, and misfortune, and the latter Avas by far the most serious. Tavo months after the Lady Juliana, sailed the Guardian, of 44 guns,"], [154, "86 HISTORY OF Lieut. Riou commander, stored with provisions, &c. which joined Avith those on board the Juliana, made enough for two years, including clothing for the seamen, marines, and convicts, Avines, blankets, medicines, tools, &c. &c. The Guardian had a large collection of private pro- perty, for the officers, on board. Lieut. Riou, with his valuable cargo, touched at the Cape of Good Hope for live stock for the colony, and took on board 150 fruit trees prepared on pur- pose, under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks. This ship, unfortunately for all parties, on the 23d of December, struck against an island of ice, in latitude 45\u00b0. 54'. South, and longitude 41\u00b0. 30'. East, Avhich did her so much damage, that to prevent her instantly sinking, the greater part of the cargo, both public and private pro- perty, Avere obliged to be thrown overboard. The live-stock was all killed, and the trees all destroyed, but the ship herself Avas saved, and had just regained port on the Juliana's arrival, and 75 barrels of flour Avere put on board her from the Guardian ; added to these circumstances, the Lady Juliana brought intel- ligence, that 1000 convicts were to sail from England shortly after, and that a corps of foot for the service of the country Avas raising. The pleasure felt on the first sight of the Juliana, was considerably depressed by the unpleasant news she brought. The birth-day of his Ma jesty was kept Avith every honour, and the Governor pardoned all those in confinement or under sentence of punishment ; and the 9th of"], [155, "87 NEW SOUTH WALES. this month was appointed to be kept as a day of thanksgiving for his Majesty's recovery from his late lamentable illness, of Avhich they noAv first heard. The Lady Juliana could not reach the cove till the 6th. It was much to be lamented, that at a time Avhen a cargo of any thing but convicts Avould have been of service, that scarce any thing else should arrive, but fortunately the colony had effectual relief by the arrival of the Justinian store-ship, Mait land, master, Avith provisions, and requisites of all kinds, from England, after a short passage of five months. Three transports Avere noAv hourly expected, Avith 1000 convicts and detachments of the corps. The day after the Justinian arrived, the full ration was ordered to be given, and served weekly, and the drums beat as formerly for labour, and every thing resumed its former appearance. A shop Avas opened on shore by the master of the Juliana, for the sale of grocery, stationary, glass, &c. &c. but were offered so dear as to sell few. On the 26th, the Surprize transport, from England, Nicholas Anstis, master*, came into the cove ; she had on board several officers and privates of \" The New South Wales Corps,\" and 218 male convicts. This vessel sailed from Ports mouth on the 19th of January, with two other transports, and only parted with them betA*-een the Cape of Good Hope and New South Wales; during the voyage they buried 4*J, and 100 more \u2022 Mr. Anstis was chief-mate on board the Lady Penrhyn,"], [156, "88 HISTORY OF Avere noAv on the sick list. On the 28th, the Neptune and Scarborough anchored off Garden Island, and the next morning entered the Cove. Great fears had been entertained that these vessels would increase the sick list, and these fears Avere realized, for the next day at noon, 200 sickAvere landed from the transports. On the West side was a shocking scene; above 30 tents Avere pitched before the hospital, and all the huts in the neighbourhood Avere filled with sick; many died, being brought on shore, and the appearance of those not on the sick list, Avas emaciated ; this, and the illness of the others, was occasioned by the Avay in which they Avere brought over, some in irons singly, and some linked together. A plan had been detected for a mutiny to take the Scarborough, and this was the cause of much circumspection ; for the future, few were suffered to be on deck at once, so that the Avant of air increased diseases shock ing of themselves, and some on board the Neptune died in irons. Profit to the owners was all that seemed to be considered aboard these vessels. New bread Avas made and deli- vered daily to the sick, and Avine, vegetables, &c. Avere given them, indeed no means of decreasing the sick list was neglected. The detachment of the N ew South Wales Corps Avas disembarked, and they took possession of the quarters allotted them in the marine barracks. The total of sick, on the 30th of June, was 349- By the 7th of July, the portable hospital, brought oA'erin the Justinian, was got up and 2"], [157, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 89 instantly filled ; and on the 13th, the sick list Avas augmented to 488 persons. The convicts whose health would permit, were sent to be employed at Rose-Hill, with a detachment of the New South Wales corps. The Governor this month, marked out land for a toAvn at Rose-Hill, one street of which Avas to be a mile in extent, and 205 feet wide. At the same time, every one Avas busy at Syd ney, discharging the transports, by which Lieut. Riou, sent from the Cape of Good Hope 400 tierces of beef, and 200 of pork, saved from the Guardian's Avreck, Avhich Avith the flour re ceived by the Juliana, was all that could be preserved of the invaluable cargo ; a brick store house Avas built this month, and a road formed from the brick-kilns to the buildings. The Sur prize and Justinian Avere ordered to Norfolk Island, as the Lady Juliana wanted repairs. The Justinian sailed on the 28th of July, with pro visions and stores, and after landing them, was to proceed to Canton to freight home. By this ship the Governor fonvarded dispatches, and the Lady Juliana being by great exertion re paired, sailed in a feAV days on the same course. The Governor received by these ships official instructions, respecting the distribution of land, to those of the marines, who wished to become settlers in the country : every non-commissioned officer Avas to have 130 acres if single, and 150 if married : to every private 80 acres if single, and 100 if married; and 10 acres for >"], [158, "90 HISTORY OF every child born at the time of the grant, free of all rent for five years, and then to pay only one shilling a year for every 50 acres ; and if they entered into the New Corps, and formed a company, to be officered from the marines, they were to have a bounty of Si. and double the quantity of land, if they conducted themselves Avell for five years ; and in this case to be sub- ject to no rent for 10 years, and then only one shilling for every 50 acres : and on such grant to receive one year's provisions, seed, tools, and agricultural implements ; and when they could prove their ability, to cloth and maintain a number of convicts, they Avere to haA*e their labour. Government between each parcel of land so allotted, retained a space as croAvn land, which was to be let on lease for 14 years. In each township 400 acres Avere kept for a clergy- man, and 200 for a school-master. The land, both good and bad, in all cases to be equally divided. The convicts who Avished to become settlers, either on emancipation or discharge, were to receive 30 acres if single, and 50 if married, and 10 for every child born at the time of settling ; and the only conditions re- quired by Government of the settlers, Avere, that they should reside on, and cultivate the ground, and reserve such timber as might be fit for his Majesty's navy. ToAvards the end of July, a Avhale came into the harbour, and some boats went after it, but the people not being acquainted with the use of the harpoon, it es-"], [159, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 91 caped, and in its course upset a punt, and Mr. Furguson, a midshipman of the Sirius, Avith two soldiers were droAvned ; after Avhich it ran on shore, and Avas killed by the natives. On the 1st of August, the Surprize sailed for Norfolk Island, Avith 135 male and 150 female convicts, Avith two superintendants and a deputy com missary. The Scarborough sailed for Canton on the 8th, and the Neptune on the 24th. Exertion Avas now made in all parts to forward the general interest; and as provisions Avere regularly delivered, Avork could be regularly enforced, and the thefts became less frequent, and till September the natives caused no more trouble ; but then Mr. White saAV (Bennillong) the native Avho escaped in May, from the settle ment, and he sent by Mr. White, as a present to the GoA'ernor, a slice of the Avhale. The Governor Avishing to see him, armed, and Avent to the look-out, with a part}7, as he heard the cove was full of natives, and landed just by the whale. Bennillong was there with another, called Cole-be, Avho had also escaped from the settlement. The former Avas so altered in his person, that the Governor could hardly recol lect him, till joined by Lieutenant Waterhouse and Captain Collins, to the latter of Avhich gen tlemen Bennillong was much attached, and now expressed much joy at seeing him again. Various articles Avere given to the 'natives, Avho Avere attending the Avhale feast. They shortly began forming a circle round the Go vernor and his party, this someAvhat alarmed"], [160, "92 HISTORY OF them, and the Governor proposed, retreating backAvards towards the boats, and instructions had been given to the men, to remain on their oars in case of any accident. Bennillong had sheAvn to the Governor several natives, and one he particularly pointed to his Excellency ; wishing to notice him, the Governor Avent to wards him, presenting both his hands, which civility, the savage mistook for an attempt to seize him, so lifting his spear in an instant, dis charged it at the Governor, and Avith such force was it throAvn, that entering above the collar-bone the barb came through on the other side. The spear Avas broken off by Lieut. Wa terhouse, and while the Governor Avas being conducted back to the boat, the men landed armed, but out of four musquets only one would go off. Tavo hours elapsed before the boat could reach the settlement, Avhen the spear was extracted, and the wound pronounced not mortal. This misfortune, no doubt arose from the Governor landing unarmed, for the strong armed party sent off for Mr. White, (the prin cipal surgeon,) to Broken Bay, returned the next day, and though they saAv many natives no accident happened. In a feAv days Bennil long, Avith his Avife and several companions, came to a cove on the North shore, near the settlement, and Mr. White and others taking Boo-roong (the native female child Avho Avas cured of the small- pox) an interview with the natives Avas obtained, in the course of Avhich Bennillong said, he had beaten Wil-le-me-ring,"], [161, "93 NEW SOUTH WALES. (the native Avho had Avounded the Governor,) and that he should Avait some days, in hopes that the Governor would pay him a visit, Avhich his Excellency did, on the tenth day after he received the Avound, but himself and officers were all armed. Bennillong assured him, that it Avas owing to fears for his own safety that Wil-le-me-ring threAV the spear. This visit may be esteemed the foundation of a good understanding Avith the natives. On the 26th of September, five men who had been trans ported for life, effected an escape from Rose- Hill, and on inquiry it Avas found they intended to steer for Otaheite; but from the boat in Avhich they undertook their voyage, there can be no doubt but they perished. In the begin ning of October-, the heat and Avant of rain Avas so great, that the grass caught fire and burned for some miles, but the wind got strong N. W. and it Avas soon checked. On the 8th of Octo ber, Bennillong, after many promises came to see the Governor, and his reception so delighted him, that he wished to have a hut and live near the settlement, for the building of which directions Avere immediately given. On the 19th, a signal was made for a ship in sight, and shortly the Supply came into the Cove from Batavia, after an absence of six months and two days. It Avas Avith great dif ficulty that Lieut. Ball executed his mission, at the expence of 11,6881. 6s. gd. As the five men escaped in September, others Avere tempted to make similar trials, but Avere detected, aud"], [162, "94 * HISTORY OF the masts and oars, &c. they had hid in the Avoods were destroyed. A boat belonging to Mr. White, Avhich Avent out Avith the seine, was filled by the surf, and Avent down near Middle Head, with five people, Avho were all drowned. The oars, &c. which floated on shore, the natives fixed up on the coast, so that they might be seen by our people, this was the first act that shewed a friendly inclination toAvards the colony from them. A Storehouse Avas began and finished in November, at Rose-Hill, the size of which Avas 100 feet by 20. At Syd ney, a landing place on the East side Avas finished, a cutler's-shop, a place to boil oil and melt tallow, and Bennillong's hut Avas com pleted, and he took possession of it. The Dutch Snow, Waaksamheyd, (Good look-out,) hired by Lieut. Ball, anchored in the Cove, with the provisions, &c. bought by that gentleman, at Batavia, AA'hich turned out of an inferior quality, and served to shew that the Dutch are not very nice about oppressing those in Avant, as our colony Avas then. In the course of the year 17g0, 2 seamen, 1 soldier, 123 male convicts, 7 females, and 10 children, died, making together 143 persons. It Avould be A*-ell if at the beginning of the new year, 1791, I could say the convicts in general had become neAv men, but that was not the case ; for as the Indian corn greAV ripe their depredations commenced, notwithstanding the full ration they noAvreceiA7ed : they seemed indeed to have an innate principle for stealing engrafted"], [163, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 95 in their constitutions. In January, the natives stole the colours from the flag-staff. On the 22d, the Supply sailed for Norfolk Island, with provisions, and to bring back Capt. Hunter, and the creAv of the Sirius ; Avith Avhich she re turned on the 26th of February. The greatest distress Avas suffered there previous to the arrival of the provisions, but now every thing Avent on well, and the Supply brought some canvas ma nufactured there, from the flax of the country. On a survey of Norfolk Island, it Avas seen, that only three or four hundred families could be supported by the produce of it. In February, the heat Avas so great at Rose- Hill, that a number of birds and bats fell doAvn dead from the trees and Avhile flying in the air. On the 2d of March, Lieut. Thomas Edgar hoisted a pendant on board the Dutch Sooav, which the Governor hired to go to England ; and at the end of the month, the officers and seamen Avho Avere to return to England, Avere em barked, but ten seamen and two marines preferred settling in NeAV South Wales. On the 28th the Snow sailed for England, with Capt. Hunter, and the officers, and part of the creAV belonging to the Sirius : and in the course of the night of the 28th, one Bryant, (with his wife and tAvo children,) and seA'en other convicts escaped in a boat; and it Avas found the master of the Dutch SnoAV, furnished them Avith a chart and compass, which as some of them understood the use of, there remained no doubt, but they"], [164, "96 HISTORY Of would reach Timor in safety, for it was under stood they meant to make that place. In the course of this month, the first settler, James Ruse, after having been fifteen months on his ground, became desirous of giving up all claims on the public store, as he found he could live on the produce of his farm. As much had been suffered for want of provisions, the Gover nor esteemed it prudent to guard against a second suffering, by lowering the ration in time ; therefore on the first Saturday in April, 3lbs. of flour, Slbs. of rice, and 3lbs. of pork, or 4-|-lbs. of beef were served to every man, woman, and child aboA*e ten years old ; and a smaller to those under that age. A plan Avas now discovered, to take aAvay a sixteen oared boat ; but to guard against this, and all ether similar attempts, a centinel Avas placed on the wharf; and no boat suffered to leave the cove without the knowledge of the officer of the guard. The native, Cole-be, Avho had lately attached himself to Mr. White, came one day Avith a musquet in his hand, Avhich he found at the bottom of the sea Avhile diving ; it Avas thought to have belonged to one of the men Avho were droAvned with Mr. White's boat The Supply did not return from Norfolk Island till the 30th of May, and her long absence began to cause great anxiety, Avhich was accounted for on her arrival, as she had been driven off by contrary winds for ten days. The provisions at Norfolk Island Avere likewise low, and it Avas 2"], [165, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 97 found to produce an evident effect on the countenances of the convicts, having suffered so much from the same cause before. On the 4th of June, the Governor named the tOAvn marked out at Rose-Hill, Paramatta. The good understanding Avhich had commenced Avith the natives, induced them to bring fish to Para matta, and exchange it for a little bread or salt meat ; but that depravity Avhich had hitherto distinguished the convicts, nearly put an end to it, by destroying a canoe belonging to Balloo derry, a native; and though all the convicts con cerned in destroying the canoe Avere punished, the native Avas not satisfied, so threw a spear and Avounded one not concerned in the mischief, Avhich made the Governor, forbid Ballooderry coming near the settlement. This alarmed the natives in general, and they kept away for some time. On the 19th of July, arrived the Mary- Ann transport, from England, with 141 female convicts, six children, and one free Avoman on board, and a small lot of provisions. The Go vernor made known, that no obstacles avouUI be placed in the way, of those Avhose times Avere expired that might wish to return to England, if they could induce the masters of any ships that came to convey them thither. The Ma tilda transport arrived on the 1st of August, after a passage of only four months and 'five days from Portsmouth ; she brought 205 male convicts, a feAv of the NeAV South Wales corps, and provisions for them for nine months after o"], [166, "98 HISTORY OF landing. The Governor placed twelve convicts Avho Avished to become settlers, in a range of farms at the foot of Prospect-Hill, West of Paramatta about four miles, and fifteen others he placed in the district named the Ponds, in a North-East direction, two miles from Para matta, and finding the lots of ground he was instructed to retain, on each side of the grants of land, as croAvn land, Avould affect the inter est of the settlers, he determined in such cases to deviate from that plan ; for the natives tak ing advantage, of the distance settlers lived from each other, actually went and destroyed the hut of one, and Avould have murdered him, had not an armed settler accidentally made his appearance. On the 20th, the At lantic arrived from Plymouth, Avith a party of the New South Wales corps, and 220 male convicts, and the next morning, the Salaman der arrived ; she likeAvise had on board a party of the NeAv* South Wales corps, and 160 male convicts, Avith an alloAvance of nine months' provisions. The latter A-/as ordered to proceed Avith her cargo to Norfolk Island. On the 28th, the William and Ann arrived, likewise Avith a party of military and 181 male convicts. The town noAV filling fast, and spirits finding their way on shore, it was ordered, that any found without a permit from the Judge Advocate should be seized. Ballooderry, with some of his friends, at length ventured into toAvn, but .on an attempt to seize him he threw a spear, on 4"], [167, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 99 Avhich, they Avere fired on, but only one of Bal looderry's companions were Avounded, and they all escaped. The business of this month was principally confined to clearing the transports, and removing the shingles Avith which the houses and other buildings had hitherto been thatched, and regular tiles substituted ; the land in all parts Avas preparing for sowing. On the 3d of September, near 200 male convicts, and a party of the New South Wales corps, went in the Salamander to Norfolk Island. His Majesty's ship Gorgon, of 44 guns, Capt. Parker, arrived on the 21st, she brought from the Cape of Good Hope, a considerable quantity of live-stock, some of which died on board, however they landed one bull-calf, 16 coavs, 68 sheep, and 11 hogs, and 200 fruit-trees, and a quantity of corn and garden seed. By this ship came a public seal for the colony, and a Commission empowering the Governor to remit, either absolutely or con ditionally, the whole, or any part of the terms, for Avhich any fellons might be transported. On the 26th, the Active from England, and the Queen from Ireland arrived in the cove; on board the Active was a party of the new corps, 126 male, and 23 female convicts, and three children. These ships had been very unhealthy during their passage, and many of those in the Active and Queen complained that they had not received a proper allowance of provisions. An inquiry into the conduct of the master of the Queen toqk place before the magistrates, when it appeared he had not acted properly, and the"], [168, "100 HISTORY OF Governor transmitted the proceedings, to the Secretary of State. On a survey of the Supply, it was discovered, after 6 months she would be un able to make a voyage to England, it was therefore determined to send her off directly. The Al bemarle came into the Cove, on the 1 3th of Octo ber, Avith 250 male and 6 female convicts, and 23 of the NeAv South Wales corps. A party of the con victs, in conjunction Avith some of the seamen, made an attempt to seize the ship on the 9th of April, but Avas prevented by Mr. George Brown, -who hearing the alarm, armed, and fired at one of them, and lodged the contents in his shoulder, Avhen they all ran below ; on being secured, tAVo of the ringleaders Avere hung at the fore-yard arm, and two of the seamen Avho it appeared had supplied the convicts Avith tools to saAv their irons off, Avhere left at Madeira to be sent prisoners to England. On the 14th of October, the Britannia, Avith 129 male convicts, stores, and provisions, arrived; and on the 16th, the Admiral Barrington, Avith a party of the neAV corps, 264 male convicts, four free women, and one child. This ship brought 84 sick, who were landed directly, On the 26th, the Atlantic sailed for Norfolk Island, Avith Governor King and family, Avith other persons for the settlement, and then was to proceed to Calcutta for provisions.

Avhere they might live Avithout work. A party Avent in search of them Avithout effect, but a boat going down the harbour a few days after, found the wife of one of the convicts who had absconded Avith him ; however she had been absent from the party three days, and had Avan dered by herself; the next day a boat brought her husband back to the settlement. They both gave the same account of the intentions of the whole party, and that they had suffered much by fatigue, heat of the weather, and hunger. Three more of these foolish people, were found by some officers on an excursion, but did not readily surrender themselves. They Avere sent to Paramatta, and careless of what they before suffered, they a second time decamped, but parties Avere sent in pursuit directly, and re turned with thirteen of those Avho first went off, in a state dreadfully exhausted, having existed chiefly by sucking the wild honey-flower and shrubs. It Avas generally imagined, that the distressed appearance of these Avould deter all others from similar attempts; but more effectu ally to guard against them, the GoA*ernor made known, that in future the parties sent after any run-a-Avays Avould have orders to fire on them, or if brought back alive, they should be chained together, and live on bread and Avater only for the rest of their terms ; and he told them also, that he understood they in tended to arm themselves and seize on the stores; but if any such attempt Avas made, every man concerned should be put to death directly."], [170, "102 HISTORY OF The Britannia, Mary-Ann, William and Ann, and Matilda, made an excursion as an experi ment to see how far it might ansAver the pur pose to visit this coast as a Avhale fishery ; but OAving to the badness of the weather few could be secured though several Avere killed ; but from the great numbers seen, the masters of the ves sels determined to give it another trial as soon as they could refit, which they did Avith much the same success. On the 26th of November, the Supply, Lieut. Ball, sailed for England, at Avhich time there Avere 921 acres of land thin ned, cleared, and cultivated. This month the mortality was so great that 50 male and four female convicts died ; and a servant of Mr. White's in passing from his house to the kitchen, Avithout his hat, Avas deprived of sense and motion by a ray of the sun, and died the next day. At tAvelve o'clock that day, the thermo meter stood at 94\u00b0 \u00b1, aud the wind was N. W. As the heat of the Avater affected the quality, and assisted by the Avatering the transports, considerably decreased the run of Avater, the Governor ordered the stone masons gang, to cut tanks in the rocks, as reservoirs, for Avater enough to last a considerable time. On the 3d of December, the Albemarle and Active sailed for India, and at and after this time orders Avere given to all masters or captains to deliA*er up any convicts or others, Avho might be found secreted on board, the first opportunity, to the British Government.

Tavo men passing took the snake away and killed it. The poor felloAV who Avas bit died the next morning. At Paramatta, the bake-house Avas robbed by a felloAV getting doAvn the chimney, and return ing by the same passage Avith his booty. To preA-ent riotous meetings of the convicts, an inclination for which now shewed itself, the Governor issued a proclamation, declaring, that isa riot took place in the night, that all absent from their huts, would be considered guilty, and be punished accordingly ; and if it hap pened in the day time, all absent from Avork Avould be implicated. At the same time all complaints Avere directed to be made to the overseers, and any person not giving informa tion of any plan for a riot, Avas to be considered as a principal. On the 14th of February, the Pitt, Capt. Manning, from England, came into the Cove, onboard of which was Francis Grose, Esq. Avith the appointment of Lieutenant-Go vernor of the settlement, and Major-Command ant of the New South Wales corps, a part of Avhich came with him ; there came likeAvise, 3ig male and 4g female convicts, 5 children, and 7 free women, with provisions for that number for 10 months, and a sloop in frame of"], [172, "104 HISTORY OF 4 1 tons burthen. The Governor gave permission for a shop to be opened for the sale of articles brought out in thePitt,Avhich sold at great prices, in consequence of the uncertainty of receiving other supplies from England. In March the Pitt sailed for Norfolk Island Avith provisions, and from thence Avas to proceed to Bengal. April and May were distinguished by disease and mortality, many died, and a great number Avere, Avith illness and shortness of provisions, render- ed, so Aveak as to be incapable of labour. The mortality and depredations Avere chiefly con- fined to the convicts Avho came from Ireland in the Queen. The continual depredations at length, in May 1792, met Avith a temporary check, for the Governor ordered, that any body convicted, should be sent to cultiA*ate the new grounds beyond Paramatta ; thus losing the comforts of a hut and garden, as well as the pleasures of being in society, and so poAverfully did this operate, that one attempted suicide to avoid it.

HoAvever, on the 20th, the Atlantic store-ship came into the Cove from Calcutta, Avith provi sions, Avhen the folloAving ration Avas issued for each marine and male convict for a Aveek, 7lbs. \u25a0of bread or flour, 7lbs. ditto of beef, or 4lbs. of pork, 3 pints of pease, -|-lb. of rice, or lib. of \u2022flour, and two-thirds of the above to each woman. A market-place, Avith a clerk to keep ac counts, was appointed at Sydney, and at Para matta, the Clerk had likewise to see thatnostolen goods Avere bought, sold, or exchanged. The harvest being got in, the viler convicts began their depredations again, on the property of in dividuals.

On the 26th of July, the Bri tannia store-ship anchored in the Cove, from Falmouth. This was one of three ships, which were sent out with tweh*e months' cloathing, for flie convicts, four months' flour, and eight months' beef and pork for 4639 persons at a full allowance ; in consequence of which, the Commissary next day issued to each man, 4lbs. of maize, 3lbs. of soujee, 7lbs. of beef, or 4lbs. of pork, 3lbs. of pease, or dholl, and -j-lb. of rice; two-thirds of a man's allowance, Avas issued to every Avoman and child above ten years old, and one-fourth of a man's ration to children under two years old. The Governor, in July, pardoned Elizabeth Perry, Avho came over in 1790, as James Ruse, a settler, had married her, Avhich, Avith her own prudent conduct added to her husband's industry, procured this kindness from the GoA'ernor, and in this and most other cases, the hand of mercy, it A\\*as found, Avas extended with good effect, as by far 4."], [180, "108 HISTORY OF the greater part of those Avho Avere pardoned, bejiaved with the greatest propriety. On the 30th of September, as the Britannia Avas about sailing out, the Atlantic hove in sight, and at night, entered the Cove, from Norfolk Island. GoA-ernor King complained of a grub doing material injury to the corn, which Avas thought to be produced by the great richness of the soil. That valuable article, lime-stone, Avas at length discovered in Norfolk Island, where it grew in great abundance, Avhich super ceetled the necessity of continually rebuilding of barracks, store-houses, huts, &c. The officers of NeAv South Wales engaged the mas ter of the Britannia, to make a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope on their account, for cattle and other articles not to be found in the stores. On the 7th of Oct. the Royal Admiral East In diaman, Capt. Bond, arrived Avith stores and pro visions for the colony, and 21 of the New South Wales corps, a master miller, and a person to be employed in cultiA-ation, and a third as master carpenter, Avith 289 male, and 47 female convicts. The Britannia sailed on the 24th for the Cape, and Mr. Raven took the Governor's dispatches for England, in Avhich he demanded a supply of 12 months' provisions directly. A licence Avas granted for the sale of porter, but as spirits A*ere introduced, it in fact, became a public house, Avith its usual accompaniments, drunkenness and idleness. At the latter end of the month a general deliA-ery of ckoathing, &c. to the convicts took place, which consisted of"], [181, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 109 two frocks, two pairs of troAvsers, one pair of stockings, one hat, one pair of shoes, lib. of soap, three needles, a quarter of a pound of thread, and a comb to each male; and to the females were delivered one cloth petticoat, one shift, one pair of shoes, one pair of stockings, lib. of soap, a quarter of a pound of thread, two ounces of pins, six needles, one thimble, and a pair of scissars. Of the quality of these articles not much can be said in favour of, they Avere literally made only to sell ! ! ! October closed, Avith a melancholy circum stance, to the feelings of those who valued real worth, it was Governor Phillip's making known, his determination of quitting his Government and returning in the Atlantic to England, as his health was on the decline, and he hoped by a change of air shortly to reinstate it. The 1st of November, was distinguished by the arrival of the Philadelphia brigantine, Patrick son master, from Philadelphia, *w*ho having heard of our distress for Avant of provisions, at the Cape of Good Hope, made the best of his Avay to England, and from thence to Philadel phia, and getting his cargo on board, sailed here with beef, wine, rum, gin, tobacco, pitch, and tar. The Governor bought as much for the public store as amounted to 28291. 11s. and the rest of his cargo was sold to the officers to grc.t advantage The Go\\-ernor hired this vessel at the expense of 1501. to go to Norfolk Island with provisions and stores."], [182, "110 HISTORY OF Having noAv reached that period, of the His tory of NeAV South Wales, in Avhich I find it re quisite, as a faithful historian of the country, to introduce myself, I must beg leaA'e to make use of the Avords of that truly respectable author, and esteemed gentleman, Capt.

He Avas afterwards SAvorn in as a peace officer. Here Avas not only a reAvard for past good conduct,. but an incitement to a continuance of it; and Barrington found himself through the Go vernor's liberality, though not so absolutely free as to return to England at his own pleasure, yet enjoying the immunities of a free man, a settler, anil a civil officer, in whose integrity much confidence Avas placed.\" On the 13th, the Royal Admiral sailed for Canton.

On the 18th a melancholy accident took place; the wife of Williams, a settler, with a child, and the Avife of a man named Green, had been drinking with Williams and others, at Sydney, and were going in a small boat to Paramatta, with a bag of rice belonging to Green, and as some Avater got to it, she endeavoured to moA-e the bag, and in the attempt overset the boat, Avhen both women and the child Avere droAvned.

The Bellona sailed on the lgth for Canton, previous to Avhich, the master Avas suffered to take on board, tA\\*o convicts Avhose terms had expired, and to prevent any getting off Avithout leave of the Government, the master permitted the ship to be smoked, Avhich produced four convicts who had found means to get secreted on board.

They Avere called the Descuvierta and Atrevida, (the Dis covery and Intrepid) the former commanded by Don Alexandro Malaspina, commander of the expedition, and the latter by Bon Jose' de Bustamante y Guevra. They requested per mission to build an observatory near the point of the Cove, on which the hut Avas built for Bennillong, which hut they used as a magazine for their instruments. The presence of these \u2022trangers afforded a pleasing* variety to the uni formity of occurrences at Sydney. On the 21st, returned the Kitty from Norfolk Island, whither she had been Avith provisions, and Go vernor King, returned by her, many of such characters, as he had reason to believe would occasion him trouble ; and he stated in his dis patches, that the harvest of wheat and maize had proved so prolific, that he had enough for tAvelve months. The people Avere healthy, and not one offence had been committed, deserving punishment, for three months. The master of the Shah Hormuzear, having submitted proposals for procuring live-stock, an agreement was entered into for that purpose, and Bengal settled to be the place from whence they should come, as Avell as some provisions, for Avhich purpose he quitted the Cove on the 19th of April, in company Avith the Chesterfield, having to carry, in conjunction with that ship, provisions and stores to Governor King, at"], [190, "118 HISTORY OF Norfolk Island, which, Avith what he had already sent him, made enough fortAvelve months, but as a signal for a strange sail Avas made, both ships Avaited to knoAv the event.

Provisions now began to get very short, and a decrease in the ration Avas become requisite, but the Lieutenant- Governor wishing to retard the evil day, proposed staying one more week, previous to carrying into effect the deduction. On the next Mon day the Britannia returned, after an absence of eight months ; at the Cape of Good Hope she took on board 30 coavs, 3 mares, and 12 goats, -with a quantity of flour, sugar, tobacco, and spirits ; but though the greatest attention Avas paid to the live stock, 29 coavs and 3 goats died. This afforded another instance of the great difficulty in bringing live-stock to the colony ; which will be still more evident by the following statement :"], [192, "120 HISTORY OF Embarked at various times for the colony, 15 bulls, 1 19 coavs, and 6 calves.

On Sunday, the 8th, the Britannia and Francis sailed foi Dusky Bay. On Tuesday, the 17th, K"], [194, "HISTORY OF 122 the Sugar-Cane arrived, Avith 110 male and 50 female convicts. In the course of the voyage a mutiny Avas discovered, and one convict found Avithout his irons was executed,4 which prevented any more mischief. This ship brought for the colony 31,4961bs. of beef, 45,440 lbs. of pork, 64,512 lbs. of flour, 44 tons of lime-stone, 17 bales and 5 cases of clothing and necessaries. The Boddingtons' and Sugar-Cane both sailed on the 13th. A mill for grinding corn was invented by a convict named Wilkinson, which Avas found to ansAver so well, that the Lieutenant-Governor ordered the artificers and a gang of convicts from Paramatta to assist in making one, under Wiliamson's directions, on a larger scale. A a\\ 'arrant of emancipation passed the great seal for 23 convicts, on condition of their entering into the New South Wales corps. From Paramatta information Avas received, that four people, in the night of the 15th, broke into the house of a settler, (John Randall,) with their faces and hands blackened, Avhere with bludgeons, they nearly murdered tAvo men Avho lived with him, and but for the activity and resistance of these two, they would have ef fected their intentions ; and the same account said, that seven of those lately from Ireland had absconded to the avoocIs.

In a storm, on the 26tb, two boys ran to a tree for shelter, and the next morning Avere found dead, being killed by light ning, and they Avere buried in one grave. This Avas the first accident of the kind which had happened in the Colony. On the 29th, the Fairy American Snow, arrived from Boston, in New England, and was to proceed to the North- West coast of America. On Thursday, No vember 7th, the Francis returned from Dusky Bay. On Saturday, the 23d of November, the first Avheat issued from the store, and the pro duce of the country Avas delivered, and for the first week, great inconvenience Avas sustained to get it ground, but other mills Avere erected, and this evil was of no long duration. The wheat sown in April was this month reaped and got in, Avhich the Lieutenant-GoA'emor agreed to buy of all settlers to Avhom it belonged, at 10s. per bushel. Guilty ignorance, eA-ery ready to cherish erroneous notions, of escaping that punishment which it deserves, by some flaAV in the administration of justice, offered to the minds of the convicts a curious idea, which was, that the Lieutenant-Governor, had not the power of ordering a sentence of death to be executed, =0"], [196, "124 HISTORY OF that it became requisite, to let them see the contrary, which Avas done in executing John CroAv, Avho Avas convicted some time before, but had been respited twice. In a storm, on the 6th of December, a boat Avhich came from Pa ramatta Avith corn, filled Avith Avater Avhich ran off the Avharf, and sunk, by Avhich 280 bushels of Indian corn and a few of Avheaten meal Aiere lost, except to the natives, who Avere so fond of it that many dived and brought up considerable quantities. , Spirits gained such an ascendency over the weak minded, that they refused any thing else in payment for labour while they were to be obtained, and several officers' ser vants stole them from their masters. Sydney had noAv increased, since Governor Phillip quitted it 160 huts and 5 barracks. Towards the close of December, a party of natives at tacked several settlers, and taking all their pro visions, fled to the Avoods. Passage boats Avere alloAved noAv to go from Sydney to Paramatta. These were the property of convicts Avho had served their time; the fare was one shilling for each person, and all lug gage Avas paid Is. per cwt. for. In the year 1793, there died 7 soldiers, tAvo settlers, 78 male convicts, 26 female convicts, and 29 children ; and Avith accidents, .Sec. the decrease Avas 153 persons.

His body was found a feAV days afterwards in a holloAV, co vered with logs, boughs, and grass ; the hands, and flesh of one arm, had been torn off by the native dogs. This poor felloAV, unfortunately, had boasted of having saved some money, and had seAved it in his clothes to prevent losing it, should his hut be robbed while he was out. The body was brought in and buried at Para^ matta, but no discovery could be made of Avho murdered the poor man. Likewise on the 5th, the Francis sailed for Norfolk Island, the Lieu tenant-Governor, becoming anxious to knoAV the state of that settlement. On an account being taken of the salt provisions at Sydney and Paramatta, only enough Avas found to last for 1 0 weeks, at the ration of 3lbs. per week for a man. One of the men employed by the officers to shoot game, having caught three kangaroo's brought two in, and said he cut the other up for the dogs, when in fact he had sold it to one Lane, a man Avho had been a con vict. To prevent thefts, the best way is cer tainly to punish receivers, for Avithout them there Avould be no temptations. Under this jdea, the Lieutenant-Governor ordered Lane to have 100 lashes, to be dependant on the store for provisons, and sent to Toongabbe to labour. Notwithstanding the great crops of corn ga thered by the settlers, only 160 bushels Avere offered to government, though it Avas ascer tained that at least 7000 bushels of wheat alone"], [200, "126 HISTORY OF bad been produced. Some kept it for distil ling and breAving, Avhile others paid debts, con tracted by gaming Avith it ; for the last indeed, some had gone so far as to lose their farms, and ethers absolutely losing their clothes off their backs, Avent naked. Ruse, the first settler, and one Williams, having imprudently sold their farms, and spent the money they produced, gained permission to begin new ones, about 24 miles from Paramatta, Avith some others Avho were about settling. On the 12th of February, the Francis returned from Norfolk Island. The accounts from Governor King Avere highly satisfactory, the harvest, Avhich was abundant, \u2022\u2022was all got in, and every store in such plenty as seemed to defy any idea of future Avant; the people Avere all in good health, and the live stock increasing rapidly. The two natives of New Zealand, sent by the Shah Hermuzear, answered the purpose so well that though Go vernor King had few hands and bad materials, a quantity of canvas Avas manufactured Aveekly; but the New Zealanders, having sheAvn great anxiety to return home, Governor King thought the Britannia's calling at Norfolk Island a faA'ourable opportunity, and embarked with a guard and the two natives for New Zealand*, * The following account of the Flax Manufactory, on the New Zealanders leaving Norfolk Island, can hardly prove un acceptable : Not more than nine men and nine women could be employed in preparing, and manufacturing the flax, which barely kept them in practice. There was only one loom on the island, and"], [201, "127 NEAV SOUTH WALES. leaving Capt. Nepean, (avIio Avas on his return to Europe by the Britannia,) as Governor in his the slay or rred designed for coarse canvas ; nor did they pos sess a single tool required by flax-dressers or weavers, beyond the poor substitutes which they wore obliged to fabricate themselves. If there had been proper slays or reeds, brushes, and other articles indispensably necessary for flax-dressing and weaving, with more people to work the flax and a greater number of weavers, this island might soon require very little assistance in clothing the convicts; but for want of these necessary articles, the oidy cloth that could be made was a little canvas some thing finer than No. 7, which is thought to be equally strong and durable as that made from European flax. This useful plant needs no cultivation. An experiment has been made to cultivate it, and answered extremely well ; but the produce was not so much superior to that growing in a natural state as to make it advisable to bestow any pains oa its culture. Before the arrival of the two New Zealanders, no effectual progress had been made in its manufacture ; nor was its without much intreaty that these visitors were induced to furnish the information required. And indeed, as this work if principally performed by the women In New Zealand. they were by no means competent to s^ive the fullest in structions. Sufficient however was obtained from them to im prove upon. Since that time those women that could be spared from other work, not exceeding from six to twelve, had been employed in preparing the flax ; and u flax-dresser, weaver, and three other assistants, in manufacturing it into canvas, rope, ivc. When the leaves are gathered, the hard stalk running through the centre is taken out with the thumb-nail ; and the red edges of the leaf are also stripped off. The two parts are then separated in the middle, making tour slips of about three quarters of an inch wide, aud the length of from eighteen inches to three or four feet. These slips arc cut across the centre with a muscle-shell, hut not so deep as to separate the fibres, which is the flax. The slips thus prepared are held in"], [202, "128 HISTORY OF absence. The passage Avas short, for on the 4th day the natives Avere landed among some the left hand, with the thumb resting on the tipper part of the slip just above the cut. The muscle-shell held in the right band is placed on the upper part just below the cut, with the thumb resting on the upper part. The shell is drawn to the end of the slip, which separates the vegetable covering from tte flaxen filaments. The slip is then trimmed, and the same operation is performed on the remaining part, which leaves the flax entire. If it be designed for fishing lines, or other coarse work, nothing more is done to it ; but if intended for cloth, it is twisted and beaten for a considerable time in a clear stream of water ; and when dried, twisted into such threads as the work requires. Instead of working it as soon as gathered, our people found it work better for being placed in a heap in a close room for five days or a week, after whick it became softer and pleasantcr to work. They also found it easier, and more expeditious, to scrape the vegetable covering from the fibres, which is done with three strokes of a knife. It is then twisted, and put into a tub of water, where it remains until the day's work is finished. The day following it is washed and beaten in a running stream. AV'hen sufficiently beaten it is dried, and needs no other preparation, until it is hackled and spun into yarn for weaving. The numbers employed at this work were as follow : Invalids gathering the flax - 3 men ; Preparing it - -' 7 women; Beating and washing it - 3 who are invalids; Flax-dresser - - 1 Spinners - 2 women; Weaver and assistant - 2 men ; Total, 18; by whose weekly labour sixteen yards of canvas of the size of No. 7 was made.

The of fence committed, Avas owing to a jealousy Avhich had arisen between the soldiers and free men, settlers and others, occasioned by some acts of violence and improper behaviour on both sides, which broke out one evening, at a place the Lieutenant-Governor had permitted plays to be represented by the convicts. Mr. King, who Avas present, thought it necessary to order one of the soldiers into confinement. When the play was ended, the detachment repaired to their commanding officer, and demanded the release of their comrade ; on his declaring his inabi lity to comply with such request, they signified a resolution to release him themselves; upon which the officer remonstrated with them, and ing the European hemp, and the accidents to which it is liable during its growth, are all, by using this flax, avoided, as it needs no cultivation, and grows in Sufficient abundance on all the cliffs of the island (where nothing else will grow) to give constant employment to live hundred people. Indeed, should it be thought an object, any quantity of canvas, rope or linen, might be made there, provided there were men and women, weavers, flax-dressers, spinners, and rope-makers, with the necessary tools; but destitute as our people were of these aids, all that could be done was to keep in employ the few that could be spared from other essential work. s"], [204, "history or they dispersed. On the following morning, Avhen the Lieutenant-Governor was made acquainted Avith the circumstances, he con vened all the officers in the settlement, and laid before them Avhat he had heard, together with an account of a determination among the soldiers, to release from the halberts any of their comrades who should be ordered punish ment, for any offence or injury done to a settler; all of which he caused to be authenticated upon oath. The result of the officers Avas, that the detachment should be disarmed, and all those settlers from the marines and Sirius's ship's company, should be embodied and armed as a militia to do their duty. This Avas put in execution on the 21st, by sending the de tachment from their quarters unarmed, upon different duties; while the new-raised militia took possession of their arms. On their return, tAventy Avere selected as mutineers to be sent to Sydney, the remainder returning to their duty immediately ; (but of that number ten Avere, after a fieAv days confinement, pardoned and liberated ;) and two days after the Francis appeared. At the conclusion of February, the natives again caused great trouble, robbing and doing every kind of mischief, and though they kept in the woods near the settlements, and ge nerally murdered all the white people they could, yet so great was the dread of labour to many of the convicts, that they absconded con tinually to the woods, thus shewing that they"], [205, "131 NEW SOUTH WALES. preferred death to work. On the last day of deliA'ering provisions for February, (the22d,) it Avas found, that if some did not arrive in a fort night, there Avould not be an ounce left. Thus situated nothing was neglected. The shark Avas even found of service, and the oil produced from the liver of it sold at Is. per quart; candles Avere a luxury in the colony which few could boast of. The Indian corn was hoav nearly ripe, and as the seed wheat, Avas yet held sacred, it Avas hoped that the Indian corn Avould be ready in time to prevent such a fatal resource ; for the stock of seed Avheat, even if added to all the live-stock, could last but a short time for so many as 5000 people. Providentially the very day that the last provisions Avere delivered from the store, the 8th of March, a signal of a vessel in sight was made, but bv great Avind and stormy Aveather, it Avas the 10th when she an chored in the Cove, and proved to be the Wil liam, Folger, of London, last from Cork, with a cargo of 1 173 barrels of beef, and 907 of pork, but no flour. At the same time arrived the Arthur, a small brig of 95 tons, from Bengal, Avith beef, pork, sugar, rum, and calicos. In consequence of these fortunate arrivals, the full ration Avas ordered to be delivered, and the short alloAvances, as promised, made gootl. Distress Avhich had never yet encreased the morality of the convicts, iioav sheAved that the love of gam ing could keep its ascendency over eA*en hunger itself. Of those adicted to gaming, one Avas an overseer, avIio giving offence to some of the"], [206, "132 HISTORY OF convicts, they formed a plan to strip him, the first time they kneAv he had any considerable sum about him ; when engaged at play, a party rushed on him just as he had won 15 dollars, and thus at once secured them, but he seized one Avith 10 dollars in his hand, Avhich Avas all he recovered. The overseer confessed, that it Avas owing to gaming only, that he became a convict; thus, though under punishment for the effects, he still retained a determination to practice the great cause, of all evils which at tended him. On the 3d of April, the D\u00e6dalus, store-ship, anchored from the North-West coast of America. The native Avho Avent out in this ship, returned Avithout acquiring much of our language, but he had rendered himself particu larly esteemed by every body in the ship. The Arthur sailed on the same day as the D\u00e6dalus arrived, and the Francis came in the next day from Norfolk Island. The good order which reigned in Norfolk Island had rendered keeping the settlers together as a militia, unnecessary. The natives continually visited those parts Avhere the corn A^-as nearly ripe, and in such numbers, that it Avas found requisite for the watchmen to fire on them, and this order pro duced many tales from the men about the natives coming in great numbers, and the valour of those a*1io drove them away ; they Avere at length given no credit to, so in a few days a watchman brought in the head of one native he had shot.

Slbs. of flour, 7lbs. of beef, or 4-lbs of pork, and three pints of Indian corn, of which latter article government had bought, of the settlers and others 6l63| bushels. The Britannia returned on the 1st of June, whose arrival had been anxiously expected. The length of her absence Avas accounted for by her being forced to go to Batavia instead of Bengal, as she was attacked in the Straits of Malacca, by a fleet of piratical prows, from which she escaped after an engagement of six hours. The Britannia brought 2.50 casks of beef, 250 casks of pork, 500 pecols of sugar, and 55 coyangs of rice. On the 8th of June^ arrived the Speedy, store-ship.

On the 28th, the Francis returned from Norfolk Island, whither she had been sent to inform Governor King that supplies Avould speedily be sent him ; who in return sent information, that the harvest had been prodigiously productive; that he had purchased 11000 bushels of maize of the set tlers, for the amount of which he had drawn bills, but the Lieutenant-Governor thinking it not requisite to put such an expense on the crown, declined accepting the bills till he had the approbation of government. On the 1st of September, the Britannia sailed, for the second time on a A*oyage of speculation, on account of the officers, to the Cape of Good Hope, for live stock and other articles. On the 10th, arrived from England, the Resolution ; and on the 11th the Salamander, both freighted Avith pro visions and stores for the colony. The heavy weather they had met with, considerably da maged the ships and stores. By those vessels came intelligence, that John Hunter, Esq.

Some of the ignorant Irish con victs, this month seized a boat, but after an ab sence of some time, landed at Botany Bay, which led to their detection of course. On the 17th, a dreadful accident happened at Para matta; a building in which Avas 2400 bushels. of maize caught fire, and Avas comsumed with a number of fine hogs. In the course of Sep tember, it became requisite to treat the natives with severity. A settler, and his servant, at HaAvkesbury, Avere nearly murdered by the natives Avho stole on them so privately, as not to be discoA'ered, till they had got so near as to preAent their getting assistance. A few days after, the natives attacked some others, and carried off every thing they could find ; but the settlers collectively followed, with arms, and killed eight on the spot.

Hill the fiend of iniquity, Avas executed on the 16th, and dissected. The settlers at Hawkesbury, uoav seemed to require some person of authority to be present, for an account Avas received, that the natives were urged to their late depredations, by an act of cruelty, to a native boy, whom the set tlers had tied hands and feet together, and dragging him several times through a fire, threAV him into a river and then shot him, this they in part acknoAvledged, but assigned as the cause that the boy had been sent among them as a spy.

On the 15th, before the departure of the Lieutenant-Governor, those convicts under confinement were released, and allotments of land made to those who wished it. During December, a farm of 25 acres Avas sold by auction for 131. The frequent failures of those Avho attempted to escape from the colony, either by stealing boats or going to the woods, by no means lessened the desire of others, though sel dom many days expired without their returning themselves, or being taken and brought back. On the 24th arrived the Experiment Snow, from Bengal, with a feAv provisions, spirits, sugar and piece-goods, on speculation. On the departure of Lieutenant-Governor Grose, the government deA-olved on Captain William Patterson, of the New South Wales corps. The loss by death in 1794, Avas only 59 persons. In January, 1795, the attention Avas turned to preparing the ground for Avheat. The Indian corn, which Avas now ripening about Hawkes bury, promised at least 30,000 bushels of that grain. Some of the young natives, Avho lived among the settlers became so useful, that they Avould in three or four hours do as much Avork as Avas allotted to a convict for a day's work. At this time the heavy rains swelled the river Hawkesbury to such a degree, that consider able damage was done to the crops of the settlers and government. A bridge at Para- T"], [212, "138 HISTORY OF matta, Avas SAvept aAvay by the torrent. No doubt now remained of the bad conduct of some of the settlers toward the natives. In revenge they threatened to put to death three of the settlers, Doyle, Forester, and Nixon ; and had actually attacked and Avounded tAVO other set tlers, Shadrech and Akers, Avhose farms and persons they mistook for those of Doyle and Forester's. These particulars Avere procured through the means of one Wilson, a very wild young, man, who, his term of transporta tion being expired, preferred living among the natives in the vicinity of the river, to earn ing the Avages of honest industry by working for settlers. He had formed a strange medley language betAveen his oavu and theirs, Avith Avhich he made shift to comprehend something of what they Avished him to communicate ; for the3r did not conceal the sense they entertained of the injuries which had been clone to them. The tribe Avith whom Wilson associated had given him a name, Bun-bo-e.

Suffini would not haA*e been shot at, had he not refused to surrender when called to by the Avatchman while in the a-ct of plundering a garden. About the latter end of the month the natives adjusted some affairs of honour near the brick fields. The people avIio live about the South shore of Botany Bay brought Avith them a stranger of an extraordinary appearance and character; his name was Gome-boak. He had been several days on his journey from the place Avhere he lived, Avhich Avas far to the southward. In height he Avas not more than five feet tAvo or three inches; but he Avas by far the most muscular, square, and well-formed native ever seen.

The usual attend ants on a short ration shortly appeared ; private stocks Avere robbed, and huts broke open ; but as many Avere caught, a rascal, to preAent that detection he Avould probably meet Avith, if he broke into a hut, hit upon a nevf plan ; he stole a greyhound, which he killed, and sold to the hungry for kangaroo, at nine-pence per pound. The Providence, of 28 guns, Capt. Broughton, from England, arrived, she had been driven Northward as far as Port Stephens, Avhere Capt. Broughton found and took on board four miserable objects of men, Avho had escaped from Sydney, in 1790, and from the Avretched boat which they stole, every one thought they must have been drowned. The tale they told furnished amusement to gaping croAvds for some days ; it seemed that having made Port Stephens, they lived like the savages, but the food by no means agreed with them. Each had a name and a Avife given him by the natives, and tAvo of them had children. The natives fed them, and they Avere considered by them as un fortunate creatures, entitled to their protection,"], [217, "143 NEW SOUTH AVALES. and as they and the natives began to understand each other, they impressed on the minds of the poor savages an idea, that they Avere the spirits of their ancestors, and one poor native so truly believed it, that he seemed to recognize the features of his father in one of the convicts, and took him to the place Avhere his father Avas burnt. The Fancy arrived on the 3d of Sep tember, from Norfolk Island, Avhere plenty abounded ; 4000lbs of pork had been salted, and the Governor offered 40 tons of salt provi sions he had, and could spare to the settlement at Sydney. On the 7th of September, the Supply and Reliance arrived, the latter of which A'essels, had Governor Hunter on board.

In the beginning of October, civil ma eistrates were substituted for military ones. On the 4th, the store-ship, Young William, an- chored in the Cove, with a cargo of provisions, with which being oA'erloaded, she Avas much damaged. In consequence of this supply the ration Avas considerably improved. On the 13th the Providence sailed for Nootka Sound ; on the l6th, the Supply for Norfolk Island ; and on the 29th the Young William for Canton. On the 5th of November, the Sovereign arrived laden A'/ith provisions. By this ship arrived Mr. Hibbins, as Deputy Judge-Advocate. On the 7th, Smith and Whitehouse Avere tried for, and found guilty of, breaking into a house, stripping it, destroying the live-stock, and cruelly beating a servant; on the 1 6th they were led to execution Arhen the Governor par- doned Whitehouse.

On the 20th, the Supply returned from Norfolk Island, and brought the unplea- sant intelligence, that the Lieutenant-GoA'ernor Avas very ill ; and OAving to the rats, and a weed called cow-itch, cultivation was much injured. Several contests which had lately taken place in Sydney and its neighbourhood, among the natives, Avere attended by many of those who inhabited the Avoods, and came from a great distance inland. Some of the prisoners gather ing from time to time rumours of the existence 4"], [219, "New south wales*. 145 bf our cattle lost in 1788, tAvo of them resolved on ascertaining the truth of these reports, and tried by different excursions, to discover their retreat. On their return from the first, subse quent to the Governor's arrival, they reported, that they had seen them. Being, however, at that moment too much engaged in perfecting the civil regulations for the settlement, the Go vernor could not go to that part of the country in Avhich where they were said to have been found ; but detatched Henry Hacking. His report was so satisfactory, that on the 1 8th, the Governor set off from Paramatta^ attended by a small party, Capt. Collins, Capt. Waterhouse, and Mr. Bass, Avhen after travelling two days, in a direction S. S. W. from the settlement at Prospect Hill, he crossed the river named the Nepean ; and to his great surprize and satisfac tion, fell in Avith a fine herd of cattle, upwards of 40 in number, grazing in a pleasant and fertile pasturage. The day being far advanced when he saw them, he rested for the night, hoping in the morninsr to see the Avhole herd. A doubt had arisen, of their being cattle produced from what Avere brought from the Cape; as it was thought they might be of longer standing ; the Governor thought it worth determining, and directed the attendants in the morning to procure and kill a calf. This they Avere not able to effect ; for while lying in Avait for the herd to pass (uoav seen to consist of upwards of sixty young and old,) they were furiously u"], [220, "146 history of set upon by a bull, Avho brought up the rear, and Avhich they killed in their OAvn defence.

Being at this time 38 miles from Paramatta, little of the meat could be sent in. The country where they Avere found grazing Avas remarkably pleasant ; every Avhere Avas thick and luxuriant grass ; the trees Avere thinly scattered, and free from underwood ; seA*eral beautiful flats presented large ponds, covered Avith ducks and black sAvans, and the ground rose from these levels into gently rising hills. Those lost in 1788, tAVO bulls and five cows, must have travelled in a Avestern direction until they came to the banks of the Nepean, and find ing the crossing easy, they came at once into a country Avell-Avatered and stored with grass. Thus finding themselves in possession of a pasture equal to their support, and in Avhich they remained undisturbed ; and as few natives Avere to be seen near there, they Avere likely to remain for years unmolested, to propagate their gpecies. It Avas a happy circumstance to have in the Avoods of New South Wales a thriving4 herd of Avild cattle.

Collins, \" if suffered to remain undis turbed for some years, Avould, like the cattle of South America, always prove a market suffi cient for the inhabitants of the country; and perhaps, not only for their OAvn consumption, but for exportation. The Governor saAV it in this light, and determined to guard, as much as Avas in his poAver, against any attempts to destroy them.\" Discharging the store-ship, part of the cargo of which, Avas injured by the Aveather she had met Avith, formed the principal labour of the month, owing to the small number of Avork ing men which could be got together, the Go vernor Avas forced to order tAvo men to be sent for this purpose from every farm having ten, till the provisions Avere placed in the public store.

Of his dress he Avas particular, and indeed he appeared highly delighted Avith civilized life. On malting inquiry for his wife, he found she had favoured a rival, but on producing a jacket and petticoat, she left her loA-er and fol loAved Bennillong ; how ever, in a day or two, the lady appeared as unadorned as usual, and Bennillong Avas not with her. Caruey, his rival, it Avas found had been beaten by Bennil long, Avho had learnt in England the use of his fists, Avhich gave him an advantage Caruey hy no means understood. However he gave up his false wife, and said he would make a better choice next time Bennillong Avas frequently absent from the Governor, but Avdien he re turned he neA-er came into the presence of his Excellency till he had dressed himself, for when he went on an excursion he left his clothes at home. In December a report reached Sydney, that the natives had been committing their de predations again, at some farms doAvn the river, and on an armed party being sent out, five Avere killed, one wounded, and four taken prisoners.

His wife War-re-weer shewed by an uncommon attention her great attach ment to him. The Sovereign sailed on the 27th for Bengal. At Sydney, an attempt being made to steal a cask of pork from the pile of provisions before the store-house, the Avhole Avas removed into one of the old marine barracks. At HaAvkesbury an extraordinary ph\u0153nome non occurred. Four farms on the creek named Ruse's Creek, the crops on all of which were ripe, and prodigiously fine, were totally cut up by a fall of large flakes of ice. This memo rable shower passed in a direction North- West, taking such farms as fell within its course. The effect was extraordinary ; the Avheat theu standing was beaten clown, the ears cut off, and the grain threshed out. Of the Indian corn the huge thick stalks were broken, and the cobs found lying at the roots. A man who Avas distant from a house Avas glad to take shelter in the hollow of a tree.

Only 26 persons lost their lives in the year 1795, which certainly Avas much fewer than could be expected. Happy indeed Avould it be, if at the close of 1795, the settlement could be found unincumbered by those, Avho like other beasts of prey, sought only Avhom they might devour; and it is particularly distressing to observe, that the several depredations commit ted, Avere on the properties of such persons as implicated those about them as being accessaries, though in many cases unjusly no doubt.

Unrivalled there, none will dispute my claim To high pre-eminence and exalted fame. As oft on Gadshill we have ta'en our stand, When 'twas so dark you could not see your hand, Some true-bred Falstaff we may hope to start, Who, when well-bolster'd, well will play his part. The scene to vary, we shall try in time To treat you with a little pantomime. Here light and easy Columbines are found, And well-tried Harlequins with us abound ; From durance vile our precious selves to keep, We often had recouse to th' flying leap ; To a black face have sometimes ow'd escape, And Hounslow Heath, has proved the worth of crape But how, you ask, can we e'er hope to soar, Above these scenes, and rise to Tragic lore ?

This ship likewise brought intelligence, that the Cape of Good Hope had surrendered to his Majesty's arms ; and General Craig and Commodore Blanket, both sent official accounts of the circumstance to Governor Hunter, kindly offering any ser vices in their poAver for the benefit of the settlement. On the 15 th, the black C\u00e6sar was shot by WimboAV. This man and another, tempted by the reAvard of five gallons of spirits, had been for some days in quest of him.

On the 18th, the Otter sailed for America. By her escaped Thomas Muir, transported for sedition, and several others Avhose sentences were not expired.

Improvident even for their own safety and interest, they ne glected the means by which all could be secured. This disposition being soon manifest, the Go vernor thought it necessary to issue an order, stating his expectations and directions, \" that all the people residing in the different districts of the settlements, whether the alarm Avas on their own farms, or on the farm of any other person, should upon such occasions immedi ately render to each other such assistance as each man, if attacked, would himself Avish to receive; and he assured them, that if it should hereafter be proved, that any settlers or other persons withdrew or kept back their assistance from those Avho might be threat ened, or Avho might be in danger of being at tacked, they would be proceeded against as persons disobeying the rules and orders of the settlement,\" Those Avho had fire-arms were en joined not Avantonly to fire at, or take the lives of any of the natives, as such an act Avould be considered as murder, and subject the offender to such punishment as the law might direct.

HoAvever from the frequent intoxication Avhich great numbers had for some time been seen in, there Avas reason to suspect that a greater quantity of spirits had been landed from the different ships than permits had been obtained for. Governor Hunter, to suppress the practice of retailing spirits in this indiscriminate Avay, thought proper not only to grant licences under these restrictions, but desired the aid of all officers to use their exer tions to end a species of traffic, from Avhich the destruction of all industry Avas to be ex pected, and no good could result.

A timber carriage Avas this month made use of both at Sydney and Paramatta, draAvn by oxen, which saAred much time, and the labour of many men. Several women were employed in haymaking, at Toongabbe, which Avas to be carried out by those ships, about to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope for cattle. On the 4th of July, Smith, a seaman of the Indispensable, Avas shot hy David Lloyd, a convict servant; and at the Hawkesbury, on the same day, David Lane was shot by John Fenlow, his master. Lane expired in a few hours, but Smith languished till the 9th, and then died at the hospital.

Live-stock Avas rapidly increasing at this time, and an officer about leaving the colony, sold to government a flock of 100 goats, for 4901. 10s. which enabled the Governor to perform some promises he had made of giving to several worthy settlers a number of those valuable animals. Information was given to the Governor, that several persons were building boats Avithout permission ; notAvithstanding the convenience which must attend having boats in the harbour, abuses Avere carried on by their means. An or der was given, that no boat should be built Avithout the Governor's permission in Avriting; and that all boats in the possession of indivi duals, should be taken to the master boat builder, and numbered on the stern, a register of which should be kept by the provost-martial ; and all boats Avithout a number Avere to be seized. The natives had been less troublesome lately than for some time.

On the 29th, the Francis returned from Norfolk Island. The criminal court at that settlement had been assembled, and one con vict suffered death for a most daring burg lary, Avhich he and two others effected with circumstances of cruelty. The accomplices were sentenced to hard labour on Phillip Island. The gangs at this place employed in public works were seldom seen in the afternoon. It appeared that, notAvithstanding the orders given for the regulation of public labour, the super intendants had tasked the people as they thought proper. By this, the work of government Avas almost neglected, and the convicts time applied to the use of individuals. To remedy this evil, the Governor informed the superintendants and overseers, that if they should be found applying to any other use the time to be employed for the public, they Avould be instantly dismissed. A court of criminal judicature Avas assembled early in August, for the trial of several offenders on different charges. Four were tried fora burglary in the house of William Miller, but acquitted. David Lloyd Avas tried for the wilful murder of John Smith, the seaman belonging to the Indispensable. It appeared, that the seamen had in a state of in toxication gone to the house, to take from a female convict (then living as a servant at"], [241, "167 NEAT SOUTH WALES. Mr. Payne's, Avho he had cohabited Avith dur ing the passage) some clothes he had given her. A riot in consequence ensued, and the prisoner endeavoured to make it appear, that he in his defence fired the pistol. The court found him guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced him to receive 600 lashes. John Fenlow Avas tried for the murder of his servant, David Lane. The charge Avas fully made out, and the prisoner re ceived sentence of death. Four Avho had often broke out of prison, and run from the jail gang, Avere tried as incorrigible rogues, and being found guilty, Avere sentenced to three years hard labour at Norfolk Island ; and one man tried for a rape Avas acquitted. FenloAv, being tried on the Saturday, Avas executed on Monday, and his body delivered to the sur geons for dissection. A stone was found in his gall bladder of the size of a lark's egg. The night before his execution he confessed that the murder Avhich he committed Avas premeditated. The day before he Avas tried, he had prepared an opening through the brick Avail of his cell, purposing, had it not been discovered, to have escaped after his trial. On the Sth, the Susan sailed for Canton, in which tAvo women and a feAV men Avere alloAved to quit the colony. A civil court Avas held the next day, when some avIio had been arrested by Avrits issued from the last court Avere brought up, several of Avhom being settlers, assigned their coming crops for the different sums.

Several individuals had taken ad vantage of this convenience, by inclosing from 10 to 100 acres of the uncleared parts, into which they turned their swine, of them many had from 20 to 150, that required nothing more than a small quantity of maize to accus tom them to their oAvners.

The goats too are extremely prolific, and ge nerally breed thrice in the year, having com monly from tAro to four kids at a time. The want of artificers of all descriptions, and the scarcity of labourers at public Avork, much retarded the construction of a number of build ings.

No risk need be run by ships keeping in Sydney Bay, as the landing is good at Cascade Bay, Avhen it be comes in the least degree hazardous at the for mer place.

She soon became a great favourite in Sydney, Avhich made the natives about that settlement very jealous of her, and at length they found means"], [261, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 187 to get the poor girl into the Avoods near the Governor's house, when they murdered her, by cutting off her arms, and making many spear wounds in her body ; they then left her, and AvithdreAv into the Avoods. In January a stack of wheat containing about 800 bushels of corn, Avas destroyed by fire ; and as a consider able quantity of Avheat the property of Govern ment Avas in the neighbourhood of it, the jail gang Avere ordered out, and promised if they stopped the progess of the flames, that the irons in Avhich they always worked should be knocked off.

The Governor ordered him to Norfolk Island for life. His Excellency made an excursion to Botany Bay, for the pur pose of exploring George's river, and the soil near its banks. The river it Avas found reached 25 miles from Botany Bay. This month a windmill and a granary were finished.

The continual repetitions of the most cruel outrages, committed by the natives on the settlers in the Northern farms, in one of which they lately murdered a man and Avoman, com pelled the settlers to arm and follow them, keeping up the pursuit all night; the next morning they came near about 100 of them, when the natives fled, leaving their plunder on the ground. The pursuers continued to follow them to the neighbourhood cf Paramatta; when fatigued, the settlers Avent into the toAvn, and Avere in return followed by the natives, with Pe-mul-Avy at their head. This felloAV, with all the brutal impudence of ignorance, threatened to kill the first man that approached him, and actually threw a spear ata soldier; inconse quence of which a discharge from the military and settlers took place, by Avhich 5 natives were killed, and many Avounded; among the )atter Avas Pe-mul-wy, avIio Avas then brought"], [264, "HISTORY OF 190 to the hospital, from whence, when cured, he made his escape, with an iron about his leg. The log prison and granary at Sydney were completed during* March. The settlers at the HaAvkesbury sent round a quantity of grain to repay the store for that lent them, as seed to crop their grounds the last season; and at the same time sent information that the natives had plundered a settler's house, and then burnt it, as well as a rick of Avheat. The public granaries being filled, they closed on the 21st of April, and Avere declared shut against the receipt of grain, till the folloAving August. The Governor wishing to ascertain the quantity and quality of a tract of land betAveen the Duck and George's River, set out Avith a party, sending a boat on first Avith provisions to the Banks of the George's River, from Para matta; the ground Avas found excellent, and \u2022well stored Avith ponds of fresh Avater.

Durina; April a tree Avas discovered, the bark of Which, when soaked in water and well beat, could be spun and used instead of hemp, and was superior to the flax from Norfolk Island, which was particularly fortunate, as the colony was in great Avant of cordage. A criminal court assembled this month, sen tenced three (Avho had served the terms for which they were transported), to be noAv again"], [265, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 191 transported to Norfolk Island ; one for receiv ing stolen goods for 14 years, and the other two, who Avere of that class, Avho to avoid work, sought refuge in the Avoods, and robbed the settlements at night for support, the court sentenced to 7 years transportation. The public Avorks continued the same as at the end of the last month. The foundation of the building for the reception of the assistant surgeons Avas laid, and the loAver floor of the large granary at Sydney was nearly completed. Much rain fell during this month. On the morning of the 27th of April, a high wind came on, Avhich, for the Avant of care at the Avind mill, it Avas set going Avith such violence, that one of the running stones Avas broke, a piece of which so Avounded the millAvright, that his life Avas despaired of. Some carpenters Avere ordered to repair the damage, and in a feAV days it Avas at Avork as usual. The example lately made had no good effect on the natives, they still troubled the settlers in Land Cove, burning a house, and killing a num ber of hogs, which, as they left behind them, proved the attack to be Avanton. At Kissing Point, they wounded a settler and his wife, and burned every article they had. The settlers Avere so perpetually alarmed by the natives that they again collected, and with a feAV soldiers sent to assist them, Avent out in the night, and their fires directed them to the place Avhere a large body of natives had collected to attack and plunder them. A volley of musketry 4"], [266, "192 HISTORY OF Avas then fired over their heads, which so alarmed them, that they instantly fled, leaving their spears, 8c c. and about 20 bushels of Indian corn which they had stolen. Though many of the natives bad been kindly treated, yet they Avere seldom found to possess any degree of gratitude. Bennillong him self, Avas as destitute in this respect as most of his countrymen ; even their children, bred up in the settlements, and Avho, from being ac customed to folloAv the settlers' manner of living, might have been supposed to ha\\*e no taste for the life of their parents, Avhen groAvn up, quitted their hospitable abodes, and took to the same savage mode of living, Avhere the supply of food Avas often uncertain, and their lives in danger. The wife of a man named Ye-ra-ni-be, both of Avhom had been brought up in the set-; tlement, Avas murdered in the brick-fields by her husband, and Cole-be, Avho first beat her about the head, and then drove a spear through her heart. If spoken to for robbing the maize-grounds, or corn-fields, to be revenged, they assembled in large bodies, burned the houses of the settlers, and frequently took their liA-es, though seldom refused corn when they Avould ask for it; that they Avere stimulated to this conduct by some run-a-Avays, avIio avlic among them at the time there Avas no doubt. In order to get these pests, a proclamation Av-as issued, calling on them by name to surrender Avithin 14 days, declaring them outlaws if they failed, and"], [267, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 193 required the inhabitants to assist in bringing them to justice. And the Governor made known, that if any natiATs were again detected in rob bing the settlers, he Avould hang one of them in chains near the spot as a terror to the others. , On the 16th of May, the Supply arrived from the Cape of Good Hope, Avith 31 cows, 5 mares, and 27 sheep, all in perfect health : 8 coavs, 2 bulls, and 13 sheep died in the course of the Voyage. In the night of the 16th, a boat which had been fishing at some distance to the South- Avard of Botany Bay, brought to the settlement three persons Avho belonged to a ship called the Sydney Cove, which had sailed from Bengal with a cargo for this country on speculation. The Governor Avas informed by Mr. Clarke, (one of the three) that the ship had sprung a dangerous leak before she had rounded the South Cape, which, as soon as they had got to the Eastward of the Southern part of the coast, increased to so great a degree, as to render it absolutely necessary to haul in for the land. The wind being from the S. E. they Avere ena bled to accomplish this, in time to land the ship, when she was dropping from under them, having sunk clown to the fore channels, Avhen they were enabled to run her a-ground, on an island in lat. 40\u00b0 37' South. They met Avith this misfortune in the middle of February ; soon after which a small number of them resolved to attempt reaching Port Jackson in c c"], [268, "194 HISTORY OF the ship's dong boat, leaving the commander and about 30 people to stay near the Avreck. The boat being got ready, 17 people embarked in her, and sailed ; but meeting Avith very bad Aveather they Avere again Avrecked on the coast near Point Hicks, and endeavoured to travel. NortliAvard, but dropped off one by one and lost each other daily, till the number Avas reduced to five, the three Avho had arrived (the supercargo, a sailor, and a Lascar), the first mate of the ship, and the carpenter. These two, from excessive fatigue, had been unable to proceed, and had stopped the day before then companions had been taken up by the fishing boat. To seek these unfortunates a 'boat Avas dis patched, provided Avith such comforts as Avere necessary. The man avIio met Avith the super- cargo Avas sent in the Avhale boat, and they proceeded to the spot which Mr. Clarke had described as the place Avhere they lost sight of their companions ; but, after a long search, they only found some trifling articles, and these being bloody, it Avas naturally imagined they had been killed by the natives, whom, in the course of their long march, they had found frequently very kind, and at other times on the contrary very savage. Mr. Clarke, and the tAvo other people, were very much exhausted, but every care being paid to their situation, they quickly recovered. The Britannia anchored betAveen the heads from Ireland, on the 27th, Avith 150 male and"], [269, "195 NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 50 female convicts from that kingdom, and an officer and 25 recruits for the NeAv South Wales corps. The same day the Francis, and a long-boat named the Eliza, sailed to bring aAvay the re mainder of the ship's company belonging to the unfortunate Sydney Cove. The settlement was now much distressed for canvas, the best boat being in the HaAvkesbury, it became requisite to dismantle another, and thus furnish sails to bring her round. On the 2d of June, the ship Ganges arrived from Ireland, Avith convicts from that kingdom, and a detachment of recruits for the NeAv South Wales corps. The Governor now visited Paramatta, to examine that part of the country he meant to cultivate on the public account; and to observe how the convicts, lately arrived, Avere provided for. The cattle from the Supply had been sent thither, and Avere Avith the stock at Toongabbe, all thriving well. The ground proposed to be cleared on the public account, Avas two miles and a half from Paramatta, very Avell situated, having excellent ponds in its vicinity. The deputy surveyor at tended the governor, spots Avere marked out for erecting- the public buildings ; and named Portland-Place. In consequence of the proclamation issued last month, a run-a-Avay convict delivered him self up, an another was taken; they seemed half starved ; but their sufferings were not suf-"], [270, "196 HISTORY OF ficient to prevent a repetition of the offence in themselves, or similar ones in others; so strong Avas the aversion these vile characters had to Avork. On the 26st of June, the Reliance arrived from the Cape of Good Hope, with 26 coavs, 3 bulls, and about 60 sheep on board, for the colony. Tavo boys belonging to the Reliance, on the same night she arrived, carried away a small tAVO-oared boat, in Avhich they intended to pro ceed and join the natives. To effect which) they took a boat-cloak to sleep in, a pair of pistols, a small quantity of gun-poAvder, and 50 cakes of portable soup ; but being pursued, they Avere brought back again. The inhabitants of Sydney Avere assessed to supply thatch for the neAV goal, and the building was enclosed Avith a strong high fence. It Avas 80 feet long, the sides and ends Avere of strong logs, a double row of which formed each partition. The prison Avas divided into 22 cells. The floor and the roof were logs, over Avhich Avas a coat eight inches deep of clay. On the 5th of July the Francis arrived from the wreck of the Sydney Cove, Avith all the creAV ex cept six, Avho Avere left to protect that part which was saved of the cargo. A violent storm arose on the 17th, Avhich rooted up many large trees, and blew doAvn seAeral chimnies. The vanes of aAvindmill were torn by the Avind, and even the ships in the cove, brought their anchors home. On the 7th of August, the Francis sailed for Norfolk Island with provisions, but the wind a"], [271, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 197 left her before she cleared the harbour, Avhen some of those on board got intoxicated, and desired to bring a boat on shore, which Avas of course refused ; in consequence of this, one of the crew fired a pistol and Avounded a sea man, and for this he Avas brought on shore, though not in a Avay agreeable to his desires. A whale-boat Avas sent Avith Mr. Bass, to dis cover a stratum of coal found by Mr. Clarke, two days before he Avas taken up by the fishing boat. Mr. Bass met Avith it seven leagues Southward, and found it extended for nine miles to the breadth of eight feet. On the 27th, a young native, said to have committed murder, underwent the encounter of that revenge usu ally exhibited on those occasions. In the com bat two spears Avent through his hand, Avhen his friends rushed on his adversaries, defeated them, and broke their spears. Bennillong Avas noAv accused of the murder of a native Avoman, be cause she told her friends, Avhen at the point of death, that she dreamed Bennillong had killed her; but he protested he Avas a perfect stranger to the Avoman, having never seen her. A piratical misfortune occurred in the begin ning of September; a boat, named the Cum berland, on her passage with stores to the Hawkesbury, Avas boarded by some persons in a small boat, and joined by some of the crew. Four not wishing to escape in this Avay, were put on shore near Broken Bay. The boat then put off to sea, and those landed hastened to Port Jackson with the information ; and though"], [272, "198 HISTORY OF tAvo boats Avent in pursuit of them, it Avas Avith out effect. On the 20th of September arrived the Deptford brig from Madras, on speculation, principally laden with spirits ; for as they at all times found a ready sale at Sydney, no ship came there on a trading voyage with out a large portion of them in their cargo, and though every means that could be devised Avas made use of, to prevent the Avhole of them being brought on shore, Avays Avere contrived to land them Avithout leaA*e ; so great Avas the determi nation to procure those baneful commodities. ToAvards the close of this month another ex cursion Avas made to vieAv the Avild cattle, Avhen tAvo herds were seen, one consisting of 67 and and another of 170. On the 2d of October, another boat was seized by a party, in Avhich Avere included the three men Avho objected to going aAvay in the Cum berland last month ; and though boats Avere sent out after them directly, they returned with the same Avant of success. The Reliance though cleared of her stores, and now quite. light, Avas found to admit as much water as before ; and it appeared on opening the ceiling, that the leak Avas in the guard-board streak, abreast of the main-mast, the Avater rushing in there with great force. A survey had been held on the Supply, after Avhich she was pronounced unfit for further service. The bricklayers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and other labourers, Avere all now fully em-"], [273, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 199 ployed. A large and convenient shop, capable of working several forges, Avas erecting at Sydney. The Governor to prevent any more escapes by means of boats, ordered all that might in future be found not properly secured, or left with rudders, sails, masts, or oars, to be burnt. On the 20th of October, tAvo men Avere tried for the murder of a native long accustomed to the settlement, but Avere acquitted, as it seemed committed by accident. One for forgery was convicted, and sentenced to be transported for seven years to Norfolk Island. Three of the Avit nesses on these trials Avere afterwards convicted of perjury, and sentenced to stand in the pillory, Avith their ears nailed to the rostrum; at the execution of which the mob greeted them Avith the true English accompaniments of dirt and rotten eggs. The 20th of this month a contest took place between the natives; one of which, desirous of reArenging the death of a friend, who had been killed, by some native of a tribe from Avhich a young man had just come amongst them. Dis covering their intention, he stood up, and, being attacked by numbers, defended himself with great bcavery, till being speared in several places, at length fell. As he lay on the ground, several treacherously rushed on him, and stab bed him repeatedly with a Doo-ul. Thus situated, he tried to coA*er himself with his shield, on which, rising from the ground, he"], [274, "200 HISTORY OF was again attacked, and received their spears with the greatest dexterity, till some treache rous native took a station on one side, and fixed a spear in his back, Avhich remained there. On this, they proceeded a second time to rush on him, Avhen he had just strength enough left to make his escape into a house, Avhere he Avas kindly received, but immediately fainted. The spear being drawn, and his Avounds dressed, by a surgeon, in a feAV days he Avas able to Avalk. His brother, Avho had accom panied him to the battle, stood up in his defence, and Avas Avounded both in the leg and thigh. The principal sufferer in this affair Avas one named William and Ann, which he had adopted from a ship of that name which arrived in the year 1791. Some of the Avomen on this occasion hoAvled and cried alternately Avhen they Avere enraged, Avhich often happened, they danced and beat their sides with their arms; a proof of their passions being affected. On the 31st, an open boat, from the HaAvkcs bury, Avhich arrived Avith Indian corn, had been boarded in her passage by a party of natives in canoes. They Avere suffered to come in the boat, Avhen watching an opportunity, they made an attempt to seize the arms. This caused a struggle, in Avhich the boat's crew prevailed, but not before some of these black pirates had lost their lives."], [275, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 201 It was discovered that a boat belonging to a settler, Avhich had been stolen some time, and was supposed to have been driven out to sea and lost, had been taken by the natives, after murdering the men who were in her. The boat, on a search being made, Avas found in the pos session of the natiA*es. This Avas a novel circumstance, but it Avas too true ; the white people living amongst them had been the instigators of this mischief. A bridge, capable of bearing any weight, Avas erected over Duck river, for the convenience of land carriage between the toAvns of Sydney and Paramatta. During November, a scarcity of Avheat once more visited the public stores, and the Gover nor ordered a reduction of that article till the crops Avere gathered. The success which attended the seizure of the Cumberland, and the other escapes of two parties of convicts, tempted 14 others to form a plan for taking away a boat, and making the same effort. Having secreted all the stores they meant to carry away, the night for their departure was settled ; and they Avere on the point of embarking, when they Avere surrounded by a party of magistrates and constables, avIio took them and their stores into custody ; for they had not proceeded Avith the caution neces sary for such an enterprize, and information was given just in time to defeat their project; r> jp"], [276, "202 HISTORY OF and the next day they were punished, by being sent up to Paramatta to hard labour. On the subject of these mad schemes, the Governor addressed the convicts, and after- Avards published an order, pointing out the risk Avhich must attend such enterprizes ; and said, he Avas of opinion, that a feAV ignorant people had been\u00abled to try them by the wicked designs of some viler than themselves. The Irish convicts Avho arrived in the last ship sheAving a propensity to desert from work, a party of soldiers Avere sent to Toongabbe, there to remain during the harvest. Nine hundred bushels of the last year's crop, where brought round in the Francis from the HaAvkesbury, and placed in the public store. Than the appearance of the Avheat of this season nothing could promise better ; it had ripened suddenly, OAving to some heavy rains being followed by hot Avcather. The military Avere hired to assist in reaping, it being necessary to lose no time in collecting the crops. James Wilson, avIio had for a long time taken up his abode in the Avoods, surrendered himself this month to the Governor's clemency. He had been Avith the savages over different parts of the country, and had submitted to have his shoulders and breast scarified after their custom. He appeared Avith no covering but au apron of a kangaroo's skin. The Governor knowing, from his former habits, that if punished and sent to hard labour, 1"], [277, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 203 he Avould rejoin his savage companions, thought to make him useful in the mode of living Avhich he seemed to prefer ; therefore pardoned him, and proposed his attempting, to take the con victs Avho were at large in the Avoods ; just be fore Wilson's return tAvo of whom had stolen two mares. Wilson said, that he had been 100\u00ab miles in every direction round the settlement, and had seen several animals, which had not been seen in any of the districts; and to the North West of the head of the Hawkesbury, he came upon a very extensive tract of open and Avell-Avatered country, where he had seen a bird of the phea sant species, and a quadruped, which he said Avas larger than a dog. A convict avIio had formerly been a school felloAV of the Rev. Mr. Johnson's, had been taken into his service, and he reposed in him the greatest confidence, treating him with every indulgence. He had not been in the service of Mr. Johnson long, Avhen that Gen tleman Avas informed that his servant had taken an impression of his store-room key, and pro cured another from it that would fit the lock. Hardly crediting the information, he Avas urged to furnish an opportunity; for which purpose a constable Avas concealed in the house one Sunday, Avhile all the family but this servant Avere attending divine service. This plan suc ceeded ; imagining all Avas safe, by means of his key, he entered the room, and was proceed-"], [278, "204 HISTORY OF in <>\u2022 to plunder it, when the constable seized him taking the property. This month the Deptford brig sailed to the coast of Coromandel. On the 10th of December tAvo of the natives, both of them Avell knoAvn in the settlement, (Cole-be, the friend of Bennillong, and one of another tribe) meeting at Sydney, attacked each other. Cole-be Avas remarkable for his activity, but his opponent Avas much younger, and a perfect match for him. Closing on each other, Avith their clubs, Cole-be, Avho had not before gained any advantage, and the handle of the other's shield drawing out, and falling from his grasp, he stooped to pick it up, Avhen Cole be struck him on the head, and staggered him, and folloAved his bloAv while in that situation. Cole-be as conscious this Avould acquire him the name of jee-run, or coAvard, as that the friends of the other Avould revenge his cause, the consequences might be serious if he died, he thought proper to abscond, and the poor felloAV was taken care of, but on the 16th he died. During this time he Avas attended by some of his male and female friends, particularly two, Collins and Mo-roo-bra. One of the nights when a dismal song of lamentation had been sung over him, principally by women, his male friends, after listening Avith great attention, started up, and siezing their Aveapons, Avent off determined on revenge, knowing Avhere to meet Avith Cole- be, they beat him and reserved the"], [279, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 205 gratification of killing him for their final re venge, until the fate of their companion should he ascertained. The next night, Collins and Mo-roo-bra attacked a relation of Cole-be's, Boo-ra-Avan-ye, Avhom they beat about the head with great cruelty. The murdered native Avas burried the day after he died by the road side beloAV the mili tary barracks. He was placed by his friends upon a large piece of bark, and laid into a grave. Bennillong assisted, placing the head of the corpse, near which he stuck a beautiful war-ra-taAV, and covered the body Avith the blanket on Avhich he died. The earth Avas thrown in Avith some spades, during Avhich, and the Avhole of the ceremony, the Avomen hoAvled and cried ; this Avas the effect of violent passions into Avhich the men threw themselves. Many spears Avere throAvn, and some blows Avere dealt Avith clubs ; but nothing serious happened. Cole-be's death all seemed determined on, hav ing in so coAvardly a manner killed one so much beloA-ed. To effect which a number of natives met in a feAV clays near the barracks, at Avhich time a young man, a relation of Cole-be's, receiA*ed many wounds, and a lad also related to him, (and who formerly lived Avith Mi.

The violence sheAvn by the friends of the deceased Avas indescribable ; and Cole-be would certainly have lost his life, but for seAeral of the military. Although active in the use of the shield, he was overpoAvered, and falling beneath their spears, Avould haA*e been killed on the spot, but several soldiers rushed in, and prevented them ; he, from the many severe wounds he received, being incapable of making any resistance. The soldiers lifted him from the ground, and bore him into the barracks. Bennillong, the friend of Cole-be, Avas present at this meeting; but, Avithout intending to take any part in it either Avay. The atrocity of his friend's conduct had been such that he could not openly espouse his quarrel; perhaps indeed, he had no AA'ish to fight ; and if he could avoid it, he Avould not, by appearing against him, add to the number of his enemies. He Avas armed, however, and Avithout clothing of any kind, remaining a silent spectator till the moment when the soldiers rushed in to save the life of Cole-be. On a sudden he Avas in a rage, and threw a spear among the soldiers, which took effect on one of them, entering at his back and coming out at the belly, close to the naval. For this he would instantly have been killed"], [281, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 207 had not the provost-marshal interfered and brought him aAvay ; for he had received a blow on the head with the butt-end of a musket. It Avas thought necessary to confine him all night, to prevent the mischief Avith Avhich he threatened the Avhite people, and to save him from the anger of the military, and on the fol loAving morning he quitted thetOAvn. Prior to the death of the poor felloAV mur dered by Cole-be, the natives at Sydney Avere called to the celebration of that ceremony, Yoo-lahno- Era-ba-diano;*. Bennillong Avas there, but returned Avithout his Avife, being persuaded by her mother, Avho she met at the Yoo-lahng, to leave her husband.

On Christmas-day information Avas giA-en, that two seamen of the Reliance had discovered the body of a soldier (who had been for two days missing,) lying in a mangled state, with his head and hands cut off. A settler Avas fined 40s. and ordered to labour for six Aveeks, for disobeying the public orders.

On the East side of Sydney, a fire broke out; among the convict's houses, Avhen three of them Avere destroyed ; and another house, at some distance, Avas burnt by some Avretches Avho the owner had displeased. In December, the public labour Avas co vering the neAV store-house, finishing a toAver for a clock which had arrived in the Reliance, building another windmill, and completing the barracks of the assistant-surgeons. At Paramatta and Toongabbe the Avheat Avas all nearly housed. At the latter place a barn had been built, 90 feet long, with a floor on Avhich 16 or 18 threshers could work. In January, 1798, the prisoners Avho arrived in the last ships from Ireland had become so troublesome, and sodissatisfied, that, without the most rigid treatment it Avas not possible to make them do any work. Added to the natural vici ousness of their propensities, they formed a stu pid opinion that there existed a colony of white people in the country S.

The Governor receivin o- information of these intentions, desired a magistrate to go to Toon gabbe, Avhere the principal malcontents were employed, and sheAv them the danger to Avhich such a step Avould expose them, and to acquaint them, that the Governor Avould alloAv any four fb proceed as far as they should find inclined, with what provisions they could carry, and for the preservation of their lives, he avouM order three other people, accustomed to the Avoods, and acquainted Avith the savages, to accompany and lead them in whatever direction they should point out.

A short time demonstrated the effect of the GoA-ernor's address. He received information that numbers of them Avere assembling for the purpose of proceeding in quest of the new set- tlement. His Excellency directed a party of armed constables to secure as many as they Avere able; and sixteen Avere taken and put iuto confinement; they appeared to be quite igno- rant Avhere they Avere going ; but observing both obstinacy and ignorance, the Gover nor, conceived that he could not use any"], [285, "211 NEAV SOUTH AVALES. argument more likely to convince them of their folly than by ordering a severe corporal punishment to be inflicted at Sydney on those who appeared to be the principals in this busi ness, which Avas put in execution ; seven of them received tAvo hundred lashes each ; the remain der, after being punished at Paramatta, were sent to hard labour and Avell looked after. The necessity of checking this spirit of emi gration, determined the Governor to convince them, by their oavii experience, of the dangers at tending it,he therefore ordered four of the strong est among them to be chosen, and prepared for a journey of discovery. They Avere to be accom panied by three men, who Avere to lead them back, Avhen fatigued and exhausted with their journey, over the very Avorst and most dan gerous parts of the country ; but this plan Avas no sooner settled, than the Governor was in formed that a party concerted Avith the four fellows elected, to meet them at a particular place, and there murder the persons intended as their guides, possess themselves of their arms and provisions, and afterwards pursue their own course. This infernal scheme Avas coun teracted by an addition of four soldiers to the guides ; and on the 14th they set off from Pa ramatta, On the 24th the military brought back three of the fellows, Avho, having gained the foot of the first mountains, were so completely sick of their journey, and the prospect before them, that they intreated the soldiers to return, Avho"], [286, "HISTORY OF were ordered to leave them at this place to the direction of the guides; only one man expressed a determination to penetrate further into the country, and was left Avith them for that pur pose. In the transactions of the'2d of October, it Avill be seen a boat had been carried off by some Avho Avere supposed to have taken her out to sea, but they were noAv heard of. Owen Cavanagh, a free man, had a boat which he employed in conveying grain from HaAvkes bury to Sydney. On the 10th of this month, he informed the Governor, that a short time before, his boat had been boarded off Mullett- Island, by the people Avho stole the settlers, and carried her off, and another with 50 bushels of grain, Avhich Avas bringing to Sydney. One who had against his Avish, been a party in the first seizure, noAv left them, and returned with Ca vanagh ; and gave the following account of their proceedings : \" Having made the capture they proceeded to the SouthAvard, Avith the idea of reaching the wreck of the Sydney-cove. For their guide they had a pocket compass, of Avhich hardly one man of the fourteen knew the use. In this boat they were twice throAvn on shore, and at length reached an island, Avhere they fortunately found many birds and seals, or they must have perished.

Their number reduced to seven, they thought themselves in danger near this port ; they had been lurking for some time near Broken Bay, with a view of stealing a better boat loaded Avith grain, which they effected, first by taking the boat of Cavanagh, by means of Avhich he had long been enabled to support his Avife and children ; securing him, they took possession of a smaller boat, with above 50 bushels of Avheat. Finding Cava nagh's the largest and best, they ran out from the land, and shifted their prisoners into the smaller boat and stood off to the Northward. Wilson lately came from the Avoods, and among other information mentioned finding above 50 skeletons, which the natives said, Avere those of Avhite men, avIio had lost their Avay ; which Avas corroborated by old shoes, &c lying about. On the 20th, the Francis returned. Previous to his departure for the Avreck, Capt. Hamilton informed the GoA-ernor that she had on board 7000 gallons of spirits, and wished to bring back part with him by the Francis. The Go vernor averse to the introduction of spirits, would have opposed the application; but"], [288, "214 HISTORY OF it being known in the colony, that a quan tity of this article had been saved, and that the island abounded with kangaroos and birds, he thought these circumstances Avould not only have led to desertions and captures of boats which had been effected, but likely to prove temptations to similar practices ; he therefore agreed to purchase 3500 gallons of the rum of Capt. Hamilton, on account of Govern ment. Capt. Hamilton said, that of the other articles taken on shore from the Avreck, a small quantity of coarse cloth only had been preserved, as the remainder Avas destroyed hy Avind and bad weather.

During his Excellency's stay, an Irish convict, Avho had escaped for some time, Avas brought in. After Avandering about several days in search of a road Avhich Avas to have conducted him to China, or the neA*/ ideal colony of Avhite people, his strength failed as provisions greAV short, and as he despaired of meeting Avith relief, he had sense enough to re verse the Avritten instructions calculated only to carry him out, directing him to keep the sun on a particular part of his body, varying ac cording to the time of the clay. Thus he tra velled EastAvard, which led him nearly to the head of George's river, where a feAV people were settled ; and having one morning heard a gun at a distance, he tried to Avalk to it, but Avas unable, Avhen night came on him, being faint, he took a little flour from his pocket, and sprinkling it on some \\A*ater, drank it, and then laid doAvn to rest. In the morn ing he Avas a little refreshed, and again endea voured to get in the direction Avhence he heard the report of a gun, and soon heard a man's voice, on Avhich he hallooed and to his great joy Avas answered. This man, avIio Avas a settler, took him to his house, recruited his spirits, and brought him into the town.

The public Avorks carrying on this month, Avere laying a neAv floor in the granary at Para matta; repairing every brick building belong ing to government, Avhich Avere all very much decayed. At Sydney, on the 31st, the building for that purpose being finished, the clock Avas put up, and thus made known the hour to the inha bitants. This appendage of public utility, astonished the natives, avIio could by no means account for the noise it made on striking, at which times they started in the most anxious fear, till they became accustomed to the sound. The Francis again sailed to the wreck of the Sydney-Cove, on the first of February. Some of the natives avIio dwelt in the neigh bourhood of the cow pasture plains, told the Governor that several of the Avild cattle had been killed, imagining this to have been clone by the Irish run-a-way convicts, a party of military, w i th Hacking, was sent out Avith orders if possible to secure them. After an absence of some days, they returned, having searched the country round, but no traces of the cattle where they had been accustomed to range could be seen, or did they meet any white people. The natives persisted in having seen some of the convicts among them, and said that some calves had been run doAvn by them. This idea was strengthened by finding F F"], [292, "218 HISTORY OF some short pointed spears, supposed to be made for the killing calves caught. On the 9th of February, the three men avIio had been sent out Avith the Irishmen, so desirous of discovering a way to China, returned so ex hausted, that tAvo of them Avare scarce able to move. Wilson, who Avas the third, having been in the habit of travelling in the Avoods, kept them in spirits, and enabled them to reach Prospect-Hill about sun-set. Having been in Avant of food for several days, except a feAV small birds, the refreshment which they procured had nearly OA*ercome them. The Governor sent a free ser\\*ant of his Avith Wilson, who gave an ac count of the journey ; in the folloAving very in teresting particulars : \" From Mount Hunter, (Avhich Avas the highest land then known in that part of the country, and distant from Paramatta from 30 to 34 miles S. W. they departed January 24, travel ling S. S. W. for 18 miles, 12 of Avhich Avas a fine open country. There they fell in Avith the river Nepean, Avinding behind the cow-pasture plains. The banks of the river being exceed ing steep and rocky, they had difficulty in crossing. The other side of the river had a barren appearance ; during that day they saAv a feAV kangaroos of a particular kind, having long, black, and brushy tails ; Avith a few birds, which, from the length of the tail feathers they called pheasants. \" On the 25th they continued in their course S. S. W. about six miles. They saw"], [293, "219 NEW SOUTH AVALES. many kangaroos and several emus ; met Avith some natiA'es, one of Avhom engaged to go with them, if they woujd halt that night. This agreed to, they had leisure to examine a bill, the face of which appeared white, and proved to be a large cliff of salt, a sample of Avhich they brought away. The next day they inclined to the Westward, and went 16 miles W. S. W. over a rocky country, covered with brushwood. They on the following day, travelled in the same direction, nearly the same distance, in which they got to an open mountainous coun try, Avhere crossing a small river, they disco vered both coal and lime-stone, and every step the scene improved. The 28th, they still Avent W. S. W. and added lo their distance 20 miles. In one part they ascended a hill, from which they obtained a view of the country for a great distance. To the Northward it seemed to be open, and thinly clad with timber: to the North- WestAvard they saw some very high mountains, and apparent ly good land : to the Westward they saAV a deep break, which they thought formed by a river. This day they met \\\\ ith a party of natives, Avho were terrified, and ran aAvay from them. One of the party folloAved and came upAvith a Avoman and child, whom he detained to tempt the men to return, but though she remained with them all night, the men did not appear. They gave her a small hatchet in the morning, and sent her back. Wilson, though he understood a little of the language of the"], [294, "220 HISTORY OF mountain natives, could not comprehend any thins; the woman said, nor could she understand one single Avord spoken by him. \" These natives Avere clothed Avith skins of animals, reaching from their shoulders to their heels, which had a very pleasing effect. \" The 29th, they travelled 24 miles in the same direction. The first four miles the coun try Avas not good, being rocky and covered with Ioav shrubs, and intersected Avith creeks, appearing to run tOAvards some river. At the head of these creeks they saAv several Avater falls, one fell 40 feet, and tAvo others 20 feet each. They noAv proceeded Northward 12 miles, in tending to get round the heads of the creeks ; but fell in with more. They then determined to keep W. S. W. but found the country rocky and barren. They then saAv a tree Avhich they had not before noticed, about the size of an apple tree, the leaves of Avhich Avere of a light blue, and the bark resembled that valuable pro duction of nature, the mahogany tree. \" The party Avere noAv nearly exhausted, hav ing had nothing to eat for two days^ except a rat. Wilson Avas willing- to go forward ; but his companions Avere hoav become very umvell, and wished themselves safe home again. \" The 30th, they continued 16 miles in the same direction of W. S. W. In the course of the clay they fell in Avith the head of a river nearly as large as the HaAvkesbury, appearing to run from S. E. to N.W. Its banks Avere so rocky and steep, that they Avould have found"], [295, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 221 infinite difficulty in descending them ; to Avhich they Avere strongly invited by the appearance of a level open country on the other side ; and Wilson proposed making a canoe to cross over with ; but the others Avere so faint and tired, having had nothing to eat but the rat and two small birds each, that they were afraid to ven ture. Their shoes Avere now Avorn out, and their feet cut and bruised by walking, so at length they proposed to return. \" This being agreed to, on the 1st of Febru ary, they came back S. E. by E. and having Avalked nine miles, they fell in with many meadoAVS thinly stocked with trees. The hills were slightly covered with timber, and they were light. The ground was good except on the tops of the hills where it was stoney. Here they became much exhausted, and though they saAv many birds, they could not approach near enough to shoot any. \" On the 2d, they came E. N. E. over a sine country, formed of meadoAvs, extending some thousands of acres, Avith very few trees. To wards the evening, having passed the first ridge of mountains, they fell in with a number of kangaroos, one of which they killed, and were much refreshed by it. \" On the 3i.\\, the report of tAvo guns in the S. E. was heard by them, which they answered, but were not returned. Though they had noAv* reached that part of the country Wilson Avell knew, they must have perished, but for his great exertions. Wilson assured them of their"], [296, "222 HISTORY OF beino* near Prospect-Hill ; Avhich, after much difficulty, they at length reached, at the time they despaired of ever vieAving it.-' A muster took place on the 14th of February, in every district of the colony, at which al! the labourers, either free men or convicts, Avere obliged to appear. The next morning the set tlers were called over, prior to Avhich the Go vernor informed them, that he had heard much discontent prevailed among them in conse quence of some grievances Avhich they com plained of. For these, till he Avas acquainted with the nature of them, he Avas unable to ap ply any relief, so he desired they might be made in writing ; and to save trouble, he Avould direct two gentlemen to collect from the settlers such of their distresses and grievances as they wished to make knoAvn ; and assured them, he had, from his oavh ideas, forwarded a plan to the Secretary of State, which lie hoped Avould be attended to, and benefit them. The Avomeuand children Avere then mustered, and proA-ed to form a very considerable part of the settlement. As the maize ripened the natives resumed their depredations ; and on the 19th, the Go vernor received information from Paramatta, that a man had been murdered near Toongabbe, and three others Avounded ; and in a few days, two others were killed in the same Avay, by the same natives. From these circumstances it became requisite to send out seA-eral Avell armed parties, and attack them Avhere they could meet them,"], [297, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 223 Mr. Bass, the surgeon of the Reliance, noAv returned from an excursion of 12 weeks in a boat to the Southward. This gentleman, dis liking an idle life, and having a good consti tution, and being possessed of great sensibility, ingenuity, and observation, requested the Go vernor to lend him a boat, and allow him to man her with A-olunteers from the King's ships; proposing to go along the coast to make obser vations. The Governor consenting, he set out in her; he persevered as far to the Southward as the latitude 40\u00b0 00', visiting every opening in the coast; but only in one place, to the Southward and Westward of Point Hicks, find- ing a harbour capable of admitting ships. There was an'appearance of a strait, or rather an open. sea, between the latitudes of 39\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 South, and that Van Diemen's land consisted (as con jectured) of a group of islands off the Southern < oast of the country. Mr. Bass, on his return, picked up, on an island near the coast, the seA*en men who were part of those Avho ran off with a settler's boat, and had been left in this place by their com panions. Being incapable of taking them in his boat, he put them on the main land, fur nished them a\\ ith part of his provisions, and a gun for their protection. Two avIio Were ill he took into his boat, and left the other five to march to the Northward, at the distance of upwards of 400 miles from Port Jackson. They Avere nearly naked, almost starved, and must have perished on the island, had not Mr. Bass 1"], [298, "224 HISTORY OF discovered a smoke that they had made to dfaA7 his attention ; which he, being neaT, took for a smoke made by some natives. On the 26th of this month there Avas an unusually heavy fall of rain during the night. A curious notion Avas found to prevail among the natiA'es respecting Pc-mul-Avy, Avhich must prove fatal to him. Both he and the other natives entertained an opinion, that, from his having been frequently Avounded, he could not be killed hy our fire-arms. This fancied secu rity tempted the rascal to be at the head of every party that attacked the maize-grounds. On the 5th of March, a court Avas held at Paramatta. Writs were issued, and prosecu tions for debt commenced, and on the 7th ad journed till the 19th, Avhen it continued sitting until the 24th. The business consisted chiefly respecting debts contracted between the retail dealers and the settlers ; and as a proof to Avhat height this business had arrived, it is only to state, that an appeal Avas made to the Governor in one cause for a debt of the very serious sum of 8681. 16s. lOd. Avhich was withdrawn on the defendant consenting to pay the debt. The Governor having received from the set tlers, by means of the#tAvo gentlemen he sent to them (the Rev. Mr. Marsden and Mr. Arndell), a statement of their grievances and distresses, informed them, that he was sorry to see the effects of them at each civil court held.

To begin which. he found it necessary to shut many public houses, Avhich, Avhen permitted, Avere meant as a convenience to the people ; but he saw they Avere the chief cause from Avhich many confessed their ruin to haA-e sprung. The island which Captain Hamilton run his ship on, to preA'ent her sinking with them at sea, Avas noAv distinguished by the name of Preservation Island. From Avhich the Francis had arrived with the remaining part of the pro perty. When she was unloaded, the property Avas put up and sold for the benefit qf the underwriters, and fetched the most enormous prices. The money that the settlers should have expended in the improvement of their farms Avas thus thrown aAvay ; and as the Avheat of the last season had been received into the public granary, and paid for, money not being scarce, twenty-two shillings were paid for a common cup and saucer. The Governor Avishing to obtain further iuformation respecting the salt-hill Wilson and his companions saAv in their late excursion, he sent Hacking there. On his return he brought some samples of various veins of salt in different places, of 10 to 12 feet deep. e Q"], [300, "226 HISTORY OF While out he Avas directed to seek for the Avild cattle, and reported that a feAV miles from the place Avhere they Avere usually found, he met Avith the most numerous herd yet seen ; in Which he counted 170, and afterwards saw some stragglers. It was highly satisfactory to knoAv that they Avere-safe, Those men Avho carried off the boat of Owen Cavenagh, Avere heard of again. The end of this month, a report reached Sydney, that a' piratical creAv infested the harbour of Broken Bay, and the HaAvkesbury. The Governor had a letter from these men, in Avhich they pro fessed to repent of their conduct, and intreated forgiveness. They said, they had been wrecked 400 miles to the Northward, Avhen they at last got on shore, saving as much of Cavenagh's boat as enabled them to make a smaller one, and in this they returned, and surrendered themselves, Avhen they Avere confined for piracy. The wanton destruction of timber had brought forth an order to prohibit the cutting it doAvn, The practice still continuing, the Francis Avas sent round- to the Hawkesbury, tb seize a quantity of timber Avhich had been cut doAvn for private sale. This seizure was of con-r sequence at this time, as a brig was building, from 125 to 150 tons burthen, to replace the Supply, which Avas condemned, and a large boat, the Cumberland, in the room of that taken aAvay by the creAv. The colony Avas now jn such Avant of naval stores, that the ruin of the craft, lately in such good condition, was"], [301, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 227 nearly effected. The bottoms AVere destroyed by Avorms, for Avant of pitch, tar, paint, and oil ; and to render the Francis capable of going to Norfolk Island, with the Reliance, it Avas found necessary to reduce part of the Supply's sails for her use. Provisions and stores were hoav anxiously expected, as 16 months had elapsed since the arrival of the last. April opened Avith five men being capitally convicted at a court of criminal judicature, of seizing two boats, Avith an intent of escaping. One was convicted of a robbery ; three Avere transported to Norfolk Island for 14 years ; one for 7; one Avas adjudged corporal punishment, and one acquitted. Two of the five, condemned for seizing the boats, suffered at Sydney. Their companions were respited at the place of execution. They seemed penitent, and confessed the justice of their sentence, acknoAvledging much mischief they had done, and Iioav much more they medi tated, had they not been taken. One man, for robbery, of the name of Mitton, was executed at Paramatta, certainly a fit sub ject for example. He had been twice pardoned after sentence of death ; once in Ireland, and once here for a similar offence for Avhich he now suffered. Before this man was executed, he confessed that many robberies had been concerted, and were to have been committed by him and others. He mentioned, as the chief instigator, a woman named Robley (the. wife of a blacksmith at"], [302, "228 HISTORY OF Sydney), who received all the property collected in this Avay. Dreading this discovery, she offered to accuse others, or she must have been convicted herself. A native Avoman from the Hawkesbury, reported that she had seen the two mares stolen some time since from Paramatta, and that they Avere in the neighbourhood of that river. She also said, that one of the men Avho stole them had been killed by the natives, and the other had perished Avith hunger. Hacking, Avhen sent to the salt-hill last month, Avas accompanied by Wilson and another man, who Avere directed to pene trate as far into the country as the provi sions they Avere able to carry Avould permit. They returned from an absence of three Aveeks, and said that they had been 140 miles W. by S. from Prospect Hill. In their journey they tra velled over a A'ariety of country, and found more salt hills. They met Avith some narrow rivers or creeks, and some very extensive tracts of open rich ground. They ascended hills of great height, from Avhich their prospect was extensive, and whence they discovered moun tains rising upon mountains to the Westward ; all exceedingly high, and they did not meet a single natiAre in all their journey. The Governor wishing to know the truth of every report that could improve his knowledge of the advantages which this country contained, he sent a party, with a few natives, to learn if there was any salt near Broken Bay. Captain Watcrhouse undertaking the search, found the"], [303, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 229 place described, and some salt; it Avas the pro duce of the spray ; the sea breaking over the rocky parts of the shore in bad Aveather, and draining clown behind, occasioned the quantity of salt among the sand, and on the rocks. The settlers, little undeserving the attention they met with?, Avere constantly laying com plaints before the Governor. A petition Avas presented from them in April, expressive of the distress they were under, both from the high wages they gave for Avorking their ground, and the immense price paid for all articles requisite to carry on business. And requested the price of maize might be the same as last year. His Excellency knowing their distresses, and as he was ever ready to listen to any reasonable applications, ordered the commissary to recei\\'e it at that price. But they Avere informed, that. they must expect a reduction in the price of grain of every kind to take place. Another evil oppressed them, which Avas an unbounded rage for traffic. Even the delivery of grain into the public store houses Avas com pletely monopolized, aud settlers had few opportunities of getting any thing near the value for their crops, being obliged to dispose of it to those Avhose greater influence could get it received into the public store. Orders had. been often issued on this subject, directing the storekeepers to give the preference to those whose grain Avas the produce of their own labour, and to let favour be sheAvn to the pooi settler. These directions had been often frus- 2"], [304, "HISTORY OF 230 trated, from the knoAvledge of which, the Governor Avas completely kept ; on one occasion the store at the HaAvkesbury opened to receive 1,500 bushels of Avheat, and the Avhole was engrossed by tAvo or three rich traders, to the exclusion of the farmers, settlers, and others. But the Governor directed, that half the quan tity thus partially put in, should be taken away, and room made for the accommodation of those so grossly injured. A report noAv prevailed, particularly among the 'Irish, that an old Avoman prophesied the arrival of several French frigates, or larger ships of Avar, Avho, after destroying the settlement, Avould liberate and take aAvay all the convicts.

In a few days after this circumstance, the GoA*ernor visited Toongabbe, and returning to Paramatta, met the prophetess, an old Scotch Avoman, avIio, Avhen she saAv the Governor, held up her hands, and begged he Avould for a feAV minutes listen to her, and she Avould endeavour to confute the reports propagated in her name.

On this the old woman recounted a dream she had the nio-ht be fore, and from which she Avas led to hope that ships Avould soon arrive. Out of this conver sation and dream, a story had been fabricated, purporting that this poor old creature had pro phesied many extraordinary things.

With this she appeared highly gratified ; for she had been much distressed before she had met with this opportunity of in forming him from Avhence this story originated. On the 2d of May, some of the Irishmen Avho had for sometime been searching for a road to China, were brought in by the settlers near George's river. They had Avandered through the Avoods till nearly perished for Avant of food, Avhen they were discovered in an unexpected Avay.

While such A'agabonds Avere about the coun try, the safety of all property Avas in clanger. A bull-calf of an officer Avas stolen from the herd, and though rewards Avere offered no in formation transpired. On the 14th, the Nautilus Brig, arrived from the island of Otaheite, in great distress. This little vessel had lost her passage to the N. W. coast of America, and had been at Kamscatka, the SandAvich Islands, and Otaheite. Being infirm and nearly Avorn out, the master found it impossible to repair his vessel at either of those places, and had touched at Otaheite for the re. freshments they required, and then endea voured to reach this port, where they hoped to receive that assistance Avhich Avould enable them to proceed to India. At Otaheite they found the missionaries sent from England, to propagate the Christian reli gion, were not on such a footing as they expected to be with the natives, being nearly shut up Avithin their little fortress. The natives had used threats, and made knoAvn an intentiou of taking off their women. The arrival of this vessel in some degree relieved them from the"], [307, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 233 anxiety they had for some time been under, and they determined to leave the island in her. Mr. Bishop, her commander, paid them all the attention the shattered state of the brig permit ted, taking on board in all, 19 men, women, and children ; and AvitTi great difficulty brought them safe to Sydney, the vessel being so leaky as to require the labour of all the company to keep her afloat. She was unable to bring them all, leaving six or seven on the island. Those arrived, Avere treated with attention, and all possible relief afforded to their distresses. On the 18th, the Barwell arrived from Eng land, Avith male convicts, stores, and provisions. The weak state of the public gangs, even made the allotment of villany Avhich arrived in this ship, an acquisition to the general strength. The Banvell brought an account (from the Cape of Good Hope,) of the Lady Shore trans port being lost on her passage to New South Wales, Avith 60 convicts, 57 females and 3 males, a large assortment of stores, and a company for the NeAv South Wales corps on board, to Avhom Avas owing the loss of the ship; for after murdering the commander, and his first mate, they carried the ship into Rio de la Plata, Avhere she was delivered up to the Spaniards. Thank God, there is no port in the British dominions ever open to receive the traitors of any country.

Instructions noAv came from his Ma jesty's Ministers to the Governor, on some points he had requested orders, particularly to the number of labouring people Avho had for such a length of time been allowed to the civil and military officers at the public expense. These instructions limitted the number to two; and others they might be inclined to employ Avere to be maintained and clothed by them selves ; or if fed and clothed at the public ex pense, to be paid for at a certain rate, either in the produce of their farms, or otherways. Among the convicts received by the Barwell Avere some useful mechanics ; a truly A'aluable acquisition, as the Governor Avould be enabled to discharge several free people. On the 29th, the Reliance and Francis sailed for Norfolk Island, carrying a proportion of the stores received by the Barwell. On board of the Reliance Avere sent 100 casks of salt pro visions, and 1200 bushels of Avheat. The Governor having receiA'ed several peti tions and complaints from the settlers at Nor folk Island, he caused the following order to be sent thither for their information : \u2014 \" From the nature of the difficulties of which the settlers upon Norfolk Island have com plained, difficulties which have not until very lately been knoAvn to have any existence, the Governor is led to suspect, that the same rage for traffic, and an intemperate indulgence in some of those destructi\\re gratifications Avhich, ha\\*e so effectually ruined, many at' the most"], [309, "235 NEAV SOUTH WALES. forward and promising settlers in NeAv South Wales, have reached Norfolk Island. \" His Excellency, from an earnest desire to promote the prosperity of the island, and the true happiness of its inhabitants, has, since his arrival in this country, availed himself of every opportunity of forwarding for their accommo dation a share of such little comforts, as acci dental ships may have brought hither. But he is sorry to observe, that instead of those at tentions being felt as an advantage, they appear only to operate as an incitement to more exten sive dealings; a circumstance Avhifch he foresees must end in the ruin of many of the settlers, for Avhose Aveifare he is extremely anxious. He therefore urges them not to be led aAvay from their real interest, by speculative ideas, or a desire of indulging in dangerous gratifications, squandering the whole produce of their hard labour in trifles, or in scenes of dissipation Avhich must eventually end in their complete ruin. He desires that they will persevere Avith patience in the management of their farms and the rearing of stock; and assures them, that he has taken such steps as he hopes will incline the Government to consider the inconveniences which are sustained in this distant part of the Avorld, and induce them to adopt such measures as Avill procure the colonists, before long, every European article that they may have occasion for at a very moderate expense ; and by that means put an effectual stop to the impositions under which the industrious settlers have too long laboured.''"], [310, "236 HISTORY OF At the end of May, the settlers at the North ern farms Avere much troubled by the natives, who came doAvn in a body, and burnt seA*eral houses. This Avas indeed unfortunate, as those farms had very great industry bestOAved on them ; and as the land Avas of a superior quality it had not but for these savages been thrown aAvay. On the 14th, there Avas a shoAver of hail stones of a very large size, most of them measur ing six inches in circumference. The Governor Avent to Paramatta on the 6th of June, to search for a proper place, for settling as farmers some of the missionaries from Otaheite, avIio Avished to continue in New South Wales; and some free settlers lately sent out by the Government, who Avith their families arrived from England in the Barwell.

On an examination of the country, he pro nounced it superior to any that had yet been seen, and in quantity equal to what Avas Avanted.

HoAvever, seA*eral determined to settle there, and in con sequence received a portion of tools, grain, and other assistance from the public stores. Messrs. Campbell and Clarke of Calcutta, not discouraged by the fate of their unfortunate ship, the Sydney Cove, sent out another, Avhich, in compliment to the Governor, they called the Hunter, and sent by her an assort ment oflndia goods, and some cows and horses. This vessel arrived on the 10th of the month, Avhen the Governor determined to crush if pos sible, the spirit of monopolv ; to effect Avhich he gave public notice, that the ship had arrived Avith a cargo for sale, and that every inhabitant might have an opportunity of buying what their circumstances Avould afford, he directed that no part of the cargo should be sold before the settlers had made knoAvn to him Avhat sums of money they could conveniently spare ; and a day Avas appointed to receive their accounts. Orders Avere 8,'iven, that no person should board any ship in the harbour till she was pro perly secured in the Cove, and the master had been with the Governor and received port orders. Capt. Hamilton, late of the Sydney CoA*e, survived the arrival of the Hunter only a few days.

Complaints having been made, that the peo ple avIio brought grain from the HaAvkesbury to Sydney Avere practising numerous impositions on the farmers, by false measures ; the Gover nor determined to put a stop to such robbery ; directed the magistrates of Sydney and Para matta to order all measures to be brought to Sydney, to be proved and marked ; and made known that any measure used Avithout such mark Avould subject the oAvner to a prosecution. The Avant of a vessel for a more frequent in tercourse Avith Norfolk Island, having been felt, the commanding officer constructed a small decked boat, sloop rigged, which arrived at Port Jackson on the 15th; but for the want of a harbour at that island, she Avas launched from the shore, and obliged to proceed directly to sea. In consequence of which she proved very leaky; but as tAvo pumps had been fitted on board her, they were able to keep the Avater under. The maize harvest Avas all got in during June : but some buildings Avere retarded by the rains which fell at the latter end of it. The situation of the Governor and other of ficers, employed in the GoA-ernment of the coun try, must have been particularly distressing: ever anxious to protect the good, and to pre vent and punish the vile, Avho on their part were racking their too poAverful inventions to"], [313, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 239 elude, if only for a moment, the paternal care which the government took of its subjects. Perhaps if Ave look back in history Ave may ac count for the origin, increase, and groAvth of despotic governments ; from the same causes as that vileness too general among the ignorant, must have caused an increase of severity in those regulations first established for the good of the AVhole, and thus form eA-entually, that cli max of despotism, Avhich in the more modern periods of history are found overthrown. On the 1st of July armed the CornA\\all, Southern Avhaler, the master of which brought an account that some Spanish cruizers had ap peared off Cape Horn, the Avhalcrs of the South ern fishery Avere directed to pass into these seas during the Avar. This ship Avas followed by two others, the Eliza from the Cape of Good Hope, and the Sally. This circumstance promised some advantages to the settlement. The Avhale fishing on the coast Avould most certainly be effectually tried, and the existence, and positions of shoals, har bours, or rivers, be ascertained. Having in a feAV days refitted, the 3 whalers sailed on their fishing voyages. Previous to Avhich, the Argo, an American schooner, arrived from the Isle of France, having on board a cargo of salt provisions, French brandy, and other articles on speculation ; which, as usual in this country, found a ready sale, much more to the advantage of the oAvners than the colo nists. As this ship came from the Mauritius, 9"], [314, "240 HISTORY OF the Governor entertained some jealousy, cer tainly founded on probability ; and, as it Avas not any Avays impossible, that, under neu tral colours, a spy might be concealed, he thought it requisite to put the battery on Point Maskelyne, into a more secure state, and to construct two redoubts in proper and comre nient situations for offensive and defensive warfare, should it prove requisite. On the 18th arrived the Britannia whaler from England, Avith 94 female convicts, avIio being landed, some Avere sent to Paramatta and Toongabbe. The cattle that Avere brought in the Hunter, Avere at this time sold by auction, and Avere not greater objects of contest than the newly-arrived females, as the number of that sex in the colony bore no proportion to the men.

They wrote at the same time to the Governor, denying giving any name to their meeting, but heavily complaining; that, \"after much expense and trouble in rearing swine, the storekeepers Avould not receive it.\" The Governor highly and justly censured this manner of assembling, and in a printed notice Which he sent to them, told the inhabitants, that if they felt any grievance, Avhether real or supposed, they must submit their complaints to the commanding officer of the settlement, by one or two persons elected for that purpose, and not by a numerous body of people. Every other mode of attempting to gain redress Avas illegal, and could only tend to expose those who might be concerned therein to a very conside- rable degree of clanger, which he would most undoubtedly inflict. In the course of this month was tried an incorrigible offender, John Raynor, who Avas convicted of house-breaking, and accordingly executed, which fate he had often merited. He left a letter previous to hisexecution, in Avhich he enumerated many of the offences he had committed, and denied some with which be had been charged. Various complaints Avere made of the profli gacy of the Avomen; who, from having met too much indulgence on account of their sex, Avere grown, as might be naturally expected, so idle and insolent, that they would not, unless forced, i i"], [316, "HISTORY OF 242 do any thing but nurse their children; an excuse very few were without. If their value might be estimated by the fineness of the children with Avhich they had prodigiously increased the numbers in the settlements, they would have been found deserving every care and attention ; but their vices, too conspicuous and promi nent to admit of much palliation, rendered them objects of detestation. The heavy rains' which had fallen this month and last, having much damaged the public road between Sydney and Paramatta, two gangs were employed in repairing them. The weather was much colder than usual at this season, and in the interior, there was a sharp frost during the night. . . An order having been given in the beginning of August, for assembling the court of civil judicature, a recommendation to the inhabitants was added, \" that when any bargain, contract, or ao-reement, was made between any party or parties, on any subject whatsoever, the same should be reduced to writing, specifying in direct and clear terms Avhat the nature of such bargain or contract might be, and causing the same to be properly witnessed, and subscribed by the parties concerned.\" This measure was to prevent disputes, litigation, and misunder- standings among them, and to avoid the incon- venience which the members of the court experienced, when convened, from the loose and careless manner in which business was brought before them."], [317, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 243 On the 1st of this month the regulation rela tiA*e to the number of public servants Avhich the officers Avere allowed to retain, commenced. It noAv became too obvious, that, instead of employing each Sunday in the performance of those duties for Avhich that day was set apart, it Avas passed in committing every vile act of dissipation, the overseers of the gangs Avere ordered to see their men mustered every Sunday morning, and to attend Avith them at church. The superintendants and constables Avere to see this order complied Avith, and that the Avomen (who, as in all cases when they are really bad, are much Avorse than the men) Avere strictly looked after, and made to attend divine service regularly. And, as example Avas thought might, (as inmost cases,) do something, the officers were ordered not only to send a number of their ser vants, but they Avere a-H called on, civil and military, to assist in theexecution of this order; and the magistrates Avere required to pay their attention, in compelling a proper obedience to it, by preventing the opening of the public houses during divine service, as Avell as any other irregularity on that day. On the 20th, arrived the Pomona and Diana, Avhalers belonoina; to the Southern fishery. The Governor desirous of having that part of the coast surveyed in which a strait Avas supposed to exist (betAveen the latitude of 39\u00b0 00' S. and the land previously deemed the Southern Promontory of NeAv South Wales, and called Van Diemen's land), his Excellency"], [318, "244 HISTORY OF resolved to send Mr. Bass, and Lieut. Flinders of the Reliance, on that service, in the small decked boat which lately arrived from Norfolk Island, which Avas named the Norfolk, after the Island on which she Avas built, for which purpose she was properly fitted up. The powder magazine having been found to be in an insecure and dangerous state, the poAV der Avas removed on board the Supply. This in deed Avas very necessary, for an attempt had been made to break open the door of the magazine. The mind, fatigued by the enormities of the convicts, Avill at least find relief by contem plating the transactions of those, from Avhose nature nothing but savage actions can Avell be expected, for in this Avay the natives noAv claim attention.

As the death of the young man slain by Cole be Atas of course to be revenged, a body of the Southern natives fought those of Sydney for that purpose a few clays after. The contest Avas carried on with much desperation on both sides; three natives Avere killed, and many Avounded, among whom Avas Bennillong, Avho, having re covered of his Avound, appeared and fought on this occasion for Cole-be, like a good, honest, faithful, friend.

The master Avanted Avood and water, and as three days proved time enough to procure them, at their expiration he sailed for China. At the end of this month the Governor made an excursion among the settlers at Hawkes bury; and Avhile there, made several regula tions for the saAvyers, who fixed their OAvn portion of the public labour.

In November the criminal court of judica ture met tAvice, for the trial of several offenders; one of Avhom convicted of perjury, stood in the pillory agreeable to his sentence.

The unfortunate produce of the harvest, noAv proved a most serious cause of regret, for the Avheat Avas little more than straw ; and the maize burnt in the ground for Avant of rain.

On January the 12th, arrived the Norfolk, with Lieut.

W. on which they bore up, gained, and cast anchor in TAVofold Bay. Mr. Bass had visited this Bay Avhen on the coast before in the Avhale-boat ; but had Hot then au opportunity to examine it as he"], [336, "262 HISTORY OF wished, but now lie ascertained Twofold Bay to be situated at the South end of a chain of hills, one part of which is more conspicuous than the rest, laying behind the bay. The land on the West side of this chain of hills, is both high and rocky. The shore divided into steep cliff heads, Avith small beaches ; the one formed by the foremost ridges, and the others by the sand throAvn up at the foot of the vallies, and ponds of brackish Avater were found behind the beaches. The sudden rise of the hills permit the vege table earth to be Avashed doAvn into the vallies, and some of the gradual slopes retain enough of it to produce a thick coat of grass ; hoAveArer the soil partakes too much of the stoney quality of the higher parts for cultivation. The hills and vallies produce large timber and brush-Avood ; on the hills, the brush-Avood groAvs in small clumps ; but in the vallies it not only covers all the surface, but is bound together by creeping vines of various sizes. In the S. W. corner of the bay, is a small inlet that communicates Avith the sea, through the beach at the back of Avhich it lies. The chain of hills here runs back some distance from the Avater, and leaving some miles of good ground, through Avhich the inlet takes its course to the S.W. for six or eight miles, Avhere it ends in swamps and marshes. On its banks they saAv some hundred acres of alight sandy soil, in patches of from 50 to 100 acres each; but on the mountain side, it soon became stoney,"], [337, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 263 and on that next the inlet it was Avet and salt. The country on the back of the bay is formed of round stoney hills hardly fit for pas turage, but covered Avith timber, and patches of short brush-Avood. On the South side, they found another shal- Ioav inlet, larger than the other, running in by the end of a beach, and Avinding along to the S.S.W. Avith little low ground on its borders, but the returning tide did not allow them time to proceed to its head. On the East side, the hills not being either steep or prominent, several large slopes of good though sandy soil, Avere discovered to have been formed. Some of Avhich extended to the Avater, Avell covered with grass, aud thinly set Avith timber, which formed a beautiful appear ance from the bay. Speaking of the land round the bay, these Gentlemen observed, it might be said it Avas more barren than productive ; that there were several spots of tolerable good, and some of excellent soil ; but the greater part incapable of cultivation, and sit only for pas turage. The most common timber they saAv was a species of gum tree, the bark of which on the trunk is that of the iron bark of Port Jackson ; and its leaf, that of the gum tree; its branches near the head are of a yelloAV colour, smooth, and resembling the barked limbs of trees.

They used canoes, and seemed to Avell knoAV the value of them ; for on roAving round the point of Snug Cove, when Mr. Bass was on a former visit, a party of them paddled on shore, took their canoes upon their heads, and ran off Avith them to the Avoods. Hoav ever, they did not noAv appear quite so shy as formerly ; and there Avas every reason to imagine that a friendly intercourse might have been established. As the very feAV spears seen here were made of solid avoocI, Messrs. Bass and Flinders con jectured, that the grass reed spear used by the nath*es of Port Jackson was not knoAvn among these people. Fcav marks of the kangaroo Avere seen, and both quadrupeds and birds appeared to be far less numerous here than in most other places. The dogs accompanying the voyagers found a porcupine ant-eater, which they could make no impression on; he escaped by burrowing in the loose sand, sinking himself directly downwards and not head foremost, thus presenting his prickly back, opposed his adversaries to the last. A few ducks, teal, herons, cranes, and red bills Avere seen on the lagoons, and some flights of curleAvs and plovers. The rocks consist of hard clay, mixed with great numbers ofsmall stones, variously coloured, some Avith red, others with yellow. Some cal earious spar lay scattered on the surface of the"], [339, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 265 ground ; strata of Avhich Avere deposited in fis sures formed in the bodies of the rocks. Leaving TAvofold Bay, they proceeded to the South Avard, and on the 17th, made a small clus ter of Islands, in latitude 3$\u00b0 16', Avhich noAv bears the name of Kent's Group. These are six or seven in number, of various sizes. Their height is considerable, and as irregular in figure as can well be imagined. This group appears formed of granite, which is imperfectly con cealed by long straggling dwarfish brush, and some few still more diminutive trees. Nature is either working sloAvly on these islands, or has ceased to work on them, since a more deserted place is no Avhere to be met with. The birds seemed not to frequent them in their usual num bers. Indeed there Avas nothing to tempt the explorers even to land. Passing Kent's Group, and standing to the Southward, next morning Furncaux's Islands were in sight, and on the following day they anchored at Preservation Island, Avhich is one of them. These islands, from Avhat Avas now and before seen of them by Mr. Bass, appeared to consist of tAvo kinds, perfectly dissimilar in figure, but alike in the materials they are formed of. Both are of granite ; but the one is Ioav, and rather level, Avith a soil of sand covered with brush- avooc! and tufted grass: the other is high and rocky, and cut into a A'ariety of peaks. Some vegetable soil lies on these, and the vege tation is large ; and trees of a tolerable size are M M"], [340, "266 HISTORY OF produced in some places. There are attached to some parts of these islands low sandy land, of the same height Avith the lower islands. Preservation Island, is of the humble class of islands and of a moderate height. A surface of sand, mixed with A*egetable soil, scarcely hides from view the base of granite. In several places Arast blocks of this stone lie scattered about, as free from vegetation and the injuries of Aveather as if they had but just fallen ; and, what is remarkable, most of them are entirely detached from the stone on Avhich they rest. It seemed that these blocks had fallen from some place higher than on Avhich they Avere found ; but that Avas at the same time deemed impossible, for they Avere then higher than any other part of the island. It is cer tainlv more probable, that subterraneous or vol canic sire might have caused their appearance. The bulk of these blocks render them so con spicuous, that the attention is first taken by them on approaching the island. But, besides granate, there is on the North side, Avhere the island is loAvest, a slip of calcareous earth, which discovers itself near the surface of the Avater. It is not pure, for broken pieces of the granite are mixed With it. Some parts are a mere mass of these pieces, cemented by the calcareous matter; others are a perfect chalk, and may be burnt into excellent lime. Broken sea shells and other exuvi\u00e6 of marine animals are apparent throughout the whole, mass."], [341, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 267 Upon the beach near this chalky rock, w*ere found a considerable quantity of black metallic particles, Avhich appeared in the granite as black shining specks, and are undoubtedly grains of tin. It excited much surprise to find this bed of the remains of shell animals, of Avhich chalk is formed wherever found ; and Mr. Bass endea voured to hwestigate the cause of this deposit, by examining the neighbouring parts ; on which he was of opinion, that as traces of the sea, and of the effects of running Avaters, Avere dis cernable in various parts of the island, and par ticularly in the vicinity of this deposit, it seemed probable it had been formed by two streams of the tide, which Avhen the island Avas beneath the surface of the sea, having- swept round a large lump of rock, then met and formed an eddy, Avhere every substance must fall to the bottom. The lump of rocks is a rocky knoAvl, which runs from the opposite side of the island nearly to the chalk. On each side is a gap, through which the tAvo streams have passed. The vegetation of the island seems starved; consisting only of a few stunted trees; some patches of brush- wood, almost impenetrable; tufts of sour Aviry grass, and many Ioav saltish plants, principally of the creeping kind. A spot on the East end of the island exhi bited a phenomenon not easily explicable by any laws of that class of natural history to which it could be resemble."], [342, "268 HISTORY OF In a patch of naked sand, on one of the most lofty parts of the island, not less than 100 feet above the sea, Avithin a feAV hundred yards, lay scattered a number of broken branches of dead trees, from one to three inches in diameter, and apparently of a kind similar to the large brush- Avood. Amid these branches Avere seen sticking up several Avhite stoney stumps, of sizes ranging be tween the above diameters, and in height from a foot to a foot and an half. Their form, together with a number of prongs, projecting in different directions around their base, and entering the ground in the manner of roots, presented a strik ing resemblance to the stumps and roots of trees. They Avere extremely brittle, a slight blow with a stick, being sufficient to break them; and Avhen taken into the hand, they broke to pieces with their OAvn weight. When broke transversely, it Avas seen that the internal Avas divided into interior or central, ex terior or cortical. The external part, Avhich occupied various proportions of the Avhole, re sembled a fine white and soft grit-stone ; but acids being applied to them, shewed it to be combined Avith a considerable portion of cal careous matter. The interior or central part was always circular, seldom found the same diame ter, or of the same composition, on any two stumps. In some, the calcareous and sandy matter had taken entire possession, so that the wood was completely obliterated ; but yet a cen tral ring remained. In others Avas a center chalk, quite white, which crumbled between the fin-"], [343, "269 NEW SOUTH AVALES. gers to powder; some consisted of chalk and brown earth, and others had detained a few* por tions of their Avoody fibres, the spaces between which Avere filled up Avith chalk or earth. It appeared, when the people of the Sidney cove came on the island, the pieces of dead branches at this time lying round the stumps, then formed, Avith them, the stem and branches of dead trees completly. But by this time cu riosity, and the frolics of the horse landed from the Sidney-Cove, had reduced them to the state described. Mr. Bass had been told that the trees Avhen in a complete state, rose from the stoney part ; and that a living leaf was seen upon the upper bran ches of one of them. But he could never learn Avhether the stoney part of the stem Was of an equal height in all the trees. To ascertain to what depth the pelrification decehded, Mr. Bass scratched away the sand from the foot of many of the stumps, and in no instance found it to have proceeded more than three or four inches beneath the surface of the sand, for at that depth the remains of the root came to view. There were parts of the roots which had underaone an alteration similar to that which had taken place in the stems : these es tablished the limits of the petrifying power ; for they had felt it only either at their outset from the bottom of the stems, or Avhen, being obstruct ed in their progress, they had arched upAvards to the surface."], [344, "HISTORY OF 270 In accounting for the cause that produced this change in the structure of the lower parts of the stems of these trees, Mr. Bass professed the greatest diffidence. He found that all his conjectures Avere best supported by existing facts, alloAving however, they Avere petrifactions, it is certain that there must have existed a pond, in which the petrifying Avater Avas contained; but the ground in their neighbourhood retained no traces of such a receptacle. There Avere, in deed, near them, some feAV lumps or banks of sand, and vegetable earth held together by dead Toots of small trees, and elevated above the rest of the ground, but the relative position of these Avith each other was so confused and irregular, that nothing but the necessity of a once .exist ing reser\\-oir could ever lead any one to conjec ture that these might have been parts of its bank. Mr. Bass concluded that this must haAe been the case, and that the remainder of the bank had been torn aAvay, and the pond anni hilated by some violent effort of nature. Notwithstanding the narrowness of the island, many small kangaroos Avere found in its brushy parts; but so many had been destroy ed by the peo ple of Sydney- Cove, that they now became scarce. The sooty petrel had appropriated a certain grassy part of the island to herself, and retained her position with a degree of obstinacy not ea* sily to be overcome. For though it so happened, that the store-house for the Avrecked cargo Avas erected upon the spot, and the people for more than a year gained the greater part of the"], [345, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 271 food from these birds, and were continu ally- Avalking over their habitations, yet at the end of .that time the returning flights in the even ing Avere as numerous as they had been on their first arrival. When Mr. Hamilton, the commander of the Sydney-Cove, quitted the house, he left tAvohens sitting upon their eggs, some breeding pigeons, and a bag of rice ; but no traces Avere iioav to be discovered either of the birds or their food. Pro bably as long as they continued in doors, they did well ; but that, when forced by necessity to go abroad for food, they fell a sacrifice to the ra pacity of the hawks. Several snakes Avith venemous fangs were found; but, no person had been bit by them, so that the degree of their poAver was unknown. The water of the island Avas imagined to have been injurious to the health of people of the Sydney-Cove. Being supposed to contain arse nic, Avhich seemed highly probable from an ex periment made with the metallic particles, which were thought to be tin. A fume of Avhich bore many marks of arsenic arising from the crucible during the time of smelting it. Water was ve ry scarce while these people Avere upon the island ; but, OAving to some unusual falls of rain, seA'eral little runs and swamps Avere found by Mr. Bass ; and a Ioav piece of ground Avhere they deposited their dead Avas noAv a pond of an ex cellent quality. Although he had seen but few of the Ioav islands of Furneaux, yet Mr. Bass had not any"], [346, "272 HISTORY OF doubt but that this account of Preservatiofi Island Avould in general answer for the descrip tion of any of them. He next describes what he saAv of Cape Bar ren Island, Avhich he understood, from the peo ple of the Nautilus siioav, Avas an exact specimen of those of the higher kind, so far as they had observed of them. Cape Barren Island, Avhich takes its name from the cape so called by Captain Furneaux, is a small island Avhen compared Avith that lying to the nortfiAvard of it. From Avhat Avas seen of it in the sloop, it could only be conjectured that these tAvo Avere separate Islands ; but Mr. Bishop had passed in the Nautilus through the channel that divides them. This island is one of the higher kind that consists of both high and Ioav land. The high part composed of granite, in many places, in others clothed with small gum trees, which draAV their support through some small quantity of vegetable earth lodged by the broken blocks and fragments of stone, and some straggling brush-Avood shooting up round the trees. The base of the Ioav part is granite ; the sur face chiefly sand ; its produce, variety of brush wood, Avith some feAV small gum trees, and a spe cies of fir, that grows tall and straight to the height of twenty or twenty- five feet. Within the body of the brush there are several clear spots, Avhere the ground is partly rocky or san dy, partly wet and spongy. These are some what enlivened by beautiful flowering heath 1"], [347, "273 NEAV SOUTH WALES. and Ioav shrubs, but have a dark aspect. A grass tree groAVS here, similar to that about Port Jack son, except that no reed, either living nor dead, could be found belonging to it. In the brushes, Avere a feAV tufts of grass ; but the greater part of it Avas the coarse sort that grows in hassocks. It is curious that a place Avhere food seemed to be so scarce should yet be thickly inhabited by the small brush kangaroo, and a neAv quad ruped, also a grass-eater. This animal, being a new one, appears to de serve a particular description. \" The Worn-bat (or Womback) is a thick, short-legged, inactive quadruped, with appearance of every strength, and bigger than a turnspit dog. Its figure and movements, strongly bring to mind the bear. \" Its length, from the tip of the tail to the tip of the nose, is thirty-one inches, of Avhich its body is twenty-three and five-tenths. The head of this curious animal is seven inches. Its cir cumference behind the fore-legs, twenty-seven inches; across the thick part of the belly, thir ty-one inches. Its Aveight is betAveen tAventy five and thirty pounds. The hair coarse, and about one inch in length, thin on the belly, thicker on the back and head, and thickest up on the loins and rump ; the colour of it a sandy brown, of varying shades, darkest along the back. \" The head is large and stattish, and, Avhen looking the animal full in the face, seems, ex cluding the ears, to form nearly an equilateral triangle, any side of which is about seven inches N N"], [348, "274 HISTORY OF in length, but the upper side, or that Avhich con stitutes the breadth of the head, is the shortest. The hair upon the face lies in regular order, as if it Avere combed, Avith its ends pointed upAvards in a kind of radii, from the nose. \" The ears are sharp and erect, of tAvo inches and three tenths in length, stand Avell asunder, and are in nowise disproportionate. The eyes are small, and rather sunk than prominent, but quick and lively. They are placed about two inches asunder, a little beloAV the centre of the imaginary triangle towards the nose. The nice co-adaption of their ciliary processes, which are covered Avith a sine hair, seeming to afford the animal the power of excluding whatever may be hurtful. \" The nose is large and spreading, the nostrils large, and capable of being closed. They stand angularly, and a channel is continued from them toAvards the upper lip, which is divided like the hare's. The Avhiskers are rather thick and strong, and are in length from 2 to 3 inches. \" The mouth is small ; Avhich contains five long grass-cutting teeth in the front of each jaw, Avithin them is a vacancy of an inch, then appear two small canine teeth of equal height Avith, and so similar to, eight molares situated behind, as scarcely to be distinguishable from them. The whole number in both jaws amount to twenty -four. \" The neck is thick and short, and greatly restrains the motions of the head, Avhich looks as if it was stuck on the shoulders."], [349, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 275 \"' From the neck the back arches a little as far as the loins, Avhence it goes off at a flat slope to the hindmost parts, Avhere no tail is visible. A tail, notwithstanding is found, after separating the hairs, five tenths of an inch in length, naked, except for a feAV short hair near its end. This curious tail seemed to hold a much bolder proportion in the young than in the full-gOAvn animal. \" The fore legs are very strong and muscular: their length, to the sole of the paw, is 5 inches, and the distance between them is 5 inches. The paAvs are fleshy, round and large being 2 inches in dia meter. Their claAvs are 5 in number. The 3 mid dle claws are strong ; the thumb and little finger claws are also strong, but shorter than the others. The fleshy root of the thumb claw is smaller and more flexible than the others. The sole of the paAv is hard, and the upper part covered with the common hair, down to the roots of the claws which it over hangs. The hind legs are less strong and mus eular than the fore; their length, to the sole, is five inches and a half. The hind paw is longer than the fore, but not less fleshy ; its length is nearly three inches, its breadth two inches and a half. The claws are four in number: the three inner ones are less strong, but. about tAvo tentlis of an inch longer than the longest of the fore claws ; and there is a fleshy spur in the place of a thumb-claAV. The whole paw has a curve, which throws its fore part rather inward. \" In size the two sexes are nearly the sanv but the female rather the heaviest."], [350, "276 HISTORY OF \"This animal has not any claim to SAviftness of foot, as most men could run it doAvn. Its pace is hobbling something like the gait of a bear. In disposition it is mild and gentle ; but it bites hard and is furious Avhen provoked. Mr. Bass never heard its voice but once ; it Avas a low cry, which could not be heard at a distance of more than 30 or 40 yards. He chased one, and Avith his hands under its belly lifted it off the ground without hurting it, and laid it on its back along his arm. It made no noise, nor any ef fort to escape. Mr. Bass carried the beast up- Avards of a mile, shifting him from arm to arm, sometimes laying him on his shoulder, Avhichhe took in good part ; till being obliged to secure his legs Avhile he Avent into the brush to cut a specimen of a new Avood, the creature's anger arose with the pinching of the tAvihe ; he Avhiz zed Avith all his might, kicked most furiously, and snapped off a piece from the elbow of Mr. Bass's jacket Avith his grass cutting teeth ; and the creature, Avhen again taken up, remained implacable all the Avay to the boat, only ceasing to kickAvhen he Avas exhausted.\" Besides Furneaux's Islands, the Worm-bat inhabits the mountains and several islands to the Westward of Port Jackson. In all these places its habitation is under ground, being ad mirably formed for burrowing, but Avhat depth it descends does not seem to be ascertained. According to the account given of it by the natives, the Avom-bat of the mountains is never seen during the day, but lives retired in his hole, feeding only in the night; but that of the"], [351, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 277 islands is seen to feed in all parts of the day. The stomacs of such as Mr. Bass examined Avere distended with the coarse wiry grass, and he had seen the animal scratching among the the dry ricks of sea-Aveed thrown up upon the shores, but could never discover Avhat it was in search of. Cape Barren Island, besides the kangaroo and Avom-bat, is inhabited by the porcupine ant-eater ; a rat Avith webbed feet ; parroquets, and small birds unknoAvn at Port Jackson, some few of which Avere of beautiful plumage. Black snakes Avith the venimous fangs Avere numerous upon the edges of the brush. The rocks to ward the sea were covered with fur-seals. Quitting Furneaux's Islands, the Norfolk proceeded toAvard the North coast of Van Die men's land; and on the 1st of November an chored at the largest of the Swan Isles, tAvo small islands so called by Lieut. Flinders, when here in the Francis; as an European belonging to the Sydney-Cove assured him that he had met great numbers of swans on them. The isle at Avhich the sloop anchored, like Preservation Island, Avas low, sandy, and bar ren, but differed in the composition of its rocks, or that substance which formed the basis of its support. This had not any affinity to gra nite. It Avas of various colours, but generally cither of a light brown or grey. It seemed to be lamellated, but the lamellae were placed ver tically, often radiated Avith a diameter of four or five sect, and sometimes placed parallel. On breaking the stone, the fracture was vitreous, or"], [352, "278 HISTORY OF like that of glass, and it scintillated on steel being applied. Rust of iron Avas visible in se veral parts, the stone breaking in those parts into plates ; but Avhere none of those markings were seen, it broke with great difficulty. On the first vieAv, the stone looked like clay; but as it produced fire with steel, there must have been a large portion of flint in it. It appeared to contain iron in rather a large quantity. Not a single swan was found upon the island, notwithstanding the information giveu by the European ; but several geese Avere breeding there, and the sooty petrel possessed the grassy parts. On the first of November, early in the morn ing, they left the Swan Isles, steering to the Westward along shore. A column of smoke which arose some dis tance inland, Avas the only proof of its being inhabited. At noon the latitude Avas 40\u00b0 44' 08\", the peak of Cape Barren Island then in sight. At this time they Avere tAvo miles to the WestAvard of the small island, which Avas Ioav and rocky, lying about 2 miles and a half of a sharp, sandy point, with which it was nearly joined by some lumps of rock that almost closed up the passage. The aspect of the Ioav land here Avas less pleas ing, the mountains approaching nearer the sea, and the country appearing to be more stocked with Avood. The coast seemed inclined to a southerly direction, and the Western extremity, \u25a01"], [353, "279 NEAV SOUTH AVALES. which bore S. W. by W. appeared irregular and very much broken. At five in the afternoon they anchored tAvo miles and a half to the Westward of the small island, setting the vessel to the Northward. The next morning they weighed at nine, with an easterly Avind, and steered towards a small break that presented itself in the bottom of an extensive bay, lying betAveen the tAvo extremes then in view. The break was not sufficiently distinct to have justified in itself alone a reason able supposition of an inlet, but that it was cor roborated by the direction of the ebb tide, Avhich, while the sloop Aras at anchor, Avas ob served to come from the S. S. W. or directly out of the bay, running at the rate of two miles and a half per hour. By noon, they ascertained that there was not any inlet, they bore aAvay to the Westward along the land. Their distance from the shore did not exceed a mile and a half. The back country consisted of high mountains, whose parallel edges Avere one above another to a considerable distance inland. The laud in front appeared both Avoody, bushy, and sandy. In the afternoon they ran between a sandy point, with shoal water off it, and two islands. One of these, named Waterhouse Isle, is be tween tAvo and three miles in length, high, but level, and covered Avith large wood. The other is small, Ioav, rocky, and nearly bare. The coast now trended to the S. S. W. the land sloping up from the sea a moderate height, with"], [354, "280 HISTORY OF more open than Avooded ground, and little brush-wood ; but the soil sandy, and the grass thin. Proceeding, the shore no longer retained a regular line of direction, but fell back into sandy bights. Hauling off for the night to the WestAvard of a small rocky barren island, about four miles from the land, at six o'clock the next morning they came in with it again, and began their course along the shore, to the S. S. W. in an irregular manner. At eleven they passed Avithin a mile of a grassy cape, which is the extremity of a ridge, that rising up by a gentle ascent, retreats and joins some lofy mountains. A small rocky island lay too miles from it to the W. S. W. at noon the latitude Avas 40\u00b0 55' 2*6\", and the lon gitude 147\u00b0 16' 30\". Early in the afternoon a gap in the land situ: ated at the back of a deep narroAV bight, at tracted attention, this they bore aAvay to ex amine; aud, after running three miles, they found they had shut in the line of the coast on each side, and Avere impelled forward by a strong inset of tide. Continuing their course for the gap, some back points Avithin the en trance soon became distinguishable, and the iapidity of the flood tide Avas observed to in crease on nearing the shore. When the sloop Avas on the point of entering the harbour, the Avater shoaled suddenly, and she struck the ground and lay fast ; but the strong flood in a few minutes dragged her over into deep water,"], [355, "281 NEAV SOUTH WALES. and shot her into the entrance Avith great ve locity. Having advanced Avithin the entrance, the harbour began to expand itself in a kind of large basin. Its shores Avere broken into points, be tAveen some of which the great strength of the flood tide led them to expect it Would branch off into arms. The land lying immediately up on its borders Avas low, but not flat ; and those points near Avhich the sloop passed Avere clothed with an unusual degree of verdure. The sun being down, the vessel Avas anchored for the night, and the next clay they proceeded Avith their researches. This harbour, or inlet, which Avas named by the Governor, Port Dalryinple, in compliment to Alexander Dalryinple, Esq. takes its course from the S. E. between tAvo chains of rounded mountains, stretching inland from the sea Avith an almost imperceptible increase of elevation; and, seemed to unite, at the distance of between thirty and forty miles, in a body of rugged moun tains more loftv than themselves. These two chains in their relative positions formed an acute angle, being at their greatest distance asunder, as measured along the sea coast, only sixteen miles. As these gentlemen Avere limitted in point of time (twelve Aveeks having been deemed by the Governor sufficient for the execution of this service), the fear of losing a Avind favourable for the prosecution of the principal object of the voyage, that of sailing through the strait, de^er- o 9"], [356, "282 HISTORY OF red them from trying to reach the head of the river. The quality of the ground, was far superior to that of the borders of any of the salt Avater inlets of NeAv South Wales, Western Port ex cepted. The vegetable mould Avas, hoAvever, found to be of no great depth, and Avas some times mixed Avith small quantities of sand. The best of the soil Avas found upon the sides of slopinghills, and in the broad vallies betAveen them. Some parts that were Ioav and level had a Avet surface, bounded by small tracts of flower ing shrubs and plants, that absolutely perfum ed the air. These retained in general the ap pearance of those in Ncav South Wales, Avhile they were in reality very different. The tAvo countries present a perfect similarity in this, that the more barren spots are the most gaily adorned. Except in these places the grass does not grow in tufts, but covers the land equally Avith a short herbage, better adapted, for small than of large cattle. The food for the latter groAVS in the bot toms of the vallies and on the clamp flats. A large proportion of the soil promised a fair re turn to the labours of the cultivator, but the greater part Avould perhaps be more advantage ously employed, if left for pasturage, than if throAvn into cultivation. Water Avas found in runs more than in ponds, not very plentiful, but far from being scarce. The Avest side of the river possessed the larg est quantity of the best ground, because the mountains on that side are at a greater distance"], [357, "283 NEAV SOUTH AVALES. than those on the east. The country lying near the Avest arm is rather flat, and might be con verted to many useful purposes. The best land seemed to be that fine hilly country at the back of an island named Middle- Island ; but access to it is not easy on account of a large shoal extending along its fro*pt, Avhich is dry at low Avater, as far out as the isjand itself.* The shape of the land is very pleasingly A*aric gated Avith hill and valley ; the soil is in general a rich black mould, shalloAV, and even some times a little stoney on the hills, but in the val lies abundant depth and richness. A close coat of grass of a uniform thickness overspreads it every Avhere. It appears to be Avatered only by swampy ponds, which in many places are at some distance from each other. The heavy timber is chiefly of the various species of the gum tree ; of which two are differ ent from any that have been yet seen in this coun try. But, from the few trees that have been fel led, it was thought to be more sound at heart than they are usually. The she oaks Avere more inclined to spread than grow tall. The tree pro ducing the yelloAV gum is of a very diminutive size; but, unlike that of Cape Barren Island, it bears a reed correspondent to itself. These Avere going into floAver, and their length Avas only from nine inches to tAvo feet. Grey kangaroos of a large size, abounded in the open forest ; and the brushes with the smaller black kind. The gloomy plumage of the parrots forms a"], [358, "284 HISTORY OF contrast with the lustre of those near the settle ment. The cry of the bell-bird seems to be un knoAvn here. Aquatic birds, Aveb-footed and waders, frequent the arms and covers of the ri ver ; but the black swans alone are remarkable in point of number. Mr. Bass once saAv three hundred^Avimming within the space of a quarter of a mile j^nd heard the \" dying song\" so ce lebrated by the poets. Not more than two thirds of any of the flocks which they fell in with could fly, the rest could do no more than flap along upon the surface of the Avater, being either moulting, or not yet come to their full feather and groAvth, Avhich they require tAvo years to at tain. They sAvain and flapped alternately, and went surprisingly fast. It Avas some times a long chase, but the boat generally tired them out. When in clanger, speed makes no part of their escape, they immerse their bodies so far, that the Avater makes a passage between their neck and back, and in this position they Avould avoid a heavy load of shot. They seemed endowed with much sagacity ; in. chase they soon learned the Aveakest point of their pursuers, and, instead of swimming directly from them, as they did at first, always endeavoured in the most artful man ner to gain the Avind. The swan is said to feed upon fish, frogs, and Avater-slugs ; but in the gizards of many \u2022that at different times and in different places were examined, nothing appeared but small wa ter plants, and some little sand. Of their affec tion for their young he had seen some sacri*"], [359, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 285 sices; but of their fierceness, Avhen opposed to man, or their great strength, he had seen no in stance. Among other reptiles Avere found the snake Avith venemous fangs, and some brown guanoes. This country is but thinly inhabited, and the extreme shyness of the natives prevented any kind of communication Avhatever. They ne ver even got sight of them but once, and that at a great distance. They had made fires abreast Avhere the sloop Avas at anchor ; but as soon as the boat approached the shore they ran off to the avoocIs. Their huts, of Avhich seven or eight were frequently found together like a little encamp ment, were constructed of bark torn in long stripes, after being divided transversely at the bottom, in such breadths as their strength Avould be able to disengage them from the Avood. It is then broken into lengths, and placed, sloping wise, against the elbowing part of some dead branch that had fallen off limbs of the gum tree ; and a little grass is sometimes thrown over the top. But, they have not ingenuity enough to place the slips of bark in such a manner as to preclude the rain. The only utensil observed lying near their huts was a kind of basket made of long grass. The two ends of a large bunch of this grass are tied to the two ends of a smaller bunch ; the large one is then spread out to form the basket, while the smaller answers the purpose of a handle. Their use is to bring shell fish from the mud banks where they are collected. The large"], [360, "286 HISTORY OF heaps of muscle shells found near each hut proved the mud banks to be a principal source of food. On an examination of their fire-places nothing, except a feAV bones of the opossum, or squirrel, and here and there those of a small kangaroo were discovered. The mode of taking the opossum seemed to be similar to that practised in NeAv South Wales, except that they use a rope in ascending the tree; for at the foot of a notched tree, about eight feet of a two-inch rope made of grass Avas found Avith a knot in it, near which it appeared broken. To the canoe they Avere strangers as one Avas never met Avith, or Avas any tree ever observed to be barked in the manner requisite for this purpose; though birds bred upon little islands to which access might be had in the smallest canoe. The roughness of the notches left by the stone hatchet upon the bark of the trees bore no fa vourable testimony to its excellence. They were rather the marks of a rough than of a sharp edged tool, and seemed more beaten than cut, Avhich Avas not the case Avith the marks left by the stone hatchet of NeAv South Wales, The range of the thermometer, taken in vari ous parts of the port, Avas at night from 49\u00b0 to 52\u00b0, aud at noon from 58\u00b0 to 64\u00b0. On the 20th of November they left Port Dal ryinple with a light breeze at N. E. and proceed ed slowly to the westward. At day-light the following morning, the Avind shifted to the W. by N. which drove them back to Furneaux's 4"], [361, "287 NEAV SOUTH AVALES. islands, Avhere, the gale continuing at west, they were kept until the 3d of December, when they Avereenabled to proceed to the westward. The land here trended to the W. N. W. as far as visible through thehaze, Avhich suffered them only to dis tinguish that it Avas high and uneven. Atnoon the latitude Avas 40\u00b0 58', and the iongitute 140\u00b0 44'. Their progress Avas slow; but Avhat Avas seeu of it appeared high and mountainous, the moun tains forming into low peaks, to which a few large shapeless knobs added a great singularity. On the haze clearing aAvay, and the shore being distinctly seen, it appeared rocky, but Avooded nearly doAvn to the water's edge. Here and there Avere seen spaces of open ground, some of which sloped toward the sea, and had a few large trees growing on them. A peaked mountain, some miles inland, might have been thought, from its shape and height, to have been once a volcano. On the 6th, towards noon, soon after passing- Circular Head, the outermost land in sight stretched so far on the northward, that the course to clear it Avas N. N. W. It formed like two hummocks. Nothing new presented itself on the follow ing clay, but some small flights of sooty petrels. On the 8th, being threatened with a gale, they came to anchor under the land, off a small beach on its N. E. part, Avhere the S. W. Avind could not molest the vessel. Here Mr. Bass land ed to examine the country, but the tall stur dy brush-Avood grew so close that their dogs"], [362, "288 HISTORY OF could hardly make their Avay through it. Se veral patches seemed to have been burnt many months ago, but the Small brush and creeping vines only Avere destroyed ; the closeness of the blackened saplings Avas still irresistible. A few starved gum trees erected their heads above the brush-wood, and the Avhole Avore an aspect of poverty. The rocks Avere composed of quartz, probably a species of granite, but unlike what formed Furneaux's Islands. Leaving this place on the 9th, they steered for the outermost land in sight, and Avas distant three or four leagues. After rounding the end of the land under Avhich they had anchored, its shores fell back, and discovered to them it Avas an island of from fifteen to tAventy miles miles in circuit, and situated betAA*een four and five from the main. It Avas Avith the greatest aston ishment that they recollected the fire places and sea shells which they had the preceding even ing seen upon the island. This island had bestoAved on it the name of the Three Hummock Island. During the early part of the morning, some millions of sooty petrels passed the vessel on their way to the westward. Having passed Avithin a mile of a pointed part of the main, Avhich in height and vegetation resembled Three Hummock Island, towards noon they came up Avith some land, A\\*hich prov ed to be a small island, high and steep ; and a long SAvell, Avhich had just before made its first appearance, broke violently upon it, making a furious surf on -all sides. Its summit Avas"], [363, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 289 whitened over Avith birds. With difficulty a landing Avas effected, and, after an encounter with some seals that stood above, they reached the top. The birds found Avere albatrosses. The spread of their Avings Avas from seven to nine feet; and the appearance of their visitors did not occasion much disturbance among them, even Avhen they approached close to them. The females sat upon their nests, this being the season of their breeding, the nests Avere not more than a foot and a half apart, built of muddy earth, bound with grass, raised about four inches from the ground. One young bird Avas in each nest : of the size of a small pullet, covered Avith a beau tifully Avhite doAvn ; at some distance resemb ling a ball of cotton. Some nests held an addled egg of a dirty Avhite colour, and equal in size to that of a goose. The nests Avere so near each other, and the birds so conscious of the strength of their sharp bills, that in going through them they Avere obliged to make use of seal clubs, to procure a passage. EA-en the young ones spout ed plentiful mouthfuls of a kind of oil on them not altogether unpleasant. This island, Avhich obtained the name of Al batross Island, Avasa mass of stone, Avithout any other vegetation than afeAV tufts of coarse grass. Besides albatrosses, it afforded shelter to a feAV hair seals, and the large gull. The latitude Avas 40\u00b0 24', the longitude 145\u00b0 02'. Several other islands Avere seen to the South ward, and the coast of the main seemed trended F P"], [364, "290 HISTORY OF in the same direction. A deep bight lay at the back of these islands, Avith points and openings visible in its most distant part. They passed near enough to determine that they Avere high, steep, and difficult of access. Their tops and sloping parts Avere groAvn over Avith either coarse grass or short brush ; but not any trees appear ed. The largest might be seven or eight miles in circuit, the smaller were mere masses of rock, and the whole in number about tAvelve, obtained the name of Hunter's Isles. A fresh gale at E. N. E. and a heavy swell from the S. W. drove the vessel fast to the South ward and WestAvard ; and on the 1 1th, the gale having moderated, they stretched in for th*** land, a large extent of which Avas indistinctly visible through a light haze that hung about the horizon. At noon the latitude Avas 41\u00b0 13', and the longitude 148\u00b0 58'. With a fresh breeze at N. N. E. they bore aAvay along the shore, Avhich trends to the S. E. by E. and Avas distant three or four miles. On the following morning the Avind rounded to the NortliAvard, and they continued along the shore. Early in the forenoon they passed a sin gular point, Avith a number of lumps of rock ly ing some two or three miles off it to the S. W. It resembled an artificial pier, or mole, Avith wai chouses upon it, and a light-house on the end next the Avater. Large masses of detached ob long rocks gave the appearance of Avarchouses, and a remarkable long one standing upon its end, that of the light-house."], [365, "NEW SOUTH' WALES. 291 Neither Mr. Bass, nor his fellow , voyager, Lieut. Flinders, hesitated to think thSy had passed through the strait, and from the Pacific, had entered the southern Indian ocean ; for Avhat within the extent of a vast sea could give birth to the monstrous SAvell noAv rolling in before their eyes ? and the coast Avas evidently trending towards the S. W. cape. It Avas Avorthy of remark, that the Northern shore of the strait from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port resembled the bluff bold shore of an open sea, Avith a SAvell rolling* in, and a large surf breaking upon it; while the Southern shore, or Avhat is the coast of Van Diemen's land, appeared like the inner shore of a cluster of islands, Avhose outer parts break off the great Aveight of the sea. On the 1 1th in the afternoon a piece of land like an island Avas discovered standing out of the line of the coast, but Avas found joined to the main by a sandy beach. The shore behind it Avas rugged and craggy, and the land Avas both sterile and stoney. As night came on the vessel stood off to the WestAvard, and at day light the next morning came in Avith the land near the same spot, and ran along the shore at N. W. About noon the coast rose into chains of high mountains, in the same line as the coast, in latitude 43\u00b0 07', the longitude 145\u00b0 42'. Some smoke rising astern the vessel was the first circumstance which afforded proof of inhabi tants being on this West coast. 2"], [366, "292 HISTORY OF On the 13th they found the vessel had been carried in the night to leeAvard of a break in the land, they had seen the preceding evening, which appeared like the entrance of an harbour. The north point of Avhich Avas named Point St. Vincent. In the evening they passed the S. W. cape of Van Diemen's land, hitherto knoAvn as that of NeAv Holland. It is a narroAV piece of land, with tAvo hummocks. Passing the cape, they Avent bet\\A^een De Witt's Isles and the main, and at sunset they were only about a mile and a half from the South Cape. 1 \u2022*. t The South West and South Capeslie nearly East and West of each other, distant nearly fifteen leagues. The coast betAveen forms the Southern boundary of Van Diemen's land. The extremity of Van Diemen's land presents a rugged front to the icy regions of the south pole; and seems to have extended further South than at present. It has numerous peaks, ridges, gaps and fissures, that seemed to disdain the smallest uniformity of figure. Beneath this con fusion is observed an equal regularity. Lofty ridges of mountain, bounded by large cliffs, project for miles into the sea, at nearly equal distances from each other, with a breadth from one to two miles. The bays between them are backed by sandy beaches. These buttresses ap pear to be the southern extremities of the moun tains of Van Diemen's land. De Witt's Isles are tAvelve in number, and of various sizes. The two largest are three or four"], [367, "NEAV SOUTH AVAL ES. 293 miles in circuit. Their sides steep ; but their height is inferior to that of the main. The largest is the lowest. The smaller isles are little more than lumps of rock, of Avhich that called by Captain Cook the MeAv Stone is the south ernmost. Their appearance, like that of the main, bespeaks sterility i but, superior to the greater part of it, they produce a covering of brush; and upon the sides are a few stinted gum trees. A smoke that arose at the back of one of the bights shewed the main to be inhabited. The South Cape is easily to be distinguished from any other projection in its neighbourhood. Besides being the southernmost, it is a promon tory making like a foreland, sloping gradually as it runs towards the sea, Avhere it ends in a perpendicular cliff. About sunset the fresh N. W. Avind died aAvay suddenly ; and a squall from the Westward, of thunder, lightning, and heavy rain, soon car ried them round the South cape, and, by dark, brought them off Storm-Bay, Avhere they hauled to the wind with the sloop's head up the bay, meaning, in the morning, to proceed by this bay to the Derwent river. The night Avas squally, and by day light next morning (the 14th,) it Avas found that the ves sel had drifted across the mouth of Storm-Bay, or Storm-Bay-Passage. Tasman's-head, its East ern point, bore N. E. distant three miles. Being too far to leeAvard to fetch up, and the gale con tinuing, they bore away round Tasman's-head."], [368, "294 HISTORY OF Nothing remarkable was observed about Tas man's head, except two small islands lying off it, at the distance of half or three quarters of a mile; and close to them Avere the tAvo rocks named the Friars. The vegetation on the inner most of the two small islands had been burnt in a manner similar to that on De Witt's isles. Passing Fluted Cape, a fine piece of Basaltes, and Penguin island; they brought up under Cape Frederick Henry, the north point of Ad venture Bay ; and, the Avind bloAving strong off it, and the sloop being light and leAvardly, they bore round Cape Frederick Henry, hauling on the north of it into the bay, and thus go into the Denvent river: but, finding themseh'es likely to lose ground by tacking, they stood into Henshawr's bay, and were greatly surprised to find that, instead of its being a mere shalloAV bight, as laid doA*vn in Hayes's chart, it extended many miles to the nortlnvard. The Avhole noAv bears the mame of Frederick Henry Bay. In this very extensive bay they remained a Aveek, traversing and measuring various parts of its shores. The surrounding country Avas found miserable, presenting little fit even for pasturage, and none good enough for cultivation, except near a shal- Ioav lagoon on the Avest side, on the borders of which Avere se\\*en or eight hundred acres of Ioav ground, of a black mould. Near the best part, Avas a large fresh Avater SAvamp, overgroAvn with reeds and bulrushes."], [369, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 295 In the eATning of the 2 1 st they entered the mouth of the Denvent. In passing betAveen two islands, the heads of the sea-Aveed, named from its size, (Gigantic,) Avere sheAving themselves above the surface in six or eight fathoms Avater. After a very slow course of about tAven?y-six miles to N. W. the Derwent river falls into Frederick Henry Bay, at Avhich place its breadth is two miles and a quarter, and ten fathoms deep. Several hundred yards above the mouth, it is joined by the Storm- Bay-Passage, which union makes an island of that land Avhich is Adventure Bay. This island, the Denvent river, and the Storm- Bay-Passage, Avere the discovery of Mr. Hayes, of which he made only an incorrect chart. That dull river the Derwent, not being affect ed by the tides, its navigation is tedious, parti cularly with a foul A*nnd. It winds through a country of hills and mountains. The hills on the East rise directly from the banks ; but the mountains to the Westward are at the distance of some miles from the water side and have hilly land before them. The hills are thinly set with light timber principally short oaks ; but are co vered Avith thick grass, free from brush-Avood or patches of shrubs. The s,oil is a black mould. deep in the vallies, very shalloAV, and occasion ally a mixture of sand and small stones. As the hills descend with gentle slopes, the vallies be tween are extensive and flat."], [370, "296 HISTORY OF Mr. Bass ascended a mountain In the West three miles from the Avater, and so conspicuous as to be seen from every part of the Derwent, and Avas surprized to find it abound Avith tall o-um-tree timber remarkably straight. The shore on the East side of the river, is covered Avith a good soil, lightly Avooded ; on the West the country rises suddenly into stoney hills so that it is not in general so good as in other places ; a few patches Avere observed of eighty or one hundred acres of excellent land. The strata of cliffs were broken and lay sloping in different directions ; several pieces of petrified Avood, and lumps of stone Avere in veloped, or rather stuck into the matter of the rock, which, although in colour much like a yelloAV tinged clay, yet had the usual rough porous surface peculiar to such substances ; here as in other places, it Avas hard, but did not scintillate Avith steel, and was diA'ided by lines of a still harder iron-tinged stone, into squares and parallograms of various sizes. From one of these intersecting lines, Mr. Bass took a small lump of this ferruginous stone, that seemed to have bubbled up, and to have hardened in the form of an ill-shaped bunch of small grapes. Some of the neighbouring cliffs, for several yards Avere formed into basaltic columns. In crossing one of the heads between tAvo bays Mr. B. met Avitha deep hole in the ground which seemed to have been caused by the fal ling in of the earth. It extended about"], [371, "297 NEAV SOUTH WALES. twenty-tAvo yards by seA*enteen ; its depth tAven ty. And the sides Avere both rather smooth and perpendicular. Alittle surf that Avashed up Avithin it proved a communication with the river, by a narroAv subterraneous passage of from ten to sixteen feet in height, and according to the distance of the hole from the edge of the cliff, about thirty five yards in length ; proceeding on the West side from Point William to Shoal Point, the land is too stony on the hills for cultivation, but proper for pasturage. The val lies are certainly adapted to grain. The land round Prince of Wales Cove is le\\rel, and often clayey. About three hundred acres of open ground, called King George's Plains, seem Avell calculated for the purpose of rearing grape vines. The land at the head of Risdon creek, on the East side, seems preferable to any other on the banks of the Derwent. Herdsman's Cove, above Risdon Creek, has a large tract of good land lying at its head. The country, which is thin of timber, rounds in to grassy hills of gentle ascent. The soil con sists of more brown earth than black mould ; on the sides and tops of the hills, it is stoney. A chain of ponds intersecting the hills afford a con tinual stream of fresh water to the head of the Cove. Not supposing the sloop could proceed above Herdsman's Cove, they Avent up the river in her boat, under the idea that one tide Avould enable them to reach its source ; but they were mista- Q Q"], [372, "298 HISTORY OF ken. When the returning tide met them, the Avater had become fresh ; the stream Avas two hundred and thirty yards in breadth, and in depth three fathoms. It Avas Avedged in betAveen high grassy hills that descended to the river. In their excursion a human voice reached them from the hills; Avhen they landed, carrying one of several sAvans they had shot. Having nearly reached the summit, tAvo females sudden ly appeared some distance before them, each snatched up a basket, and ran off. A man then appeared, and suffered them to approach him Avithout any signs of fear. He accepted the swan with joy and seemed to esteem it of value. He Avas unintelligible to them, even as they were to him, they addressed him in several of the dialects of NeAv South Wales, and some feAV of the most common words of the South Sea Islands. With some difficulty they made him understand they Avished to see his habitation. He pointed over the hills, and proceeded on- Avards; often stopping under pretence of having lost the tract; which made them suspect his aim Avas, to amuse and tire them. Judging, therefore, that in persisting to folloAv him they must lose the remaining part of the flood tide, they parted from him in great friendship. This man Avas short, slight, and of a mid dle age, with a countenance more expressh'e of intelligence than of that ferocity or stupidity Avhich generally characterized the other natives; his features Avere less negro-like, than theirs; and on the top of his head were plaisteves of red earth."], [373, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 299 His hair was either naturally short and close, or had been rendered so by burning, and, although short and stiffly curled, they did not think it woolly.* He Was armed with tAvo ill made spears of solid avoocI. No part of the dress of Mr. Bass or Lieut. Flin ders attracted his attention, except the red silk handkerchiefs round their necks; and their fire arms Avere to him, objects neither of curiosity or fear. This Avas the first man they spoke Avith in Van Diemen's land, and his open deportment led them to form a favourable opinion of the disposition of its inhabitants, and conjecture if the country Avas peopled in the usual numbers, he Avould not have been the only one they Avouldhave met. They found many huts on the shores of the river, of the same bad construction as those of Port Dalryinple, but with fewer muscle-shells lying near them. The natives of this place, draw the principal part of their food from the Avoods ; the bones of small animals Avere nume rous round their deserted fire-places; and the two spears which they saw in the hands of the man Avere similar to those used for hunting in other parts ; and many trees Avere observed to be notched for the purpose of climbing. No canoes Avere ever seen, nor any tree so barked as to ansAver that purpose. And yet all the islands in Frederick- Henry Bay had evi dently been visited. * Mr. Raven, returning to England in the Buffalo, put into Adventure Bay, where this man was seen, and cut off some wool from the head of a native there."], [374, "300 HISTORY OF The feathered tribes Avere similar to those of Port Dalrymple. The flocks of black SAvans even exceeded those they had before met Avith. The most formidable among the reptiles Avas the black snake with venemous fangs, and so much in colour resembling a burnt stick, that a close inspection could only detect the difference. Mr. Bass once, Avith his eyes cautiously di rected tOAvards the ground, stepped over one Avhich Avas lying asleep among some black sticks, and Avould have passed on Avithout observing it, had not its rustling and loud hiss attracted his attention. He resolved to take it alive, and try the ef fect of its bite on a haAvk at that time in the sloop. In the contest, he turned round and bit himself severely ; in a feAV minutes after which he was overcome. His exertions, hoAvever, Avere still vigorous, and Mr. Bass expected, as he began to recover himself they Avould increase ; but in less than ten minutes he died. Having never before knoAvn a snake of this size to be killed by a few very slight bloAvs Avith a stick so rotten as scarcely to bear the Aveight of its own bloAv, he was at a loss to conceive hoAv death so sudden succeeded so much vigour in an animal so tenacious of life. When, three hours afterwards, the skin Avas stripped off, the flesh for some dis tance round the marks of his teeth, Avas found inflamed and discoloured ; thus this reptile prov ed a suicide. Every particular relative to the Denvent river being stated, and all the information of Van"], [375, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 301 Diemen's land related, it may be esteemed highly proper, to point out the manner in Avhich this country and new South Wales appear to differ in their most essential quality, that of their soil. In adjusting the comparative fertility of the soils of Van Diemen's land, and NeAv South Wales, their contrasted dispositions are more pro minent than any inequality in their quantity. They are poor countries ; but, as far as the eye of discovery has yet penetrated in either, the cultivable soil of the latter is found lying in a few distinct patches of varying quality ; while the soil of the former, being more equally spread, those spots of abundant richness, or large Avilds of sterility, are less frequently seen. Although Van Diemen's land seems to possess few or none of those depths of soil Avhich the happiest spots of NeAv South Wales are blessed Avith, it seldom excludes the hopes of its tra veller Avith those tracts which disarm industry. In point of productive soil Mr. Bass gives the advantage to Van Diemen's land. Tavo rivers only, Port Dalryinple and the Derwent, are knoAvn to descend from Van Die men's land; and by Point St. Vincent possibly there may be a third. But tAvo or three rivers bear but a scanty proportion to the island. On the 3d of January they quitted the River Derwent, and proceeded tothe NortfiAvard, coast ing the East side of Frederick- Henry Bay. The figure of the shore, betAveen Avhat is noAv called Basaltes and Cape Pillar, exhibited one of those great works of nature which seldom fails exciting"], [376, "302 HISTORY OF surprise: it was all basaltic. The cape is a vast hi<*>-h wedge, which projects into the sea, sur mounted by lofty columns. After passing Cape Pillar, some islands be came visible to the nortfnvard ; but they did not reach them, as the wind failed. On the next day, they arrived Avithin five miles of one Avhich in its general appearance, bore some resemblance to Furneaux's Islands. On the 7th they saAv Cape Barren Island. They did not pass through the channel, or pas sage, which divides Furneaux's Islands, but discovered Avhy Captain Furneaux named the place the Bay of Shoals. Early on the 8th they neared the islands lying off the Patriarchs; three in number; the largest of which was high, rocky, and barren, With a basis of granite, which, like that of Pre servation Island, laid scattered about in large detached blocks. Landing upon the outermost, Mr. Bass found it Avell inhabited. The various tribes had divided into districts. One part was Avhite with gannets, breeding in nests of earth and dried grass. Petrels and penguins had their under-ground habitations in those parts of the island which had the most grass. The rocks of the shore, and blocks of granite, Avere occupied by the pied offensive shag and common gull; geese, red-bills and quails, lived in common, and the rest Avas appropriated to the seals. Mr. Bass observed Avith surprise, that though the principal herd made off as usual on the first ap proach, yet the males, Avho possessed a rock to 4"], [377, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 303 themselves, Avhere they sat with their wives and progeny, on his drawing near them, hobbled up Avith a menacing roar, and fairly commenced the attack, Avhile the Avives seemed to rest their secu rity upon the superior courage of the males; for, instead of retreating into the Avater Avith con sternation, they only raised themselves upon their fore fins, ready to go, keeping their eye on him. The seal is reckoned stupid ; but Mr. B. noticed many signs of sagacity in them ; and Avas of opinion that, a seal might be trained to be a fisher for man, even as a haAvk is his fowler. Having collected Avhat stock Avas necessary, they stood to the Northward, and on the 12th reached Port Jackson. On an account of this voyage being delivered to the governor, he named the principal discovery, Bass Strait, as a tribute due to. the correctness of that judgment which led to the supposition that the south-Avesterly winds which rolled in on the Western shores, could proceed only from their being exposed to the Southern Indian Ocean. The principal ach-antage likely to arise to the settlement from this discovery was, the expe diting of the passage from the Cape of Good Hope to Port Jackson. But there is a greater advantage to be gained by making a passage through the strait. The major part of the ships that have arrived at Port Jackson have met Avith N. E. winds on opening the sea round the South Cape and Cape Pillar, and have been so retarded by them, that a fourteen days' passage to the"], [378, "304 HISTORY OF port is reckoned to be a fair one, although the difference of latitude is but ten degrees. If by going through Bass Strait, the N. E. winds can be avoided, which would be the case, a Avcek or more Avould be gained by it. This strait presents another advantage. From the. prevalence of the N. E. and easterly winds off the South Cape, many suppose that a passage may be made from thence to the West- Avard, either to the Cape of Hood Hope, or India ; but the fear of the great unknoAvn bight betAveen the South Cape and the S. W. Cape of LeAven's land, lying in about 35\u00b0 South and 1 13* East has hitherto prevented the trial. The strait removes a part of this danger, by presenting a place of retreat, if Avanted; and should the Avind come at S. W. no ship need fear making a good stretch to the W. N. W. There is besides King George the Third's Sound, discovered by Capt. Vancouver, in latitude of 35\u00b0 03' South, and longitude 108\u00b0 12' East. Thus prosperously did the \\royage of Mr. Bass, and Lieut. Flinders, ansAver every purpose the Governor and these gentlemen fondly expected; and to future ages, most probably, -will be left the proper elevation of these navigators' names, in the Temple of Fame; for though the advan tages may now be seen, they will undoubtedly hereafter be beneficially felt."], [379, "305 NEAV SOUTH WALES. CHAP. IX. ritoM the interesting A*oyage of discovery, performed by Mr. Bass and Lieut. Flinders, Ave must return to the proceedings at the colony. In the night of the 24th of January, 1799, the commissary's house was robbed to a considerable amount, as they effected an entrance into the store-room. The governor this month visited Paramatta, and had the misfortune to find the pasture so universally burnt up, that the cattle Avere in Avant of grass ; and, as the drought continued, the maize, it Avas feared, Avould fall very short of the quantity expected ; his Excellency, therefore, ordered a return to be made of the stock of grain, that he might see on Avhat he had to de pend. By the arrival of the Diana, information Avas brought from Norfolk Island, that the produce of Avheat had been greater this harvest than it had ever been before ; but the maize, for Avant of rain, Avas by no means so prolific ; and the ex travagant price paid for wages,' had obliged the settlers to advance the price of Avheat to fifteen shillings a bushel. The number of causes for the recovery of debts, which came before the magistrates, ren- R R"], [380, "306 HISTORY OF dered their business very troublesome; and, as the hiA*entive genius of the convicts, afforded them nearly constant employ as justices of the peace: an order Avas issued, making knoAvn, that pleas of debt must be decided by the court of civil jurisdiction. At the close of January, the criminal court resumed its operations ; Avhen one man Avas found guilty of house-breaking, a second for forgery, aud a third for having shot a native at Botany Bay. The man convicted of forgery Avas recom mended to mercv, and the murderer Avas to re ceive corporal punishment, at the execution of Avhich, many of the natives attended, and be- held it Avith perfect indifference. The man convicted of house-breaking, suffer- ed on the 8th of February, and his exhortations, previous to execution, had scarce ceased, Avhen the court Avas assembled for the trial of another man for the same offence, of Avhich he Avas con victed. This man, Samuel Wright, had before been convicted but received a pardon. On the morning, of the clay noAv appointed for his ex ecution ; he cut his throat, but in so slight a way, as evidently shewed he Avished only to de-\u00bb lay the fulfilment of his sentence, that he might obtain an opportunity of making an escape. A feAV, belonging to a gang of thieves, Avhich had for some time infested the settlements, and plundered to a very large amount, Avere brought to trial before this court, but not being capital ly convicted, some were transported to Norfolk Island, and others flogged. The executions of"], [381, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 307 those sentences, which the offended laAVS of eve ry nation inflicts, are in general esteemed useful as Avarnings to others, but, that these should particularly lose that effect in New South Wales', should by no means excite astonishment as the major part of the inhabitants,had been too conver sant Avith the nature of crimes and punishments, for any example to affect them; particularly while a ready market almost continually offered for the sale of any stolen articles, which must be the case while the sailors of any ships Avere Suffered to come on shore, or any persons permit ted to go on board the ships. About tAvelve o'clock on the night of the 1 1th, the goal at Sydney Avas burnt doAvn ; there Avere above 20 prisoners all ironed, in at the time it Avas first discovered, and it Avas Avith very considera ble difficulty, they Avere brought from the flames. Not the least doubt Avas foran instant entertain ed, but this building Avas set fire to purposely, though nothing could be discovered. In a few days after this fire, some of the Irish convicts with blackened faces, broke into the bouse of one of the missionaries, and not content with rob bing him of all he had, they Avounded him in se veral places. The badness of the harvest, Avhich seemed to indicate a Arery material degree of Avant in the ar ticle of grain, by no means tempted those Avho wished to distil spirituous liquors, to forego their inclinations though so repeatedly forbidden, con sequently former orders on this subject Avere re peated, and several stills seized and destroyed."], [382, "308 HISTORY OF The harvest which had most certainly been very unproductive, offered to the settlers an ex cuse for requesting the loan of grain from the public store for seed, but as too many examples had proved Iioav little good, could result from endeavouring to assist them, they Avere refus ed, for their oavii stock they Avere knoAA'n to have sold for spirits, and in some instances even that lent them for seed before they left the store house door, and for the sole purpose of obtain ing spirits ; Avhich may, with great propriety, be deemed the forbidden fruit of NeAv South Wales ; and the effects of plucking it (if I may be alloAved the simile) Avas again exemplified on the last day of this month, Avhen a* soldier Avas. found dead, sitting on the ground Avith his back reclined against the barracks ; he had, in an in ordinate desire for spirits, taken too copious a draught the preceding night, and unable to reach home, undoubtedly fell doAvn in the posi tion he Avas found, and thus, like Bibo, Avas drunk Avhen he died ; and though, from the si tuation in Avhich he Avas found, he appeared to have resigned his life Avithout a struggle; it af fords to any mind capable of thinking an exam ple at once just and dreadful ; for the mind, thus rendered incapable of retaining a proper sense of the creator, is thus sheAvn not fit to exist. The excessive heat of so long a continuance had very much affected the Avater. Those ponds which still retained any, were so reduced, that the major part of them Avere become most into lerable brackish, and hardly drinkable. This"], [383, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 309 circumstance made it strongly conjectured, that the earth contained a very large portion of salt, as at this time the ponds on the high grounds Avere even very far from fresh. All the Avoods from Sydney to Paramatta were absolutely completely on fire, the trees Avere burnt to the tops, and all the grass destroyed. To counteract if it was possible the vile in tentions of those Avicked Avretches Avho Avere directly or indirectly concerned in setting the gaol on fire, a strong building of stone, Avith substantial Avails, Avas began this month, Avhi-ch Avas well calculated to defeat any future attempt to reduce it by fire. The long dry weather which had prevailed, to the great injury of cultivation, Avas succeeded in the beginning of March by rain for seA-eral days, Avhich much refreshed the gardens then nearly burnt up, and revived at all parts of the island the shockingly perishing vegetation. At the Hawkesbury, a sad accident occured, Avhich, proved destructive to the settlers at that place. The river suddenly, and in the course of a few hours, SAvelled to the height of 50 feet from its usual level, and Avith that rapidity as to carry every thing that stood in the Avay before it. The government store-house, erected at the first set tling in this part, was in the course of this in undation, swept away, with all the provisions it contained. Several inhabitants were taken from the ridges of their houses, by boats only in time to save their lives; for most of the dwellings were inundated, and the Avhole country"], [384, "310 HISTORY OF appeared one extensive lake. A very conside rable number of lh-.e stock, with a great part of the produce of the last harvest, and the house hold property of the people, Avere driven aAvay by the torrent. Fortunate indeed may it be esteemed, only one life Avas lost. This proA-ed a shocking calamity ; as no cause had appeared to indicate an overfloAv of the river, the settlers Avere by no means prepared for such an event. The natives hoAvever foresaAv it, and advised the inhabitants of it, but, not liking to be taught by untutored savages, they neglected their advice, and thus ruinously felt the effects. There Avas no doubt, unperceived by the settlers a very heavy fall of rain in the interior, among the mountains, and, from the parched state of the land for such a long time, it had not been absorbed, but ran down the sides of the hills, sil ling the Ioav grounds, and branches of the river, which, Avas in form strictly serpentine, and could not give a passage to the Avater as fast as it descended. It Avas very generally believed, this violent inundation Avould, hoAvever, prove beneficial to the grounds overfloAved, making them produce with such abundance as to cover the loss sus tained. In a feAV days this collection of Avater found its Avay to the sea, and, the river resumed its usual level, when the settlers began fresh cropping their grounds ; for which purpose they applied to the Governor for seed Avheat, Avhich certainly could not be Avell refused, but an ap plication made at the same time for beds and 4"], [385, "NEAV SOUTH AVA1E5. 311 (\u2022loathing, could not be granted, as the store Avas not rich enough in these articles to afford relief. The Rebecca Avhaler arriving, brought the account of the battle of the Nile, which Avas celebrated by a discharge of the artillery. The goods which arrived in the Rebecca for sale, were not able to be disposed of at Sydney, as a bad harvest had prevented the settlers being in possession of any money. The Nautilus Avas therefore chartered to convey them to Norfolk Island, At/here they might find a market. The Britannia came in to repair, and her suc cess could by no means be complained of, as the had procured nearly 26 tons of oil while absent, and had the Aveather been more favour able, she Avould have taken much more. During March, the criminal court met once, Avhen one man received sentence of death for house breaking ; and another for the same of fence, Avas to be transported for 14 years* The civil court was a week deciding a variety of causes for debt. On the 1st of April the criminal court Avas assembled for the trial of a soldier, Avho a feAV days before stabbed a seaman belonging to the Reliance, that insulted him while on duty as centinal on a wharf at Sydney. As the man died, the soldier was of course tried for murder, but in the defence he made it Avas proved to the court, that it Avas occasioned by the intemper ance of the seaman, in consequence of which he was accordingly found to have committed a justifiable homicide."], [386, "312 HISTORY OF To this effect of intoxication, a few days added another victim, in the person of a female, either the real or pretended Avife of Simon Tay lor, a man Avho had ever been considered one of the very feAV industrious settlers the colony could boast. They had been drinking together, unfortunately, to great excess; and in that state quarrelled, Avhen the unhappy man put an end to her existence. He Avas taken into cus tody directly, and confined for trial. A grub-Avorm Avas found in several parts of the cultivated ground, which did very consider able damage; and at the HaAvkesbury a cater pillar commenced its ravages, on the young grain just as it Avas shooting out of the earth. This circumstance occasioned some delay in soAving that ground Avhich belonged to govern ment. It Avas for some days reported, that the crews of tAvo boats, suffered to goto Hunter's river for a load of coal, had been cutoff by the na tives, the Governor ordered his Avhale-boat to be well armed, and to proceed thither in quest of the boats and their creAvs ; sending in her Henry Hacking, Avho from his past services still retained the Governor's confidence. On his return, the information he gave his Excel lency Avas, that on arriving he found an attempt had been made to burn the lesser boat, Avhich had only three men in her, Avho on leaving Syd-* ney, were provided Avith a musket each; the men Avere, hoAvever, not to be found. Going in search of them, he met with a large body of"], [387, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 313 armed savages. On asking them to tell him what was become of the white men, the natives said, they Avere gone to Sydney; but as he found they had taken away the sails, the men's blankets, and every thing that they had with them, this did not satisfy him ; so be then threatened to fire if they did not inform him directly, and presented his musquet at them. At this they laughed, and said, that if he did not go away, and leave the small boat, he had brought, and the Avhale-boat they Avould spear every Avhite man there, and accordingly poised their spears in a very threatening manner. Hacking again levelled his piece at them, and snapped it Avithout priming, merely to alarm them ; but they on the contrary, became far more noisy and violent than before. Finding an attack Avas certain, he charged Avith buck shot, and ordered them to leave the place ; but, their violence increasing, he at length fired, and four fell, one of whom got up again and ran aAvay ; but as the other three remained on the ground, they were most probably mortally wounded. The Avhole body hoav disappeared, leaving Hacking to retreat unmolested. As our people had been in the constant habit of visiting this river for coals, and Avere always very particular in their conduct to all the natives they met with, treating them with kindness and civility, fortheirbehaviour there was butoneAvay to account. It has ever been universally alloAved, that all savages are under the influence of sud- s s"], [388, "314 HISTORY OF den impulse, Avhich nearly renders it impossible to trust them with security. The men belonging to the boats Avere not heard of for some time, which made it feared they had been murdered, but they very fortu nately reached the settlement in perfect safety. On the 24th of April, the Nautilus returned from Norfolk Island, and Avith her a Spanish ship, a prize to two whalers, captured off Cape Blanco on the coast of Peru. The Spaniard Avas bound from Lima to Guiaquill. A vice-admiralty court being assembled, she Avas condemned as a legal prize, and that part of her cargo, consisting of sugar and flour, Avas in a few days sold by public auction ; but a quan tity of an ardent spirit, similar to the aqua ardente of the Brazils, the Governor would not allow to be sold. This new circumstance in the history of NeAf South Wales, wore the very promising appearance of rendering it pf more consequence than it had previously been ; it indeed proved, that in a Dutch or Spanish war, it might become a place of importance, as it at once offered a reception to the prizes, and a court were they could be con demned, as well as a market for their cargoes. On the 26th, the Norfolk returned from Norfolk Island, with information that the maize harvest had entirely failed, in consequence of the long drought. TheAvant of clothing, during April, stimulated [several experiments to be made, to remedy what indeed .there seemed no other Avay of getting the"], [389, "315 NEW SOUTH AVALES. better of. An end of a linen Avcb, produced from flax of the country, was crossed Avith thread, made of the bark of a tree, and a Aveb from the bark Avas crossed by a thread of avooI. Specimens of these Avere sent to England, and at least served to shew, that with proper tools, and proper hands, much might be clone; nor must be forgot, the discovery of a strata of coal, or the iron ore, which on being smelted, has been found at least equal to the Swedish iron. His Majesty's ship the Buffalo, arrived from England, on the 3d of May. At the Cape of Good Hope she took on board 66 head of cattle, Avhich Avere landed in good condition. She brought various tools and articles of hard - Avare for the colony, but no bedding or cloath ing had been sent out. Mr. Raven commanded this ship, by whose services the colony was much benefitted when in the ship Britannia, and was sent out to replace the Supply, and whose commander, Lieut. Kent, Avas with her officers and crew to be removed to the Buffalo ; and the Governor Avas directed to furnish Mr. Raven a passage to England. This ship, notwithstanding she was named the Buffalo, had at her head a carved figure of a kangaroo, with which the natives appeared very much pleased not expecting to see the ani mals of their country represented by us in wood. The natives still hostile to the settlers, speared one of those at George's river so shock ingly that he died of the Avounds."], [390, "316 HISTORY OF The flatives. of New South Wales, though they retained the greatest ferocity towards our people, were not divested entirely of the softer passions, for occasionally they \"would retire to the Avoods and unbend their morose natures by singing and dancing ; but that savage disposition which is universally found among them, even on these occasions gets superior to every other sensation, and they have absolutely been known to leave these parties of pleasure to satisfy that thirst for revenge for which they are at all times found to be so particularly eminent. On the 16th of May, Simon Taylor Avas brought before the criminal court of judicature for the murder of his wife; and being convicted, he receiA'ed sentence of death, and Avas executed on the 20th, at Paramatta. This man Avas sen sible of his guilt, and admonished the spectators against indulging in drunkenness, which had brought him to his disgraceful end. Another man, Avas adjudged corporal punish ment, and one year's hard labour, for embez zling some live-stock, the property of govern ment, which had been entrusted to his care. He had been one of the convicts Avho were with Capt. Riou in the Guardian, avIio on account of their good conduct before and after the ac cident, received emancipation, and Avere allowed to provide for their own support. Few how ever Avere found to merit this indulgence, and this last act strongly pointed out how requisite it was, for free persons to be sent out from Eng-"], [391, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 317 land to take care of the public live stock, and other purposes of trust. A highway robbery Avas committed on the 23d, betAveen Sydney and Paramatta. Three men rushed from a Avood, and knocking down a young man travelling from the first to the last mentioned town, emptied his pockets of several dollars. However recovering, and find ing only one man, who Avas trying to get his handkerchief from his neck, he had a struggle with him, and the thief not being the strongest, Avas secured and conveyed to Paramatta. A court assembled for his trial ; but the evidence being defective he Avas acquitted. Fresh pork having been for some time received into the store, there were now found six months' salt proAisions on hand ; but Avithout this supply from the produce of the country all Avould have been consumed, and the colony left destitute of animal food, unless an inroad had been made on the live stock. The curing of pork at Norfolk Island A\\'as en couraged by every means ; but the casks in Avhich the salt meat Avas sent from England Avere so Aveak by their arrival that not one in twenty Avas fit for that use again. Had any timber, for this use been found, a supply of hoops and salt pans would have been wanting ; and, if not cured in the winter season, and the method observed by Capt. Cook which was now used at Norfolk Island, it remained doubtful Avhether it could be carried to any serviceable extent."], [392, "318 HISTORY OF Fresh pork being raised in consequence of the bad crops produced by the late harvest, afforded some relief to those avIio had materially suffered, the commissary Avas, at the close of this month, directed to pay only the former price, of nine- pence per pound. On a revieAV of the public stores respecting salt provision, it was found necessary to make a small reduction in time, to avoid a greater. It Avas therefore ordered, that the rations should be delivered as follows to each man weekly, Beef ----- 5 pounds, or Pork 3 pounds, Wheat - - - - 12 pounds, Sugar - - - 6 ounces, and this deduction Avas only to continue till the arrival of a store-ship with salted provisions. And to such men as Avcrc entitled, Avas issued as much as blue gurrah (or East India bunting) and thread as Avould make a frock and troAvsers, a proportion was also delivered to the women and children. These gurrahs were brought from In dia in the speculative cargos to this country, and were at last found useful to cover the absolute nakedness of too many people. The arrival of the Buffalo, enabled the Gover- nor at length to inform those people convicted in Ireland, and transported to New South Wales, that he had received a statement of the senten ces of those brought in the Queen ; and an as surance, that the lists of those sent out since should be forwarded by the next vessel Avhich sailed for the colony."], [393, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 319 The Diana and Eliza Avhalers came in to resit, and refresh on the 2d of June. Each had pro cured upAvards of tAventy-five tons of spermaceti oil since they left port, and had seen the Britan nia, Avhich had still better success, having one hundred and ten tons of oil on board. On the 3d the Indispensible sailed on a fishing voyage, after having been careened and repaired, in the Cove. The masters of the Avhalers, asserted that ships properly fitted for the variable weather they are liable to meet Avith on the coast, must most un doubtedly succeed. In the evening on the 4th, the Aveather be came tempestuous, which continued for three days blowing a heavy gale from the SoutliAvard, with a deluge of rain ; several public buildings, erected Avith great labour, Avere very much da maged ; among others Avas the toAver of the new mill at Sydney, Avhich Avas so much in jured, that it was found necessary to take the whole doAvn. This gale subsiding, returned about the mid dle of the month, blowing with increased vio lence, and attended with another deluge of rain. Its effects were more destructive than the for mer, doing great injury to various public and private buildings. One side of the church tower Avas destroyed, the clock Avas, Iioav ever, fortunately saved. The government house at Paramatta, which Avas nearly fi nished, received very material injury, but Avas not entirely destroyed. A man, crossing a"], [394, "320 HISTORY OF gully betAvixt Sydney and Paramatta, was car ried aAvay by the torrent and drowned. The cattle suffered much, and some of both the pub lic and private stock perished. The storm did so much damage, that the set tlement Avas throAvn back at least 12 months in those Avorks, Avhich avouUI have been shortly completed. The Aveather had never been so se vere as at the beginning of this month. The set tlement had from the fires of the summer, and the floods and gales of the Avinter, suffered very considerably. In addition to these, great in convenience arose from the late unproductive harvest, as Avell as from an exhausted store in the articles of clothing and bedding, the hostile disposition of the natives, and the absence of morality, honesty, aud industry in the colonists. Every exertion Avas made to redress the mis fortunes suffered by the late tempest, and it Avas hoped they would be surmounted during the present year. The erection of the stone prison at Sydney, Avas found very expensive, the Governor therefore called a meeting of the officers, inhabitants, and landholders, and pro posed a portion to be furnished by each, of money, as Avell as labour ; which Avas agreed to by them ; and that building Avas carried on at their expense, the public stores only furnishing the iron Avanted. On the 29th, the Albion arrived from Eng land, having made the quick passage of only three months and 15 days. She brought 900 tierces of salt pork, and some dispatches. 3"], [395, "321 NEW SOUTH WALES. Mr. Ebor Bunker, avIio commanded the Al bion, had been at Port Jackson in the William and Ann transport, and Avas now commissioned by her OAvners, Messrs. Champions, to give the Avhale fishing on the coast a fair trial. For this purpose the ship Avas fitted out liberal, with every store for her own use, and every com fort for her people. On the 2d of July, a horrid murder Avas ef fected on Mr. Samuel Clode, one of the mis sionaries from Otaheite. This act of barbarity was committed at the brick-fields, in the hut of one Thomas Jones. His brains Avere beat out Avith an axe, and his throat cut so as nearly to seA*er the head from the body, Avhich Avas then thrown into a saAvpit full of Avater, and covered Avith bushes. Here it remained only until the following morning, Avhen it Avas discoA'ered by a labouring man, avIio Avent to get his hoe ; which, to prevent being stolen, he had been in the habit of hiding every night in the saAvpit. Suspicion falling upon four persons, they were apprehended ; and the criminal court be ing convened, three, Thomas Jones, (a soldier,) his wife, and John Albury, Avere, on the clearest evidence, convicted of the murder, and sen tenced to suffer death. It came out on the trial, that 101. Avhich Jones was indebted to Mr. Clode, tempted him to effect his destruction. For this purpose he told that unfortunate gentleman, that if he Avould call at his hut in the evening lie Avould pay him.

They Avere convicted on the 4th, and exe cuted on the 6th, on the spot Avere the murder was committed. The house was then pulled down and burnt, and the bodies of the tAvo men Avere hung in chains near the place ; the avo man's Avas delivered for dissection to the sur- geons. To form a just idea of the shocking aban doned state of the settlement at this time, it Avill only be requisite to peruse the folloAving orders, that were issued. \" From the late increased number of noctur nal robberies, there is much reason to suspect that the petty constables, and divisional Avatch men are either extremely negligent in the per formance of their duty, or that they suffer themselves to be prevailed on by the house breakers to be less vigilant than that duty re quires, and to connive at their depredations on the inhabitants. A continuance of this unpar donable remissness upon their part must dispose the more respectable inhabitants to believe them partakers with the theives. It is, there fore, hereby particularly recommended by the GoAernor to every officer in the colony, as they"], [397, "323 NEAV SOUTH WALES. value the security of their property, to give their utmost assistance to those immediately concerned in the executive part of the civil police, in putting as speedily as possible, a stop to so very great an evil. It is also particularly recommended to the principal inhabitants of the towns of Sydney and Paramatta, that they select a feAV of the most respectable of their number, in each division of these toAvns, whom they may authorize to consider of the most ef fectual means of detecting the robber, and bringing them to trial ; Avhether by such reAvards as they may be enabled to offer, or by small divisional patroles for the night service, and avIio shall take that duty by turns, and be under the immediate direction of a reputable inhabit ant, of their oavii choice, or an officiating con stable selected from among the most sober and vigilent of that description of persons.\" Proposals Avere to be sent to the Judge Advo cate's office, and a bench of magistrates Avere either to approve or alter them. This order Avas published on the 2d, and next day the folloAving appeared : \" The continual complaints which are made of the conduct of the female convicts require the most rigid and determined discipline with such characters, who to the disgrace of their sex, are far Avorse than the men, and are gene rally found at the bottom of every infamous transaction that is committed in the colon}*.

The first of the orders was attended Avith ef fect ; for in a few days, several avIio had been out of their time, were employed only in ai an dering from one district to another, Avithoutany honest means of getting bread, were appre hended, and being examined, were ordered to labour.

The middle of July was occupied in taking arj account of the inhabitants of the settlements, the land in cultivation, and live-stock on hand, for the purpose of forwarding to England with the next dispatches, The number of acres in wheat amounted to 4393, and in maize to 1440, or thereabouts. A settler at the Flawkesbury, avIio had been a convict, had more land in cultivation than any individual in that district, having 46 acres in wheat, and five in maize. A man, left by a Mr. Hogan, in the care of some land bought by him in 1796, had noAv 200 acres in wheat, and the Commissary, Mr. Palmer, had an agent who, by great attention, had got upwards of 290 acres in wheat. Hogs were still numerous in this district, notwithstanding the great slaughter amongst them of late for the store. The settlers had in- deed few sheep, but nearly 250 goats. The ground in cultivation Avas considerably less in the neighbourhood of Paramatta, but the settlers were also proportionably feAV. The number of settlers at the Hawkesbury being nearly 200, and at Paramatta only 100. The Avidow of a superintendant had 50 acres in Avheat, and 23 in maize.

In the district of Paramatta, the total of the live stock Avere 332 sheep, 903 goats, and 428 hogs. The land in cultivation about Sydney, Avas very inconsiderable, and the live stock, exclu sive of the officers and free settlers, Avas only 38 sheep, 292 goats, and 362 hogs, the convict settlers amounted to 70 only. Thus the agricultural affairs of the country were by no means in a contemptible state, and Iioav A'ery far superior must they have been, had the convicts and other labourers used any thing like decent industry.

The Hillsborough transport arrived from Eng land on the 26th of July, Avhen she sailed, the number of male convicts on board, amounted to three hundred, but the gaol fever, breaking out among them on the passage, ninety-five died Avhich number Avas encreased by six more within a feAV days after they landed. The erection of the stone gaol proceeding too sloAvly, the constables of the divisions of Sydney Avere ordered to inform the inhabitants of their divisions, that the)' must furnish from each, viz. from King's, Nepean's, Banks's, and Mas kelyne's divisions, as Avell as from the Brick fields, five men each day and a Avatchman to attend them. These Avere to be relieved by the same number every day, as long* as the Avork should require such assistance. In the beginning of August the Governor employed several days taking an excursion from Prospect Hill to the settlement near George's river. Having formerly surveyed the country from Paramatta to that river, he determined to trace it in another direction, and had the satis faction of finding, that it Avas equally favourable to cultivation with that before taken notice of. The distance from the hill Avas about five miles, over very fine ground, adapted for cultivation and pasturage, and equal to any part of NeAV South Wales. The settlers placed there Avere do ing very well, and had not been troubled for"], [402, "328 HISTORY OF some time by the natives. His Excellency noAv proceeded doAvn the river to Botany Bay, and walked from there to Sydney, the space be tween which places is nothing but barren and uneven ground, covered very generally Avith flowering heath. In a few days after his return, the Norfolk arrived from the NortliAvard. The Governor being anxious to obtain some information relative to the coast Northward of Port Jackson, and more particularly of two openings laid down by Capt. Cook, the further most North of which he called Hervey Bay, and seemed to lie in latitude 24\u00b0 36' South, Lieut. Flinders, Avas directed by his Excellency to proceed in the Norfolk NortliAvard, and exa mine them Avith ail the accuracy six Aveeks Avould suffer him. The Norfolk Avas manned from the tAvo king's ships, and Lieut. Flinders took with him a native named Boug-ree, Avho Avas remarkable for his good disposition. To guard against accidents, they Avere supplied Avith eleven Aveeks provi sions, and the vessel sailed on the 8th of July on this service to the Northward, and Lieut. Flinders on his return delivered to the Gover nor the substance of the folloAving particular and very interesting account : \"Soon after seven in the morning of the 9th they sounded, Avithout finding ground at fifteen fa thoms, at the distance of half a mile from a reef of black rocks. There were two Ioav and dan-"], [403, "329 NEAV* SOUTH WALES. gerous rocks, lying between three and four miles from this point. Sounding again they found ground Avith ten fathoms of line, balsa mile from shore, abreast Cape HaAvke. Tavo hills noticed by Capt. Cook stood on the Cape, and Avere covered Avith brush- Avood, and the strata lay many degrees from hori zontal. From the Cape the coast falls back, forming a double bay. The land Avhich Avas low, rose gradually, ridge over ridge inland, which made the country look pleasant from the sea, though the trees were very small indeed. In the morniug of the 10th they discovered the vessel had been carried by a current conside rably to the SoutliAvard, and at noon found a difference of thirty-three miles. The sloop Avas this morning found to haA-e a bad leak, Avhich admitted Avater so fast that one pump Avas obliged to be kept constantly at Ayork. Its coming on suddenly Avas considered not to haA-e been occasioned by any strain. But from Avhatever cause it arose it was of a serious nature, as the maize with Avhich the sloop had been loaded continually choaking up the pumps. The Solitary Isles came in sight on the 1 1th. Lieut. Flinders intended to have landed on them, but no inducement presented itself; as on them he saAv neither a seal or bird. They appeared covered Avith brush; the colour of the rock, and general appearance, much resembled the small islands off Tasman's-head. At noon the country still continued to have the same irre gular appearance; but running along the shore u u"], [404, "330 HISTOftY C*F it evidently greAV Avorse, having a still greater ten dency to sand. The several projections of land which appeared, often presented the appearance of openings behind; which hopes they Avere in clined to entertain, as Capt. Cook passed thi* part in the night Early in the afternoon a small island opened from a Ioav rocky point, behind Avhich a small river run to the S. W. but breakers appeared to extend nearly across the entrance. A peaked hill, standing four or five miles in land, and more conspicuous than usual Avas seen soon after three o'clock P. M. Before five, the A*essel stood in for an opening, and soon after dusk she anchored in tAvo and a half fathoms, of water on a hard bottom of sand. The objects in vieAv inducing Lieut. Flinders to enter this bay Avere, that he might by day-light run along the remaining part of the coast, Avhich Capt. Cook had only sailed by in the night, and to seek a place of safety, should the Avind fail him on his return. The leak in the sloop was also a material inducement ; for should the place prove to be of consequence enough to expend a feAV days in examining, and a place offer for laying her on shore, he meant to get it stopped. Examining this bay in his boat, he found it very shalloAV ; and the North point of the en trance proved a projecting spot of sandy ground. Returning to the sloop at noon, he landed on the South head to observe the latitude. The sun being half an hour from the meridian alloAV ed him time to examiue three huts standing ia."], [405, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 331 a circular form, at a little distance. The frame was composed of strong tendrils of the vine, crossing each other in all directions, bound by Strong grass at the intersections. The roof Avas bark, resembling that of the Tea-tree at Port Jackson, and so laid on as to keep out both wind and rain. The entrance Avas by a small avenue projecting from the periphery of the cir cle, and not leading directly into the hut, but turned to prevent the rain beating in. The height of the under part of the roof Avas about five feet, and had collected a coat of soot, from fires having been made in the middle of the huts. One Avas a double hut Avith two recesses under one entrance, and large enough to contain fif teen people. Bong-ree observed they Avere much superior to any huts made by savages Avhich he had ever seen. He brought aAvay a small hand basket, made of some leaf, capable of holding two or three quarts of Avater. White cockatoos and parroquets Avere hoav \u2022geen, and a crow Avith a note remarkable short and siasty. Pelicans, gulls and red-bills, frequented the shoals, and the country Avas 6andy Avherever landed. The palm nut tree found here Avas the third kind mentioned by Capt Cook as produced on the Eastern coast of New South Wales ; and as Bong-ree, Avho Avas acquainted with the country as far as Port Ste phens, never saw it before, this Avas probably one of the most Southern situations in which it grew. The nuts were seen about the fire-places of the natives ; the lower end of Avhich had been suck- 1"], [406, "332 HISTORY OF ed, which method Avas afterwards practised, on procuring some ripe ones. The taste though pleasant at first, left an astringency behind, that by no means tempted a second trial. The eat able part of the nut Avas so small, as not to be worth sucking out from the fibres. Their size Avas that of a walnut ; Avithin the outer skin Avas a hard shell like that of the cocca nut; and Avith in this, two, or more almond-like kernels. The nut, Avhen taken from the tree, Avas an assem blage of these kernels set into a cone, varying in the size of a man's fist, to that of a melon. The size, and indentations on the surface, on a first view looked much like the outAvard form of the bread-fruit. The stem of the tree Avas short, and none Avere observed to be eighteen inches in diameter. The branches did not ra mify into tAvigs, but preserved their size to the extreme, where the leaves Avere produced sur rounding the fruit. One or tAvo smaller branches struck off from the main branch, and pro duced their leaves in the same Avay, Avithout fruit. The height of the tree altogether might be from fifteen to tAventy-five feet. Suckers or branches of all sizes Avere seen shooting out below those bearing fruit, groAving doAvmvards along the stem, Avhich entered the ground and formed roots, as Avell as supporters to the tree. This bay not appearing to deserA'e a paticular examination, Lieut. Flinders got under weigh at one o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th. On Saturday the 1 3th, at ten in the morning, they Avere three miles from Cape Bryon, and the"], [407, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 333 peak of Mount Warning just appeared over it. Having hauled more off the shore, to avoid the reef lying off Point Danger, on the following morning they Avere at a great distance from land. They now steered West for a large space, Avhere no land Avas visible, and, perceiving breakers off the South point of the opening, found this Avas Moreton Bay. Passing betAveen these breakers and Point Look-out, they got ground in twenty fathoms Avater. As they drew nearer, there ap peared to be a large extent of Avater in the open ing; but Lieut. Flinders suspected there Avas no passage for a vessel in the direction he Avas steering. The country to the sea-Avard Avas A-ery sandy. Cape Moreton Avas at dusk only distant tAvo miles ; and the highest Glass-House, presented itself over the distant land. Two hummocks resembling haycocks, distinct from any other land, opened soon after to the South- Avard. * The vessel Avas now hauled in round Cape Moreton, to go into Glass-House Bay. They steered West till eight o'clock, when having little Avind, and that from the SoutliAvard, they dropped anchor. Weighing again the next morning, the 14th, they Avorked near the East ern shore till noon. While Avithin a mile of the shore, ten natives Avere distinctly seen, half of whom Avere most probably Avomen, as they kept behind the others. The men made many gestures to our people. One had a green branch in his hand, n ilich he waved from the ground on one side of"], [408, "334 HISTORY OF him to the other, and some of them ran into the Avater occasionally, and beat the surface with sticks. They appeared to be friendly, using the same Avoid in calling as that made use of by the Port Jackson natives, and appeared very desirous indeed, that the vessel should pro ceed up the bay. In the evening Lieut. Flinders anchored in eleven fathoms Avater, tAvo miles from shore. On Tuesday, the 16th, at day-light, they weighed to turn up the bay. In their progress, they found various depths of Avater ; and, per ceiving an opening in the Western land, Lieut. Flinders Avished to anchor near it, but shoal water prevented him. At a quarter past eight in the morning, hoAvever, they cast anchor in three fathoms of Avater. Lieut. Flinders Avent in his boat tOAvards the opening, taking Avith him Bong-ree the nati\\*e. As they approached the sandy point on the East side of the opening, some dogs came doAvnupon the beech, and shortly several nathres appeared, carrying fishing nets over their shoulders. They lay upon their oars some time, conversing with them by signs, aud repeating the Avoids which they made use of. As they seemed to be friendly, Bong-ree resolved to visit them ; and seeing nothing among them but the pieces of fireAvood, which these savages usually carry about with them, the boat Avas backed in, Avhen he jumped on shore, naked, and as unarmed as themselves."], [409, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 335 He soon made an exchange of the yarn belt from his Avaist, for a fillet of kangaroo hair. The muskets were kept at hand in the boat to guard against any treachery ; every thing seeming to go on well, the natives appearing ra ther shy than othenvise, Lieut. Flinders joined his companion, taking his gun Avith him. By making friendly signs, laying doAVn the gun, and offering a Avoollen cap, he Avas suffered to approach, and one took the cap; but Avhen Lieut. Flinders made him understand he expected his net bag in return, he let him know he must first give him his hat. This hat, made of white fila* ments of the cabbage-tree, seemed to excite the attention of the whole party. As the hat Avas not given to the native, he came forward, first throwing the cap ou the bank behind him, to secure it, and seemed very anxious for the hat or gun, if not both. Every thing Avas, however, still carried on very ami cably ; and Lieut. Flinders, Avith Bong-ree, made slowly towards the boat, but turned again, as he found they pressed too close after them. One native laughing, and talking as Avell as he could to Lieut. Flinders, tried to take his hat with a hooked stick, Avhich, on being discovered caused a laugh. Behind another was stretching his arm to the same object, but fear preA7ented his coming near enough to reach it. When our people got into the boat, and shoved her into deep water, they Avere not pleased, but tried to induce them to land again. Finding this not succed, one threw his piece of sire-Avood"], [410, "336 HISTORY OF at them ; as it fell short the matter Avas treated as a joke. Another noAv ran into the Avater, and threw his, which likeAvise fell short: he then took the hooked stick, and slipped off the h'ook, which Avas only tied on, sheAved a spear, with Avhich he ran up to his middle in Avater, and threAV ; it passed over the center of the boat, but touched no one. In consequence of this unprovoked attack, Lieut. Flinders snapped his gun at the man Avho threAV the spear ; the flint being Avet, it mis sed fire ; but as the offender still stood in the water with his back toAvards them, and calling to his companions, Lieut. Flinders again tried, and the gun again missed fire. During this transaction, the greater part of the natives Avere observing Lieut. Flinders' mo tions Avith much unconcern. On the third trial, howeA-er, it Avent off. The man in the water fell flat, as did every individual among them; but those on the shore rose directly, and scram bled aAvay, some upright and others upon their hands and feet. One of the people in the boat then fired among them, and they fell again upon their faces; but, as none were killed, they all got up, and made off behind a bank. The man in the Avater noAv rose up, and proceeded the same way, but his progress was sloAver than the others, he stooped much, carrying one hand be hind him on his back. From whence it Avas thought he had been Avounded, he continually looked o\\*er his shoulder, perhaps expecting to see a spear sticking in his back. Bong-ree said"], [411, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 337 another native had his arm broke by the second shot. This Avanton attack, which obliged the party to fire on these people, in order to maintain that superiority which they esteemed it requi site to assert, Lieut. Flinders thought might be the means of preventing future mischief, by giving them an extensive idea of his poAver, and thus deter them from any future attempt in his intercourse with them. For as he had to exa mine this ba}', and the leak Avas to be stopped, it became probable they Avould often meet ; and he was satisfied of the great influence which the awe of a superior power has on savages, to Create respect. With this view he fired at a man among the trees, Avho being above two hundred yards off, certainly esteemed himself safe. One of the balls grazed the bank in a line for him, but if it took effect, it could not be seen. They then landed to bring away the nets, which it Avas sup posed the natives in their flight had forgot to take with them. On viewing the bank to ascertain the position of the natives, he saAv se veral running various Avays among the trees, with an apparent design of coming round on them ; and, not knowing their force or numbers, Lieut. Flinders ordered the native and a man mho had landed to return to the boats, as no nets were left as expected. The Ioav sandy point where this business hap pened, obtained for it the name of Point Skir- X x"], [412, "338 HISTORY OF mish; they afterwards proceeded up the opening, which proved to be a river leading to the Glass- House peaks. These peaks stood on the Ioav flat ground, much Avithin the mountains, and as far as could well be judged, had a volcanic appearance, as a quantity of pumice-stone Avas found lying at the high-Avatcr mark on the shore, Avhere Lieut. Flinders landed to mark the nature of the country, not being able to pro ceed in his boat. Among the most common trees there Avas one differing from any at Port Jackson. The leaves Avere of a dark hue, aud bore resemblance to the pine. The Avood on being cut smelt of turpentine, which exuded where the bark had been Avounded. The external part Avas white, but the body Avas of a reddish broAvn, the bark resembling that of the iron bark-tree at Port Jackson. The blue gum, she-oak, and cherry tree of Port Jackson Avere also here, and one Avith the leaAres of the gum tree, but Avith the soft bark of the tea tree, and the soil it greAv in Avas sandy. Fearing the natives might surprize them among the trees, they did not go far from the beach.. Several huts, from 1 2 to 15 feet in length, Avere standing near each other. They appeared like a covered arcliAvay, rounded at the end. The roofs, and Avay of securing them, were nearly the same as those in Shoal Bay ; hut these had no curved entrance to keep out the weather, nor Avas the hut smaller in that part than elseAvhere, the sides and roof Avere equally"], [413, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 339 calculated to shelter the inhabitants from a storm. In one of them was found a small light shield, aud in another a net, Avhich had a bag to it, knotted and made in the same Avay as it Avould haA*e been if made by an European Avorkman. Returning to the sloop they passed a dry shoal lying at the entrance of the river, the deep channel into which Avas betAveen this shoal and Point Skirmish, where they found from three to six fathoms Avater. Before he left the sloop, Lieut. Flinders gave directions to examine a part on the starboard side, Avhere he suspected the leak to be ; and on his return found it to have been occasioned by the starting of a plank from the timber near the keel. The caulker had filled it up with oakum from the inside, since which she had made but little water. From the situation in Avhich the sloop lay, the bay had not any appearance of closing round, but seemed to promise a large river at its head, and a communication Avith Moreton Bay. At three in the afternoon they got under weigh to proceed up this river, with a light air from the NortliAvard, standing to the Southward till dark, at which time they anchored three miles from the shore, in five fathoms, on a soft muddy bottom. On Wednesday the 17th, at day-light, the sloop got under weigh, Avith a Southerly breeze, as long as the tide lasted, and anchored about ten o'clock, a mile and a half from a"], [414, "340 HISTORY OF point remarkable for its red cliffs. To the WestAvard of this point, the latitude Avas 27\u00b0 16' 9.5\" South. The rocks Avere stone, impregnated with iron, Avithsome pieces of granite and crys tal about the shore. From this point they made to a green head land, two miles\" Westward. The reefs off this head appeared a truly remarkable miniature of those that form a barrier to the North shore of NeAv South Wales. In a hut standing- on the side of the head, they found a net fourteen fathoms long, Avitii meshes larger than any English seine, and of much stronger tAvine; its depth was, hoAvever, much less, being only three feet, and at each end Avas a stick of nearly the same length, pointed at the end. On the shoal near the hut Avere several semicircular inclosures, made Avith sticks and tranches, set and intenvoven so close, that no fish could pass. The net Lieut. Flinders sup posed was to be placed across the semicircle at high Avater, and thus secure the fish that might get Avithin the inclosure, until the tide should leave them dry. He brought aAvay the net, as a proof of the ingenuity of these natives, and left them in return a hatchet, and that they \u2022might learn the great use of it, he cut doAvn se veral branches, and laid them near the hut. Some avoocI, which the crew at high water collected for their fire, proved to be cedar of a fine grain.

During the afternoon they made a further progress with the sloop till night, when they anchored, and the following morning got under weigh Avith a flood tide, and a gentle breeze from the Northward. They shortly passed tAvo islands three or four miles each in circuit. The Nor thernmost Avas the largest, well covered with avoocI.

They seemed to have long poles or spears with Avhich they appeared to be paddling, all shifting their hands at the same instant. About tAventy of them Avere counted, and Avere thought to be coming on with much resolution, so the creAv prepared for the event Avhatever it might be. The Norfolk Avas put under easy sail, her decks cleared and each man had a number of musquet-balls, pistol-balls, and buck-shot, to be used as distance might seem to ren der requisite ; as it Avas determined not one should escape if they made an attack. Thus prepared, they bore tOAvards them, but finding at length that notwithstanding all their Ot? O exertions they did not approach any nearer the vessel ; to their great surprize they discovered that instead of being in canoes to attack them, they Avere standing on a flat, Avhich surrounded the third island, driving fish into their nets, and that they in fact, had only tAvo canoes among them. They stood all in a line, splashing the water Avith sticks, first on one side and then on the other. This apparently hostile array thus proved to be only a feAV men fishing, and they were so peaceable that on the vessel's approach they sunk their canoes on the flat, and retreat ing to the island made their fires.

On standing near the South part of the shoal which seemed to surround the island that the natives had retired to, one came doAvn abreast the sloop, making gestures, and running back- Avards and forwards, but little attention Avas paid him, Lieut. Flinders intending to get as far up the bay as possible while the tide served. At midnight he anchored as the deep water iioav became contracted to a narrow channel. The next day Lieut. Flinders landed on an island in his passage. Recent footsteps of dogs, were numerous on the beach, but traces of men but just visible: there Avere several fire-places, and various other proofs of the island being vi sited. This island Avas three miles in circumfer ence. The central part of which Avas higher than the skirts, and covered Avith sine mould. On the S.

E. sides it was- low and sandy, and the palm nut-tree flourished here. These nuts it Avas supposed formed the principal induce ment for the natives to visit this island ; parti cularly as there Avas abundant testimony under the trees that they did not fall off and rot. They found some boughs ranged to keep off the wind ; and from the fire-places which they were to de fend, it was thought not less than five or six na tives had made this their residence, but as they"], [418, "344 HISTORY OF met Avith no huts regularlyconstructed, it was probably only a temporary one. Black and the white cockatoos, the beautiful lilac-headed parroquet, and the bald-headed mocking bird of Port Jackson, Avere seen, but no marks of resident quadrupeds, rats excepted, could be discovered. Beyond this island the bay Avas contracted in to a river, of considerable Avidth, but it appear ed so shoal, and so difficult of access, that Lieut. Flinders gaA-e up all idea of pursuing it, particu larly as the winds Avere adA-erse : so he returned on board, Avith the intention of visiting the ri ver near the Glass-House peaks, and there to lay the sloop on shore, and procure a supply of Avater. The following clay passed in endeavouring to get into the river, Avhich, from the pumice-stone found on its shores, Avas called Pumice-Stone River. And at sun-set they anchored within tAvo miles of its entrance. On the morning of Sunday the 21st, Lieut. Flinders went in his boat to examine the river, aud its entrance. On searing Point Skirmish, several natives came doAvn towards the boat un armed, and, by friendly offers of their girdles and nets, Avould fain have pursuadcd him to land; but as he could not be satisfied they had not some treacherous design, or whether their being unarmed arose from any confidence they might be inclined to place, he did not choose to trust them, so proceeded in his examination of the river."], [419, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 345 Notwithstanding he found the shoals very intricate ; yet, as there Avas depth of Avater enough for the sloop, he determined to get her in. On these shoals several pelicans Avere seen ; and they did not go far before they Avere salut ed Avith the Avell-known note of the swan, Avhich bird now took so much of their attention, that before they left the river eight Avere killed. Having hoav nearly reached the end of their excursion, two nath'es came to the beach, and Avere very desirous they should land. Being dry sand and at a distance to be safe from the reach of spears, they put ashore on it. Lieut. Flin ders taking up his gun to fire at tAvo red-bills, at the same time, the natives alarmed ran to the Avoods ; Bong-ree folloAving they returned, Avhen he made an exchange for their hair fillets and belts, giving them a Avoollen cap in return, and came to the boat for a piece of cloth and some biscuit, to make the exchange more equal. During this time Lieut. Flinders Avas on shore Avith a gun, to cover him in case they behaved improperly. On his advancing to them, they Avere very violent for him to keep at a distance, and would by no means suffer him to approach without laying down his gun. Though this place Avas six miles from Point Skirmish, it was evident that the fame and dread of fire arms had reached it, and undoubtedly it must have been considerably increased by the shoot ing of the swans, which they Avitnessed. Returning clown the river, they Avere hailed by a man on the West side, with a spear in hi* Y Y"], [420, "346 HISTORY OF hand ; and tAvo Avomen and several children be ing with him argued much against any preme ditated hostility. The Avomen and children re tired on the vessel approaching the shore; but they were observed to be peeping from the bushes. The man was very anxious for the gun being laid doAvn, calling out \" Avoo-rah, Avoo-rah,\" and seemed delighted when it Avas complied Avith ; but he did riot appear to have heard many particulars of their dangerous poAver, for on pointing a musquet towards him, he by no means appeared sensible of any danger to him self. As he Avould not quit his spear, and night was approaching, they did not land, but backed in to throAV him a stocking, which they sheAved him might be Avorn as a cap, and then sailed on. Monday the 22d Avas taken up in getting the sloop in the river, Avhich Avith some difficulty was accomplished, having to find out a channel through a number of shoals. Having found apro per place to lay the sloop on shore, on Thursday the 25th, they completed stopping the leak, and \u2022was again in a condition to prosecute the excur sion to the Glass-House peaks. A few hours before high Avater on the 23d, he attempted to get some sAvans, but met with none but could fly. He saAv several large fish, or animals that came up to the surface of the water to bloAV, like the porpoise, or seal, they did not spout, and had no dorsal fin. The head resembled the bluff-nosed hair seal, but their size was larger than any Lieut. Flinders had seen- He fired three balls into one, and Bong-ree"], [421, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 347 threw a spear in another ; both sunk, and were not seen again. These animals Avere supposed to be sea-lions, and Avere observed no Avhere but in this ri\\*er. Not finding fresh Avater to fill up their casks, they dug a hole in a low situation a hundred yards inland. The first foot Avas fine vegetable earth, mixed Avith a little black sand ; the three folloAving feet were different layers, of sand, and then they came to the hardened black clay of which the rocks on the banks Were formed. Here the Avater began to ooze in at the sides of the hole, which in the course of six-and-thirty hours Avas filled, but with very thick Avater. Fortunate, hoAvever, there Avas no occasion to make use of it ; as one of the people, rather in cautiously strayed into the avoocI, and met with a deep hole containing some very good Avater, and Avith this they completed their stock, * While they Avere making up the sails, which had been loosed in the morning to dry, three natiA-es appeared on the beach, a little distance from the vessel, unarmed as before. Bong-ree went to them in his usual manner, but they Avould not suffer Lieut. Flinders, or indeed any of the party to come near them, Avithout previously lay ing doAvn their guns. Yarn caps, pork, and biscuit, were given them, all of which they took, with apparent delight, and made signs for Bong-ree to go Avith them, that they might give him girdles and fillets, for his head and arms. While their visitors were only two, the natives seemed lively, dancing and singing; but, the"], [422, "348 HISTORY OF number of Avhite men increasing to eight, they became alarmed and seeming to look Avith a jea lous eye on the shot belt Lieut. Flinders Avore, -which they undoubtedly must have thought to be some Aveapon. To restore their confidence, he gave it one of the people to carry aAvay ; but this he thought wrong, as it might tend to make them suspicious of every thing they saw, and thus destroy their friendly intercourse. By this belt they certain ly recognised Lieut. Flinders as the person who sired on them before, and Avere evidently desir ous that he should keep at a much greater dis tance than any other person. Three of the sail ors, Avho Avere Scotch, attempted to dance a reel, but made a very bad business of it, Avhich the natives seemed to vieAv either Avithout amuse ment or curiosity. Finding at length they could not persuade the natives to visit the sloop, they parted Avith them in a very friendly manner. On Thursday the 25th, having weighed an chor, and proceeded up the river in the afternoon, as they might be nearer the Glass-House peaks, as he noAv intended to visit them.

The next morning Lieut. Flinders took the boat up a small branch which seemed to lead to wards the peaks, but afterwards, joining the same"], [423, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 349 stream, formed two very Ioav islands, leaving the Glass-Houses at some distance on the left hand. BetAveen nine and ten o'clock he left the boat, taking with him two seamen and the nath'e. Steering N. W. by W. through a Ioav swampy country, till they came to the side of a creek, the banks of which Avere Ioav, muddy, and cd4- A-ered with mangroves. This creek carried them by the head of it, where the stream, passing through a rocky SAvamp, permitted them to Avade over it. From here they steered till they ob tained a sight of the flat- topped peak, which appeared to be nearer than the highest Glass- House, which was that he first meant to visit ; but finding one of the mounts Avith sloping sides considerably nearer, he altered his course for it; and, after walking nine miles from the boat, reached its top. The country they passed through was Ioav and swampy, and tOAvards the end of their jour ney the Avay Avas someAvhat uneven. In those sAvampy parts the surface Avas full of holes, Avhere the Avater lodging, walking Avas both difficult and tiresome. The higher places were either sandy or stoney, and in these the grass tree or gum rush abounded. The mount itself was a pile of stones. The vegetable matter that lodged in the cavities produced a covering of long grass, very fit for thatch: the trees on the mount were like those on the level ground, but much taller. From the summit they viewed the bay and surrounding country which was very extensive."], [424, "350 HISTORY OF Near the head of Pumice-Stone river was a large sheet of water, Avhich seemed to divide O y into branches, and others still smaller falling into this beloAV, the whole formed channels, which, ramifying through the low country, drew off Avhat Avater might collect within the ridge of the back mountains. These appeared to be distant between ten and twenty miles, and the intermediate country to be as low as that just Avalked over. From this mount, the Avay Avas over an irre gular country, the higher parts of which Avere sandy and stoney, the loAver sAvampy as before. About half Avay between it and the flat-topped peak, by a stream of water they rested for the night. At seven next morning they found themselves under the steep cliffs of the flat- topped peak. The stone of which Avas of a whitish cast, close-grained and hard, but light and though there not stratified, there Avere many fissures in it. Some distance from the peak lay some pieces of a reddish-coloured stone, and some small pieces of granite scattered about. Lieut. Flinders Avas surprized at not meeting with any volcanic appearances, as the pumice stone in the river, and the situation of these stupendous peaks, standing upon Ioav flat ground, led him to form some expectations of that kind. The steepness of its sides prevented any idea of reaching the summit of the flat-topped peak, therefore he directed his course to the river, steering S. S. E. not only to clear the head of"], [425, "NEW SOUTH AVALES. 351 the creek, but the sAvamps ; this direction took him A-ery far inland ; and upon his altering the course to reach the place where he had left the boat, he had to cross a broad stream of fresh water, which fell in lower down, and to Avalk near three miles to reach the Avater side. He hoAveA-er reached the place with great readiness, and was presented Avith a black swan the people in the boat had caught, and which Avas at the moment ready to satisfy the appetites of his party, who Avere perfectly prepared to do it every justice. The traces of men and animals were feAV, and rarely met Avith in the upper parts during this excursion ; but Lieut Flinders found a new species of pheasant, about the size of a raagpye. The emu was not seen, though its voice had been heard so repeatedly, as to induce him to suppose that bird must be numerous. The in land part of the country was higher and better than in the neighbourhood of the salt Avater, but no where did he meet with any calculated for the production of the Avheat. They reached the sloop in the evening of Sa turday the 27th, and as soon as the ebb tide permitted, the folloAving morning they got under weigh to return down the river, and as they proceeded, there were many natives on the shore abreast of them, avIio seemed anxious for them to land, dancing and singing to obtain attention, and express their oavh good-Avill ; but as they could not effect their wishes, they fol lowed the sloop along the banks, and their hopes"], [426, "352 HISTORY OF seemed to revive by the trips which the vessel made in tacking occasionally toAvards the shore. The intricacy of the channels proved a great impediment to their progress, but they could not get out of the river in one tide, so Avere obliged to anchor about a mile short of the en trance : 18 swans Avere procured in this river. Soon after anchoring, Lieut. Flinders took some of his people Avith axes on shore to cut a log of the pine for the Avorkmen at Port Jackson to ascertain the kind and value of the Avood. There was a house aud several natives near the place, Avith -whom Bong-ree Avas talking to Avhen the tree fell, the crash and report of which startled them, and probably assisted in giving them a high idea of their visitors. These peo ple were still averse to the appearance of a mus ket. The Avorthy native, Bong-ree, made them a present of one of his spears, and a throAving stick, of which he shewed them the use, for they appeared to be Avholly ignorant of the lat ter, and their Aveapons of the former kind Avere inferior to his. Bad Aveather detained Lieut. Flinders here tAvo clays, during which they Avere occasionally visited by the natives, who came doAvn upon both sides of the river, and entertained them with singing and dancing : their singing, in deed, could not be distinctly heard, being nearly lost in the Avind. While lying here, Lieut. Flinders had an ap portunity of observing their manner of fishing, which Avas perfectly novel even to his compa-"], [427, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 353 ilion Bong-ree. The party on the East shore, near Avhich the vessel lay, went out every morn ing at day light along the side of the river Avith nets on their shoulders ; and the mode in Avhich they used them was, Avhichever saAv a fish, by some dextrous man\u0153uvre got at the back of it, and spread out his scoop net: others prevented its escaping on either side, and in one or other of their nets the fish Avas infallibly caught. With these nets they saAv tlfem run sometimes up to their middle in water, and they Avere ge nerally successful, after fishing they made a fire near the beach, and sat doAvn by it to regale with their fish, Avhich Avas no sooner out of the water than on the fire. The rain clearing up on Tuesday, in the after noon, a party Avent to the Eastern shore to pro cure fire-Avood, and comply Avith the desire which the natives had expressed of seeing them land. On approaching them, they carried their nets away to the wood, but three of them avIio remained, suffered the Avhite people to advance Avithout laying doAvn their muskets, which never happened before. They Avere still timorous ; but on being requested by signs to sing, they began a song in concert, Avhich actually Avas musical and pleasing, and in rather a melancholy strain. Bong-ree gave them a song at the conclusion of theirs, which sounded barbarous ; but he Avas thought a poor singer in his oavii country. These, like the natives of Port Jackson, fal ling to a Ioav pitch of their voice, recommenced z z"], [428, "354 HISTORY OF their song at the octave, Avhich they accompa nied by sIoav and graceful motions, their hands \"being held in a supplicating posture, and the tone and manner of their song and gestures seemed to bespeak the good Avill of their au ditors. Observing they Avere paid attention to, they each selected one of our people, and placed his mouth close to his ear, as if to produce a greater effect, or teach them the song, Avhich their silent attention might seem to express a desire to learn. In return for the pleasure they afforded, Lieut. Flinders gave them some Avorsted caps, and old blanket trowsers, with Avhich they were greatly gratified. Other natives soonmade their appearance, but it Avas some little time before they overcame their dread of approaching those strangers Avith fire-arms ; but, encouraged by the three Avho Avere Avith them, they came up, and a general song and dance commenced. Among those Avho last came, three Avere re markable for their large heads ; and the face of one Avas so very rough, that it had much more the appearance of a baboon than of a human being. He was coA-ered Avith oil and soot; his hair matted Avith filth ; his visage, even compar ed with his fellow countrymen's was uncom monly ferocious ; and his large mouth, beset with teeth of various filthy hues between black, Avhite, green, and yelloAV, and sometimes smiled in a way which might make any one shudder. Among other friendly interchanges, they learned the names of Lieut. Flinders and his"], [429, "355 NEW SOUTH WALES. party. Him they called \" Mid-ger Plindah,\" and his brother Mr. Samuel Flinders, they nam ed \"Dam-Avel.\" Three of their names AvereYel yel-bah, Ye-Avoo, and Bo-ma-ri-go. The resem blance of this last to Porto Rico imprinted it on Lieut. Flinders's recollection. When these people joined the party, the strangers Avere shoAvn and their names severally told them, until they had learnt the pronunciation. The ceremony was reciprocal, and accorded with what Capt. Cook had said before of an inhabitant of Endea vour river, \" he introduced the strangers by name, a ceremony Avhich upon such occasions was never omitted.\" On a comparative view of the size of these people, they Avere evidently lower than the Eng lish, and perhaps less in every respect, except in the disproportionate size of the head ; and indeed this Avas not general. In the features of the face, particularly in the elongation of the lower ones, in the small calf to the leg, and the curve of the thigh, they bore a general resemb lance to the natives of Port Jackson; but there Avas not one in all this group, whose countenance had so little of the savage, or the symmetry of Avhose limbs expressed strength and agility, so much as those of Bong-ree. A hawk presenting himself, Lieut. Flinders thought it a fair opportunity of shewing his neAv friends a specimen of the effect of his fire-arms. lie made them understand what he intended ; but, while shifting the buck-shot in the musquet for a charge of small shot, their agitation was 2"], [430, "356 HISTORY OF so great, that they seemed to be on the point o# running into the Avoods ; hoAvever, an expedient to keep them Avas contrived ; the seamen placed themin a cluster behindthemselves,andinthissitu ation they saw Lieut. Flinders approach towards the bird and fire. Their sensations at this mo ment must have been curious ; for the hawk flew aAvay, though much hurt, as the natives noticed, for its leg Avas broke. This disappoint ment brought to mind Iioav ineffectual had been some former attempts of his to impress them with an idea of the superior poAver of their visit ors. Bong-ree had annoyed his auditors Avith the barbarous sounds, and the clumsey exhibition of the Scotch dancers had all been \\ieAved by them Avithout either Avonder or gratification. These people go naked, except that they wore belts round the Avaist, and fillets about the head and upper parts of the arm. These Avere formed of hair, tAvisted into yarn like threads, and then into bandages. Indeed the inhabitants appeared to possess in general a pointed differ ence from those of New South Wales, particu larly in their net-AVorks. To these may be ad ded the bag in Avhich they seemed to carry their' portible property, and Avhich Avas most probably of the same kind as those mentioned by Capt. Cook ; but they Avere seen of different sizes, and tAvo that Lieut. Flinders procured were very dif ferently Avorked. They Avere shaped somewhat like a breast plate ; and Avorn suspended from the neck, which led him, previous to his first interview with them, to suppose they Avere"], [431, "1TEW SOUTH WALES. 357 gome kind of defence for the more vital parts. They Avere provided Avith nets for catching very large fish, or animals, as the fragments of a rot ten one lying on the shore Avere picked up, the meshes of Avhich were wide enough to admit the escape of a moderate sized porpoise; and the line \u2022of which it was made Avas from three quarters to an inch in circumference. Lieut. Flinders thought this mode of procur-r ing their food Avould cause a characteristic dif ference between the manners and dispositions of these people, and of those Avho mostly depend upon the spear or fiz-gig for a supply. In the one case, there must necessarily be a mutual operation of tAvo or more, who Avould from neces sity associate together. Those which had been met Avith in Shoal Bay and Glass-House Bay were far superior to any that had been seen in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson ; this superiority Lieut. Flinders attributed to the dif ferent mode of procuring fish which had been adopted by the inhabitants. He likeAvise sup posed that the use of nets, and consequently whatever resulted from such use, arose from the form of the bay, which being shoal for a consi derable distance from the shores, gave the great est advantage to nets, over every other method, more especially the setting and scoop nets. Pumice-Stone river being full of shoals, required the same manner of fishing ; and it was observ ed that most if not all the islands in the bay Avere surrounded by entensive shoals, which, by"], [432, "HISTORY OF 358 extending the necessity, would assist in bring ing nets into general use. At one time they saw nearly twenty natives engaged in fishing on one flat, the greater part of whom were employed in driving fish into a net which was held by their companions. That they were so engaged, they convinced our peo ple by one of the party holding up a fish to them while he was standing in the water. During the time the sloop Avas in Glass-House Bay, they scarcely saAv any of the Avomen. Of their canoes little could be said; for the only one they could examine Avas on the East side of Pumice-Stone river. This Avas formed of the stringy bark, and Avas much larger than any used at Port Jackson, The ends of itAvere tied up in the same manner, but it Avas very clumsy. None of the natives ever attempted to approach the sloop in canoes, though eight or ten Avere seen standing together, Avho appear ed very desirous of having a communication with it. On the day the sloop Avas laid ashore in the river, the rise of the tide Avas but three feet and nine inches. The tides Avere then neaped, and the remark made by Capt. Cook, that \" they had only one high tide in tAventy-four hours\" seemed to apply in this bay; for, although the sloop was got up as high as the strength of the cicav Avould admit, yet she righted a full hour and an half before the night tide had clone flowing, and shortly after one man haled her off. The superior rise of the night tide Avas -well"], [433, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 359 knoAvn, and of course proper advantage was taken of it, at Port Jackson ; the tide also rose the highest at Western Port, round the South ern promontory of New South Wales. The time of high-Avater in the river preceded the moon's passage over the meridian by tAvo hours and a half. On Wednesday the 31st having a moderate \u25a0breeze at S. by W. with fine Aveather, they got under weigh and beat out of the riArer. Having passed fifteen clays in Glass-House Bay, Lieut. Flinders Avas enabled to form a complete judg ment of it. And found it so full of shoals, that he could not point out any passage that would lead a ship into it Avithout danger. Lieut. Flinders named the land on which \u2022Cape Moreton stood, Moreton Island, supposing that which Capt. Cook would have given it, had he known its form. It appeared a strip of land the greatest extent East and West of Which Avas not more than five miles ; but its North and South extent Avas about twenty-two miles. The ridge of land which ran along the middle of the island was nearly of the same height with the Cape; and though it appeared to be composed of piles of sand heaped together upon a base mostly of Stone, it was interspersed with small trees calcu lated to mislead a distant observer, Avho Avould most probably think that some spots of it could not be classed among the most barren parts of the universe. Passing out of the bay they srav a turtle lying adeepon the water, whenceit became very proba-"], [434, "360 HISTORY OF hie, that taking these animals formed part of the labours of the inhabitants, and Avell indeed would it be if many of those who pride them selves on the high state of civilization, equally well employed their time. In his passage to Hervey's Bay, the next place of destination Lieut. Flinders Avas only tA\\*u days; passing the Wide Bay of Capt. Cook on the 1st, and Sandy Cape on the 2d of August ; the Southerly Avind of the day Areering round in the evening to the Eastward compelled him during the night to keep some distance from some land ; but returning in the morning, he found Captain Cook's description of the coast applied exceed ingly Avell. During this run he passed one of those spotted flat- tailed snakes first noticed by Captain Cook in this latitude, and Avhich appeared to be of the kind observed by Captain Dampier on the North West coast of NeAv Holland. In this bay Lieut Flinders remained till the 7th, during Avhich time he had sailed round the interior Avithout being able to enter any opening that might take him to a river. It Avas deep and extensive, the soundings in it irregular, and in several places he Avas prevented by breakers from approaching nearer the shore. Hauling up for an opening Avhich he Avished to examine, he came to a sandy inlet, laying at the mouth of it. Being unable to find a passage into the openiug with the sloop, he came to an anchor and Avent ashore o,n this island which Avas sunounded with shoal Avater. The base of"], [435, "r> NEW SOUTH WALES. 36l NEW SOUTH WALES. 36*1 -*** Avhich he found to be a hard stone, over which was a covering of sand, mixed with coral and shells. There Avas a cluster of palms on it, and other small trees ; a few large trees were lying on the shore, throAvn down by the Avind or flood, assisted by the weight of the trees them selves, Avhich the depth of soil Avas not able to support. Being about half ebb, the shoal Avas dry, on Avhich, were some thousand curleAvs and gulls, and some pelicans ; but all too shy to alloAv of his approach Avithin musquet shot. On one of the trees Avas stuck the cap of a small whale's scull, and in one of the sockets of the eyes a bird's nest, apparently of the last, season Avas discovered. This islet must certainly have been visited by natives ; for they found three spears, and near them Avas hidden a small shield, of the same form and substance as those seen near Pumice- Stone river. The spears Avere of solid wood, of twelve sect in length, and could not have been used with a throwing stick. One of them Avas barbed Avith a small piece of bone. The forms of the shores about this harbour, apparently dividing it into tAvo bays, an upper and lower ; and the shore on the East side of the upper bay being high and bounded by steep cliffs Lieut. Flinders Avas induced to think a deep channel existed there, as the sheet of Avater extended six or seven miles square. With the intention of accomplishing an Eas tern passage to this upper bay, he returned on board from his visit to Curlew islet, and got 3 A"], [436, "362 HISTORY OF the sloop under weigh; but Avas obliged to give up the idea, finding the shoal Avater so extensive as to make it probable it joined a line of breakers; and the sun being near the horizon, to get clear of the shoal water before dark, became a princi pal concern ; these induced him to shape his course for an hummock on the West side of the bay. The soundings deepened gradually to six fathoms ; but, shoaling again to three and even tAvo fathoms, Lieut. Flinders suspected the flood tide might set the vessel to the Southward to wards the shore ; this hoAvever, Avas not the case, for at day light next morning her situation was that expected, the sloping hummock bearing W. 5* N. and -their distance off shore about tAvo miles. Keeping along the shore till nine o'clock, the water shoaled to nine feet, and obliged them to haul off to the N. E. Being noAv to the North ward of where Capt. Cook had laid down the coast line, and the land being visible at W. 10* N. and as far as N. W. from the mast head, he did not judge it necessary to pursue the search any longer under the supposition of there being a double bay, and therefore continued his course for the extreme of the sloping hummock called Break Sea Spit. Round Hervey's Bay the coast Avas in general Ioav near the shore, and on the West side it ex tended to some distance inland. On that side the land wore a different appearance from that of .Sandy Cape, there being few marks of sand,"], [437, "363 WEW SOUTH WALES. and the shore very rocky. Proceeding toward the head, the beaches presented themselves, and continued Avith little interruption into the up per bay. A large island lying off the entrance to the upper bay sheAved no marks of sand, but Avas well covered Avith both wood and verdure. In height, it Avas equal to the high parts of the main, and being four or five miles in length, seemed to be a fire island. On the Eastern shore the sand was more or less apparent every where, increasing in quantity toAvards the Cape. The white cliffs that Avere noticed before contained chalk ; the upper stratum, tAvo or three feet in thickness, having a superior whiteness in those which Avere best seen. With respect to fertility, the general aspect only can be spoken of. About the head of the bay, the trees Avere of a fair groAvth; grass seemed sufficiently abundant, there Avere few appearances of sand, and some parts of it Avere stony. Respecting the inhabitants he had only time to observe, that their smokes Avere numerous about the bay, and that they at times frequented Curlew islet. Of the animal, vegetable, or fossil productions of the bay, he could speak still less, the short ness of his stay permitting no examination. From the appearance of the tide the day he landed on the islet, it Avas high Avater betAveen twelve and one o'clock, which Avas three or four hours before the moon came on the meri dian. 3"], [438, "364 HISTORY OF Having cleared the point of Break Sea Spit$ on Thursday the 8th he proceeded on his return to Port Jackson. Passing the land between Smoky Cape and Solitary Isles in the day Avhich had been before passed in the night, he observed it seemed to be higher than most parts of its coast, Mount Warning excepted ; and even there it Avas not so high near shore. The view that he had of the land at sunset, Avhen Smoky Cape bore S. 25\" W. distant five or six leagues, induced Lieut. Flinders to imagine it probable that there might be an opening to the Northward. In the afternoon of Sunday the 18th, there being little Avind, and the weather fine, they were attended by several spermaceti Avhales. They were not more than twice the sloop's length from her, coming up on either side at times very near her ; and remained playing about for more than two hours. Their appearance Avas folloAved in the evening by a gale from the S. W. which reduced them to their storm sails, and compelled them to keep off and on during the night. The Avind, Iioav ever, loAvering the next day, and a Southerly current having been in their favour, Lieut. Flin ders concluded his labours at dusk in the even ing of the 20th; at which time he secured his little vessel along side his Majesty's ship. the Reliance in Port Jackson. The observations which Avere made by Lieut. Flinders on the set of the current at different parts of the coast, being directly opposite to the remarks of Capt. Cook, it will only be doing"], [439, "365 NEW SOUTH AVALES. justice to his great merit to state them. That great and able seaman, Capt. Cook, says, in his notice of the qurrent on this coast, \" that it ahvays ran with more force in shore than in the offing.\" Noav in going to the Northward the Norfolk Avas kept as near in shore as circum stances would permit; but the Avhole sum of Southing produced in eight days, was 65 miles, almost the whole of which they lost off' the Three Brothers and Smoky Cape. To counter act this, they had tAventy-five miles of Northing, reducing the current to thirty miles in eight days, Avhich could indeed hardly be called a cur rent. On the contrary, their average distance from shore Avhen returning, Avas about tAvelve leagues off the land ; and in running the same difference of latitude in twelve clays the sum of the South ing Avas tAvo hundred and eleven miles, and the Northing but one mile and a half. Out of this, thirty-four miles Avere gained in one day when their distance from shore Avas the greatest. From this it appears, the current Avas strongest at the distance of five, and from thence to tAven ty or more leagues; and Avithin that there was some set to the Northward. But Lieut. Flin ders thought the Southerly current would pre vail nearer to projecting points, at the times its strength was greatest, for in that respect it had been found to vary much. Respecting the tides it was scarce necessary to say any thing; for, by a comparison of the times of high water at Bustard Bay and Port"], [440, "366 HISTORY OF Jackson, it seemed the flood came from the Southward, and Avould therefore produce little or no set along the coast, either way, in the greatest part of that space. From Break Sea Spit, the coast trends to the WestAvard of North, which has a tendency to draw the flood from the S. E. and this Avas shown by Capt. Cook to be the case. Thus concluded the arduous voy age of Lieut. Flinders, whose great skill in ex ploring unknoAvn coasts and harbours, has so evidently manifested itself in this excursion, pro mises fair to place him high in the list of British circum-navigators."], [441, "367 NEW SOUTH WALES. CHAP. X. Troii contemplating a narrative, replete with rational gratification to the mind, it is a pity to be obliged to resume a continuance of the catalogue of crimes with which iniquity seems ever ready to afford a super-abundance of mate rials. The crminal courts being assembled on the 29th of August, one man, Job Williams, Avas con victed of a burglary ; and several others Avere ordered to be transported to Norfolk Island. Williams aftenvards received a pardon, as some favourable circumstances Avere laid before the GoArernor. Some difficulties Avere still placed in the Avay of the Commissary in preparing his accounts to be sent home, through the settlers, and other persons Avho had not come forward asdirected, to sign the vouchers of sums paid for grain or pork delivered at the public stores, the Commissary was therefore ordered not to pay directly in future, but to issue government notes quar terly; Avhen every person concerned Avould be obliged to attend, and give the proper receipts for such sums paid them. This Avas indeed a most valuable regulation, and some such pre venth'e mode had been long Avanted."], [442, "368 HISTORY OF The convicts Avho arrived in the Hillsborough being mostly recovered from the disease and Aveakness Avith Avhich they landed, additional strength Avas added to the public gangs, and the different Avorks in hand went on Avith consider ably more spirit than they had for some time. In addition to the battery Avhich, under the direc tion of Lieut. Kent, had been constructed by the seamen of the Supply on the East point of the Cove, the Avork on Point Maskelyne had been completed Avith embrasures ; and some guns Avere placed in a commanding situation above the wind-mill on the West side ; and a Avork had been throAvn up on Garden Island; there fore, in point of defence, the settlement Avore a respectable aspect. During the night of the 6th of September, the Resource, an American ship, arrived from Rhode Island, bound to China. Having refreshed her crew she sailed again on the 14th ; but to the in jury of other Americans Avho might hereafter visit the settlement, the master took several seamen aAvay belonging to the king's ships. To recruit their numbers, and refresh those he had on board, were undoubtedly his motives for coming in; but such conduct deserving a representation to the American Minister, the Governor deter mined to make one. On the 15th, the Buffalo sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, to fetch cattle for the colony. The Governor wished to send a cargo of coals by her to the Cape; but her repairs had taken up so much time, that to load her Avith that article"], [443, "369 NEW SOUTH AVALES. would have procrastinated her departure too far into the season, to admit of her return within the summer months, which was absolutely re quisite to preserve her cattle. This desirable object Avas therefore declined. Dispatches were sent to England by this op portunity, containing among others, a requisi tion for those materials Avanting to carry into effect the manufacture of Avoollens and linens, viz. a large quantity of reeds, hackles, tOAV, and wool cards, a quantity of log Avood, red Avood, copperas, and alum. Shortly after the sailing of this ship, the Go vernor visited the wild cattle, for Avhich pur pose he left Paramatta the 24th of September, crossing the Nepean river next morning further to the NorthAvard than before. In this direction he traversed Avith his party a neAv tract of coun try, perfectly beautiful and highly calculated for both cultivation and pasture. Arriving at the Cow-pasture Plains, they met with a small herd of cattle about 20 in number, all extremely fierce, and had not some clogs been with the party, they would certainly have been attacked. The natives avIio accompanied the Governor, Avere alarmed so much, that they climbed up the trees, and left their friends to provide for their oavh safety. Several of the dogs having been set at the cattle, by some of the party, Avho did it, not thinking their situation perfectly safe, the animals dismayed at this unu sual appearance went off with great expedi tion, all but a bull calf, which the dogs detained: 3 B"], [444, "370 HISTORY OF the Governor hoAvever, directed him to be freed, on which a curious circumstance occurred. Three horses being with the party, the calf stuck close to them, running betAveen their legs, and as he belloAved very loud there was every reason to fear the flock Avould return, and there by danger the party; thus it Avas thought requisite to stop his cries by shooting him Avhich was done instantly, and they regaled Avith infinite satisfaction on veal, a dish almost unknoAvn in this country. Quitting the CoAV-pasture Plains, the Gover nor and his party re-crossed the river higher up, and were led four miles over a mountainous country, and then over a level space covered with fine grass, and very well Avatered. On the return of the Governor and his party on the beginning of October, they found the Eliza whaler had come in from sea, Avanting only thirty tons of oil to complete her cargo. A great number of convicts and others Avho were the labouring servants of Government hav ing absconded for the purpose of living by rob bery, or escape in those ships ready to sail. An order Avas issued, that those concerned might not plead ignorant of the consequence and thus try to evade punishment, \"that any officer or man belonging to the above ships, who should be knoAvn to have countenanced or assisted the convicts aboA*e alluded to in making their escape Avould be taken out of the ship, and punished with the utmost severity of the laAv ; and as the most strict and scrupulous search would take"], [445, "371 NEW SOUTH WALES. take place on board, for every convict Avhich should be found concealed, or suffered to remain on board Avithout regular permission, so many of the ship's company should be taken out and detained for daring to encourage such escape. Such of the above public servants as might have taken to concealments on shore for the purpose of avoiding their Avork, or making their escape from the colony, if they did not return Avithin a week to their respective stations, might, upon discovery, expect the most exemplary punish ment ; but they Avould be pardoned for the pre sent attempt if they returned immediately.\" Notwithstanding the Governor had found it requisite to publish this particularly strict order, the very day it appeared, on searching the Hills borough then moving out of the Cove, several convicts Avere secreted on board, these hoAvever, were brought on shore, and all except one receiv ed severe corporal punishment. That one Avas forgiven on declaring Avho Avere the people that encouraged their concealment, and prepared hiding places for them. This he did and it proved to be tAvo of the seamen, Avho Avere also directly brought on shore, punished and then drummed to the wharf, and returned to the ship from Avhence they came. The little effect of good orders, regulations, and punishments, Avere again fully sheAvn, and still more strongly confirmed by the folloAving circumstance; The Spanish ship a prize to the Avhalers had been bought by Mr. Hingston, late master of the Hillsborough, and tAvo free men of the settle-"], [446, "372 HISTORY OF ment, she had been named the Hunter, and was about making a voyage to Bengal, for the pur pose of freighting back Avith goods for the colony. A female named Ann Holmes being found missing, Avhile the Hunter Avas going out of the harbour, the Governor directed an armed boat to follow the ship, Avith constables to search her ; and ordered if any persons Avere found on board Avithout permission, to bring the ship again into port. Having found the Avoman, the ship was accordingly brought up the harbour and pro perly secured. Many of her crew conducted themselves in an insolent and mutinous manner to an officer sent from the Reliance, having armed against the constables, and one of them presented a musquet at a chief constable, they Avere noAv secured, and ordered to be punished on board their oavii ship, after Avhich they Avere turned on shore. But as the Governor thought something more than this requisite to be clone; a criminal court assembled and the master of the ship Avas tried, charged Avith aiding a female com'ict to escape. The offence consisting of aiding a convict, thus it hecame requisite to proA*e the person found in his ship Avas a convict; but on referring to a list of the prisoners Avho arrived in the Royal Ad miral, which ship Ann Holmes had been sent out in, to NeAv South Wales, no term of transporta tion Avas found against her name. So the master was acquitted, it not being possible to prove that Holmes Avas then a convict. But the mas ter was highly reprehensible for concealing any 2"], [447, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 373 person in his ship, and must undoubtedly have felt himself in an aAvkAvard situation, in being brought before a court for the breach of an order issued but a short time to guard him and others against the very offence he had committed. The Hillsborough, Avhen searched, had no less than thirty convicts on board, against the orders, but these Avere Avithout the knowledge of the officers, being secreted by the seamen. Soon after these transactions, both ships sailed on their voyages. Though by the measures adopted, it Avas sup posed none had escaped in the ships, yet many Avere still knoAvn to be in the Avoods. On the 15th a young ox Avas missed from the stock yard at Toongabbe ; -with the hope of discover ing the offenders, a notice Avas issued, holding out a conditional emancipation, and permission to become a setvler, to any convict for life, who Avould come fonvard Avith the information neces sary to convict the persons concerned; and an absolute emancipation, Avith permission to quit the colony, to any one transported only for a limitted time; but nothing ever transpired that could lead to a discovery. Wheat at this time getting Ioav in the stores rendered it necessary to deduct two pounds from the twelve which were issued, an addition Avau made to the alloAvanceof salt meat, eight pounds and a half of beef being issued instead of five, and live pounds of pork in the room of three.

The Reliance sailed on the 2d of November, with a party of military to relieve those on duty at Norfolk Island ; and the next day the ship Walker arrived from England, on board of which Avere Lieut. Colonel Paterson, and Capt. Abbot, of the NeAv South Wales corps. The dispatches the Governor noAv received, directed a register to be kept of all ships enter ing in and clearing out of the harbour, in conse quence of which he appointed Richard Atkins, Esq. the judge advocate, to that service; and it noAv became an article in the port orders delivered to the masters of ships on their arrival, \" that they Avere not upon any account to break bulk, or attempt to land any article Avhatever, until such time as an account of the ship, her commander, cargo, &c. had bpen laid before the GoArernor.\" It Avas at the same time ordered that no boat, or indeed any person, except the pilot and officer, sent by the Governor, and the person to fill up the register, should ever board a ship, entering the port, till the informa tion required had been fully obtained."], [449, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 375 The ordnance of the colony Avas increased on the arrival of the Walker by four iron twelve pounders, and intelligence Avas brought that copper coin, to the amount of 5501. Avas put on board the Porpoise, and might be daily ex pected. Money Avould in its circulation most certainly be attended with the greatest utility to all the inhabitants of the colony in their se veral dealings ; and to prevent its being taken out of the colony it might be marked.

At the same time as the Walker, the Britannia arrived from her last cruize, having perfected her cargo of oil. A general complaint being made by the in habitants of Sydney concerning the quality of the bread delivered to them, the Governor or dered a meeting of officers for the investigation of it; it appeared the bakers received the Avheat as issued, and engaged to giA*e in return a quantity of bread ; but, never having been confined as to quality, returned loaves composed of more chaff and bran than flour, which made the convicts very feelingly call them \" scrubbing brushes.\" The bakers Avere heard."], [450, "376 HISTORY OF but proper directions Avere given to remove the evil, and prevent a repetition of it. Lieut. Col. Paterson had, since he arrived, introduced some regulations in the corps of which he Avas sent out to take the command. As his Majesty had augmented the pay of the non-commissioned officers, drummers, and pri vates of the army, since the 25th day of May 1797, under certain regulations Avith respect to stoppages, this regiment Avas to receive the benefit of three-pence halfpenny per day, to be deducted, as a payment for the ration issued to them, and which the commissary Avas now directed to serve, agreeable to the ration estab lished by command for such troops as were serving* in Jamaica, Gibraltar, &c. &c. Col. Paterson Avas also instructed to com plete the companies of the corps, if he could obtain proper characters for the purpose, in consequence of which notice was given, in forming those free people, avIio could bring with them satisfactory recommendations to the colonel, they Avould be received for the regi ment. The great pains formerly taken, to enforce a proper attention to the duties of religion, it might rationally have been thought, would have had a lasting effect ; but 'the orders and regulations for the good government of NeAv South Wales, like the Acts of Parliament of the mother country, Avere only observed at their first publication : again, therefore, Avas the Governor obliged to call on all in authority,"], [451, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 377 to exert themselves in enforcing a proper ob servance of the sabbath, and they Avere parti cularly directed to urge the Avomen to attend divine service, for the females had at all times thought it convenient not to imagine them selves included in those addressed by the public orders. The crops of wheat, Avhich at this time Avere ready for the reaper, wore a profitable and very promising appearance ; the stalks of that at the Hawkcsbury Avas bending Avith the weight of the corn. But in this, as in other coun tries, a crop could never Avith safety be reck oned, until gathered into the barn. On the l6thof November fell a heavy storm of thun^ der, lightning, and rain, Avith a shoAVer of hail that knocked the greater part of the fruit off the trees, and cut up the gardens in the neigh bourhood of Sydney ; though at tAvo miles from that place, it Avas not felt. On the 18th of November, a gale of wind and rain visited the Hawkesbury two clays after the storm at Sydney, which beat doAvn much of the Avheat, and greater part of the public store. This tempestuous weather subsided for a day, and then recommenced and continued until the 25 th, when it cleared up ; and, to encrease the affliction, myriads of caterpillars were now destroying the young maize. To obtain an absolute knoAvleclge of Avhat was the produce of the year's harvest, proper persons Avere appointed, by the Governor, to visit every district, and to obtain from tire 3 c"], [452, "378 HISTORY OF owners an account of Avhat was produced on each farm. The building the public gaol at Sydney was not yet completed, although a meeting of the officers had been held to consider of the means best to be devised for defraying the expense. The Britannia Avhaler being noAv ready for sea, on the 2d of December sailed for England, hy which opportunity Mr. Raven, avIio cameAvith the Buffalo, and five of his officers took their passage ; an agreement being made with the master, to furnish them Avith a passage for 2501. The Walker on the same day sailed on her fishing voyage. The dissatisfaction manifested by the settlers, respecting the reduction of the price of grain Avhich had been ordered by the Governor to take place, induced them to complain to his Excellen cy by petitions, in Avhich they stated many hard ships they laboured under, in the hope that he Avould receive the crops of this season at the higher price. Having considered the proprietyof their petitions, he wished them to recollect, that four years since he had giveu notice, that the high price of grain could not be continued longer than that season : and though he had no doubt of their having had the losses they represented, and they must know he had used every means he could to remove or relieve them ; yet his duty forced him to adhere to die reduction of Avhich he had given notice, and at the same time observed, some of the misfor-"], [453, "379 NEAV SOUTH WALES. tuues had proceeded from a Avant of attention to their OAvn interest ; many of them having sold their last bushel for the imprudent gratifi cation of the moment, thus reducing their fa milies to distress and even nakedness. At the same time he informed them, he felt much pleasure in being able to communicate to their, that government intended to administer every relief, by supplying the inhabitants with both necessaries and comforts at a moderate price. During the same clay which the Britannia sailed, the Plunder, a Spanish ship, anchored in the cove; Avhich ship Avas a prize to three Avhalers that captured her near Cape Corientes, on the coast of Peru. Her cargo principally consisted of spirits and Avine, which being con demned by the Vice-admiralty Court as a laAV ful prize, were removed to the Supply, and an order was issued, to forbid the landing of spirits, wine, or malt liquor, till a regular permit was obtained, which restriction Avas ex tended to Avine and malt liquor, as spirits were frequently landed as those articles. The Commissary Avas noAv enabled to issue slop-cloathing to the convicts, as a quantity had been received by the Walker ; but unfortu nately, however, much put on board arrived in a damaged state. On the 14th of December, the Martha schooner came in from Bass Strait; she brought 1000 seal-skins and 30 barrels of oil, which she had procured among the islands,"], [454, "380 HISTORY OF The criminal court assembled on the 16th, when tAvo mates of the Walker were tried for using menaces to a person for stopping their boat Avhen attempting to land spirits Avithout a permit ; but as he had no authority for making a seizure, they Avere acquitted. One John Morris Avas convicted of forgery, and received sentence of death ; but his fate being determined by the majority of one voice, this business must, as provided by the patent for establishing the court, be referred to the King in council. It Avas fortunate that such instances did not often occur ; for the unfor tunate criminal must languish for many months in so dreadful a state of uneertainty, that it is hard to say, if the thus created punishment By suspense, even though eventually the cul prit Avas pardoned, did not exceed the instant punishment of death ; and if, after a lapse of time, the pendant arm of justice inflicted the rigorous sentence of the laAv, the poor Avretches state, must excite the commisseration of all hearts composed of any softer materials than iron. The settlers in a body again represented their inability to bear a reduction in the price of wheat this season, not only in consequence of their former losses, but of the very high price of those necessaries of life requisite for paying their labourers : thus the Governor consented to receive the wheat only at the former price of 10s. per bushel, and they Avere then told the re-"], [455, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 381 duction Avould certainly take place the next season. His Excellency also allowed a quantity of Avine and spirits to be landed, for the accom modation of those Avho had crops to secure, and thus prevent the impositions they must be sub ject to in procuring them from a petty dealer. The Reliance and Francis returned on the 24th from Norfolk Island, Avith the relief of the mili tary. Before the morning of the 25th, the log gaol at Paramatta Avas set on fire, and shortly con sumed.

It is by no means wonderful, that in a coun try inhabited by convicts there should be an antipathy to a gaol, so strong as to end in the destruction of those, composed of combustible materials, and though it might be thought, the criminals on the outside, Avould have had a little pity for those on the in, that was not found the case either at the burning the prison formerly or now, which sheAvs too plainly the real state of depravity to which human nature can reach."], [456, "382 HISTORY OF The harvest noAv begining, constables were sent to the Hawkesbury to secure every vagrant they could meet Avith and bring them to Sydney, if they did not choose to Avork, as the settlers wereAvilling to pay them a dollar per day, and give them their provisions; at this time there were many persons in that district, calling themselves free people, Avho refused to do any kind of labour unless paid the most exhorbitant Avages. This evil indeed reigns too universally in all countries, for from this cause the farmer is evi dently forced to charge more for his grain ; thus the encrease of price rises still higher, till at length the very labourer, who is the first grand cause, complains of the price of that bread he needs for himself or family. The folloAving statement of the live stock and ground in cultivation in New South Wales at this period, is highly satisfactory : viz. LIVE STOCK. 39 Horses, 72 Mares, 1S8 Bulls and Oxen, 51 2 Cows, 3189 Hogs, 4751 Sheep, and 25S8 Goats. LAND IN CULTIVATION. 5465 Acres of Wheat, 2302 of Maize, 82 of Barley, and only 8 of Oats. Thus it appears there Avas a great encrease of live stock, except of horses. And a considera ble addition had been made to the ground in cultivation. 1"], [457, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 383 That the encrease of live stock and land in cultivation, should have for its growing accom paniment an encrease of crimes, can only be viewed with regret, and it is much to be lament ed, that abilities so great, as those possessed by every officer in the settlement, had not more worthy subjects of his Majesty's to govern, and thus have them sheAvn to still greater advantage. On the 3d of January, 1800, the Swallow, East-India packet, arrived on her voyage to China. She on anchoring saluted the fort, which Avas of course returned. . She had a variety of articles for sale, intended for the China market; but the master found it worth his Avhile to display to the female inhabi tants here various elegant articles of dress. On the 11th the Minerva transport arrived from Ireland, Avith 162 male and 26 female con victs from that kingdom, all in perfect health, their treatment doing the highest credit to the master, the surgeon, and officers ; only three had died during the passage. She was chartered for Bengal; and, as the season Avas early for her proceeding on that voyage, the Governor wishing to divide this description of people, Avould have sent her Avith them to Norfolk Island ; but as no provision had been made for her proceeding to that place under the original charter-party, he did not think proper to give what the master demanded.

The -third made his escape, by jumping into the river, and though to assist him in swimming he could only make use of his feet, yet Avith this disadvantage, and the savage murderers of his companions firing constantly at him, he reached the opposite bank alive, and soon joined his own far more innocent people. The governor, on being informed of this cir cumstance, withhis.usual goodness sent directly to the place, Avhere the bodiesof these poor victims Avere found buried in a garden, stabbed in several places, and their hands tied as described. Powell and the other murderers Avere taken into custody, and a court being assembled, they Avere tried for the Avilful murder of the tAvo native boys.

She had spoke the Albion, which had unfortunately been equally unsuccessful. The gaol at Sydney still Avanting much of being compleated from the smalness of the sums raised to carry it on ; and as it appeared that the officers had paid foity pounds each as anidividual share of the expense, it became re- quisite that some means should be adopted to finish the building; and, as the price of Avheat had, at the urgent request of the settlers, been for this season continued at ten shillings per bushel, it Avas -thought proper to raise a sum for the purpose, by each leaving with the commis- sary sixpence, for every bushel of wheat taken to the store.

Col.

The quantity of salt provisions at this time in store, not being able to suffer an exemption of the regiment from a reduction, they were informed that, till the store could afford to victual them agreeable to that regulation, they Avould receive the same as the civil department; but that no stoppages from their pay would take place on that account. One of these people a well-disposed young man, fell a victim to an attachment he had formed with a most infamous woman ; avIio, after plundering him of every thing he pos sessed, turned him out of her house, to make room for another. This treatment, though only what he might rationally have expected, he could not survive ; and, placing the muzzle of his gun under his chin, drew the trigger Avith his foot, and, the contents going through his neck, he instantly expired.

At the same time the Hunter bark came from Calcutta, with a cargo on speculation; and the next clay a Spanish brig captured by the whalers. On the 16th arrived the Friendship transport from Ireland Avith convicts : last from the Cape of Good Hope, Avhere the Buffalo Avas embarking cattle for the settlement. The con victs arrived in very good health, though they had been rather sickly previous to her reaching the Cape.

Since the last arrivals from Ireland, a number of suspicious persons were continually strolling about Sydney at all hours of the night, se veral boats had been taken aAvay, and property to a serious amount stolen out of houses ; in order to put a stop to these practices, the cen- tinels were directed not to suffer any person, the civil and military officers of the settlement excepted, to pass after ten o'clock at night, Avithout giving the counter-sign; on failure of which the centinel Avas to detain them until the relief came round ; when, if the corporal should not be satisfied Avith the account they gave, they Avere to be taken to the guard-house, and detained till enlarged by the magistrates. In addition to this, the constables were directed to be strict in their rounds, and apprehend all improper or suspicious persons they might meet in the town during the night. In a few days after the issuing this order, several of the Irish prisoners assembled at a house, and making more noise than proper during the night, Avere taken up, and lodged in the gaol till the morning ; when they Avere set at liberty with strong assurances of being punished if again taken up.

She was therefore fitted for sea, and sailed on the 3d of March on her homeAvard bound Aroyage. The Martha returned from the SouthAvard on the 6th of March, Avith a cargo of oil and seal skins.

Accounts of an alarming nature toward the latter end of the month arrived from George's river and the Hawkesbury. The Aveather had, for upAvards of twenty days, been very Avet, which Avas unfortunate, as the maize was now ripe, the wind blew a heavy gale, accompanied with so much rain that the river Hawkesbury, and all the creeks, rose beyond their banks, laying the flat country under water. The con sequent damage followed the desolation which this flood spread over the cultivated grounds, and some lives Avere lost, though considering the extent of the flood they Avere few. The prospect of a fine maize harvest was noAv at an end, and Avork of everykind Avas suspended, for the purpose of preparing the ground for a se cond crop of Avheat. The settlement had not yet become so firmly established as to be en abled to withstand such a succession of ill-for tune Avithout some assistance from the mother country. Had the settlers been more indus trious, they must in some degree have been pre pared for accidents of this nature ; and it was to be lamented, that, Avhen they Avere established on the banks of the HaAvkesbury, attention had not been paid to the evident signs of the floods which the river appeared liable to, had the dwellings been built on higher ground, the inundations which had occurred could have done no injury. The late overflows 3 s"], [468, "394 HISTORY OF had been such as exceeded in horror and de* siruction every thing that could be imagined. To prepare with every expedition the ground for Avheat, all persons were called on to give assistance ; and, as a number of idle persons Avere wandering about the colony, avIio refused to labour unless paid exorbitant Avages, these Avere again directed to be taken up, and, if found to prefer living by extortion or robbery, to working at a reasonable rate, they Avere to be made labour for the public. The Walker went on the fishery ; and the Martha snoAV sailed for Norfolk Island, with some articles for sale, the property of her owners during the latter part of this month. On the first day of April, the criminal court of judicature met for the trial of offenders. Rob beries had been \\rery frequent, on household property as Avell as live stock. Two men Avere convicted of robbery, and Mary Graham of forgery. Several were sentenced to have cor poral punishment, and others Avere ordered to be transported to Norfolk Island. The Go vernor pardoned the woman and one of the men, leaving the other to his fate, and appointed the day for his execution ; but the officers so liciting that his life might be spared, the Go vernor consented, directing that both the prisoners, yet unacquainted Avith'the pardon to be granted them, should be taken to the place of execution with their coffins, and every ap pearance observed that could give solemnity to the 6cene, and impress on the minds of the"], [469, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 395 spectators a proper aAve. These directions be ing complied with, and the ropes put about their necks, the provost marshal produced the pardon and read it. One appeared much af fected ; but the other declared that he Avas neA*er in his life so Avell prepared, and indeed he seemed hardly to desire a procrastination of death. On the 14th the Hunter sailed for Norfolk Island, and on the 16th the Speedy Avhaler arrived from England, with fifty female con- Aricts; and eight hundred and thirty-two casks of salt provisions, Avhich enabled the Governor again to issue a full ration. In this ship arrived Capt. Philip Gidley King, the lieutenant-gOA*ernor of Norfolk Island. In the evening of the same day, the Buffalo arrived from the Cape of Good Hope, having on board eighty-five coavs and twenty breeding mares. This voyage Avas performed in seven months, the Buffalo having sailed from Port Jackson on the 15th of last September. She made her passage there in three months, arriv ing in Table Bay on the 1 6th of December. The quantity of spirits at this time in the colony occasioned much intoxication and irre gularity. The settlers at the HaAvkesbury lost to their own interest neglected sowing their grounds ; a circumstance which, but for the interference of the Governor, Avould have ended in their ruin. On hearing their situation, he forbade the sending more spirits to that profli gate district of the colony, as well as the retail- 3"], [470, "396 history or ing Avhat had been already sent, under pain of the offenders being prosecuted for disobedience of orders. The Governor inthebeginingof May received information from the officers, that they had some grounds for suspecting, that the convicts from Ireland had brought Avith them the prin ciples which occasioned their being sent from that kingdom, and were holding seditious correspondences, and unlaAvful meetings; to discover Avhether there Avas any foundation for this, he called in the assistance of Lieut. Governor King, Colonel Paterson, Major Fo veaux, and the magistrates ; Avhen it was deter mined to make a general search among the per sons suspected in all parts of the colony at the same time, and to secure, and seal up their papers. This examination took place on the 15th; but nothing was discovered that could furnish the smallest evidence of the imputed crimes.

The Governor judged it necessary, in consequence of these conjectures, to extract the heads of several acts against seditious correspondence or unlaAvful assemblies of the people, and altering them so as to suit the settlement, published them as a proclamation, that none might plead ignorance of the existence of such laAvs. This beside being madepublic in the usual manner, Avas read on Sunday the 24th, in chuch, after the performance of divine service. The Friendship having sailed early in the month for Bengal, that opportunity Avas taken of sending dispatches to England, and to the Governor of India; who, by the Hunter, had sent a letter to the Governor, inclosing a list of persons from New South Wales who Avere then resident in Calcutta, and \" desiring to be informed whether any of them had left the terri tory Avithout having previously obtained permis sion for that purpose, or served the regular term of their transportation ; in which latter case it was the intention of that government to return them to the colony by the first opportunity.\" On comparing the list with the books, there Avere found none of this description, and all were accounted for, except two or three whose names"], [472, "398 HISTORY OF did not appear on the books ; of course, if they had once been on them, their owners must now have used others. The number of persons that appeared at Calcutta Avas not more than fifteen ; small however as that number Avas, the fear that such Avorthless characters should find their way into that government Avas strongly ex pressed. Indeed there Avas no community, but would view with horror the possibility of such persons mixing Avith them. At the same time information transpired that some proposition had been made, and a corres pondence entered intobetAveen the secretary of the Bengal government and the gentlemen em ployed as the private agent of the officers respecting, sending Indian convicts to NeAv South Wales.

Several applications being made to get fresh pork received into the stores, the Commissary was directed to comply with the requests; but as there Avas every reason to imagine that the compliance would be attended with the destruc tion of breeding and young soavs. It was or dered, that any person who should be known to offer meat of that description to the store, that it should not only be refused to be received ; but the owner was also to be informed against, as being in that case no longer deserving any encouraa-ement or indulgence from the govern merit he thus offended.

In absolute defiance of the repeated orders issued to enforce a decent attendance at divine service on Sunday, that day was still marked by nearly a total neglect of its duties. Another order was now given on the 25th, again point ing out the duties of the superintendants, constables, and overseers, as far as respected this particular needful attention, and at the same time assuring them that a further neglect on their parts, should be noticed by their dis mission from their situations ; thus, as their interest Avas made concerned, there could be much less doubt of their attending to this last order, more than to those Avhich before left it that scarce article in this country, prin cipal.

Over the Avood natives he had so great an influence as to enable him to persuade them that he had himself been a black man, and carried the joke on so far as absolutely to point out an old Avoman as his mother, Avho poor soul Avas Aveak and credulous enough to OAvn the rascal as her son. These natives Avho inhabit the Avoods are certainly not so keen as those Avho live upon the coast. The essential difference may be accounted for by their manner of living, as undoubtedly society contributes much to the exercise and enlargement of the mental faculties. Wilson presumed upon their mental inability; and, having imposed himself on them as their countryman, and inspired them Avith both fear and respect of his superior poAvers, he indulged himself in taking libertine liberties Avith their young females. Deficient as these poor savages Avere in reasoning faculties, he found to his cost they were susceptible of Avrongs; for, having appropriated against her inclinations a female to his OAvn accommodation, her friends took an opportunity, Avhen he could not defend himself,"], [479, "NEAV SOUTH WALES. 405 to drive a spear through his body, and thus ended his career, and left them to expect his return at some future period in the shape of another white man. It may be remembered in the former part of this Avork, that the natives of Port Stephens, entertained a similar idea, Avhen four Avhite men had been throAvn among them ; Wilson ha\\*ing heard this circumstance, availed himself of it in his visitations with the Avood natives. Some A*ery serious rumours were circulated early in September, respecting the prisoners lately sent from Ireland for sedition, and being concerned in the late rebellion. It Avas asserted that they had formed a plan for gaining posses sion of the colony, that many pikes Avere in great forwardness ; these reports caused the Governor to nominate a committee of officers to examine all suspected persons, and endeavour to ascertain if any such design existed. In the routine of their inquiries, they found occasion to imprison Harold the Catholic priest, who both from his language and behaviour was suspected of being concerned in the intended attack on the GoA'ernment. He confessed the reports Avere founded in truth, and undertook to discover the Aveapons concealed, of Avhich it had been said several hundreds were made. He implicated seAreral of his countrymen, and they on being questioned, accused several others ; indeed, from Avhat transpired on the examination, the committee thought them all deserving of punishment; Harold hoAvever was unable to"], [480, "406 HISTORY OF fulfil his promise of producing the pikes. He first said they Avere buried in the ground of a settler, but on searching every part of it, no pikes could be found. He then said they were sunk iu the harbour; but here neither could they be discovered. Thus failing he tryed to persuade an Irishman, to make a feAV to produce in support of his assertion ; but the man unfor tunately for him had been transported for hav ing already been a dealer in those articles, and declared he would not involve himself a second time on their account. He hoAvever did at length find a man to make something like one, from a large old hinge, this bore too strongly the marks of imposition to gain any credit. There was evidently a determination to create an alarm ; Harold declaring that he only, as their priest, was able to come at the facts, was thought to be aiming at making himself of consequence in the new intended government. He had some time since applied to the Governor for liberty to act as their priest and most un doubtedly had he been Avell affected to the government, he might have been of use to the colony in that office. In consequence of these circumstances and to counteract their effects, a number of the in habitants were formed into tAvo volunteer asso ciations of fifty men each, and called the Sydney and Paramatta Loyal Associated Corps, each commanded by a Captain, tAvo Lieutenants, and a proper number of non-commissioned officers.

To amend the latter inconvenience, it Avas only requisite to Avait an increase of the num bers in the colony, when the price of labour Avould find its proper level, and the high de mands made for articles Avanted, the government of the mother country, Avas now kindly taking means to overcome, by sending them out for the purpose of being retailed to the settlers at a moderate rate, and thus by an ample supply, prevent the groAving evil of monopoly. 3 g"], [484, "410 HISTORY OF On the 21st of October, the Buffalo sailed for England, and the Governor intended to touch at Norfolk Island, to learn from ob servation, the state of that settlement, as some of the Irish prisoners, suspected of laying plans of insurrection, were taken in the Buffalo, to be landed there. As the last information from Avhich place Avore an unpromising aspect, the buildings were in a state of decay, and feAV symptoms of industry Avere visible. Of live stock, only a feAV hogs and a feAV vegetables Avere to be procured. At Phillip Island, on which had been fed a great number of hogs, not one Avas alive, they having, for want of food,, absolutely destroyed each other. A feAV acres of wheat Avere ready for reaping ; but on the whole, Norfolk Island, did not promise to repay the expense it cost. On board of the Buffalo Avere taken two black swans, and three NeAv South Wales emus. Lieutenant Kent avIio returned to England in the Buffalo, previous to his departure,, sold an elegant house he had built at a great expense, which Avas bought to convert into an orphan school, and speedily inhabited by them. How highly honourable it Avas to the pro moters of so laudable an institution ! for cer tainly, in no country under heaven, could such an establishment be more Avanting, as nearly every child might be esteemed an orphan, for, generally speaking, their parents did not de serve the name of fathers or mothers even while alive. 1"], [485, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 411 The following is an account of ground granted and let on lease by the several governors, from the date of the first, the 22d of February 1792, to the 25th Sept. 1800.

A second strong wind-mill tower was erected at Sydney, 36 feet in height. At Sydney a granary, 72 feet in length, and 21 in width, with two floors, was built from the ruins of a mill house, formerly erected with great labour and expense by Lieut, governor Grose. The public roads made good and lepaired at various times, and bridges thrown over the gullie's. A framed bridge built over Duck-river, ca pable of bearing any weight. Two log granaries, 100 feet long, one for wheat and the other for maize, erected at the Hawkesbury on the Green-hills, and inclosed with paling. A similar one at Paramatta, 100 feet in length, and paled round with a strong high fence, like that at Sydney, which was also like that, destroyed by fire. A suite of rooms built of brick at Sydney, be tween the hospitals and dwelling-house of the surgeon, for the use of his assistants; the huts originally built for them, having gone to decay. The huts at Paramatta, built by Governor Phillip for the reception of convicts on their arrival, having been neglected and which had"], [490, "416 HISTORY OF fallen to ruin, were repaired and made fit for the use designed, A wind-mill with a stone tower, built on the hill above Sydney. A double logged gaol, 80 feet long, with se parate cells for prisoners, was built at Sydney, which was afterwards burnt. Eight embrasures to the battery on point Maskelyne, were made, and a redoubt raised with eight embrasures on the point of the cove, and mounted with cannon. And two guns were mounted on Garden Island. An apartment containing threerooms of brick, was built in the yard of the old gaol, before it was burnt, for debtors. A barn 90 feet long, was built at Toongabbe, in which nine pair of threshers could work. The original one built by Governor Phillip hav ing fallen down. Both government houses, the military bar racks, officers' dwellings, store- houses and gra naries, and all public buildings repaired, coated with lime and white-washed, to preserve them from decay. A brick building 100 feet long, built by Go vernor Phillip at Paramatta, was repaired, and two floors laid ; with an addition to its length of 60 feet, for the purpose of a granary for wheat ; there being no building entirely for this use in the colony. A framed and weather-boarded house was built on the Green-hills at the Hawkesbury, for the commanding officer of that district. It"], [491, "417 NEW SOUTH WALES. was shingled, and had a cellar, a kitchen, and other accommodations, and paled round. A weather-boarded store-house, with two wings built at Sydney, which was. on the burn ing of the church converted into a place of worship, till a new church was erected. At Sydney an excellent brick granary was erected, 100 feet long and 22 wide, with three floors. An addition was afterwards made to this building* of about 70 feet, for a kiln to dry the grain. At Paramatta a weather- boarded granary, 140 feet in length, was built for the receptioa of maize. A complete smith's shop for forges, was built at Sydney. A range of barracks at Sydney were built for three officers. The foundation of a church was began at Sydney, of a large size. A handsome church was erected at Para matta, 100 feet in length and 44 in width, with a room 20 feet long, raised on stone pillars, for a vestry or council room. A tower steeple was built at the same place for a town clock. A naval yard was paled in on the west side of the cove, and within it a joiner's and a blacksmith's shop, with sheds for the vessels re pairing, and the workmen, were erected ; with a steamer, a storehouse, a warder's lodge, and an apartment for the clerk. . 5 H"], [492, "418 HISTORY OP A neat thatched hut was built in the govern ment garden at Paramatta, for the gardener. A handsome and commodious stone gaol at Sydney ; with separate apartments for debtors, and six strong cells for condemned felons. A commodious stone-house was built near the naval yard for the master boat-builder. A large and elegant government house was erected at Paramatta, the first being too small, and so gone to decay that the roof fell in. The new building is spacious and roomy, with cellars and an attic story. A new powder magazine was began, a frame was raised, and the roof thatched of an open barn at the Ninety Acres, and a threshing floor was laid. A new dispensary was built, and the pan nelled hospital removed and rose on a stone foundation, and at the same time was erected a new hospital store. Fenced the military barracks with high paling. Enlarged by a scalene building the whole length of each house, the dwellings of the principal surgeon, the senior assistant-surgeon, aud the deputy-surveyor, by which an addi tional accommodation of two rooms were given to each house. Paled in a cooperage adjoining the provision at Sydney. Cleansed from filth the pub lic tanks, and encompassed them and the spring-head -with paling. A military hospital and dispensary, and an officer's guard-room, were built at Sydney."], [493, "419 NEW SOUTH WALES. Sheds for the boats belonging to government when hauled on shote were also built. Laid a new foundation, rebuilt a part of the walls, and repaired the wet provision store at Paramatta. Houses were erected near the hospital at Syd ney, for the nurses and attendants. Repaired, plastered, white-washed, and coat ed with lime, a house for a school at Sydney. Several stock yards for cattle were inclosed, and many old sheds were repaired at Paramatta, Toongabbe, and Portland-place. In the Jatter district, the timber of 120 acres was cut down, and nearly half (that of 50 acres) burnt off, a township marked out, and some few huts built, and a number of inferior buildings. Exclusive of erecting and repairing the fore going public works, detachments were daily employed in preserving the various buildings, the property of the crown, particularly those occupied by that class subordinate to the com missioned officers ; and, as these repairs were necessary to prevent those buildings going to decay, they had been paid every attention to by Governor Hunter. The inclosures of the park and burial ground having suffered by decay, a gang of carpenters and labourers were for a considerable time employed in preparing railing, and putting them up. The judge-advocate's house at Sydney was enlarged and repaired, with several alterations, and out-houses."], [494, "420 HISTORY OF The strength of the public gangs did not permit their being further employed, or it was meant to have built a water-mill at Paramatta. A court-house at the same place, and two new stores, with a guard-house at the Green Hills. The stores were of brick, and the guard-house of weather boards. In the district of Portland Place, a stocks yard, consisting of 30 acres, was inclosed with posts and rails, and included four chains of fresh-water ponds. In the naval department, a vessel was left on the stocks, designed to be of 1,50 or 160 tons burthen, and intended for the purpose of tak ina: the relief to and from Norfolk Island. A boat called the Cumberland was on the stocks, and nearly finished, of 27 tons burthen, meant to be schooner rigged and armed, for the pursuit of deserters, who were in the practice of carrying away the boats of the settlement. In this account of the labour performed for the purylic, under Governor Hunter, is not estimated the time employed for the preparation of the earth for sowing, and the gathering in of the harvests ; so that it must indeed be considered, with no small degree of astonishment, that such a number of buildings should have, by any exertions, been effected, when proper allowance is made for the dispositions of those, who only could be employed in either building or repairing, and when added to the deduction, which thresh ing out the corn for delivery, and unloading"], [495, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 421 the store-ships as they arrived, a proper allow ance of time is made ; it proves that Gover nor Hunter effected the most with the compa ratively little labour he could induce the con victs to perform. Shortly after the departure of Governor Hunter, it appeared on an investigation of the registers of the terms of transportation of the convicts, that the clerks, who had been suffered to have access to them, had altered the senten ces of nearly two hundred prisoners, on receiving a sum from each equal in value to ten or twelve pounds ; and proper steps to guard against so truly serious an evil in future, were taken at the colony, and proper information sent to England on the subject. It now appeared the expenses attending the erecting of the county gaol, had cost the surft of 39541. the greater part of which had been paid by public assessments. Every encouragement being given for the purpose of promoting the growth of wool, for manufacturing 300 yards of blanketing were made from what the wool produced last sea son, from the flocks belonging to government and individuals ; and in five months, 470 yards of flax were made into linen. The neVer-resting spirit of Speculation which continually manifested itself in the arrival of ships, received a serious check by the Gover nor's sending back three vessels from Bengal, on board which were fifty- four thousand gallons of spirits and wine."], [496, "422 HISTORY OF The quantity of copper coin expected having arrived, the Governor published a table of the specie legally in circulation in the colony, af fixing the rates to each, at which they were to be considered a legal tender in all payments, viz.

Ships arrived from India, England, and America, bringing on speculation cargos pf * Except by government."], [497, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 423 Wine, spirits, tobacco, teas, sugar, hardware, wearing apparel, &c. and were publicly sold. By these ships had been imported 59,294 gallons of spirits, 30,896 ditto of wines, out of which were landed 26,974 ditto of spirits, 8,896 dito of wines ; and 32,320 ditto of spi rits, 22,000 ditto of wines, were sent away. By information from Norfolk Island intelli gence was received, that a plot was fortunately discovered, on the 14th of December 1800, formed by some of the convicts to murder the officers, and, by getting possession of the island, to liberate themselves. Two of the ringleaders were immediately executed, and others properly punished. Major Foveaux, the lieutenant-governor, had found the truly desirable long wanted and un known acquisition, a good landing-place for boats and small vessels, in Alison's Bay, where there were four and five fathoms of water only a few yards from the shore, with a fine sandy beach, and a free passage from rocks or shoals. Having at length brought down the History of New South Wales in regular progression, to the close of the eighteenth century, I shall here desist from following the routine of the regular relation of events, and leave the coun try in its settled state, and I shall now proceed to the Natural History of the Island ; that done, I shall, in a concluding Chapter, give a continuance of the History, from the beginning of the year 1801, till the time I forwarded the manuscript to England. S"], [498, "424 HtSTORY OF CHAP. XI. Little versed in studying the divine works of Nature, I have availed myself of the labours of my predecessors, and accompany their re searches with my own observations on the various subjects ; and as I have been assisted with natural historical information from the same high and distinguished characters who have generously favoured me with Colonial historical facts, I shall give undoubtedly a faithful account of the Natural History of New South Wales in its various departments, as far as yet discovered, and, as Pope very justly observes, that \" Want of decency is want of sense.\" I shall by no means introduce any descrip tion that can offend the most delicate mind, or shall I intrude on my readers any account of those productions which seem the inhabitants of nearly all countries, -such as the rat, the bat, the squirrel, &c. &c. meaning only to de scribe those which seem to be more particularly the natives of this country, and were not ge nerally known previous to the establishment of the colony."], [499, "NEW SOUTH WALES. 425 QUADRUPEDS. ORXITHORHYNCHUS PARABOXUS. This animal, which has obtained the name of Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus, is still very little known. It is found only to inhabit fresh water lakes in the interior parts of the country. It swims not on the surface of the water, but comes up to breathe, in the same manner as the turtle. The natives often sit on the banks, with spears and watch their rising to the sur face, till they get a good opportunity of strik ing them, which they do with their usual dexterity, and frequently succeed in catching them. Governor Hunter once saw a native watching one above an hour before he threw his spear at it; but at length he drove it through the neck and fore leg, and when he brought it on shore, it used its claws with such force, that it be came requisite to confine it between two pieces of board, while they cut off the barbs of the spear, to disengage it. When freed, it ran on the ground with as great activity as a land tortoise, which was much faster than the structure of its fore feet seemed to promise. It inhabits the banks of lakes, and feeds in the muddy places which surrounds them; but its food is unknown. The male is 1 74- inches in length, from the point of the bill to the extremity of the tail. 3 1"], [500, "426 HISTORY OF The bill is 2i inches long; and the end of the tail 4-f inches. The animal's body is compressed, and of the fame general thickness, except over the shoul ders, where it is smaller. The circumference of the body is 1 1 inches. In size, the female is rendered rather larger than the male, by a portion of fat lying very generally under the skin, which the male is without. The colour of the male is a very dark brown, on the back, legs, bill, and tail; the under part of the neck and belly is of a silver grey. The hair is of two kinds ; a very fine thick fur, one half an inch long, and a curious kind of hair, nearly an inch long. The part nearest the root has the appearance of hair ; but for a quarter of an inch towards the point it becomes flat, resembling feathers : this has a gloss on it. The fur or hair on the back is shorter than that on the belly. No appearance could be observed of nip ples ; although the skin on the belly of the fe male was examined with the greatest accuracy. The head is compressed. The bill, projects beyond the mouth, and in its appearance resem bles that of a duck ; but is in fact more like that of the spoonbill, the middle part being composed of bone, as in that bird : it has a very strong covering. The nostrils are close to each other, near the end of the bill; and the upper lip projects three quarters of an inch beyond them."], [501, "427 NEW SOUTH WALES. The eyes are small; situated more on the upper part of the head than usual, and are be hind the loose edge of the flap belonging to the bill. The eyelids are concealed in the hair, and, in the male, are scarcely seen ; but the female has a tuft of lighter hair, which marks their situa tion. The cars are two large slits, behind the eyes, and larger than the orifices of the eyelids. The teeth are all grinders ; and are four in. number, one on each side of the upper and under jaw, and have broad flat crowns. They differ from common teeth materially, having neither enamel nor bone, being composed of a horny substance only, connected by an irregu lar surface in the place of fangs. When cut through which is readily done, the internal struc ture is like the human nail. Between the cheek and the jaw, on each side of 'the mouth, there is a pouch, as in the mon key tribe. When laid open, it is 1-f- inch long, and the same in breadth. In the female it con tains a substance, the size of a small nut, in each pouch. Besides these teeth, there are two small point ed horny teeth upon the projecting part of the posterior portion of the tongue, the points of w Li h are directed forwards, to prevent the food being pushed into the fauces during the process of mastication ; which circumstance is peculiar to this animal. The fore legs are short, and the feet webbed. Each foot has five toes, united by the web,"], [502, "428 HISTORY OF which is very broad, and is continued beyond the points of the toes nearly an inch. On each toe there is a rounded straight nail, which lies loose upon the membrane forming the web. The hind legs are nearly of the same length as the forelegs, but stronger. Each foot has five toes with claws, and webbed. The male, on the heel, has a strong crooked spur, with a sharp point, which has a joint be tween it and the foot, and is capable of mo tion in two directions. When the point of it is brought close to the leg, the spur is con cealed in the hair ; -when directed outwards, it projects considerably, and is conspicuous. The tail in shape is like that of the beaver. THE TAPOA TAFA, OR TAPIIA, Is the size of a rat, though its formation gives it the appearance of the martin cat, but that its body, compared to its size, is not so long. The head, which is broad from side to side, is in front flat ; the nose, which is pointed, projects beyond the teeth ; the eyes are large ; the ears broad and end in points. The nature and colour of its hair resembles that of the rat, and it has wiskers from the nose to the eyes; the hind feet are longer, and more flexible than the fore. On each foot there are five toes, and of those on the fore feet, the middle toe i*3 the largest,, the rest fall off progressively ; the"], [503, ""], [504, "[iJ>li.riutlNov.6.i8o'i,%y At.Ji>n*s Pa.tfrti\u00a3>stsr Row."], [505, "429 NEW SOUTH WALES. nails are short and sharp ; on the sole of the foot there is no hair ; the tail is long, and co vered with hair of a mixed grey colour. THE TAPOA TAFA Is only a variety of the Tapoa Tapha, and that in its external appearance, being covered with black and white markings of various shapes. \u25a0rilA TAPOAU ROO. This animal in size resembles the racoon ; the colour, which is grey on the back, be comes lighter on the sides, and changes to a rich brown on the belly; the hair is of two sorts, long hair, and a kind of fur. The Wha Tapoau Roo has a very short head, with pro minent eyes and broad ears. Its tail is long, and covered with hair, except the under part towards the end. On the fore feet are five toes, the shortest of which appears like a thumb; the hind feet resemble those of the monkey, having no nail on the great toe, and being bare on the sole. THE DOG, OR DINGO. The native dog of New South Wales re sembles very much the foundation of the spe cies, which is the Wolf, though it is consi derably smaller, and stands lower ; but from its 3"], [506, "430 HISTORY OF ill-nature and viciousness, which indeed no thing overcomes, it may with great propriety be esteemed the wolf of the country. The Dog or Dingo barks in a way peculiar to itself, but moans, snarls, and howls like other dogs. Its general colour is a reddish dun, covered with long thick strait hair, and has short erect ears and a bushy tail ; the nose, belly, and feet, are of a blue grey colour. THE POTO ROO, OR KANGAROO RAT. The head of this animal is not so flat on a side view as the Scalpis Dentata. It has ears formed like those of a mouse. The hind legs compared to the fore are long ; on the fore legs are four toes, the two middle of which are longest, and of the same length, with long bent nails. On their hind feet they have three toes, the middle one of which is the largest; the tail is long; the body has a mixed covering of hair and fur of a brownish grey colour. This curious animal, which is indeed a mi niature of the Kangaroo, has a pouch also on the lower part of the belly, for carrying its young in cases of danger or pursuit, on the surface of which are placed four nipples near each other. the hepoona roo.

Between the fore and hind legs, on the side is a skin, which on the extension of the less form a broad wing ; but when the legs are used in walking, it draws close up to the side of the animal, thus resembling the flying squirrel. On each fore foot it has five toes, with sharp nails, and on the hind toes it has the same number ; but one may be termed rather a thumb, as it has a broad nail like a monkey. The foot is well calculated for holding the animal in a sus pended state ; the hair is thick and long on the back, and of a brown-grey colour. THE KANGAROO. This animal appears the most important in the country ; its size is considerable, and it supplies both food and clothing, if an apron may be so called, to the inhabitants. It has a small bead, neck, and shoulders, and the body increases in thickness to the rump, from whence it again tapers to the tail. The head is oblong, and in form like that of a fawn, the upper lip being divided. The nos trils are wide and open, and the lower jaw is lewhat shorter than the upper. The pupil of the eyes is of a blueish black, and the irides are dusky. The ears are erect, ovated, and thin at the ends. The hair of the Kangaroo is of a greyish brown colour, somewhat similar to the English wild rabbit. It is thick and long, when the"], [510, "432 HISTORY OF animal becomes old ; but is very slow in its growth, and for some time resembles a strong down. In some parts, however, the mouth for example, it begins earlier to be hairy. This animal's teeth are so singular, that it is impossible to decide, from them, to what class the Kangaroo belongs. It has four broad cutting teeth in the upper jaw ; but only two long lanceolated teeth in- the lower, which point forwards, and are so placed as to oppose those of the upper. It has also four grinding teeth in each jaw, remote from the others ; and possesses the very singular power of sepa rating the lower inoisores, and bringing them again close to each other. The proportions in some of the parts of this animal bear no analogy to what is common in most others. The fore legs are so very short, as scarcely to reach the nose, and are indeed useless for Avalking. The hind legs are almost as long as the body, and the thighs are very thick. On the fore feet are five toes, with long conic and strong black claws ; but on the hind feet are only three, the middle toe being very long and thick, like that of an ostrich, and extending far beyond the two others, which are small, and placed very distinct from it. The inner toe of the hind feet is singularly distinguished, bv bavin\": two small claws ; and the bottom and hind parts of the feet, on which the animal often rests, are black, naked, and tuberc'u-"], [511, "433 NEW SOUTH WALES. lated. The tail, which is thick at the base, and tapers to a point, has at the end a strong hard nail, and the hair on it is short and some what bard. The tail, though long in the old, is in the young short proportionably to the animal's size. It seems to keep pace with the growth of the hind legs, which are the instru ments of progressive motion in this animal, and Avhich would also shew that the tail is a kind of second instrument in this action. The scrotum, which is large and pendulous, is placed before; and the female has, on the belly, an oblong pouch, of a vast depth, the receptacle of her young. The Kangaroo is frequently more than six feet long, from the nose to the tail ; and its weight of a hundred and fifty pounds and upwards. Kangaroo is the natives name for this extra ordinary animal. It lurks among the grass, feeds on vegetables, and drinks by lapping. It goes chiefly on it's hind legs ; making use of the fore feet as hands, only for digging, or bringing its food to its mouth. The Kangaroo is timid : at the sight of men it flies from them by amazing leaps ; springing over bushes seven or eight feet high, and go ing progressively from rock to rock. When in motion, this animal carries its tail quite at right angles with its body ; and, as it alights, often looks back. It is much too swift for greyhounds, and frequently escapes from j K."], [512, "434 HISTORY OF the fleetest of those animals. The tail is its weapon of defence, with which it is capable of beating away the strongest dog. The Kangaroo soon becomes domesticated when taken. Mr. Pennant, the celebrated English natu ralist, gives the following account of one he saw in London, during 1793: \" It was (says Mr. P.) in a place of con finement ; it for a little time went on all fours, but soon assumed an upright attitude. It would sport with its keeper in a very singular manner : it first placed its tail in a perpendi cular manner ; erected its body on it as a prop ; and then, raising its whole body, darted its hind legs on the breast of the man. It was capable of striking with great force, if pro voked ; and it could scratch violently witli its fore claws.\""], [513, ""], [514, "\u2014 -~ \u2014 \"\"\" V.Woo&horptJc.

THE R1RD OF PARADISE OF NEW SOUTH WALES. This elegant bird, which by some is called the Bird of Paradise, and by others the M\u00e6 nura Superba, has a straight bill, with the nostrils in the centre of the beak. The base of the upper mandible has hairs like feathers in clining downwards, the upper mandible is at the base much like that of the pigeon. The eye is a dark hazle, with a bare space around it of a blue cast. The chin, and a small part of the throat, are of a dark rufous colour : the rest, with the body, of a blackish grey. The rump feathers are longer than those of the body, and more divided. The colour of the wings is dark rufous. The legs and claws are large in proportion to the bird. The outward toe is connected with that in the middle as far as the first joint. The tail is long, and com posed of three sorts of feathers, of which the upper side is of a dark grey, with ferruginous spots. The first two lower feathers, which are curved in two directions, are beneath of a pearl colour, with several crescent-shaped spaces, of a rich red and black colour. The lamin\u00e6 are unwebbed, rounded towards the extremity, or namented with a black bar, and fringed at the Cfld. The shaft of the second, also long, is"], [518, "436 HISTORY OF fringed with hair-like filaments; and the third, which is long and curved, is plumed on the inner side only, except at the extremity. The female differs little from the male, ex cept in the tail, which is formed of 12 feathers a little curved and plumed, having the upper side dark rufous and grey, and the under of a pearl colour. These birds frequent the most retired parts of the country, and have been seen running very fast; but their cumbrous tails prevent them from being able to fly in a direct line. They sing for two hours in the morning, beginning when they quit the valley, till they attain the summit of the hill, where they scrape to gether a small hillock ; on this they stand, with their tail spread over them, and in this situation they imitate the note of every bird in the country, and then they return to the valley. WHITE FULICA. This bird is the only species of the genus known of this colour. Its body is the size of a large fowl, and on its wings are a small spine. The legs and spines on the shoulders of the wings are yellow; the bill and front of the head are red. BLUE BELLIED PARROT.

BLACK OR BANKSIAN COCKATOO. The general colour of the black Cockatoo of New South Wales is a rusty black, with long feathers on the head, on the top of which is a fine mixture of yellow. The beak is brown, and on the under side of the tail are several fine scarlet feathers, with black markings and tips. FULLIGINOUS PETERIL. The beak of this bird is of a pale yellow hue, but the bird is in all other parts of a deep brown or blackish colour; except that on the chin there is a marking of white descending from the lower mandible. This bird is most cer tainly only a variety of the \u00c6quinoctialis of Linn\u00e6us. In size it equals the English Raven. AVHITE VENTED CROW.

This truly remarkable bird is very shy, and when seen, runs Avith the speed of a grey hound ; its flesh is good food, being as tender as the best beef. CRESTED GOATSUCKER. This genus of birds are particularly large mouthed, in comparison to the smallness of their beaks. The colours of the Crested Goat sucker are cinereous, pale-broAvn sprinkled with white spots on the under parts, Avith the long feathers of the tail sprinkled with pale fasci\u00e6, and the ribrissae standing up on the upper man dible like a crest. The name of Goatsucker arose in conse quence of an ancient opinion of their sucking goats, &c.

This bird is both an object of Avonder and feat among the natives, for it frequently takes up a kangaroo, a dog, or a sheep, and probably they have little doubt but, that if driven by hunger and nothing else offered, the Mountain Eagle would descend for the purpose of carrying off a native WATTLED bee-eater, In size this bird must be compared to the Missel Thrush, though larger in its proportions.

The footstalks are about half an inch in length, round on the un der side, angular above, quite smooth. The floAvers grow in clusters, from six to eight in each, sessile and conglomerated. These clus ters are supported on angular alternate foot stalks, which form a kind of panicle.

The wood is extremely brittle, and, from the large quantity of resinous gum Avhich it contains, is of little use but for firewood. The flowers grow iu little clusters, or rather umbels, about ten in each, and every flower has a proper partial foot stalk, about a quarter of an inch in length, besides the general one. The geneial footstalk is remarkably compressed, and the partial ones are so in some degree. The flowers are yel lowish, and of a singular structure.

This calyptra, Avhich is the essential mark of the genus, and differs from that of the Euca lyptus obliqua of L'Heritier only in being co nical and acute, instead of hemispherical, is perfectly entire, and never splits or divides, though it is analogous to the corolla of other plants. When it is removed, a great number of red stamina are seen standing in a conical mass, Avhich before the calypta is taken off* are completely C0A*ered by it, and silled in the inside. The Anther\u00e6 are small and red. In the centre of these stamina is a single style or pointal, rising a little above them, and termi nated by a blunt stigma. The stamina are very resinous and aromatic. They are inserted into the margin of the calyx, so that the genus is properly placed by Mr. L'Heritier in the class Icosandria. These stamina and style be ing removed, and the germen cut across about the middle of the calyx, it appears to be di vided into three cells, each containing the ru- diments of one or more seeds.

The varnish which it makes Avith either is very Aveak, and of little use. With respect to its medicinal qualities, Mr. White has found it, in many cases, a good pectoral medicine, and very balsamic.

A great number of birds being perceived about this bank, they endeavoured to make for it, in the hopes of killing some of them and gathering ea-ffs, but found that the boat was drifting to the leeward of the bank ; they therefore hauled doAvn the sail, and endeavoured to row up to it, but found themselves so exhausted for Avant of food and Avater, that it Avas impossible to make their Avay tOAvards the bank ; indeed so much had that attempt fatigued them, that it Avas witjb. the greatest difficulty they could ac complish stepping the mast and again hoisting the sail. \" This fatigue, after the boat Avas again on her course, occasioned them to repine and mur mur at their misfortunes ; but reflection on the goodness of that providence who so far had pro tected them, changed it into a perfect reliance on his mercy. \" On the 7th in the morning, they found two small birds in the boat, one of Avhich they im mediately divided into three parts, each devour ing his share Avith the keenest sensations of hun- 4"], [577, "NEAV SOUTH AVALES. 483 ger : the other bird Avas reserved for another meal. Even Avith this small share of sustenance their spirits were considerably raised :\u2014 they still steering to the Westward ; the sun being their guide by day, and the stars by night. \" Shortly after sun-set this day they found themselves in shoal Avater, and breakers all round them ; however, they stood on till about nine at night, when, having deepened to about five fa thom, it was proposed by Mr. Shaw, and agreed to, that they should come to and rest themselves for the night. \" On the 8th in the morning, they discovered land on both sides of them, Avhich Avas at first very discouraging, but Mr. Shaw, perceiving a current setting to the Westward, conjectured that there was a passage through, and that after clearing the land they should find an open sea, by which means they might shortly reach Timor. \" Having, therefore, stood in between the islands, they found there Avas a passage between them, and, not perceiving any signs of inhabit ants, agreed to land and look for water : Mr. Shaw and Mr. Haskett accordingly landed, and finding a hole full of Avater, Mr. Shaw could not refrain from drinking heartily of it ; after which*, however, and that a keg of it had been filled, it Avas found to be as brackish as the Avater alongside. \" They stood on through these straights, which they named God's Mercy. In the after noon Mr. Carter's Abound became very painful ;"], [578, "484 HISTORY OF and on Mr. Haskett's opening it to wash it as usual Avith salt Avater, he found three pieces of the skull had worked out ; which circumstance, hoAvever, he did not communicate to Mr. Car ter, but, on the contrary, gave him every as surance of its doing well. \" Mr. Carter, having been very weak from the opening of the Avound, the throat of the re maining bird was cut and applied to Mr. Car ter's mouth, and, yielding a few drops of blood, gave him great relief. They divided the bird in the same manner they had done the Other. \" On the morning of the ninth, Mr. Carter was so much reduced as to be under the neces sity of drinking his OAvn urine, Avhich example was followed by the other two, and notAvith standing its being disagreeable, they found great relief from it. About nine at night Mr. ShaAV and Mr. Haskett found themselves so weak and overcome by sleep, that not being able to stand to the steer oar, they lashed the oar, and found the boat Avent along very stea dily. After joining in a prayer of thanksgiving to the Almighty, to whose protection they com mitted themselves, they lay down and had a re freshing sleep ; occasionally, hoAvever, they could not refrain from starting up to look out for land or danger. : They resumed their labours at the oar on the morning of the 10th, Avhich Avere rather increas ed by its bloAving fresh and by a heavy swell, which obliged tfyem to reef the sail.

But on Mr. Carter's being helped out of the boat, it Avas found he could not stand : he Avas there fore helped in again, and Mr. Haskett Avith Mr. ShaAV advanced towards the natives, Mr. ShaAV having a Avater keg and Mr. Haskett a musquet, Avhen they Avere overjoyed by hearing the natives cry out, \" Bligh !

They made motions to the natives for cocoa nuts, Avho gave them to understand that they did not belong to them ; one of them however gave Mr. Shaw a baked yam, which he found it impossible to eat on account of his throat being so exceedingly parched. Having made signs for Avater, the natives led them to a spring, Avhere they quenched their thirst; Avhen, having filled the keg, they ran to Mr. Carter, who Avas calling out for water, after which they devoured the yam with the greatest eagerness, the natives looking at them the Avhole of the time in astonishment. \" After their slender repast, they mentioned the Avord Timor to the natives, avIio repeated it very distinctly, and pointed towards the point"], [582, "488 HISTORY OF to the SouthAvard, and then to a prow on the beach, intimating that they Avould conduct them there ; in consequence of Avhich Mr. Shaw gave them tAvo musquets and a number of knives and scissars Avhich remained in the boat. \" The natives made signs to go farther up the bar, Avhich they acquiesced in; but finding they wished to lead them up a very narrow in let, Mr. Shaw refused to go in Avith the boat, representing that it AVQuld be highly imprudent, and as they Avished to get to Cupang as soon as possible, thought it adviseable to make the best of their Avay there. \" This being agreed to, the boat was pushed off, a\u00bbd two oars got out in order to row round the point, expecting, after that, to have a fair Avind to Cupang.

They then lay doAvn to sleep, and on Avaking in the morning were refreshed with the smell of spices, Avhich was conveyed by the land Avind, and Avhich so revived Mr. Carter that he several times exclaimed, \" Keep up your hearts, my boys, Ave shall dine Avith the GoA*ernor of Cu- pang to-day.\" Their hopes Avere hoAvever frus- trated by the numerous difficulties they had yet to encounter, owing to the innumerable shoals and points, The Avater they had drank tended likeAvise to increase their appetites. They Avere forced at night, notwithstanding, to pursue the same method they had formerly adopted in order to obtain sufficient rest to en able them to go through the fatigues of the ensuing day. \" On the morning of the 13th, Mr. Shaw took the steer oar; but the wind being fresh, and the boat going with great velocity through the Avater, he was, from Aveakness, unable to stand the force of the oar, and fell o\\*erboard : luckily, however, he held by the gunnel until Mr. Haskett came to his assistance, Avhen Avith great exertions he was got into the boat again. \" Shortly after this they saAV a point a-head, Avhich thay found it impossible toAveather while the Avind remained the same Avay. They, there fore, once more determined to land, ahd ac cordingly ran into a small bay ; when the natives came running towards them, beckoning 3 R"], [584, "490 HISTORY OF them to come ashore, and calling out, \" Bligh !

When they had brought them on shore, they presented them with a couple of cocoa-nuts, yams, and Indian corn, Avhich they received Avith unfeigned gratitude. \" The natives gazed on these three famished sufferers in silent astonishment : nor is it to be Avondered at ; for their cheeks Avere shrivel led, their eyes sunk almost into their heads, their beards long, and their Avhole frames to tally emaciated. \" The natives, far from disturbing them, made signs for them to eat and drink, Avhich they did Avith the greatest eagerness. Mr. Carter then begged to have his Avound dressed, Avhich Avas done with fresh Avater. Mr. Shaw having unbound his Avound, found it nearly healed. \" The natives appearing to express some cu riosity as to the manner in which those wounds Avere received, Mr. ShaAV explained it in the best manner he could, at Avhich they made sio;ns of beino- much shocked, Avhich did not however fully satisfy the three gentlemen of their pacific intentions ; but as they beckoned to proceed on towards their huts, they com plied, which gave the natives apparently great satisfaction."], [585, "491 NEAV SOUTH WALES. \u25a0 They then attempted to get up and walk, but they could not accomplish it without sup port, -which the natives very kindly afforded them, and led them to their town, Avhich is si tuated at the top of a steep hill, accessible only by two perpendicular ladders, up Avhich they Avere lifted by their guides.

The discoveries of coal, tin, iron, &c. &c. open the doors of commercial intercourse, sufficiently to prove, that Avhatever articles the country might here after stand in need of, may be procured by the endless resources of its own natural produc tions. The unfortunate circumstances which occa- sionally distress the country, both in conse- quence of the extreme heats and overflowing of the Hawkesbury, Avill undoubtedly become evils of less serious magnitude, as cultivation becomes still more generally diffused; for the slightest observation Avill shew, that had the country in the interior, been in a state of cul- tivation, the rains Avhich sAvelled the HaAvkes- bury Avould have been absorbed, as they de- scended instead of rolling down the smooth sur- faces of the hilly parts, and thus in one grand body, rushing into the Hawkesbury. Of this indeed, I am fully convinced, for as the pur- suits of Agriculture extend, the violent rains *are attended with less dreadful consequences, Avhich proves evidently, that in process of time, no ill effect will result from them. But on the contrary, the earth Avhen in a state of culti vation in the interior, will naturally be moist ened and improved by the rains, and the moisture so received, will resist the heats which . occasionally distress the settlers, by setting the whole surface of the country on sire ; and as the nature of the soil is so particularly prolific as to afford two annual crops. New South Wales"], [590, "496 HISTORY OF may in time prove a second Poland, by becom ing the Granary of the World ! ! ! The difficulties the officers have, from the foundation of the Colony had to combat, de serves absolute pity, for what a scene of misery has been their portion, born and educated in affluence, nurtured in splendour, and accus tomed to elegance, fashion, politeness, and all the enjoyments of refined life ; Ave find them snatched suddenly away, and placed through national necessity, between a numerous body of vile convicts, and an innumerable body of sa- vages, with only the very slender barrier of a feAV military. Thus situated, their strength could only be increased by the very few of those convicts returning to a proper knowledge of themselves. Dangerous indeed must be ima gined, the situation of these gentlemen, and dangerous indeed it Avas ; but fortunately their OAvn conduct was such, that ensured them re spect, fear and love at the same time, and bad indeed as the coiwiets have been found, from the beginning to the end of the History of the Colony, not one has been found so lost, as to offer any personal injury to any of the officers. In continuing this retrospect, the poor na tives next interest my attention : their natures, Avhich are naturally savage, could but ill brook being driven from any part of their native coun try, and though offered no personal violence, at the foundation of the Colony, that spirit of revenge, so truly congenial to their natures, manifested itself by far too powerfully on every"], [591, "497 NEAV SOUTH WALES. occasion. True, it most certainly is, that some of the convicts continually committed those depredations, which must have cried loudly, and have obtained redress, had they been exe cuted on other persons. The consequence of course followed, for the natives knoAving no superior power, sought redress in their own Avay ; but doubtless, had they never had just cause to be offended, the greatest benefit might have been gained by their labours, Indeed, noAV they begin to understand the English language a little, many are found particularly useful, and live regularly at the settlement, on the earn ings of their own industry, and possess disposi tions of the most amiable kind. Though there are undoubtedly, continually others, who, after living some time amongst our people, quit all the comforts of the Colony, for the savage asso ciation of the Avild natives; but this may cer tainly be accounted for on two grounds ; a na tural savage ignorance, or a total abhorrence of labour, to which cause must be attributed, the primary motive which occasioned many of the convicts visiting the country. It is therefore, by no means wonderful, that these savages to tally unacquainted Avith any employment, should quit absolute labour, till they obtained a pro per knowledge of all the various enjoyments they might obtain, by the exertion of that labour. As the natives associate with the inhabitants of the settlements, they very rapidly become en- 3 s"], [592, "498 HISTORY OF lightened, and have in many cases been known to give the first intelligence, of any breach of public orders issued by the Government. This has gained them the esteem of some, and the censure of others ; indeed, several have been so disgusted with the criminal proceedings of the convicts toAvards each other, that they have sought rather the habits of the former part of their lives, than live with those who Avould in jure each other wilfully. It is hoAvever, to be hoped, that as the settlements; increase in culti vation and population, the natives will have bet ter examples and fewer temptations to do in juries ; for, there are noAT nearly One thousand young persons living, all born in the country, who, it is fondly hoped, Avill become good and useful members of society ; in which case, a few years will remove all those fears, either from mischief to be dreaded from the natives or con victs, that continually alarm the Government and better sort of settlers. Some of the natives are now very regular in attending divine Avor ship, and even those totally unacquainted with the language, behave Avith the greatest propriety, Avhich respect, undoubtedly arises from an ex planation received by them, from those of their felloAV natives ; who have not only acquired the language, but can both read and understand the scriptures. How opposite has been, gene rally speaking, the conduct of the convicts, horn in a country where the poorest and meanest of the people are taught the value of the"], [593, "499 NEW SOUTH WALES. scriptures they have neglected, nay even des pised them. The actions of their lives form but one dreadful chain of events, only con nected by a series of uniform depravity, Avhich no admonitions could repress, no laws restrain, and no punishment reform. The regulations adopted by the Government, either for the general good of the settlements, or even for the particular benefit of the con victs themselves, have not only been neglected, but prevented being carried into effect. Even the restrictions the convicts Avere Avished to observe, as to confining themselves within a given space, though it concerned the safety of their own lives, they by no means regarded, notwithstanding examples frequently met their eyes, of those Avho paid for their rashness with their lives. The A'arious escapes attempted and effected in spite of every regulation, every danger, or every fatal instance of those, Avho by such vain endeavours fell sacrifices to their folly, had no beneficial effect on the minds of the depraved inhabitants. But this certainly arose from that detestation of labour, which nearly all so uniformly inherited, and which there seems even yet to be no very efficient means of overcoming : for at this period even the warden grounds allowed to many of the convicts are not cultivated, as they prefer rather wasting the time allowed them for that purpose, than to make a proper use of it.

It is in deed much to be lamented, that every ship nearly which visited the country, furnished those disposed Avith the means of procuring spi rits in the most unreasonable quantities, not withstanding the prohibitions of the govern ment, and that scarce a vessel left the country without assisting some to make their escapes. This perhaps unsettled most of those avIio Avould otherwise haA-e been contented ; for as every arrival revived their hopes of escape, so did it cause them to neglect their duty to attempt getting away. These, added to the repeated and unfortunate shortness of provisions Avith which the colony Avas formerly visited, might be an additional motive for such attempts \"being made.

When the time shall arrive, that a more regu lar communication is kept up between New South Wales and the mother country, Avhich there is every reason to expect Avill shortly take place, in consequence of the representations which GoArernor Hunter promised on leaving the colony to make to Government, there can be no doubt but many advantages Avill result to both countries, though more particularly to this ; and should it be thought proper by Go vernment to suffer some honest families to come out as settlers, there can be no doubt but it Avould prove most highly beneficial to them selves and the settlements, as that spirit of monopoly which has in several instances mani fested itself, would by that means be broken, if not entirely overcome, as there would be a greater number ready to buy the cargos thar might arrive for sale, and consequently an in creased number of retailers, which would oc casion a necessity of selling the articles at a more moderate price.
