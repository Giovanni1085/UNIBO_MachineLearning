Notwithstanding the valuable labours of Burns, Ramsay, and others, in furnishing verses for our Scottish Melodies, there still remain some airs of great beauty, which are unprovided with suitable words. In many of these, the old words are so coarse, or absurd, as to exhibit a revolting contrast to the dSlicacy and beauty of the airs to which they belong : and, not unfre quently, their absolute indecency condemns them to proscription with that sex whose sensibility, taste, and voice, are calculated to give the music its highest charm. Allan Ramsay (whose other performances exhibit a remarkable inferiority to his matchless Dramatic Pastoral of the Gentle Shepherd) has written many songs ; but his suc cess has not been great. Even those in the Gentle Shepherd are by far the least prominent of its beauties. Most of those in his publica tions of the Evergreen and the Tea- Table Mis-"], [6, "INTRODUCTION. IV cellany \u2014 (whether written by himself, or by other contributors of his time) \u2014 are of very mo derate merit ; and are, in general, deformed either by coarseness on the one hand, or by a mawkish classical affectation on the other. Of the songs of Burns it is needless to speak. The consenting admiration of his country has long pronounced their character. To Mr George Thomson, Scotland owes a debt of lasting grati tude for having called forth that mighty voice in a congenial labour of love ; and for having col lected and published the corresponding airs, with an industry and good taste, which have spread the Melodies of Scotland over many lands, and made our vocal treasures the companion and charm of the civilized world.* There still remain, however, the Author has persuaded himself, some good airs not furnished with suitable words ; and this want he has at tempted to supply in the following pages. To wards a task so difficult he can pretend to bring no qualifications, except an early delight in our native music ; with the advantage of having passed many of his younger years in the country, * It would be unjust here to omit, that to Female Authors we are indebted for three of the finest sets of words for Scot tish Melodies: \u2014 two for the Flowers of the Forest, and one for Auld Robin Gray."], [7, "INTRODUCTION. V and in the most familiar intercourse with our Scottish peasantry. Without this, it is impos sible to acquire a thorough knowledge of their feelings, habits, prejudices, and language ; \u2014 with their mode of thinking and mode of speak ing : \u2014 and unless this be attained, in vain will any one attempt to supply words to their native songs. The Author had the advantage, at the same period, of hearing our best Scottish airs sung by persons of refined musical taste ; in whom the most perfect scientific culture had not impaired the relish of our native music, in its original simplicity and purity. This is a combination seldom to be met with, at the present day, when more elaborate and complicated systems of music have much superseded the simple melodies of our forefathers. This, however, is a disunion which, to the Author, seems by no means neces sary or inevitable. He conceives it quite pos sible that a sound musical taste may, at the same time, retain a relish for the simple native melo dies of Scotland, Ireland, or any other country, and for the more elaborate and complex harmo nies of the Italian or German school. The Author must own that he has little hope of ever again hearing Scottish music sung in the same perfection as that in which he has formerly"], [8, "VI INTRODUCTION. heard it ; \u2014 for the art itself, as well as the taste which understood and relished it, have almost passed away. But he thinks that something may still be done towards its preservation and revival, by instilling good doctrine into youthful minds, \u2014 continuing it by sound tradition, \u2014 and providing the means of its practical exercise, by furnishing suitable words for the music. Mr Tytler of Woodhouselee (author of the Vindication of Mary Queen of Scots), a person eminent in musical science \u2014 but nurtured among the pure ivells undefiled of genuine Scottish Song \u2014 has declared that no one can properly sing a Scottish air, except an individual born and bred in Scotland. \" A Scots song,\" says he, \" can only be sung in taste by a Scots voice.\" * In this opi nion the Author is somewhat disposed to concur ; for though he has heard historically of one not a native of Scotland being able to sing a Scottish song, such a phenomenon has never been pre sented to his waking sense : And often has he listened, with the sufferings of a martyr, to the barbarous trucidation committed by some ac complished English artist, on Auld Robin Gray, * See Mr Tytler's Dissertation on Scottish Music, printed in the Appendix to Arnot's History of Fdinburgh. Mr Tytler does, however, afterwards make a qualified exception in the case of Tenducci, the celebrated Italian singer."], [9, "INTRODUCTION. VII Nid, nid, noddin', the Bush aboon Traquair, or the Braes of Yarrow. \"Were there no other obstacle, the ludicrous mis-pronunciation of the Scottish language, which must attach to all fo reigners, throws an air of burlesque over passages whose sentiment is serious, or even pathetic. But. besides this, there is a peculiar character in the Scottish \u2014 as in all national music \u2014 indelibly in terwoven with both language and manners, \u2014 which makes it impossible for any one fully to comprehend, or give expression to, the music of Scotland, who has not been familiar, from his infancy, with the feelings, usages, and dialect, of its people. Besides a general familiarity with the people of Scotland, and their usages, there are, as it ap pears to the Author, three requisites indispen sable towards the writing of good words for Scot tish songs ; \u2014 not to mention the most indispen sable of all, \u2014 a poetical genius. The first of these is a thorough command of the national dialect. This is an accomplish ment so rare, that, of all the moderns who have attempted it, the Author knows only of three who have succeeded, \u2014 Ramsay, Burns, and Sir Wal ter Scott : \u2014 and even Ramsay has often failed, except in his Gentle Shepherd. Under this head of Language, is included not merely an acquaint-"], [10, "INTRODUCTION. VIII ance with vocables, in all their shades of meaning ; but a familiarity with the idiomatic and proverbial phrases,\u2014 the manner of thinking, and turns of expression, \u2014 usual among our rural population, who speak their native dialect in greater purity than the lower orders of large towns. Besides this, an extensive knowledge of the language en ables a writer to select the pleasing, characteris tic, and euphonious expressions, and avoid such as are coarse, ill-sounding, or disagreeable. The legitimate Scottish language is not to be con founded with the provincial barbarisms of Eng land, or other countries ; but is a remnant of the ancient English tongue, as used by the original classical authors of England, \u2014 by Chaucer, Spen cer, Shakespear : \u2014 And indeed so late as the days of Elizabeth, and Mary Queen of Scots, the lan guage of the two countries was nearly identical. Many Scotsmen, of the educated classes of so ciety, are still alive, who remember that, in their youth, their parents and relations, and many per sons of the highest rank and accomplishments, spoke their native dialect, almost with the same intonation and pronunciation as the lower orders ; though with a greater selection of expressions. It was from this recollection that Sir Walter Scott derived that fine discrimination of language which distinguishes the conversation of the Ba-"], [11, "INTRODUCTION. IX ron of Bradwardine, or Lady Margaret Bellen den, from that of Dandy Dinmont, or Cuddy Headrigg ; \u2014 a distinction of which no English or foreign reader is probably sensible. There is, therefore, pure and corrupt Scots, as there is pure and corrupt English ; and Scottish composition admits of good taste and selection as well as English. This ancient distinction of language between the higher and lower classes, in Scotland, was, however, so slight, that the former may be used, now-a-days, in representing the dialect of the people, without the smallest violation of nature. It may also be observed, that, in Comic or Bur lesque Songs, words may be used which would be unsuitable in those of a graver character.* To the Author it further appears, that the Scottish language is, in many respects, peculiarly fitted for adaptation to music, by possessing a Doric naivete, simplicity, and melody, in many * The great mistake of the usual adventurers in Scottish composition is to over-Scolify. It must never be forgotten, that even the humblest peasant in Scotland, in his ordinary speech, uses ten English words for one strictly Scottish ; though his pronunciation of the former be, no doubt, very unlike that of England. It is also an error to attempt the expressing of the exact Scottish pronunciation by English orthography. The thing is really impossible ; and the result commonly is, to render the language unintelligible both to Scotsmen and Eng lishmen."], [12, "INTRODUCTION. X of the vocables, as well as in the idiomatic phrases. These suit well with the simple music to which they are applied. There is occasionally a soft ness and smoothness in the combinations of the vowels, which slide into the notes of the mu sic with an almost Italian sweetness. These beauties, however, it is not every hand or ear which can attain.* In the second place, it is necessary for one who composes words for Scottish songs, to be ac quainted, not merely with the Scottish language in general, but with the peculiar phraseology and mode of composition used in our ancient songs. In this way alone can he attain that idiomatic simplicity and naivete by which, in the success ful instances, our songs are distinguished, and which form their peculiar charm. Everything resembling effort or endeavour, \u2014 refinement or over-ornament, \u2014 must be avoided; as inconsistent with the Doric simplicity both of the thoughts and the music. A sort of infantine carelessness * The softness of the Scottish pronunciation is considerably promoted by the elision of the final consonant in words, and leaving the termination in a vowel, or a liquid consonant : such as a', ca\\ for all, call, &c. ; yoursell. himsell, for yourself, himself, &c. Many particular words are also liquid and eu phonious, as gloamin' for twilight, sowm' for faming, dool for grief, whin or broom for furze or gorse, burn for rivulet, brae for declivity, wimple for the undulation of running water, &c."], [13, "INTRODUCTION. XI and naivete is even becoming : But this is a ha zardous attempt, and runs the risk of falling into a mawkish inanity, \u2014 the last and lowest stage of poetical declension. One of the greatest diffi culties in writing words for Scottish songs, is to preserve the distinction between simplicity and childishness. But, above all, in adapting words to Scottish melodies, the quality of ease is indispensable. There must be no inversion, no involution, no stiffness, no labour, no effort ; \u2014 the words must come trippingly off the tongue, and seem to drop into their places as if the utterer could not help it. But, in the third place, all these acquirements will be unavailing towards the composition of good words for Scottish songs, unless the com poser have a correct musical ear, \u2014 a taste which can appreciate the charm of our Scottish music, \u2014 and a perfect acquaintance with the particular air which he supplies with words. He must sing as he writes : \u2014 he must adapt his choice of words to the various turns of the air : \u2014 In short, if the words be not suggested and inspired by the air, they will be good for nothing. It is, doubtless, very desirable, as to written songs, that they should both read well and ring well ; yet the latter is by far the most essential"], [14, "XII INTRODUCTION. air has a sort of specific or prevailing character, or sentiment, which it is the design of the music to express. This character, or sentiment, it should be the first object of every one to discover, who attempts to supply it with words ; and such, accordingly, we learn from Burns, was his own practice. And yet, while this is true, it is won derful what a power of adaptation many of our melodies possess, to express sentiments of very opposite kinds. Thus the well-known air of Hey tuttie tatie is applied to the old roystering, drunk en, Jacobite song of Fill, fill your bumpers high, \u2014 to Burns' noble lyric of Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled, \u2014 and to the tender and plaintive words of The land of the leal : And although to none of these sets of words does the air seem absolutely uncongenial, yet the Author must own that the last appear to him to express its most pleasing and appropriate character. Thus, also, many of our finest serious melo dies admit, with little loss of beauty, of a quick movement ; \u2014 omitting the half notes, and dwell ing solely on the full and long-sounding notes, \u2014 and thus approaching to what we, in Scotland, call a Lilt.

XIII thro' the rye, &c. The converse of this is also true (as is occasionally remarked in the following pages), that many of our lively airs, when sung or played slowly, and with expression, possess a serious and even pathetic character. Instances of this are, Saw ye Johnnie comin , There's nae luck about the house, The dusty Miller, and many others. To conclude : \u2014 The Author trusts that the fol lowing Poems will be found to possess a merit, in which far greater masters have sometimes failed ; \u2014 that of containing nothing which can offend the most scrupulous delicacy, or render them unworthy of the favour of that sex whose approbation would be their highest reward."], [16, ""], [17, "CONTENTS.

This is one of the sweetest of our Scottish melodies, when sung moderately slow, and with expression. The words given by Allan Ramsay, in his Tea-Table Miscellany (partly old, and partly added by himself), are unfit for decent ears. Those written by Burns for the air, \" When wild war's deadly blast wasblawn,\" though extremely pretty in themselves, are to be considered, from their length, rather as a Ballad than a Song. The last four lines of the following stanzas are taken from the original words, which are of an earlier date than the age of Ramsay. 1.

II. DUNCAN DAVISON. To this pleasant and merry air, the Author has never heard any words which he thinks worthy of it. Some are given in Chambers's Songs of Scotland, vol. ii., p. 369, but they are not of great merit. An attempt has, therefore, been made in the following stanzas, to furnish a suitable hero for the song. 1. Wi' reamin' swats, and hearty cheer, We welcome in the gude New Year ; Then wha comes round, the fun to steer, But canty Duncan Davison ? He blaws his drone, and whisks about, And reels wi' mony a roarin' shout, And young and auld come rinnin' out To bob wi' Duncan Davison. 2. And then, the blade, he cracks sae cvouse When ruggin' at his Christmas goose ; The blithest bairn about the house Ne'er daffs like Duncan Davison : To push around the whisky gill, Or blaw the froth frae nappy yill, Then toss it aff wi' right good will, There's nane like Duncan Davison."], [24, "4 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 3.

LOW DOWN, AMANG THE BROOM. This beautiful Melody is of comparatively modern origin, having, it is said, been composed by Mr Carnegie of Balnamoon , a Forfarshire Laird, who was out with Prince Charles Ed ward, in the Forty-five.* It is one of the happiest imitations of the simple beauty of the ancient Scottish melody which has been produced in later times. The original words were, it is believed, by the same hand as the music ; but, with ex ception of the first stanza, and of the Burden, or Chorus, they are scarcely worthy of the sweetness and delicacy of the air. This has occasioned the following attempt to add to the first stanza (which is excellent) three others, more in unison with the music than those originally written. 1. My daddy he 's a canker'd carle, Ay countin' at his gear ; My minny she's a scoldin' wife, Hauds a' the house asteer : But let them say, or let them do, It 's a' ane to me ; * Chamberss Scottish Songs, vol. i., p. 173."], [26, "6 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

Three stanzas are given in Chambers's Scottish Songs, vol. ii.. p. 607, which seem to be intended for this air ; though they are not precisely of the same measure as the following. Neither are they so good as to preclude further attempts. From a foot note in Chambers, the air seems to be considered as of English origin. That with which the Author has long been familiar, \u2014 and to which the following words are adapted, \u2014 he always considered as Scottish. It is lively and pleasant. 1. Hark ! the bugle sounding cheerly ! Cheerly taps the morning drum ! Waken, lass ! \u2014 The sun shines clearly : \u2014 Quick! \u2014 the hour of march is come.

ROBIN ADAIR. Whether this well-known and excellent air be of English or Irish origin, the Author knows not ; but he fears that Scot land can make no claim. She is, however, too rich in her own treasures to envy or dispute the merits of her neighbours. After this full acknowledgment, the Author trusts that he will be forgiven for adapting to the air words in our northern dialect. The character of the air appears to him to combine the Festive with the Tender ,- \u2014 and hence is not ill suited to a meeting and recognition of old friends, as is attempted here. The two sets of words written for it by Burns (Phillis the fair. and Had I a cave on some wild distant shore) are on designs so different from the following, that no competition can be suspected. 1. Welcome !\u2014 You're welcome here ! Robin Adair : Come, \u2014 taste our Christmas cheer ; \u2014 Come, \u2014 never spare.

VI. THE DEUKS DANG OW'R MY DADDY. This well-known and familiar air, the Author thinks simple and pretty. Chambers, vol. ii., p. 668, gives only one stanza of the words, which differs somewhat from the first of the fol lowing. The rest are added with the view of bringing out the object of the song, which seems to be that of portraying the character of a Daidlin' Body ; \u2014 that is, one who is always in the way, and always in the wrong, \u2014 always falling into one unlucky scrape or another. Burns has written words for this air, beginning \u2014 Tlie bairns gat out wi' an unco shout ,- but they are none of his best. The first two lines of the stanza form the first part of the air, the last two the second part. Each part, from its shortness, may be sung twice. In the recent valuable publication of Wood's Songs of Scot land (vol. ii., p. 8), the present name is given to a quite dif ferent air, which is not adapted to the following words, and which the Author has always heard called by the name of My Highland Lassie, 0. 1.

The air is good ; but still better the pregnant sense, and quiet humour, of the words. The Author has given all that he ever heard of the old words ; and has ventured. somewhat boldly, to add a few stanzas, carrying on the dia logue between the young couple in the same prudent spirit as the original. His additions are interjected between the be ginning and concluding stanzas of the old words. Burns has written new words to this air \u2014 Husband.' Husband/ cease your strife, &c. ; but they are on an entirely different design. 1. Sweet Sir, for your courtesy, When ye come thro' the town, Sir : A ml for the luve ye bear to me, Buy me a pair o' shoon, Sir : \u2014 Clout the auld \u2014 the new 's dear, Janet, Janet; A pair may serve ye half a year, My jo, Janet."], [35, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 15 2.

JUMPIN' JOHN ; OR, THE WELCOME HOME. Tune \u2014 The lang lad they ca' Jumpin John. This air is simple and pleasing. The old words given by Chambers (vol. ii., p. 607) are rude, and otherwise objection able. The following are upon a totally different design. I.

THE WEARY PUND 0' TOW. The following stanzas were written for this pleasant air before the Author was aware that Burns had written words for it ; \u2014 at least he is stated as the author of those printed in Wood's Songs (vol. i., p. 141); although Chambers (vol. ii., p. 561), in giving the same words, does not state Burns to be the author; \u2014 nor do they occur in the edition of his works printed in London in 1825. The following words are, how ever, written on a somewhat different design, and may be allowed to appear. The chorus or burden is old. 1. Thro' a' braid Fife, was ne'er a wife Sae eident, sure, as mine ; For ay she wheel'd, and ay she reel'd, And scarce wad tak' her dine. The weary pund, the weary pund, The weary pund o' tow ! I thought my wife wad end-her life, Before she span her tow. 2. Frae mornin' light, till ten at night, When bells began to jow, Nae care in life could win my wife To leave her taps o' tow. The weary pund, dec."], [43, "23 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 3. The wind blew gruff, an' tirled the roof, The stack was in a low ; But ne'er a bit wad she demit Frae teazin' at her tow.

Till grim Death came, and sent her hame Foot-foremost ow'r the knowe ;* And so my wife did end her life Before she span her tow. The weary pund, dec. X. DINNA ASK ME GIN I LOO YE. TUNE \u2014 Comin thro? the rye. This is a very pleasing melody ; and, when sung with taste, possesses great delicacy of feeling and expression. The words commonly given are quite unworthy of it : nor are those of Burns, Comin thro\"1 the rye, poor body, &c, by any means for tunate. There are words given for the air, in Chambers, vol. ii., p. 494, beginning with the first four of the following lines. These are pretty, and well adapted to the air; but the after stanzas are inferior. It has, therefore, been attempted to sup ply their place. i. Dinna ask me gin I loo ye : Deed I daur na tell : Dinna ask me gin I loo ye; Ask it o' yoursell. Gin your heart be cauld or rovin', I the dool maun dree ; But if that it be leal and levin'. Think the same o' me. * This line is nearly taken from the former words."], [45, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 25 2.

Luve frae luve its flame maun borrow, Cauld breeds cauld, I trow ; But if ye'd live my winsome marrow, I could dee for you. XI. THE FOUL FA' THE GEAR, AND THE BLAUTHRIE O'T. This air is not without beauty and expression. There are old words given for it in Chambers (vol. i., p. 303), but of merit so moderate as not to discourage further attempts. The air is alluded to by Mr Dauney, in his learned and valuable Dissertation on the Skene Manuscript, p. 369 ; but he seems doubtful of its great antiquity. 1. 0 wae to the wanworth, the hard scrapin' elf, Wha thinks but o' hoardin', and hainin' his pelf: He trows himsell fu' wise ; \u2014 I trow he 's but a sot, To warstle for the gear, and the blauthrie o 't. c"], [46, "26 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 2. But auld-warld kindness is sair wearin' done ; And hearts are as hard as the sole o' your shoon ; An' true-luve it grows cauld, an' friends they are forgot A-grippin' at the gear, and the blauthrie o 't. 3. I helpit a friend, when his back was at the wa' ; Syne, I wantit his help for a guinea or twa ; He turn'd me his cauld shouther, an' wadna gie a groat ; Sae, the foul fa' the gear, and the blauthrie o 't. 4. I woo'd a bonny lassie, \u2014 the light o' my een, \u2014 And thought wedded luve wad be heaven wi' my Jean : She speer'd what feck o' siller I had to boil the pot : \u2014 Oh ! \u2014 the foul fa' the gear, and the blauthrie o 't. 5. There's some maun hae feastings, an' some maun hae braws, And some hae their coach, when it rains or it snaws : But, sae lang 's I hae a penny to buy me a coat, I' 11 whistle at the gear, and the blauthrie o 't. 6. Then here 's to the heart that is loyal and leal, And seeks na for siller, \u2014 the gift o' the Deil ; In poortith I can fend, and, contentit wi' my lot, Sing, The foul fa' the gear, an' the blauthrie. o 't."], [47, "SCOTTISH SIELODIES. 27 XII. OW'R THE WATER TO CHARLIE. BVhatever might be the merits of the Jacobite cause, on the score of policy and civil government, there can be no doubt of its triumph over its rival in Poetry and Song. The reason proba bly is, that these last derive their inspiration from the heart, ra ther than the head : And the fortunes of Charles-Edward were calculated to engage the> feelings far more strongly than those of his prosaic and uninteresting competitor, George II. It is really surprising how many beautiful melodies have sprung from the outbreaks of Fifteen and Forty-five. The present is one of the most pleasing and popular ; but the original word^ are far inferior to the music. A set of these is given in a Collection of English and Scottish Songs published in London in 1835, and dedicated to Allan Cunningham (vol. ii., p. 148 | ; but no part of them is retained in the following stanzas, ex cept the two concluding lines. I. 0 fair befa' the heroes a', That, braving every danger, Frae ruthless hands, and traitor hands, Preserv'd our gallant stranger : At length, wi' toil, thro' rock and isle. When winds were blawin' fairly, We shipp'd him o'er to yonder shore, And sav'd our Royal Charlie. 2. Sure Heaven did aid that noble Maid To rescue and relieve him ; And fear and gain were tried in vain To tempt one Scot to leave him ; * Flora Macdonald."], [48, "28 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

Accurs'd the dreary morning ! That made us yield Culloden field To Saxons proud and scorning : Of a' bereft, \u2014 yet He was left, \u2014 Our hope, \u2014 tho' blighted sairly : A nohle few, \u2014 'mid danger true, They rescued Royal Charlie. 1. But tho' the reel o' Fortune's wheel Has borne him to the wa' man, Your heart keep up, and drain a cup To German Geordie's fa' man : For, late or soon, yon Hanover loon, We tell him free and fairly, \u2014 We '11 draw once more the good claymore, And fecht a fa' for Charlie. 5. Tho' banish'd far by chance o' war, We ay will follow and cheer him : By land or sea, \u2014 where'er he he,-^ It 's comfort to be near him :"], [49, "29 SCOTTISH MELODIES. Then hoist our sail afore the gale, The breeze is rising rarely, Come weell, come woe, we '11 gather and go, And live and die wi' Charlie. XIII. HERE'S A HEALTH TO BONNY CHARLIE. TUNE\u2014 Here's a health to Wittol tieordic. This is another shaft from the Jacobite quiver. The origi nal words are scarcely producible ; and are, by no means, complimentary to the House of Hanover: Uut as the air ifi pleasant (though not equal to the last), the author has supplied it with a few verses, characteristic, but less offensive. The old cfiorus or burden is retained in the two concluding lines of each stanza. i. Here 's a health to bonny Charlie, Tho' he be far awa' ; Ayont the saut sea roamin', Wi' neither house nor ha' : But we '11 get hame our King again, In peace and unitie ; And we'll crown Charlie Stuart In his a in countrie. c 2"], [50, "30 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 2. When he was ow'r amang us, 0, but our hearts were fain, And soon, we hope, the time will come To fecht for him again : And mony a darg an' danger yet For his sake will we dree ; And we '11 crown Charlie Stuart In his ain countrie. 3. Our bairns about the ingle They llichter at his name ; And, when for him we 've done our best, They '11 up an' do the same : And a' true-hearted Highlandmen In concert will agree To crown Charlie Stuart In his ain countrie. i. But, as for German Geordie, We '11 float him ow'r the faem ; To delve his wee kail-yeardie, An' clout his hose at hame : Sic hafllin gentles on our throne, We canna bide to see, But vie '11 crown Charlie Stuart In his nin countrie."], [51, "31 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 5. Then, tho' we lost ae venture, We '11 yet anither try ; Again our highland hills and glens Shall hear our Gathering-cry: And, sharp and sore, our good claymore, Shall gar the Southrons flee ; And we '11 crown Charlie Stuart In his ain countrie. XIV. MY BARBARIE, 0; OK, THE NIGHT-WOOING. Of this sweet and simple melody the Author can give no account, but that he has known it, from his earliest years, by the above name. He recollects but few of the original words, and they are of little merit. He has here adapted the air to the song of a rustic lover, describing his night-journey to visit his mistress. This practice of night-wooing is common among our Scottish peasantry. Indeed, it is the only opportunity which they have for such objects, amidst their incessant la bours ; and extraordinary distances do they often traverse, on these errands, after a long day of toil. A tragic incident oc curred, some years ago, in the west of Scotland, on an occa sion of this kind. A young man of two-and-twenty, the son of a respectable farmer, set off on such an expedition, after the labour of a summer day ; and reached the abode of his mistress, ten miles off, about midnight. He had an inter view with her, but was unsuccessful in his suit. She pre ferred another. He parted from her with apparent calmness ; but next morning, at sunrise, was seen suspended from a tree close by the house, and quite dead. He had entered the stable"], [52, "32 SCOTTISH MELODIES. and got a rope, on which he made a running noose ; and had completed his purpose with such desperate resolution, that, when found, his knees were, bent, and his feet resting on the ground. 1. Now rings* the winter chill, The wind blaws loud and shrill, And the moon looks ow'r the hill 0' auld Carberrie, 0 : I 've wrought the weary day, And the folk are at their play ; But I maun haud my way To my Barbarie, 0. 2. 0 lang, lltng is the gate, The night is wearin' late, And the waters in a spate, Wildly racin', racin', 0 : But, hastin' to my dear, I laugh at every fear, And thro' the storm will steer, Bauldly facin', facin', 0. 3.

MAGGIE LAUDER ; OR, THE DESPAIRING SBBrAIN. This is one of the best known and most popular of our lively airs ; \u2014 yet, like many others of these, when played or sung slow, and with good taste, it possesses a considerable degree of expression and delicacy. The usual words are coarse, even beyond burlesque ; and although the following by no means aspire to the praise of dignity or refinement, yet it is hoped that the spirited character of the heroine has been preserved, without any breach of decorum. 1.

Tune \u2014 The Flowers of Edinburgh. This is a cheerful and pleasant air, but. from its complex character, it has not the appearance of great antiquity- The Author never heard words to it of any kind. i.

This air, \u2014 one of the most pleasant and animated that we possess, \u2014 is stated by Chambers (vol. i., p. 300; to be the pro duction of Mr Walkinshaw of BValkinshaw, in Renfrewshire. The words given in Allan Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany are also said to be by the same hand. But although they well express the eminently saltatory character of the air, they are in some respects objectionable. The same design is preserved in the following stanzas; but the first is the only one bor rowed (though with a slight variation) from the former verses.

XIX. THE BOATIE ROWS; OR, THE SONG OF THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE. This beautiful melody is said, in Wood's Songs of Scotland, (vol. ii., p. 3) to be the production of a Mr Ewen, of Aber deen, who died so lately as the year 1821. If this be the case, it is one of the happiest imitations which we possess of the genuine ancient Scottish music. The following lines were written while the Author had a faint recollection of the for mer words ; and there may be some resemblance of design between them ;\u2014 but he thinks that there is a sufficient variety in the treatment of the subject, to allow the following words to appear. The first stanza is nearly from the old words. 1. 0 weell may the Boatie roiv, And better may she speed : 0 weell may the Boatie row, That brings the lairns' brunt : The Boatie rows, the Boatie rows, The Boatie rows fu' weel; And muckle gude befa' the Hoik, The Marline and the Creel* 9 When our Gudeman gaes out to fish, And winds blayv cauld and stour, We beek the house for his come-hame.

The Author can say nothing of this air, but that he has long been familiar with it; and also with the first stanza of the words, including the chorus, here given. The air, without any great pretensions, is pleasant enough. The after stanzas will, it is hoped, be found to express the sententious morality, and edifying reflections, of a veteran toper and muft-taker. i.

TllNK \u2014 B*l,-at-th*-Bowster brawly. The hint of this composition was taken from a prose narra tive of the dialogue between an English tourist and a Scottish waiter, touching the nature and ingredients of that well-known and savoury compound called Hotch-Potch. The point of the story turned on the constant misapprehension between the parties, from the difference of dialect ; but this, it exceeded the Author's powers to transfer into his song. He has, there fore, contented himself with a general but sincere tribute to the merits of the above inestimable soup, given under the cha racter of the Scottish waiter. The tune named above will be recalled to recollection, by mentioning that it is the constant accompaniment of that old fashioned but excellent and merry dance, known by the name K"], [70, "50 SCOTTISH MELODIES. of the Country Bumpkin: \u2014 a dance ill exchanged for the sprawling inanities of the present day. 1. 0 leeze me on the canny Scotch, Wha first contriv'd, without a botch, To mak' the gusty, good Hotch-Potch, That fills the wame sae brawly : There 's carrots intill 't, and neeps intill 't, There 's cybies intill 't, and leeks intill 't, There 's pease, and beans, and beets intill 't. That soom thro' ither sae brawly. 2. The French mounseer, and English loon, When they come daund'rin' thro' our tqwn, Wi' smirks an' smacks they gulp it down, An' lick their lips fu' brawly.

And Irish Pat, when he comes here, To lay his lugs in our good cheer, He shools his cutty wi' nuco steer, And clears his cogue fu' brawly :"], [71, "51 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

A dainty Dame she cam' our way, An' sma' soup meagre she wad hae : \" Wi' your fat broth I cannot away, \u2014 It maks me scunner fu' brawly : For there 's carrots intill 't, and neaps intill 't There 's cybies intill 't, and leeks intill 't, Aud filthy, greasy meats intill 't, That turn my stamach sae brawly. 5.

JOHNNY, I WAS DEAR; OR, THE FORSAKEN. Tune \u2014 The dusty Miller. It may strike some persons with surprise to see this air, \u2014 so well known as lively and familiar, \u2014 adapted to words of a grave, and even pathetic, character. But it has always ap peared to the Author that this melody (like many other of the cheerful airs of Scotland) possessed \u2014 when played or sung slowly, and with expression \u2014 a character of simple pathos which accorded with words of the same description. He has therefore made the following attempt. The air is alluded to by Mr Dauney, in his Dissertation, p. 144, under the old name of Binny's Jig. 1. Johnny, I was dear, When first we cam' thegither ; Aften did ye swear Ye ne'er wad loo anither : Now, your Luve grown auld, Looks fu' strange upon me, And that e'e sae cauld, It 's no the e'e that won me."], [73, "53 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 2. Ye hae sought a bride Proud wi' braws and siller ; And she thinks ye '11 bide Ay true-hearted till her -. She may be mista'en, Tho' sae brisk and bonny ; He that 's false to ane Will ne'er be true to ony. 3. When we 're far apart, Pride may come to free me ; I wad scorn a heart That ye grudge to gie me : But how vain the boast, My sharp woes to cover ; \u2014 A' my pride was lost When I lost my lover. 4. Comrades dear, I crave, Twine the rue and willow ; Soon they '11 deck my grave, As now they deck my pillow Griefs they may be borne When by Luve partaken ; But, oh ! the bitter scorn To luve, and be forsaken. e2"], [74, "54 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 5. Nought remains for me, This sad warld thorough ; I my weird maun dree, Till I sink wi' sorrow : A' your luve forespent, \u2014 Scorn'd each plighted token, \u2014 Ye may yet repent, \u2014 When my heart is broken. XXIII. THERE CAM' A YOUNG LAD TO MY DADDY'S DOOR; OR, THE BASHFUL WOOER. This pleasant and humorous air is well known ; but the usual words seem to the Author by no means worthy of it. They are given in Chambers's Scottish Songs, vol. ii., p. 334. All that is retained of them in the following lines is the first stanza (which is compounded from two of the original), and the chorus or burden. 1. There cam' a young Lad to my Daddy's door, My Daddy's door, my Daddy's door ; There cam' a young Lad to my Daddy's door, A-seekin' me to ivoo :"], [75, "55 SCOTTISH MELODIES. There was a deuk-dub afore the door, Afore the door, afore the door; There ivas a deuk-dub afore the door, An' he fell in, I trow. But wasna he a bonny young lad, A braw lad, an' a brisk young lad : But wasna he a bonny young lad, Cam' seekin' me to woo ? 2. He tiri'd the pin, and I loot him in, I loot him in, I loot him in ; He tiri'd the pin, and I loot him in, For he was a' wet thro' : And ay he sat, but ne'er he spak', But ne'er he spak', but ne'er he spak' And ay he sat, but ne'er he spak', He was sae blate, I trow. lint wasna he, etc. \u25a0-;. I speer'd him how the uowt did sell. The nowt did sell, the nowt did sell. I speer'd him how the nowt did sell ; At Falktrk Tryst ye' now : He answer'd that he cou'd na tell, He cou'd na tell, he cou'd na tell ; He answer'd that he cou'd na tell, And syne he shut his mou'. But wasna he, etc."], [76, "56 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 4. I speer'd him gif the crap was in, The crap was in, the crap was in ; I speer'd him gif the crap was in, For har'st was wearin' thro' : He answer'd that he didna ken, He didna ken, he didna ken ; He answer'd that he didna ken, An' syne he shut his mou'. But wasna he, etc. 5. I took the quaich, an' I gied him a drap, I gied him a drap, I gied him a drap ; I took the qttaich, and I gied him a drap, But no to mak' him sou : He drank the drap, an' syne he spak', An' syne he spak', an' syne he spak' ; He drank the drap, an' syne he spak', \" 0 ye 're my bonny doo !\" An' wasna he, etc. 6. My Daddy he is intill the byre, Intill the byre, intill the byre ; My'Daddy he is intill the byre, A-muckin' out the cow ; But he '11 come in, if ye desire, If ye desire, if ye desire ;"], [77, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 57 But he '11 come in, if ye desire, To speak a word ye' now.

And nino I'm the Bride o' the bonny lad, The braw lad, an' the brisk young lad : And now I'm the Bride o' the bonny lad, Cam' seekin' me to woo."], [78, "58 SCOTTISH MELODIES. XXIV. THE MATRIMONIAL CURE. Tune \u2014 There cam' a young lad to my Daddy s door. The Author, with that profound admiration and respect which he bears towards the fair sex, hardly knows how to ac count for his having fallen into the following effusion. He can only plead, in mitigation, that he was apprehensive lest the preceding lyric might prove too strong an encouragement to matrimony, and might require a gentle corrective. 1. There was a man, and he had a wife, And, oh ! she was the plague o' his life ; She keepit him ay in sturt and strife, And ne'er wad steek her mou' : For, a' day lang, she wad rage an' rout, And after ferlies rin thereout ; An' yvhen the night it cam' about, She ay gat roarin' sou. An' wasna she a bonny young wife, A braw wife, an' a brisk young wife; An' wasna she a bonny youmi wife, That ay gat roarin' sou. 2. \" Gudeman,\" quo' she, \" ye 're a dirty loon, Weel kent for greed thro' a' the towii ; Ye winna gie me a coat or gown 0' the genty fashion new.\""], [79, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 59 \" Ye jad, ye 've got baith gown and coat, I 've ward upon ye mony a groat ; But a' gaes into the swillin'-pot When ye get roarin' sou.\" And wasna she, dr. 3. \" Ye speak but havers, man,\" quo' she, \" For never I taste the barley-bree, But. now an' then, a drap sae wee It scarcely weets my mou'.\" \" Ye lee, ye limmer, \u2014 ye ne'er-do-weel ! \u2014 Ye've harried my house, \u2014 ye'vecoupit my creel But, if there 's remeid frae man or Deil, I swear I '11 hae it now.\" And wasna she, etc. I. He 's gane to the Souter, an' cost a whang, He 's brunt the ends o' the leather lang ; An', when she set up her drunken sang, Then out his whang he drew : He baistit her hide thro' a' the town ; He baistit her black, \u2014 he baistit her brown, \u2014 And, e'er the tawse he laid them down, He sobered her, I trow. A n' wasna this the cure for a wife, A braw wife, an' a brisk young wife; An' wasna this the cure for a wife, That ay gat roarin' sou."], [80, "60 SCOTTISH MELODIES. XXV. I 'M OW'R YOUNG FOR WOOIN\" YET ; OR, THE FORWARD YOUTH. Tune \u2014 The sow's tail's to Geordie. The above well-known Jacobite song was levelled at George I. and his mistress, the Duchess of Kendal. The air, however (which is lively, and not unpleasant), belongs to an older pe riod, and was adapted to the words \u2014 The auld wife, ayont the fire, She dee'd for want o' sneeshin'. In the Chorus or Burden, the first line is sung three times \u2014 the last, once. 1. My Friends, they say I 'm just a bairn. An' only fit my book to learn ; Frae smirkin' Lasses ay they warn, That lead us a' to ruin. I 'm ow'r young, \u2014 they ay will say 't, \u2014 I 'm ow'r young for wooin' yet, I 'm ow'r young for wooin' yet, I 'm ow'r young for wooin'. 2. But I jalouse they 're sair mista'en, For, a' the night, I mope and mane, A-thinkin' o' thae bonny e'en That shoot, like needles thro' ane :"], [81, "61 SCOTTISH MELODIES. But ay they threap, I 'm just a gett, I 'm ow'r young for wooin' yet ; An', dearly tho' I loo my Bet, I maunna gang a-wooin'. 3. They say that I maun wait a wee, Till I can do my spellin' free, Wi' Fractions and The Rule o' Three, That set me a' a-gruin' : But let them fidge, or let them fret, I 'm no sae young as they wad hae 't ; I dinna ken the spellin' yet, But weel I ken the wooin'. 4. I gaed wi' Bessie to the fair, And muckle din an' daffin' there :\u2014 I gat ae kiss, an' gat nae mair, But, 0, it was a true ane : Then I '11 gang a-wooin' yet ; Then I '11 gang a-wooin' yet ; Then I '11 gang a-wooin' yet ; It's just the time for wooin'. F"], [82, "62 SCOTTISH MELODIES. XXVI. LOCH ERROCH SIDE ; OR, THE FAREWELL. This air is well known and admired as a modern strath spey. It has always appeared to the Author to possess consi derable pathos, and he has, therefore, adapted it to words of that character/ It has been printed in Wood's Scottish Songs (vol. i., p. 134), under the name of The Lass o' Gowrie \u25a0. but the words there given are on a design wholly different from the present. 1. Farewell to sweet Loch Erroch side : \u2014 May peace and plenty there abide ; \u2014 For I am boune to tak' the tide, And cross the stormy main, 0 : How dark the road that I maun gae ; \u2014 How lang an' dreary is the way ; \u2014 And sad forebodings seem to say, We ne'er shall meet again, 0. 2. When pass'd awa' the winter chill, And blithesome buds began to fill, We sought our sheilings on the hill, And I the first was there, 0 : The genty Ewies took their ground, The pipers blew their roarin' sound, An' sport an' daffin' a' gaed round : \u2014 I '11 never see 't nae mair, 0."], [83, "63 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 3. And when auld Yule, wi' snawy pow, Brought friends thegither round the lowe, We laugh'd to scorn the Worricow, And bade him pinch and freeze, O : Took down the kebbock and the gill, And push'd about the sneeshin'-mill ; Syne, \u2014 wag the warld as it will, \u2014 We cuitled ow'r the bleeze, 0. 4.

XXVII. THE BARD. No. I. Tune \u2014 0, quo' the wee wifie, this is no me. The following stanzas will perhaps recall to recollection Hogarth's picture of The Distressed Poet. The variety of the genus here represented is one who marries music to immortal verse, \u2014 with which occupation the Author's sympathies are at present deeply engaged. A set of words for this air is given by Chambers, vol. ii., p. 316. The following are on a different de sign, though neither aspire above the character of burlesque. 1. I canna eat my needfu' meat, I canna clout my claes ; The bairns like wul-cats rin thereout ; The beds they hotch wi' flaes. But ay, frae bonny mornin' light, Until the afternoon, I 'm hummin', an' bummin', An' drummin' at a tune. 2. My wife she says it 's a' for nought, I '11 never win the gear ; \" Wha keepit e'er a house,\" quo' she, \" Or gat their kail by lear ?\""], [85, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 65 Yet a' the night, e'er moruiii' light. An' till the afternoon, I 'm hummin', an' bummin', An' thrummin' at a tune. 3. The dog an' cat amaist are starv'd, An' fechtin' for a bane ; They howk for bits amang the aiss, But troth they can get nane : The wee bit linty chirps fu' sma', An' maks an eerie croon, While I keep fidgin' at my wark, A-thrummin' at a tune. I. The sleekit mouse rins thro' the house, To find a candle end ; The ratton comes to snoove for crumbs, But canna mak' a fend : My wife she steers the parritch-pat, To get our poor Disjuru . While I sing dool upon my stool, An' hammer out a tune. 5. In comes the saucy sour-milk wile. Her nick-stick* in her hand ; I tell her no to vex my life, I dinna understand : * The tally by which the milk score is kept. f2"], [86, "66 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

Next comes the hurley butcher-man, Wi' voice sae stern an' dour ; He gars the very rybats ring, And stamps upo' the floor : I roose him sair to flyte nae mair, And I will pay him soon ; For, in a wee, I '11 get my fee, And siller for a tune. 8. Yet, a' the while, I fecht an' toil To clamper up a rhyme ; But, 0, the sang it 's dreich to gang, The ends they winna chime :"], [87, "67 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

XXVIII. THE BARD. No. II. Tune \u2014 The rock and the wee pickle tow. The old words of this air are given by Chambers, vol. i., p. 249. The design of the following words is wholly differ ent ; and they are merely furnished as a companion to the last song, under a somewhat different phase, \u2014 but with pretences no higher than burlesque. 1. I lang hae bethought me o' croonin' a sang, If ance I cou'd ken the spinnin' o 't ; But the tune it was stiff, an' the words they gaed wrang, An' that was a bad beginnin' o 't :"], [88, "68 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

The first ane I tried was in praise o' my dear, An' dour was the tink'rin' and tinnin' o 't ; I offer'd my heart ; \u2014 but, quo' she, wi' a jeer, \" I'd no gie a preen for the winnin' o 't :\" I gran'd an' I gruntit, \u2014 I fleech'd an' I pray'd ; I ca'd her my charmer, my beautiful maid ; \u2014 But, tossin' my liltie, \u2014 \" It 's nonsense,\" she said. \" Forbye a sair hitch in the rinnin' o 't.\" 3. The neist ane I sent to a Lord o' the land ; His favor I tried for the winnin' o 't ; I swore that true wisdom he did understand ; May Heaven forgi'e me the sinnin' o 't ; I trow'd o' his bounty belyve I wad hear : But, rowin' in riches, his fist it was sweer : He keepit my sang, \u2014 but he keepit his gear ; \u2014 Fient a bawbee e'er heard I the dinnin' o 't. 4. There was an auld proverb o' catchin' your Bear Before ye begoud to the skinnin' o 't ; When I took to the quill, an' the profits o' lea:', I sairly miscountit the innin' o 't :"], [89, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 69 0, had I sat down at the Lug o' the Law, I had rantit an' routit the best o' them a', An' rade in my coach, wi' my Jeezy sae braw, An' gowpins o' gowd for the winnin' o 't. XXIX. 0 LASSIE, WILL YE GANG WI' ME ; OR, THE HIGHLANDER'S WOOING Of this air the Author cannot give the name, although he has been long familiar with it. It is usually Bung quick, in the manner of what is called in Scotland a Lilt .\u25a0 \u2014 but, when given moderately slow, it possesses both beauty and delicacy. Although the following stanzas are written in a very 6imple measure, the air, in singing, requires so many refrains and re petitions, \u2014 both of entire lines, and of parts of lines, \u2014 as to be somewhat complicated : A stanza or two will, therefore, be added in a note at the end, shewing these repetitions. Any old words which the Author has heard are wholly unfit for exhi bition. I. 0 Lassie, will ye gang wi' me, To our sweet Hieland glen ?

XXX. THE MERRY PLOUGHMAN Tune \u2014 Merrily danced the Quaker's wife. This is a cheerful and pleasant air. Such of the former words as the Author has heard, are of no great merit : And the following are on a different design. 1. Merrily danced the ploughman's wife, And merrily danced the ploughman : The blithe Daft-Days* they cheer his life, Tho' comin' but ance a towmont : The nappy yill, the canty gill, Gae briskly round the maillin' ; An' nocht but ploy, an' jest, an' joy, Are in the happy dwellin'. 2. The sun shines bright, and fresh the light, When spring it opens fairly ; Then out, wi' sangs, the ploughman gangs, Up in the mornin' early : His stalwart beasts they join their breasts, An' tug before his singin' ; While colley barks, an' shues the larks, That frae the lea are springin'. * The days between Christmas and the new year"], [93, "73 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 3. And now, when melteth comes about, \u2014 Across the quakin' bogie, The wee bit bairn comes toddlin' out, To bring her Father's cogie : He slacks the graith frae horses baith, That pasture round in plenty, Then taks his spare but wholesome fare, Which hunger maks a dainty. 4. Thus slips away the live-lang day, Till glints the peacefu' gloamin' ; The bairns look out, an' tot about, To watch their Father's comin' : And, when he 's seen, they skelp an' rin Wi' shouts o' joy to meet him ; An' pu' his coat, an' rage, an' rout, For fainness a' to greet him. 5. Then round they jouk the ingle neuk, Their een wi' pleasure glancin' ; Some sit fu' douce, \u2014 some scour the house Wi' daffin' and wi' dancin' : Goodwife looks in her aumry bin, To fetch the bit an' drappy ; \u2014 The kebbock fat, \u2014 the gusty swat, That reams sae rich and nappy. o"], [94, "74 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 6. 0 leeze me on the ploughman's hame, Tho' no in gauds excellin' ; He 's free frae care \u2014 he 's free frae blame, And peace is in his dwellin' : The lofty tower, the dainty bower, They mak' an unco show, man ; But snug the cot, and sweet the lot, That wait the happy ploughman. XXXI. THE LAST TIME I CAME O'ER THE MOOR. This well-known and pleasing melody is conjectured by Mr Tytler, in his Dissertation, to have been composed about the end of the 17th century ; but this opinion has been signally dis proved by the Skene Manuscript. This air is there inserted, as known nearly two centuries earlier : and this circumstance, in deed, leads Mr Dauney, its learned editor and commentator, to remark on the great uncertainty of such conjectures, as to de termining the era of songs from their musical character. The air, as copied in the Skene MS., differs considerably from the one now commonly known ; and the older of the two is pre ferred by Mr Dauney.* The first line, giving the usual title of the song, has also been changed from that in the Skene MS., which is, \" Alas ! that I came o'er the moor.\" The first of the following stanzas is that published by Allan * Dissert, on Skene MSS., p. 10, and pp. 253, 3c\u00bb. The Skene MSS. are conjectured by Mr Daunev to have been written about tlit- v,-ar 1815 or 11>20."], [95, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 75 Ramsay, with a few alterations. It has little merit, but is better than the rest, \u2014 and has been retained here, as asso ciated with the melody. The second and third stanzas below are new. 1. Th. last time I came o'er the moor, I left my Love behind me ; Alas! what pain do I endure, When tender thoughts remind me : Soon as the glint o' morn betray' d The sultry day ensuing, I met betimes my bonny maid In scent haunts for wooing. 2. But, e'er the hour o' gloamin' grey, Thro' moors and mosses dreary, Again I '11 toil my lanesome way, An' back to meet my deary ; The hafflin' moon will shew her face Out ow'r the hills to guide me ; And weel I ken the trystin'-place Where love and joy abide- me. 3. Tho' life should pass in care and toil, Wi' her I weel cou'd bear it ; Nor reck I ought o' Fortune's smile. Unless wi' her to share it :"], [96, "76 SCOTTISH MELODIES. On heaps o' gowd, \u2014 on ferlies fine, \u2014 Let others set their fancy ; But gowd an' ferlies a' are mine, When wedded to my Nancy. XXXII. THE BUSH ABOON TRAQUAIR. This is certainly one of the finest of our Scottish melodies. If excelled by any, it is only by The Flowers of the Forest. The words usually sung were published by Allan Ramsay, in the Tea-Table Miscellany, and are said, in Wood's Songs, vol. i., p. 19, to have been the production of a Mr Crawford. They are by no means first-rate, and have too much claim to the title of namby-pamby, bestowed by Mr Dauney on some of Ramsay's songs. In the following words the first stanza only has been retained of the former set, with some slight altera tions. Two others have been added. The air is conjectured by Mr Tytler to have been composed about the end of the seventeenth century ; and this opinion, it is believed, is generally thought to be correct. 1. 0 hear me, every faiths ul swain! I'll tell how Peggy grieves me ; For, tho' I languish and complain, Alas ! she ne'er believes me. My vows, my sighs, my mute despair, Unheeded never move her : The Bonny Bush aboon Traquair, 'Twas there I first did love her."], [97, "77 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 2. 0 Peggy, wilt thou scorn me now, For lordly birth aud bearing ? Forget, forego, each plight i-d vow, And leave me here despairing ? The pomp of state, \u2014 the pride of art, \u2014 Thou 'It gain, if such can move thee ; But thou wilt lose a faithful heart That never ceas'd to love thee. 3. How oft, beneath that verdant shade, The winged hours flew by us : Secure in bliss, I fondly said, What ill can e'er come nijsh us ? But, if thou 'rt false \u2014 ah ! never more That Bunny Bush I '11 see, Love ; But die upon some foreign shore, Far, far from home and thee, Love."], [98, "78 SCOTTISH MELODIES. XXXIII. NID, NLD, NODDIN'; OR, HOGMANAY This is one of the pleasantest and best known of our lively airs. The old words are, in some parts, inadmissible. The following are an attempt to supply their place. 1. Cry in a' the folk, Let ne'er a body gae ; We maun a' be at hame On the merry Hogmanay. And we're a' noddin', Nid, nid, noddin', We 're a noddin' At our house at hame. 2.

Tune \u2014 0, weell may the Maid be that marries the Miller. This simple and pleasing air was composed by Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, and first appeared in print (according to the statement in Chambers' Sorigs, vol. i., p. 241) in the year 1751. It is a happy imitation of the ancient Scottish melody. The old words are given by Chambers, pretty nearly as the author has heard them ; but he thought that they admitted of considerable additions and suppressions. His object has been to sketch an Interior of quiet, humble comfort and opulence. He has retained little of the former words except the first stanza, together with the Burden, or concluding couplet, at the end of each stanza. This last, however, is not necessary * Hot-pint: \u2014 a caudle made of spirits, milk, eggs, and sugar."], [101, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 81 to complete the air ; and may be used or omitted, at the dis cretion of the singer. 1. 0, weel may the maid be, That marries the Miller ; For, foul day and fair day, He's ay bringin' till her: He 'as ay a penny in his purse, For dinner and for supper ; And, gin ye please, a good fat cheese, And lumps o' yellow butter.

XXXV. 0 PEGGY, WHY THAT ALTER'D LOOK ? OB, THE LOVERS' QUAKKEL. Tune\u2014 What is that to you ? This is a pleasant air. The words adapted to it in Allan Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany, \u2014 each stanza ending with the above line, which gives name to the tune, \u2014 are far from bad : But the following are on an entirely different design. 1. 0 Peggy, why that alter'd look ? The scorn that 's in your e'e ? I 'm sure ye hae been sair mistook Tn think ought ill o' me. * A proportion of the grain, as the Miller's fee for grinding."], [104, "84 SCOTTISH MELODIES.

At a' compar'd wi' you, Ac. 3. Ye sent me back the winsome gown, The ribbon for your hair ; I cost them at the Burrow Town, When you and me were there : Ye sent me back the beads fu' braw, That ow'r your neck I threw ; But naething looks sae weel awa', As what it looks on you.

But I can read that meltin' e'e Thro' a' your cauld disdain ; Ye took thae fairings ance frae me, Ye '11 tak' them ance again : Then cease, dear lassie, cease to vex A heart baith leal an' true ; For, tho' ye trouble and perplex, It ne'er can part frae you. It ne'er can pttrt frae you, etc. XXXVI. THE FAIR. TUNE \u2014 Johnny stays lang at the Fair. This is a well-known and pleasant air, and evidently of a parentage strictly Caledonian. It is extremely simple, and has no second part, \u2014 the latter part of the stanza being sung to the same notes as the first part. The Chorus or Burden \u2014 which is still to the same notes \u2014 may be repeated or not, ac cording to the pleasure of the singer, at the close of each stanza. 1 0 foul fa' the gate that my Laddie has gane again ; He- s aff to the ploy, and has left me my lane again ; Ow'r moss and ow'r muirland his way he has ta'en again.

OW'R THE MUIR, AMANG THE HEATHER ; OR, THE EMIGRANTS This air is commonly played or sung with a quick move ment, resembling what, in Scotland, we call a Lilt .- But. like many others of this character, when given moderately slow, it possesses a character tender, and even pathetic. It therefore seemed to the Author not ill adapted to express the feelings of Scottish emigrants, driven from their country by the change which sheep-farming has introduced in the Highlands. The"], [109, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 89 words composed for it by Juan Glover, a wandering female Tinker, or Stroller, of Ayrshire, so graphically described by Burns are given in Chambers' Songs, vol. i.. p. 54, and are wonderfully good, considering the source from which the) sprung: But the following are on a quite different des The Author has heard older words; but they are not present able, nor in any degree worthy of the air. 1.

The following words bear no resemblance to those formerly adapted to the air. 1. The lasses o' Largs they are bonny and braw, An' the Fairs they are ringin' wi' sport an' gaffaw ; But a' wae an' weary, for want o' my deary, I canna tak' part in their daffin' ava. 0, when will my Laddie come hame again, Winsome an' waly, the flower o' them a' < The thought o' our meetin' it dries up my grectin', An' cheers my puir heart when my sailor's awa'. 2.

But, free ranger, scorning danger, Still he laugh'd at Cupid's darts : Till young Nancy took his fancy ; Then, to speak he was not slow : Can you love me ? \u2014 Can you love me ? \u2014 But she answer'd, No, no ; No Tom, no Tom, no Tom, no. 2.

THE BROOM 0' THE COWDEN KNOWES. This beautiful pastoral air is alluded to by Mr I>auney, in his Dissertation on the Skene MS., p. 142, under the name of The bonnie Broom. He considers its date to be about the year 1675. The words published by Ramsay, in his Tea- Table Miscellany, are given in Chambers' Songs, vol. i., p. 247, but do not rise above mediocrity. The air is also given in Wood's Songs of Scotland, vol. i., p. 56, with new words by Mr Gilfillan. These are of such merit, that, had the Author seen them before he wrote the following, he would scarcely have ventured on the com petition. Cowden Knowes, the place celebrated in the song, is situated on the river Leader, in Berwickshire. l.

THE LASSIE 'S LOST HER SILKEN SNOOD. This air appears to the Author to possess much beauty, de licacy, and expression. There is a set of words given in Chambers' Songs, vol. ii., p. 532 : hut, of these, the Author has only preserved the first stanza, including the Burden, though with some variation. The rest of the following words are on a quite different design. In regard to two former songs, on designs similar to the present, No. 1 and No. 4, the Author may observe that it was his intention to adapt the following words to a somewhat higher grade of the Military profession (often exposed to little less hardship than the lower), and one more in unison with the delicacy of the air. The words are supposed to come, not from the lover, hut from a sympathizing friend. 1. Tin Lassie 's lost her silken snood, That band her hair sae yellow ; She 's gi'en her hand to the Lad she loo'd, He was a gallant fellow.

XLII. THE YELLOW-HAIR'D LADDIE. This is a sweet and simple air ; and is particularly pleasing when harmonised for two voices. Chambers, in his Scottish Songs (vol. i., pp. 311, 312), gives two sets of words; the one by Allan Ramsay, the other of an older date, and both printed in his Tea-Table Miscellany. Neither are, however, of such merit as to preclude further attempts. The first of the fol lowiog stanzas is taken from Ramsay, with one or two slight variations ; the rest are new. i. In April, when primroses paint the sweet plain, And summer approaching rejoices the swain ; Wi' the Yellow-hair' d Laddie I often would go To glens where the birk and the hawthorn-tree grow."], [119, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 99 2. 0 light was his step when he danced on the green ; And blithe was the blink o' his bonny blue een : His cheek like the rose, and his brow like the snaw; But his saft yellow hair it was sweeter than a'. 3. He gaed to the warfare ; he fought, and he toil'd ; For his heart it was bold, tho' his face it was mild ; He brav'd every danger on sea or on shore ; And I shed the salt tear at the hardships he bore. 4. But peace came at last : \u2014 he return'd to my arms Frae perils and wand'rings, \u2014 frae hardships and harms ; And my heart is at rest frae its trouble and pain. For now I've my Yellow-hair'd Laddie again."], [120, "100 SCOTTISH MELODIES. XLIII. WHISTLE OW'R THE LAVE 0 'T. This air is usually sung quick, and considered as little better than burlesque, or, at most, a mere Lilt ,- yet, when sung mode rately slow, it possesses both beauty and delicacy. It is alluded to by Mr Dauney, in his Dissertation, p. 145, under the name of My Ladie Monteith's Lament. It is also given in Wood's Songs (vol. ii., p. 32), with words Dy Burns ; hut they are on a design quite different from the following. The more ancient words are wholly inadmissible. 1. Johnny, man, ye 're maist a fool ; Ye hae need o' gaw'n to school ; Warld's bliss, or warld's dool, 0 wha wad be the slave o 't ? If Mischance shou'd ding ye down, Rise against her wi' a boun' ; Cock your bannet on your crown, And whistle ow'r the lave o 't. 2. Fortune aye gaes past our door, Geeks at us because we 're poor ; For the rich she keeps her store, Wha mak' an unco brave o 't. But her gifts if e'er we find, Lightly got, they 're lightly tined ; Then shake the gipsy down the wind, And whistle ow'r the lave o 't."], [121, "101 SCOTTISH MELODIES. > 3.

XLIV. 0 LASSIE, YE SAY YE CANNA GET A TOW; OR, THE INCONSTANT. Tune \u2014 The bonniest Lass in a' the ivarld. This is an air of very considerable beauty. Of the former words the Author has heard little more than the above line, from which it has its name. The date or history of the tune he is unable to give. 1. 0 Lassie, ye say, ye canna get a tow That 's tight or that 's strong eneugh to tye me ; Gin ye winna tak' my honest word, ye winna tak' my vow : \u2014 I ask, I ask ye but to try me. 2. 0 Lassie, ye say, a woman's trustin' heart Wad be ill-wared, and thrown awa', to love me ; I 'm fickle and I 'm fause, ye say; \u2014 I 'm light to meet and part : \u2014 I ask, I ask ye but to prove me."], [123, "103 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 3.

XLV. CAULD KAIL IN ABERDEEN. This pleasant and well-known air has already some very good words. Two sets of these are given in Chambers' Songs, vol. i., p. 276 ; the first being the original set, the second said to be by the late Duke of Gordon. The first are those with which the Author has been familiar, and he owns that he pre fers them to the second. In the following words he has merely added four new stanzas to the three former, \u2014 carrying on the same idea of a tippling old bachelor, and no admirer of the fair sex. Burns has written words for the air, beginning \u2014 \" How lang and dreary is the night ;'' but they are in quite a different character from the following. 1. There 's cauld kail in Aberdeen, And castocks in Stra'bogie ; And ilka lad has gotten his lass, But I maun hae my Cogie ; My Cogie, sirs, my Cogie, sirs, I canna want my Cogie ; I wadna gie my ain pint-stoup For a' the queans in Bogie. 2.

This is one of the many melodies which have owed their inspiration to the above beautiful and pastoral stream. There is one called Tweedside, which is well known. The words (first printed in Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany) are given in Chambers' Songs, vol. ii., p. 350. He also gives words by a Lord Yester : But neither of these works is superlative ; nor is that air, in the Author's estimation, so good as the present. There is also, in Wood's Scottish Songs, vol. i., p. 104, one called Tweedside, different both from the above, and from the air now given. The words which the Author has heard to the present air begin \u2014 \"As Jamie Gray gaed blithe his way,\"'' &c. ; but are not such as can be presented in detail. The first four lines of the following stanzas nearly resemble the old words, but with a few slight variations. The other stanzas are new. The air is extremely pretty ; but, from its somewhat complex structure, does not seem to be of great antiquity. i. As Jamie Gray gaed sad his ivay Along the banks o' Tweed, A bonny lass as ever was Cam' trippin' ow'r the mead."], [127, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 107 He stopt to see wha this might be, \u2014 This flower amang them a' ; \u2014 But, wi' a start, his flichterin' heart, It tell't afore he saw. 2. 0 Lassie dear, for mony a year Ye ken I 've loo'd ye true ; And cou'd I gain this warld my ain, 'Twad only be for you. But. a' the while, nae cheerin' smile Has lighten'd on my heart ; And blithe wad be that scornful e'e Tho' we shou'd ever part. 3. But scornful e'e, and haughty bree, It 's unco hard to thole ; And love gainsaid, and hope delay'd, They weary out the soul : And soon ye '11 ken the truth I mean, For here I daur na bide : I canna stay to see the day That ye 're anither's bride. I. Her pawky e'e, it glanc'd agee ; \u2014 0 Jamie, ye 're to blame To start awa' frae house and ha', And leave your folk at hame."], [128, "108 SCOTTISH MELODIES. His heart up flew, he pree'd her mou' ; \u2014 And soon they were agreed : \u2014 She pass'd her life his dautit wife Upon the banks o' Tweed. XL VII. LASSIE, CAN YE LOO ME ? Tune \u2014 Carle an' the king come. This air has no great merit, but is undoubtedly Scottish ; and is alluded to, as such, by Mr Dauney, in his Dissertation, p. 144, under the name of The new way of wooing. It is adapted, by Ramsay, in the Gentle Shepherd, to the words \u2014 \" Peggy, now the king 's come,\" &c., the merit of which is but moderate ; but the songs in that charming pastoral are the least conspi cuous of its beauties. 1. Lassie, can ye loo me ? Lassie, can ye loo me ? This, right fain, my heart wad ken ; \u2014 Tell me, can ye loo me ? I 've been lovin', changin', rovin' ; Fixin' did but fley me ; Pledge your hand in haly band, That alane can stay me."], [129, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 109 2.

Thus poor woman, \u2014 trustin', comin', \u2014 Since the warld began, 0, Won by art, her silly heart Yields to fleechin' man, 0 XL VIII. MY BONNY HIGHLAND LASSIE, 0. With this air the Author has long been familiar, but is un able to give any other name for it than the above. It is quite different from that formerly alluded to (p. 12), given in Wood's Scottish Songs (vol. iii., p. 8), under a title which the Author cannot help considering as a misnomer, viz., \" The Dcuks dang ow'r my Daddy.\" The words and air there given (which the Author has known under the name of \" My Highland Lassie, 0\") are also both different from the present. 1. It 's lang sin' we hae met, I trow, My bonny Highland Lassie, 0 ; But a' my thoughts are fixt on you, My bouny Highland Lassie, 0 : Ow'r mony seas and lands I 've gane, But e'er saw like ye never nane, And Hope yet dreams ye '11 be my ain, My bonny Highland Lassie, 0."], [131, "111 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 2.

But Love and Hope they help me thro', My bonny Highland Lassie, 0, I strive, an' toil, au' hain, for you, My bonuy Highland Lassie, 0 : And when some little store 's possest, A heart content will do the rest : I '11 hie me hame, and we '11 be blest, My bonny Highland Lassie, 0."], [132, "112 SCOTTISH MELODIES. XLIX. THE LOVE TOKEN. Tune \u2014 The Dulce o' Gordon's dochler gaed to the wood her lane. This air is extremely simple, and without any high preten sions to beauty. The Author recollects it only under the above name ; there is, however, in Chambers' Collection of Scottish Ballads (p. 331), a long ballad, beginning with the above line, with this difference, that the heroine is called Sinclair, daughter of the Laird of Koslin, near Edinburgh. The title of the ballad is Captain Wedderburn's Courtship. The following verses are on a quite different design. 1. 0 Robin, is it true, lad, ye 've ta'en nae thought o' me, But buckled wi' the Black-Watch* to cross the ragin' sea? What comfort can betide me, \u2014 what good can e'er befa',\u2014 What blessin' can abide me, \u2014 when ye are far awa' ? 2. 0 waefu' was the mornin', and waefu' was the e'en, Ye fancied first to leave me, an' down to Aberdeen ; The drums an' pipes they sounded, the feathers wav'd sae braw, The 'listin' guinea tempit, and ye was wiled awa'. * The 42d Regiment of Highlanders."], [133, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 113 3.

L. 0 LASSIE 0' MY HEART. Tune \u2014 Captain Eidd. The unfortunate individual who gives name to this song, was an officer of the British navy, and was sent out in the year 1696, with a fine frigate, to cruise against pirates in the Indian Seas. After much success in this pursuit, he, in a fatal hour, was tempted to become a pirate himself, and to cruise against the lawful European commerce. He was ulti mately taken prisoner, after a desperate engagement with a British man-of-war, and brought home to England, where, with most of his crew, he was tried and executed for piracy* His fate excited much sympathy, and among other mani festations of it was the present song. The air is simple and * See Lord Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors, vol. iv., p. 14G.

Of this air, which possesses considerable beauty, the Author is unable to give the name ; nor has he ever heard it adapted to words. Its character is of that middle tone which suits rather reflection than feeling or passion ; and with such words, ac cordingly, he has attempted to supply it. 1. 0 wha wad lippen to the warld's helpin' ? Wha be dazzled wi' the blindin' o't? When poortith pinches, and the storm is skelpin', Sma' the smeddum to bo mindin' o 't.

LII. LASSIE, CAN YE THINK TO LEAVE ME? Of this air the Author can give very little account, \u2014 not even the name : But he thinks that it was published by Neil Gow, in his Strathspeys, as adapted by him from an old Highland melody. It has considerable beauty and pathos, when played, as the Author has heard it, slowly and with taste, on the violin ; but he never saw or heard any words adapted to it. 1. Lassie, can ye think to leave me ? Sure ye say it but to grieve me ; Yet I trust ye '11 ne'er deceive me, Yet ye are my ain Lassie : A' the bliss I e'er cou'd see Lighten'd frae that bonny e'e ; Harder hap I ne'er can dree Than your cauld disdain, Lassie. 2. Life it wears in dool and sorrow, Care to-day, and fear to-morrow ; Yet frae Love a ray we borrow, Glintin' thro' the gloom, Lassie : But if Love prove fause at last, A' our sky is overcast, Low we lye beneath the blast, Wither'd in the bloom, Lassie."], [140, "120 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 3. Then what recks a warld's treasure, Sport or pastime, ease or pleasure, Honours heap'd in ample measure, Nocht can fill the void, Lassie ; Vain are a' the helps o' art, Hope wi' Love will soon depart, And, within the widow'd heart, Peace nae mair abide, Lassie. 4. Speak, then, Lassie, \u2014 speak sincerely ; Ye can read my heart fu' clearly ; Ance I thought ye loo'd me dearly, Ance ye was my ain Lassie : Come, let cauld offence give way ; \u2014 Cloud nae mair our simmer day : \u2014 0 what dreary words to say, We '11 ne'er meet again, Lassie."], [141, "SCOTTISH MELODIES. 121 LIII. GENTLE JEANIE 0' THE GLEN. Tune \u2014 Tibbie Fowler o' the Glen. This popular air is usually joined to words which are al most burlesque, though they exhibit much of that quiet sati rical humour so common in our native minstrelsy. They are given by Chambers, vol. ii., p. 425. The air, however, when sung moderately slow, is not unadapted to words of a graver and more tender character. 1. Gentle Jeanie o' the Glen Has wooers up an' down the water, Ay they 're comin' butt an' ben Ay, ay they 're wooin' at her : Pensie lads, wi' braws an' gauds, \u2014 Jock the laird, and Tam the miller ; \u2014 Her sweet grace, her bonny face, It brings them a' a-wooin' till her, Gentle Jeanie o' the Glen, Ow'r mony wooin' at her ; Ay they 're comin' butt an' ben, Ay, ay wooin' at her.

On that day the Austrian forces, amounting to 20,000 men, were attacked and defeated by the Swiss, who numbered only 1300 ; \u2014 and who, by that victory, established the liberties of their country. As to the air to which these words should be sung, the performer must use his own discretion, as the Author has not yet been able to satisfy himself on this point. 1. What vengeance for a people's wrongs, When bad men grind the good ? \u2014 We '11 tell our shame in battle-Bongs, And wash it out in blood. We '11 seek the fight Where Foemen smite, And prosper as we may : For ne'er yet fell so dark a night But brought the coming day."], [144, "124 SCOTTISH MELODIES. 2. Down !

Blood for blood, saith Holy Law; \u2014 And we will keep it true : \u2014 Our sharpen'd swords we long to draw, And try their edge on you. Come on ! \u2014 Come on ! \u2014 The battle 's won ! \u2014 Our hearts can never lie ! \u2014 For all their pulses beat as one, To conquer or to die. 4. Death !

This excellent air, the Author fears, is the undoubted pro perty of our Sister Isle ; and he has, therefore, adapted the words to a denizen of that country. He has some recollection of having heard this air sung by the late Sir Alexander Boswell, of Auchinleck, with words of his own composition, on a design somewhat similar to the following : And it ifl not impossible that part of these words may be unconsciously re tained in the present ; but he does not think that this can be to any great extent. i. 1 > Mnllyvmy darlin', how long will you tarry, And vex your poor Dermot with doubt and delay?

This was written in the very summit and access of the Railway Mania. The hint of both subject and tune was taken from a newspaper ; but the Author was not quite satis fied with the words there supplied, and attempted others of his own. The subject has been since invested with a some what painful interest, from the disastrous consequences which have followed that national insanity : But, as similar epide mics may recur in future, warnings are never unseasonable. 1.

This is one of those National Airs which were so beauti fully sung, in this country, several years ago, by the Rayner Family, under the name of The Tyrolese Minstrels. What its subject was, in the original language, the Author knows not; but its sprightly and pleasant character seemed to suggest it as not unsuitable for a May-day Carol. 1. Come away ! Come away ! Let us dance round the May ; Our Pole stands erect on the green : Trip along ! Trip along ! with the pipe and the song, To carol our May's bonny Queen : Let Strife hide his head ; Send old Care to bed ; Let blithe hearts abound ; Let bumpers go round ; Let voices be gay, and keep time to the lay That welcomes our May's bonny Queen. 2.

A WREATH I BRING OF FLOWERETS RARE. Hindoo Melody. This air is well known, and possesses much delicacy and simplicity. It stands the strongest test of good music ; \u2014 that of pleasing in countries the most remote, both in situation and in taste and habits, from that of its origin. The Author has never heard English words adapted to it. 1. A wreath I bring of flowerets rare, A wreath to bind thy flowing hair, My Fair : See roses rathe of lovely hue, See violets dipt in morning dew ; Their hues will fade, their scent will fly, But my fix'd Love shall never die. 2.

It is impossible to express exactly the Scottish pronuncia tion by our common orthography ; but a few General Rules may be given. The most notable distinction between the English and Scot tish pronunciation is in the sound of the vowel u, and the diphthong oo. The sound of these is generally the same, viz., that of the French \u00ab ,- as in the words tune, disjune, refuse ; poor, moon, aboon, Boon (the river). The same sound is given to the single o in the words do, done, shoe, &c. But there are also exceptions. Thus the word door is pronounced nearly as in English ; and the same of loon, broom, &c. Sometimes the French u is expressed by the diphthong us, as puir, muir, cuttle, &c. The diphthong ou has, in Scottish, generally the sound of the Italian u, or the English diphthong oo, as in the words sour, dour, about, stout, round, house, &c. But there are ex ceptions. The words roup, stoup, coup, &c, are pronounced with the same sound as in English. The diphthong ow is, in Scottish, used almost indifferently with ou, and has the same double sound : \u2014 Sometimes that of the Italian u, or English oo, as in power, bower, tower, crow i brown, town, cow, &c. Sometimes the same as the English, as in glowr, nowt, tow, worricow, how (hollow), low (flamej, Ate."], [156, "136 GLOSSARY. Scotland has also the sound of the imperfect English u in the words trust, must, &c, as in the words, busk, duds, luck, pund, &c. The consonantal sound which chiefly distinguishes the Scot tish pronunciation from the English is the German guttu ral, \u2014 indifferently spelled by the letters gh or ch, as in the words loch, stech, pech, fecht; rough, night, light, bright, fright, &c.
