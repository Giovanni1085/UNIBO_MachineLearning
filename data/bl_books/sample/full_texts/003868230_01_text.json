It is evident that our faculty of retaining what we have been at the trouble of getting- into our memory becomes more or less powerful according as the objects have at first been presented to us, and that it de pends chiefly on the simple manner and analytical order in which they have introduced, or laid themselves down in our mind. The systematical arrangement, and even the graphic disposition of those things that are particularly intended to be presented to youth, ought, therefore, to be possessed of those qualities to the most eminent degree ; and among the sciences, which requires a more simple and clearer exposition than the geographical nomenclature? that medley of incoherent words of the idioms of the different nations, that leaves, but too often, to the ungrateful memory, not only to lament her past trouble, but, what is worse, a disgust to renew it. Technical sciences, 1 repeat it, and geography in particular, should, therefore, not only be enounced clearly, but need also be clearly presented to the eye ; I say to tbe pye, _poanse, after the pre cept of Horace, the eye, I find, has in this, as well as in many other instances, as much share in our retentive faculties as memory itself. Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem, Suam qu\u0153 sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus. . . . Convinced of the truth of these ideas, and of the want of a complete and accurate selection in that most useful branch of education, I have completed the following analytical tables, in the hope of alleviat ing to young people part of so heavy a burden. These tables contain, in a successive and regular order, a complete and extensive course of geography, and are so contrived as to suit the capacity of the child as well as that of the most advanced pupil ; for the columns contained in each table being gradually loaded with particulars, the first column, or even part of it only, need be learned at first, as containing the most conspicuous divisions and general outlines of geography. For example : out of Table XIII and following, the names of the principal rivers of Europe, and the seas they flow into, may be learned at first : a pupil more advanced will find, in the next column, the place of the sources of those rivers, in the next the pro vinces they traverse, in the fourth the towns they water, in the fifth the length of their course, and lastly, their ancient names in the sixth ; and so on with the other topics. Another advantage of this method is also to present things collectively, and at one view, which, I have experienced, affords a greater help to me mory than when1- dispersed, as in most of the elementary books ; where taking the description of the diffe rent countries one after another, form, I may say, as many distinct geographies, which are far from helping each other in respect to memory. Lastly, as the nomenclature is to geography what chronology is to history, I think that children should be well grounded in that, or at least in the general outlines, before they should have any thiug to do with the description of the manners, customs, produce, &c. &c. of the different nations and countries ; a knowledge very useful in itself, but which should form a separate work, or be selected afterwards out of the best travels, memoirs, voyages, & c.,* otherwise the nomenclature, thus drowned, as Imay say, here among natural history, there amidst commercial interests, and what is worse, sometimes among the political opinions of the author, leave the unfortunate tyro to the trouble of forming a method of his own to allay his trouble. So much so that I have met with youths who could give a tolerable account of the pyramids of Egypt or of the caravans to Mecca, and were at a loss to tell the boundaries of Middlesex, or the name of the river that runs through Paris. * If this first part has any success a selection of this kind on a new plan will follow. A"], [8, "IV The ingenuous and most useful methods of teaching introduced by the Abbe Gaultier, to which children as well as myself are so much indebted, have had such success in this country, that I thought it my duty to improve that branch of them which I had particularly embraced, as much as my capacity would allow, and the further success of this geography will prove if I have been equal to the task. The several lessons will be found naturally divided by the tables themselves and by their columns. And the different titles or heads, of each article being printed separately at the end of the book, may be cut out, and applied on cards to answer the same purpose as the counters in the old work or game. The titles of the things that have been learned are to be parted from the others, and kept in a separate pack or box, and explained or repeated now and then, as chance brings them up. This exercise will accustom young people to a quickness of remembrance, and avoid the dullness usually attached to the repetition of lessons in general. And as nothing of Geography should ever be learned, or repeated, without pointing it on the map, I have engraved a large sized map of Europe, and four smaller of Asia, Africa, North America and South America, without any names on them and they should always be on the table, and consulted at the lesson. Sets of common maps may be had every where. I should also recommend, as one of the best exercises for young persons who begin to write well enough, to set down the names on the maps gradually, as they 1 _am them. The maps may be had in sheets, and uncoloured, separate from the book, for that purpose as well as boxes containing the questions or titles pasted and coloured."], [9, "GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE EARTH AND ITS NATURAL DIVISIONS. Geography is the description of the different parts of the surface of the earth, as the Greek words ge or gea, the earth, and grapho, I describe, I paint, express it. The earth, considered as the habitation of Man, presents, everywhere, nearly the same mass of uneven surface composed of land and water, more or less intermixed with mountains, valleys, inland seas, &c, the whole constantly bounded, or surrounded by a large circle, beyond which the eye cannot reach without changing its place, or height ; the more elevated the eye the further that circle seems to be removed. This circle, for that reason, we have called the horizon, from the Greek word, orizo, I define, I bound. Above the horizon the heavens appear like an immense vault, or cupola, on which the celestial bodies perform their daily course, and are said to rise and set when they emerge from, or sink under that circle. The point of the horizon out of which we see the sun rise, on the 21st of March or on the23rd of Septem ber, is called the East, and the point where we see it set, on the same days, is called the West. The sun ascends, gradually, every day, above the horizon, till it comes exactly in the middle, between the East and West points, and from that diminishes till it sets ; that middle point above the horizon is called South, and a line drawn at that moment from the sun down to the horizon is called the meridian. The point opposite to the South, or behind the observer is called the North. The easiest way, therefore, to find these points (called the cardinal, or principal points of the horizon) in a room, or in any other place, is to look towards the sun any day about noon, and let a string or ruler swing or fall from the sun's place to the horizon, that line will be your meridian, or South ; then you have the East on your left hand, the West at your right hand and the North behind you. But as we can walk, travel or sail in any other direction but those four, it was necessary to have the horizon divided into a greater number of points in order to express exactly the direction of our courses. As well as all other circles ; therefore, the horizon has been divided into 360 degrees, and these into 32 equal parts, called the points of the compass, each distant from the other 11 degrees and 15 minutes, the quotient of 360 by 32. The names of the 32 points of the horizon, or points of the compass, are : NORTH. N. by w. N. by E. N. N. W. N. N. E. N. w. by n. } C N. e. by it, > North West-> (-North East < N.w.byw. 3 CN.E.byE.

Beginners should be thoroughly acquainted with the eight principal of these points, and to point them readily on the map, as well as in the room in which the lesson is given, and afterwards out of doors. If the surface of the earth was seen from a proper distance it would appear like the moon, with many irregular spots, some bright and reflecting the sun's light, others dark and absorbing the rays. The former our lands and mountains and the latter our Seas. The most conspicuous bright spots would be Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, JVeto Holland, and the lesser Borneo, Madagascar, Britain New Zealand, $sc.$c. The dark spots would appear a great deal more considerable, for the pro-"], [10, "VI portion between the surface of water and that of land is nearly as three to one. The Great Southern Ocean, the Indian Sea, the Atlantic and Frozen Oceans, would be the most conspicuous ; the smaller dark spots would be the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Caspian, $c. To these different irregularities in the conformation of the land and of the waters the following appel lations have been given. PARTS OF THE LAND. PARTS OF THE WATERS. Continents, Islands, Peninsulas, Isthmuses, Capes or Promontories, Mountains, Oceans, Inland Seas, Gulfs or Bays, Straits, Rivers, Lakes. A Continent is the largest tractor space of land that can be travelled without any interruption of sea ; such as Asia, Europe and Africa, which taken together, we call the ancient Continent; and North and South America, which we call the New Continent, or New World, from its having been discovered as lately as 1492, by Christopher Columbus, a Genoese. An Island is land entirely surrounded by the sea, or by any other water. Several islands collected near one another are called clusters, or groups of isles, and sometimes Archipelago, by allusion to a sea of that name which is interspersed with islands. A Peninsula is a tract of land almost surrounded by water. An Isthmus is the narrow piece of land which joins the peninsula to another land. A Cape, or Promontory, is any point or head of land projecting far into the sea Mountains are either single, or collected in rows called chains of mountains. Single mountains, of any conspicuous height, are called peaks; and burning mountains are called volcanos. An Ocean is the largest collection of water uninterrupted by land. Our globe, or earth has five Oceans: 1 \u00b0. the Great South Sea, 2\u00b0. the Pacific Ocean, 3\u00b0. the Atlantic Ocean, 4\u00b0. the Indian Ocean, 5\u00b0. the Arctic, or Frozen Ocean. Inland Seas are smaller collections of waters, generally surrounded by Land, such as the Mediterra nean, the Baltic, &c. A Gulf, or Bay, is any part of the sea projecting or entering into the Land ; the smaller gulfs are also called, havens, ports, inlets, . creeks, &c. A Strait is a narrow channel, or passage of water between two lands; a strait is also called a sound, sir channel. A Lake is a collection of water formed in the interior of lands, either by rivers or by natural sprino-s. A River is a constant stream of water formed either by a strong spring or by the union of several brooks, which are called the source of it. Rivers that retain their names to the sea I call rivers of the first class', rivers that fall into those I call rivers of the second class, those into the second, rivers of the third class, and so on to the rivulets and brooks. The upper part of a river's course is the nearest to its source, and the lower part the nearest to its mouth, its opening, or confluence. Thus London is above Greenwich and below Windsor, Paris is above St. Cloud and below Choisy, &c. The right side of a river is at the right hand of a person looking down the stream, and the left side of it at his left hand. Thus London is on the left Bank of the Thames, and Greenwich on the right side. Children in their walks may be taught all these different terms by the easy and natural contrivance of pouring water on an uneven place in a yard or garden, or by a shallow pond, where they will soon discover by themselves many isles, peninsula's, gulfs, &c, and form a clearer idea of them than out of any book."], [11, "I TABLE I. GENERAL DIVISION OF EUROPE. Europe by its situation on the Globe, the temperature of its Climate and the general fertility of its Soil, and above all by the industry and civilisation of its Inhabitants, is justly placed the first among the general divisions of the Earth, and requires to be more minutely described. It lies between the 35 and 71 degrees of North Latitude, and measures about 3300 miles from North-East to South-West. Its popu lation may be estimated at 150 millions of Inhabitants. The figure it presents is very irregular, being intermixed with Islands, inland Seas, Gulfs, &c: the whole including 15 different Countries or Powers and 14 Seas. The Countries are disposed 4 to the North, 7 in the Middle and 4 to the South. NORTHERN COUNTRIES. MIDLAND COUNTRIES. SOUTHERN' COUNTRIES. r. COUNTRIES. Great Divisions.

It seems, therefore, almost indispensable not to give here a few of the most simple notions of that science, by way of introduction to this second Part of Geography, and as things necessary for all to know. I. There are but three dimensions or extents in nature : length, breadth and thickness. Thick ness is also called depth and height. Extent. II. Lines. Whatever has the first dimension only, or length is a line. Such as the distance between two steeples ; the length of a kingdom or province ; the horizon, or that natural line or boundary between the earth \u00a3nd the s^ies. III. Planes or Things that connect the two first dimensions, length and breadth, are called surfaces 01 surfaces, planes. Such as a field, a kingdom, a province, a map, &c. IV. Solids or Things that unite the three dimensions are denominated solids, or bodies, such as a stone, a bodies. wall, a mountain, a globe, &c. V Straight and curve lilies Lines and planes are either straight or curve, and bodies arc either regular or irregular. and planes. VI. Parallels. Lines and planes are said to be parallel when they are equally distant from each other in all their extent, and could never meet however far prolonged ; such as the furrows of a plowed field, the tracks of a pair of wheels on a road, the floor and ceiling of a room, &c. VII. Lines and planes that are not parallel must meet if sufficiently prolonged, and when they ' ng *' meet the space between them is an angle. An angle, therefore, is larger or smaller as the lines or planes are more or less inclined to each other. Vill. Horizontal. Lines and planes are said to he horizontal, when they are parallel to the horizon. Such as the ceiling and floors of rooms, the level of water, &c. IX. Perpendicu- Lines and planes are said to be perpendicular when they form with the horizon two equal lar. angles, which are then called right angles. Two lines or planes are also perpendicular to each other when they form equal angles together. A stone or lead suspended from a string is always perpendicular to the horizon, and workmen have no other way of ascertaining the regularity of the elevation of walls, buildings, &c. 1"], [78, "4 X Lines and planes are said to be oblique to each other when they form unequal angles ; the the larger angle being called obtuse (blunt), and the less acute (sharp). A book laid flat on a table forms no angle with it : if a little risen it will form with it two angles, one small and the other large ; rise it till it stands upright by itself, then the angles or spaces between it and the table will be equal, or right, and the book perpendicular. Oblique. XL Circle -^ circle is a plane figure formed by the revolution or turning of a straight line upon one of its extremities. A stick or string being fixed on a table by one of its ends, and being turned round, will describe a circle with its other end, isa pencil be affixed to it. Then the end pinned in the Centre, table is called the centre, and is, of course, equally distant from all the points of the pencil line, Radius, which is called the circumference of the circle- The string itself is called a radius. It is evident that the string shifting its position at the pencil discribes the circumference. There may be as many Radii. radii conceived as there are points in the circumference. XII. Diameter. The diameter of a circle is any straight line passing through its centre and dividing its sur- face equally. Two diameters being drawn perpendicular to each other will, therefore, divide the Quadrants, w hole circumference into four equal parts, called quadrants. XIII. The circumference of all circles is always supposed divided into 360 equal parts, called de- Division of qrees. Each degree subdivided into 60 minutes, each minute into 60 seconds and each second the circle, into 60 thirds, &c. &c. The degrees, minutes, seconds and thirds are thus marked on maps, &c. 30\u00b0 3' 4\" 1'\", or 30 degrees, 3 minutes, 4 seconds, 1 third, &c. XIV. If the summit or point of any angle be applied at the centre of a circle divided into its 360\", Measure of the lines, which form that angle, will contain or cut off a certain number of those degrees, then angle.. that number of degrees is called the measure of the angle. A right angle, for example, will cut off the fourth part of the circumference ; its measure is, therefore, 90 degrees, the 4th part of 360. An angle less open will cut off a less number of degress and be acute, all angles containing more than 90\u00b0 are obtuse XV. Globe or A globe or sphere, the most regular of solids or bodies, is formed or generated by the revo- Syhere. lution or turning of a circle upon one of its diameters. That diameter takes the name of axis, Axis. (axon, which is to lead, to direct), and the extremities or ends of the axis are called the poles Poles. (poleo, I turn). Every point of the generating circle, except the two poles, describe a circle at each revolu- Parallels of tiou ; these circles are called parallels of latitude, and that of them which is equally distant Latitude. from the two poles, that is, 90 degrees from each, is called the equator or equal divisor, because Equator, it divides the sphere or globe into two equal parts. The space between any of these parallel Zone. circles is called a zone or belt. XVI. Large circles. All circles having their centres common with that of a globe are called large circles, and Hemisphere divide the globe into two equal parts called hemispheres. All other circles are called small circles, or half sphere an(j are gma]ier the further their centres are remote from that of the globe. Remark, that small Small circles, circles are, nevertheless, divided into 360\u00b0, which become smaller in proportion to their circles. XVII. Measurement Measuring a thing is ascertaining the number of times that thing contains another previously agreed upon and taken for standard ; for example, measuring a cask or butt is ascertaining the number of gallons, quarts, pints, &c. contained in it."], [79, "5 a xvni. Lines are measured with lines, and distances are ascertained by repeatedly applying the standard straight measures ; such as, 12 inches which make a foot; 3 feet . . \u2022. . .a yard; b\\ yards a pole; 40 poles . , . . . a furlong; Measure of 8 furlongs ... a mile ; lines. 69\u00a7 miles .... 1 degree, and 360 degrees make the circumference of the earth, which, if a perfect sphere, would be 25,020 miles round. XIX. Planes or surfaces are measured with surfaces, or by applying on them the standard surface Measure of called square measure ; as a foot square, a yard square, that is a surface having a foot or yard surfaces lengthwise or breadthwise. Therefore, if all surfaces Mere regular, and had their sides parallel and at right angles, their surfaces could be as easily measured as the lengths of lines. For example, a plank a foot square, containing 12 inches in length and 12 inches in breadth ; the measure of its surface must be the multiplication of 12 by 12, or 144 square inches of wood. Again, a bed of ground measuring 9 yards in length by three in breadth ; its square surface is the multiplication of 9 by 3, or 27 yards square or 243 feet square. _\\____. But as on irregular figures a square measure cannot be applied, another method is adopted Measure of to find the measure of their surfaces. It is simple, for if surfaces or figures cannot be exactly irregular divided into squares, they may at all times be divided into as many triangles(a) as they have sides ; su r aces\" nothing remains, therefore, but to find the measure of the surface of triangles. XXI. The measure of the surface of any triangle is thus found. Multiply the number of yards, Measure of feet or inches contained in one of its sides by the number of feet, &c, found in half its height.(b) triangles, Or, again multiply the whole height by half of the base. Thus also is found the superficies of a circle. Multiply the whole circumference by half of the Measure of radius. If a circle or basin of water is found 20 feet in diameter it will measure 62 feet six-sevenths circles. in circumference, (c) then multiplying 62 six-sevenths by 5, which is half of the radius, the produce 314 feet two-sevenths will give the surface of the water. The surface of a globe or sphere is found by multiplying the circumference of one of its large circles by the whole diameter. XXII. Solids or bodies are measured with solids, such as a solid inch, foot, or yard, that is a block or Measure of mass having an inch, foot, or yard every way, such as a die, and is called a cube. A piece of soI'ds marble a foot cube contains 20,736 inches cube ; for each of its surfaces being the square of 12 contains 144 square inches which are to be multiplied by the depth, which is also 144, which pro duces 20,736 inches of marble. A room, measuring 14 feet in length, 10 in breath and 9 in height, the quantity of air it contains is thus asertained : multiply the length, 14, by the breadth, 10; the produce, 140, will give the the surface of the floor or of the ceiling. Multiply that surface 140 by the height 9, the produce will be 1260, the number of cubic feet of air in the room. XXIII. The solidity of a globe or sphere is found by multiplying its surface by the third part of the Measure of radius. Thus a globe or sphere IS inches in diameter and in circumference 56 inches four- g'\u00b0he or sevenths; the multiplication of these numbers produces 1018 two-sevenths for the surface ofthesp ere' globe as said at N\u00b0 . 22. Then multiplying that surface by the third part of the radius, or by 6, the third of 18, the produce, 6109 two-sevenths, will be the solidity of that sphere or globe. (a J A triangle is a plane having three sides and three angles. When the sides and angles are all equal it is said to be equilateral. When two sides and two angles only are equal it is called isoceles (equal legs), and when they are all unequal it is said to be scalene (limping). A triangle having a right angle in it, is called a rec tangular triangle. (bj The height of a triangleis the perpendicular drawn from any of its angles to the opposite side. (cj Tuke notice, that the diameter of circles and of globes and their circumference are always in the pro portion of 7 to 22; or if more accuracy be wanted of 1 13 to 355. c"], [80, "Solar system OF THE EARTH, CONSIDERED AS A PLANET; WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM La terre est un globe d'environ 3000 lieues de diametre, elie est situee a 30 millions de lieues du soleil, autour duquel elie fait sa revo lution en365jours. Ce mouvementde revolution est le resultat de deux forces, l'une qu'on peut se representer comme une impulsion de droite a gauche, ou de gauche a droite, et J'autre comme une attraction du haut en bas, ou du bas en haut vers un centre.

The earth is a globe of about 7934 miles in diameter. It is situated at about 95 millions of miles from the sun, round which it performs a revolution in 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes (a year). This circular motion is the result of two forces, or powers, which may be represented the first as an impulsion from right to left, or from left to right ; and the second as an .attrac tion from either side towards a centre. The quantity and direction of these forces are thus combined and proportioned that the globe is forced, by their mutual and continual efforts, to describe round the sun an ellipsisfa) or oval, very similar to a circles b) As well as the other planets, the earth is opaque ; it receives and re flects the sun's light, and revolves about him, according to laws adapted to its distance and to its relative density. The earth also turns on it self in 24 hours, and the axis round which that rotation is performed is inclined, or oblique to the plane of its annual circle, and forms with it an angle of 66 degress and a half. Buffon, Theorie de la Terre, Hist. Nat. Tom. I, pag. 127 et 128. Buffon 's Theory of the Earth, Vol. I, page 127. As Buffon, in these few and concise words, has embraced the most remarkable phenomena of the celestial mechanism, a thorough understanding of them will prove a sufficient knowledge in astronomy for young people, and for all who do not intend to make a particular study of that noble science. I shall, therefore, in the following developement, confine myself to make them clearly understood, and endeavour to enable youth to form a just idea of the harmony and cons truction of the universe, and, more particularly, of those articles that have an immediate connection with geography. Article 1. A system is the order and disposition of the different parts of a thing. The system of the universe is, therefore, the order, disposition or arrangement of the celestial bodies. 2. The celestial bodies, or stars, are of two very different kinds : the first are, like our sun, sources of light and heat, and do not appear to change their situation in regard to each other \u2022 (a J An ellipsis may be thus traced : put two pins, at a small distance from each other, into a board or paper, and tie to each of them the ends of a silk; then keeping the silk tight, by the gentle pressure of the point of a pencil let it mark on the paper as if you would describe a circle. The cuive thus traced will be an ellipsis. The farther the pins are from each other the longer aud narrower the ellipsis will be. (b) A stone tied at the end of a cord and whirled round may give some idea of these forces ; the impulsion given by the hand is the first cause of the motion, and but for the cord the stone would fly in a straight line ; but the cord retaining it towards the hand, forces it to describe a circle round that centre, and represents the attraction."], [81, "7 these are called fixed stars, or suns: they are dispersed through the immensity of space without Fixed stars. any apparent regularity or order as to their size and reciprocal distances. The first astronomers have divided them into clusters or constellations, to which they have given arbritrary names of men, Constellations animals, &c. Their distance from us is immense ; that of the nearest of them could not be ex pressed in miles with less than 12 figures. {See the table of the Constellations.) 3. The second kind of celestial bodies have no light of their own, but receive and reflect that of the sun. They are not fixed, like the others, but continually change their places in the heavens ; for which reason the Greeks have called them planets (planetes, erring), and as they Planets. are much nearer to us than the fixed stars we can trace their course among the former as they pass before them or eclipse them. 4. We know 29 planets, 11 of them are called primary planets, because they revolve or Primary turn round the sun ; and the 18 others turn round and appertain to some of the primary, and are planets. called their satellites (gards) or moons. 5. The primary planets are, Mercury, Venus, The Earth, Mars, Vesta, Juno, Ceres, Pallas, Jupiter, Saturn and Herschell. (a) Their several distances from the sun may be readily conceived by dividing a straight line in Proportional the following proportion : distances. 3\u20146\u20149\u201414\u201422\u201425\u201426\u201427\u201449\u201490\u2014180 The satellites, or moons, are thus distributed : one turns round the earth, four round Jupiter, Satellites or seven round Saturn, and six round Herschell. Moons. Comets are a sort of planets revolving about the sun, but describing about him very long Comets. ellipsis, or ovals ; so that at times they come very near him, at others are extremely remote from him ; whilst the paths of the other planets are nearly circular. From the nature of the ellipsis the comets might be supposed to revolve about two suns, one in each focus ; but their theory isyet very uncertain, and the return of very few correctly ascertained. 8. Tlie sun, the primary planets, their satellites and the comets all seen through teles copes appear to be nearly globular, and our earth seen from a proper distance would also appear under the same figure. Jupiter and Saturn are visibly flattened at each pole ; the earth is also flattened al the poles, and probably all the others ; but the compression is so small that it could \u2022 not be sensibly expressed on artifical globes, being but the three-hundredth part of the axis, or about 26 miles. 9. The most striking proofs of the globular figure of the earth are deduced, 1. from the Figure of the shape of its shadow at the time of the eclipses of the moon, for under whatever circumstance they earth. happen that shadow is circular. 2. From the depression or sinking of stars under the horizon, and the apparition of others above it, when we are sailing- or travelling in any direction. 3. Also the gradual appearance and disappearance of the shores and highest mountains, as we approach them or recede from them, and 4, the numerous voyages lately performed round it in almost every direction no longer permit us to doubt of its being a globe. 10. The ellipsis or paths the planets describe round the sun are called their orbits, or Orbits. ecliptics ; these orbits are not parallel to each other, but incline to one another, forming different angles like so many hoops placed within each other and intersecting into two opposite points called nodes or knots. The nodes are situated in different parts of the Heavens, and have a Nodes. regular slow motion westward. The word ecliptic is more particularly adapted to the orbit of the earth. 11. Before the discovery of the four new little planets, Mercury was that whose orbit formed the greatest angle with the orbit of the earth, or was the most elevated upon it. It formed with it an angle of nearly 7 degrees. The orbits of all the planets were, therefore, limited within a space or zone of the starry heavens occupying seven degrees to the North of the ecliptic and as many to the South.

As they proceed into their respective orbits all the planets turn or revolve upon them- selves, and have, therefore, a natural axis and poles. One is called the arctic, or north pole, and the other the antarctic, or south pole. This rotation procures the light and benefit of the sun to all their parts successively. Each rotation is a day.

Every spot on a planet must therefore come opposite or in face of the sun once every Meridian. revolution or day ; that moment is the noon or meridian of that spot. The meridian at one place cannot consequently happen at the same moment as it does at another more to the East or more to the West than itself: for the place to the East must come to the sun before and that to the West after it, by a time proportioned to their respective distances. The difference of time be- tween the meridian of one place and the meridian of another is called the longitude : hence it Longi u e. f0uows that places which come opposite to the sun, at the same time, have the same longitude or the same meridian or noon, (a) 17. As our earth turns on its axis in 24 hours and the equator is divided into 360 degees, (a) On artificial globes the 24 great semicircles passing through the poles and every 15th degree of the equator are called the meridiaD."], [83, "9 one hour of time answers to \\b degrees of that circle; or 15 degrees pass before the sun in one hour. Reduction of Again, as every hour is divided into 60 minutes, 60 divided by 15 will shew that each degree takes degrees into four minutes of time to pass before the sun. A place, therefore, situated one degree to the eastward t,me' of another is four minutes faster in time, and a place one degree to the westward is 4 minutes later. Bristol, for example, which is 2 degrees and 30 minutes to the West of London, passes to the meridian 10 minutes later than the capital. And Amsterdam, which is 4 degrees 62 mi- nutes to the East of London, has noon or comes to its meridian 10 minutes and 28 seconds before London. (\u00ab) 18. The time in which the planets perform their revolution round the sun forms their year ; the time they employ in turning- on their own axis forms their days ; it remains now to find the cause of the changes of the different seasons. The cause of the change of seasons on our earth may be thus explained: the sun's centre and the centre of the earth are in the same plane, that of the ecliptic ; if the axis of the earth had been perpendicular to that plane, that is to its Cause of the orbit, the two poles, during the annual revolution, would never have lost sight of the sun, but change of would have received its rays continually but very obliquely ; whilst the regions about the equator seasons. or middle of the globe would have had the sun constantly perpendicular ; and the countries be- tween the poles and the equator would have seen it constantly at the same elevation on their - horizon at noon and there woidd have been no change either in the temperature of the same place, nor any difference in the length of days; it would have been a continual equinox. 19. This may be rendered very intelligible by an easy experiment. Run a silk or thread through an orano-e or a ball, or any globular object, and hold it by the silk before the light of a candle: the part of the silk inside of the ball represents the axis, and the two opposite points where it enters the ball are the north pole above and the south pole below. Then if you carry the ball round the light from left to right, in a plane parallel to the surface of the table on which the candle is placed, and keep it at the1 height of the flame you will perceive that during the whole round or revolution the rays of the light will equally reach both the poles obliquely, and be perpendicular over the centre of the ball. Also, if you turn your globe on its axis, by twisting the silk between your fingers from left to right you may observe that any other spot but the poles will, in describing its circle or its latitude, remain an equal length of time in the darkened as in the enlightened hemisphere. And if such had been the position of the axis of our earth we should have a constant equinox, constant burning under the equator, constant gloom at the pole, and more or less heat or cold according to the latitude or distance of the places from the equator. W-Pole (a) The following scheme may convey a true idea of the longitude. Every body knows that a cannon may be fired by the sun's rays passing through the focus of any magnifying glass ; let us suppose then that on such a sea-coast as that of Sussex, which lies nearly East and West, such guns were placed, exactly in the me ridian, on the different parts of the cliffs. The 1st, for example, on Beachy-Head, the 2nd atSeaford, the 3rd at New Haven, the 4th at Rottendean, the 5th at Brighton, the 6lh at Shoreham, the 7th at Worthing, the 8th at Little Hampton, the 9th at Bognor, the 10th on Selsey-Bill and the last at St. Helen's. I say that all these n"], [84, "10 20. But if, instead of carrying the ball round the light in a plane or orbit parallel to the table, you carry it through an inclined or oblique plane, so that at one time or point it comes nearer to the table than at the opposite point, the change of seasons will be clearly elucidated. Axis inclined 1\u00b0. When, at the point of the circle where the ball or globe is lowest, or nearest to the table, you can easily see that the north pole alone enjoys the light of the sun, represented by the candle, and that the rays cannot reach the south pole, although you may turn it upon its axis, it is then summer for the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere ; this happens on the 21st of June. 2\u00b0. When the ball shall have reached the opposite point of the circle or the place, at which it is the furthest from the table, you may see the south pole in the rays of light and our north pole in darkness ; this is our winter; the 21st of December. 3\u00b0. You may also notice that, as the globe ascends from the lower to the upper part of the circle, and comes to the same height with the flame of the candle, both the poles are obilquely enlightened at once, and then an equinox takes place ; this is the beginning of our autumn ; the 23rd of September* Fourthly and lastly, another equinox will happen when the globe comes again in the plane of the light, as it passes from the upper to the lower part of its orbit, \u2014 this is the vernal or spring equinox, on the 23rd of March. 21. From thence it is evident that the more or less inclination of the Axis of the earth or of any other planet to their orbit must cause a great difference in the manner in which they are illuminated by the sun, and the greater the inclination so is the variation of their seasons. The earth's axis forms with its orbit an angle of 66 degrees and about 30 minutes, and the equator an angle of 23 degrees and 30 minutes. The sun, therefore, can never be farther from our equa tor than 23 degrees 30 minutes towards the North, and the same quantity towards the South, which take up a space of the globe 47 degrees in breadth, and out of this the sun never deviates ; that space we call the torrid or burnt zone. 22. On the 21st of March, or vernal equinox, the earth being at the point where the plane of its equator cuts the orbit, the sun is over the middle of the torrid zone, and seems to describe Summer.

Also, such gun, placed in the meridian at the Tower of London, will fire exactly in the same time as that placed about Brighton, being both under the same meridian and having therefore no difference in longitude. 2"], [85, "11 the equator, but as the earth proceeds every day, the sun's rays fall higher and higher towards the North Pole. If it was possible that it it could leave its trace, on the surface of the globe from the 21st of March to the 21st of June, that trace would be a spiral line, (a) having as many turns or circumvolutions as there are days in that lapse of time, that is 92, all of them contained between the 23 degrees and about 30 minutes; this is called the sun's Sun's decU* declination. tion. 23. If the inclination of the axis had been less than 66 degrees 30 minutes, the number of the circumvolutions of the spiral would have been greater, and of course the torrid zone broader, as is the case with the planet Mars, whose axis being inclined to its orbit of only 59 degrees and T .^ zones 22 minutes, the sun deviates from its equator of 30 degrees and 38 minutes towards the North of the other and the same towards the South ; its torrid zone is, therefore, 71 degrees and 16 minutes broad. Planets. Venus, on the contrary, whose axis it is supposed is 75 degrees inclined to its orbit, can have its torrid zone only of 30 degrees broad. Jupiter, whose axis is perpendicular to its orbit, has no torrid zone, the sun never deviating from its equator, and, therefore, all its regions have a per petual equinox. 24. The boundaries of the torrid zone or the two last turns of the spiral line towards the North and South are called the tropics, (from the Greek trope, return), because it is evident that Tropics. the sun returns to the South after it has described the northern tropic, and returns towards the North after describing the southern one. The first is called tropic of Cancer and the other tropic of Capricorn. 25. The diurnal apparent motion of the celestial bodies appears differently performed, seen from different parts of the earth. An inhabitant of the Pole, for example, (if any could be), would never see the fixed stars rise or set to his horizon ; he would constantly see them describing round him complete circles, more or less elevated and always parallel to his horizon, in 24 hours; the most elevated stars describing lesser circles, until that star which appears to be almost per pendicular over his head, and is called for that reason the pole star, does not appear to have any Pole star. motion. This situation on the globe may be compared to that of a man at the summit of a high moun tain; this man, turning himself round, will not lose sight of any of the objects above his horizon, they will appear to have performed a circle round him every time he turns on himself. One point alone will be fixed, that is the point perpendicularly over his head, called the zenith. In Zenith. this situation she equator becomes the horizon, and therefore all the time the sun remains on that side of the equator, that is from one equinox to the other, or six months, that pole has it constantly parane| on its horizon. This is called, for that reason, the parallel sphere. sphere. 26. To an observer, situated at the equator, all the heavenly bodies seem to rise perpendicu larly out of his horizon, and describe from East to West a semi-circular arch every twelve hours ; those which rise nearest to the East point describing larger arches, and those which rise nearest to the Poles smaller arches, so that the poles are again motionless. This is called the right sphere. R. . , This situation may also be compared to that of a man at the bottom of a mountain ; he may turn himself round, but he loses all the objects that are behind the mountain, or exactly one half of his horizon. The sun, therefore, describing similar semicircles every day, cannot be longer than 12 hours above the horizon and twelve hours below ; making constant equal day and night. 27. In the right sphere, or at the equator, the pole star is seeu in the horizon but as soon as the observer sails or travels towards the North or towards the South, the pole is seen rising above the horizon, and the horizon reaches beyond the pole as many miles or degrees as were travelled through. The elevation of the pole star above the horizon is, therefore, always equal to the dis tance of the equator, or to the latitude of the place of observation. At any other place but at the poles, or at the equator, the sun, the planets and all the stars seem to describe arches or circles more or less oblique to the horizon, according to the height of the latitude. The man, half way up the mountain, must see a greater part of his horizon than the man at the base ; for the mountain being thinner there than at the bottom, it must hide a less quantity of the surrounding objects, and the more he ascends the more he comes to the full view, or to lhe parallel sphere. This situation is called the oblique sphere. It is to be observed that, in this oblique situation of the sphere, all the Oblique parallels described by the sun are all unequally divided by the horizon, so that the diurnal arch is sphere. sometimes larger and sometimes less than the nocturnal arch, whilst under the equator those par- lay A spiral line, or volute, is a curve line formed by the revolution of a point, round a centre from which it deviates every moment.

It follows from these three different positions of our horizon in respect to the equator, pects in the first, that at the pole never more than one half of the firmament can ever be seen, and is constantly three post- geen secon,ily_ that at the equator the wholeof the firmament is seen in 24 hours ; apd thirdly, that horizon. ' between the pole and the equator, that is in the oblique sphere, more or less of it is seen according to the latitude, or distance from the equator. 29.

Thus, London being in latitude 51 degrees and 30 minutes, its complement of latitude must be 38 degrees aud 30 minutes. The horizon of London reaches then to 38 degrees and 30 mi- nutes to the South of the equator; all the stars, therefore, that are beyond that, or that have a higher southern latitude, can never be seen in London. Circlesofper- On the contrary, all these stars that have a greater declination from the equator towards the petual appa- North, are never seen to set or sink under the horizon of that town. These parallels are called cir ntton and o of perpetual apparition and of perpetual occupation. cultation. ' There is no situation on the earth at which the sun can be seen to rise exactly in the East point two days together. On the 31st of March, or vernal equinox, the sun being over or describing the equator, it will rise in the true East point and set in the true West; but on the next and fol- lowing days it will rise and set to the horizon a little more towards the North, and will continue so until the 21st of June, or sum mer solstice. The rising and setting points will then return gra- dually towards the true East, and reach it again at the equinox the 23rd of September. From that equinox to the other solstice, the 21st of December, the rising and setting points will de- viate in the same proportion from the true East, but toward the South and at last reach the East again the 21st of March. This continual shifting of the rising and setting points is called the Sun's ampli- sun's amplitude, and is counted on the horizon, from the East point towards the North or towards tude. the South. The amplitude, if reckoned towards the East is called ortive, if towards the West occasive. 31. In the right sphere, or under the equator, the sun's amplitude can never exceed 23\u00b0 and 30 minutes towards the North or South, and at the pole or in the parallel sphere the sun has no amplitude, but in the oblique sphere the amplitude increases with the latitude, so much so that at 66 degrees and 30 minutes North, on the 21st of June, the sun's amplitude is 90 degrees, and therefore the sun is seen to rise and set in the North point exactly, and consequently day light Greatest am- lasts there for 24 hours. In London, the greatest amplitude is 39 degrees 10 minutes. At Peters plitude. bourg, in latitude 59 degrees 56 minutes, the greatest amplitude is 50 degrees and 52 minutes. 32. As the amplitude increases with the latitude, the length of day-light must also increase in the same proportion ; and that difference in the length of days in the different latitudes has given Climates. place to the ancient division of the earth into climates. The greatest amplitude being 90 degrees, at 66 degrees and 30 minutes of North and South latitude it causes the difference of 12 hours in . . the length of the longest day between the equator, and the latitude 66 degrees 30 minutes, arctic and ' which is called the arctic circle in the northern hemisphere and the antarctic circle in the antarctic. southern. 33. The antients have then divided the space between the equator and each of these circles Climates of into 24 climates, each differing from the next by half an hour in the length of their longest day. half hours. The longest day in London being 16 hours 34 minutes it must be under the 9th climate. But beyond the arctic circle the sun remains some months above the horizon without setting or without any amplitude, and at the pole itself it is six months above and 6 months below the horizon. The space between the pole and the polar circles has been divided into six climates, each differing from the next by one month in the length of day light. Thus Cape North, in Lapland, being at 71 de er f Srees 6 minutes north latitude, and the sun remaining 67 days together on its horizon it must be months. between the 2nd and 3rd climate of months. 34. The point of the equator which is in the same meridian with the sun, at any time, is called Right ascen- the sun's right ascension, because in the right sphere that point always rises above the horizon at oton. the same moment with the sun. The right ascension is counted on the degrees of the equator from the first degree of Aries towards the East to 360."], [87, "13 In the oblique sphere the right ascension rises with the sun only on the equinoxial days, on all the other days it rises either before or after it. The right ascension rises after the sun from the vernal equinox to the autumnal, and before the sun the other six months. But if the right ascen sion does not rise, in the oblique sphere, at the same instant with the sun, some other point of the equator must ; and that point, which changes every day, is called the oblique ascension ; and the ob,,(lue number of degrees of the equator, between the right and oblique ascension, forms the ascensional 3C . difference, which being reduced into degrees, will shew how much the sun rises or sets before or after six o'clock. For example, on the 14th of April, the sun's right ascension being 24 degrees, and the oblique ascension 1 1 degrees 30 minutes, the ascensional difference is 12 degrees 30 minutes; answeringto 50 minutes of time, which the sun rises before six \u2014 that is, ten minutes after five. 36. The different situations of men, in regard to their latitude and longitude, bave formed the different appellations of Anti\u0153cii, Peri\u0153cii and Antipodes. The A nti\u0153cii are those who live Anti\u0153cii. under the same meridian, and have the same latitude in the opposite hemisphere. They have the same hours, but different seasons. Such are the inhabitants of Lower Egypt to those of the Land of Natal, in the South of Africa. The Peri\u0153cii are those who live under the same parallel of latitude, in the same hemisphere; peri\u0153cii. but, more particularly, those who have opposite meridians, or are 180 degrees or 12 hours, from each other. They have the same seasons, but opposite hours. Such are the inhabitants of North America to those of Siberia, New Holland and South America. The Antipodes have the same latitude, but opposite meridians and opposite hemispheres. Antipodes. They have both the seasons and the hours reversed.

The different manners in which the shadows are cast have also given the following appellations of Ascii, Amphiscii, Heterescii and Periscii to the inhabitants of the different zones. The antients termed Ascii, shadowless, the inhabitants of the torrid zone, on the day the sun Ascii. described their latitude ; for on that day, at noon, the sun being exactly at their zenith, their shadows were under them, and consequently unseen for one instant. They called Amphiscii those Amphiscir. whose shadows are turned sometimes towards the North, and sometimes towards the South, such are the people of the torrid zone. When the sun is to the South of the equator their shade is turned towards the North, and vice versa. Ampho, both, and scia, shadow. The inhabitants of the temperate zone have their shadows constantly casted towards their respective pole, because the sun never leaves the torrid zone. They nave the appellation of ffeteroscii, different shadows, or shadows differently turned. Heterosci.. In the frigid zones, the whole time the sun remains above the horizon without setting, the shadows must turn round the whole horizon, as the sun does, and describe a circle round the objects ; and from that the name of Periscii, peri, round, scia, shadow. All the time the sun re- Periscii. mains constantly under the horizon, the inhabitants of the frigid zones are, of course, without shadows, and are the only true Ascii on the globe. The Ascii of the ancients should have been called Uposcii, shadow under them. Uposcii. 38. The solar system being thus composed of planets turning round the sun, as the centre of their motions, and of satellites revolving round their primary planets, according to the same laws of gravitation and of impulsion, or by any other power yet unknown to us. One might sup pose to see them perform their courses uniformly from West to East, according to the order Apparent ir of signs, or as it is called, in consequential but it is not the case in appearance, for we observe regularities in the planets sometimes in a direct motion, at other times following a retrograde motion, or going the course of against the order of signs, which is called antecedentia, and even sometimes they appear to be tne Planets still, or stationary, that is, answering for some days together to the same point of the Zodiac, without any apparent motion. 39. Tnese apparent irregularities in the course of the planets were the first cause of the rejecting the system ofPtolomy; for as that philosopher placed the earth in the centre of the Ptolomaic universe, and supposed that the sun, the planets and even the fixed stars, described daily circles system. round it, he was obliged, to account for these irregularities, to suppose a quantity of smaller cir cles deviating from the orbit of each planet, which he called epicycles, or circles upon circles, and which threw such a confusion in his system, that Alphonsus X, king of Castille, who passed his leisure hours in astronomy said that, if his opinion had been called for, when the universe was constructed, he might have given good advice (a). (a) Vide Fontenelle Plurality de\u00bb Monde.. E."], [88, "14 40. These retrograde motions and stationary appearances of the planets are a mere optica , The system deception, and only derives from the situation we are in to view their annual course ; for if, instead viewed from of being placed on the earth, we could observe them from the sun, the common centre of their the sun. orbits, these irregularities would subside ; and from that common centre, only, their motions can appear constantly direct and uniform. 41. The following scheme may give a just idea of these appearances. Suppose yourself at the centre of a large circle, or ring, and a horse to be walked slowly round the ring, from the Scheme right hand to the left, you will easily observe that, after a complete circle or revolution, the animal has passed before, or eclipsed for you all the outer or surrounding objects, such as trees, houses, &c, without any irregularity, or without being retrograde, or covering the same object twice, or having appeared still, or stationary at any time. Your situation, in this case, is that of the observer in the sun at No. 40. 42. But the whole aspect will change if you place yourself outward of the ring. In the first place, when the horse comes to that part of the circle where he appears to you to be farthest from the centre of it, on your right hand, which is called its greatest elongation, you may observe, \u201e , that for a few paces or yards, he shall seem to walk in the direction of the same tree or other object, until the curve of the circle be disengaged out of the right line, or visual ray from you to him : all that time he is said to be stationary, although he never stopped. Secondly, as soon as he begins to eclipse any other object, his motion becomes direct, and continues to be so until he arrives on the other side of the ring, at his greatest elongation on your left hand, where it ap- pears stationary again for some time. Thirdly, as soon as the curve or circle is again disengaged from the visual ray, and during all the time the animal passes between you and the centre of the circle, he seems not to pass before any new objects, but to come back again over the same trees, houses, & c, he had passed before when in direct motion, only in a contrary direction ; that is, from left to right or in antecedentia. 43. Such is the case with the two planets, Mercury and Venus, which being nearer the sun than Inferior ourselves and whose orbits being entirely included within ours, are called, for that reason, inferior planets. planets. And from that reason also follows, first, that they can never be seen in the middle of the night, or opposed to the sun, no more than you could see the horse behind your back, in the fore- Elongation going scheme. Secondly, that they are always seen very near the sun ; for their greatest elongation is small, that of Mercury forming with the sun an angle of only 28\u00b0, and that of Venus one of 47\u00b0. Thirdly, that they are sometimes seen before sun rising and sometimes after sunset. We see them in the morning, when they are in the western part of their orbit ; and in the evening, when in the eas- tern ; and when they happen to be behind the sun, or very near it, they become invisible, which is very often the case with Mercury. And fourthly, that when they pass between the earth and the sun, they can sometimes be seen passing over the sun's disk as a small black spot ; thijs is called the transit of Mercury or Venus. Mercury will be seen in the sun's disk on the 1 ltli of November next, 1815; and Venus not before the 8th of December, 1874. Superior 44.

PROBLEMS RELATIVE TO THE TERRESTRIAL PLACES, (a) I. To find the latitude of a given place. \u2014 Bring the given place to the graduated edge of the brass meridian, where the degrees are marked and numbered from the equator ; then the degree over the given place will be its latitude, or distance from the equator. For example : London will be found 51 degrees and 30 mi nutes to the North of the equator, etc. II. To find the difference in latitude between two places. \u2014 Take the latitude of both the places, and subtract the greatest from the least of these latitudes ; the remainder wdl express the difference. III. To find all the places that have the same latitude as a given place. \u2014 Put a style or dry pen on the brass meridian over the given place, and turn the globe once round ; all those places that will pass under the style have the same latitude as the given place. IV. To find the distance between two places on the globe. \u2014 Take the distance between the places, either with a pair of compasses, or the quadrant of altitude, or with a slip of paper, and bring that distance over one of the great circles, such as the equator or meridian, and reckon the number of degrees it contains : that number multiplied by 69| will give the number of english miles, if multiplied by 20 the number of sealeagues. V. To rectify the globe ; or to dispose the general horizon so as to become the horizon of any particular place. \u2014 Find the latitude of the given place, and leave it under the meridian. Then if you rise the nearest pole above the horizon the same number of degrees as expressed by the latitude, the general horizon be comes the horizon of the given place ; and setting the meridian North and South by the compass, the globe is rectified. VI. To find the bearing of one place to another ; that is, what point of the compass it is situated in regard to another place. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the given place, and screw the quadrant of altitude to the zenith ; turn the quadrant till it falls upon the other place, ana the point of the compass will be found upon the second circle of the horizon. VII. To find the longitude of a given place on the globe. \u2014 Bring the given place under the meridian : the degree of the equator which the meridian then cuts is the longitude either East or West. VIII. To find the difference in longitude between two places on the globe. \u2014 Find the longitude of both places, and subtract the least from the greatest ; the remainder will express their difference, either in degrees or in time; allowing four minutes of time to each degree, four seconds of time for each minute of degree, four thirds of time to every second of degree, &c, &c_ (a) The definitions at the beginning of this treatise should be perfectly understood before any of these problems should be attempted."], [90, "16 IX. To find all the places that have the same longitude with a given place ; or that keep the same time. \u2014 Bring the given place to the brass meridian : all those places under that circle, on the same side of the globe, have the same longitude, or time. X. The latitude and longitude of a place being given, to find that place on the globe. \u2014 Look on the equator for the given longitude, either East or West of the meridian of London, and bring it under the side of the meridian which is graduated from the equator ; then find the given latitude, and the required place is under that decree of the meridian. 8 XI. To find the hour at any other place, when it is a given hour in London. \u2014 Bring London to the brass me ridian, and set the index of the hour circle at the given hour, and turning the globe until the other place \u00c6omes to the meridian, the index will shew the hour at that place. XII. To find the Anti\u0153tii, the Peri\u0153cii and Antipodes of a given place. \u2014 First, bring the place under the general meridian, and having noticed its latitude, look under the same meridian for the same latitude to the south of the equator ; at the place under it are the Anti\u0153cii of the given place. Secondly, leaving the globe as it is, set the hour index at 12, and turn the globe until the index points to the opposite 12 ; then under the same parallel of latitude are the Peri\u0153cii of the first place. Thirdly, leaving again the things as they are, look for the Anti\u0153cii of the last found place, they will give you the Antipodes of the first given place ; for our ([antipodes are the anti\u0153cii of our peri\u0153cii ; or which comes to the same, the peri\u0153cii of our anti\u0153cii. PROBLEMS RELATIVE TO THE SUN. v XIII. To find the sun's place in the ecliptic for a given day. \u2014 Find the day of the month, with the sign of the zodiac and the degree of the sign it answers to, on the large circles traced for that purpose on the breadth of the general horizon. The same degree being found on the ecliptic will be the sun's place for the given day. XIV. To find the sun's declination for any given day. \u2014 Bring the sun's place to the brass meridian, the degree over it will be its declination or distance from the equator, either North or South. XV. To find the sun's meridional altitude, or elevation above the horizon at noon, for a proposed day or place. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the given latitude and bring the sun's place under the meridian ; then the num ber of degrees of the meridian between the sun's place and the horizon will be the altitude at noon. XVI. To find the two days of the year that have equal declination and equal meridional altitude. \u2014 The globe being rectified, set a pencil or pen over the given declination and altitude, and turn the globe until the ecliptic be twice cut by the pencil, and look on the circle of the signs to what days they answer. XVII, The latitude and the meridional altitude being given, find the day. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the given place, and having marked the sun's declination on the meridian, turn the globe until the ecliptic comes under it, and the degree of that circle will tell you the day. XVIII. The sun's meridional altitude and declination being given for a certain day, find the latitude. If the sun's declination is northern, subtract it from the meridional altitude, the rest will express the complement of the latitude to 90 ; but if the declination be southern add it to the meridional altitude. If the complement happens to be 38\u00b0 30' of course the latitude must be 51\u00b0 30', &c."], [91, "17 XIX. To find the time of the sun rising and setting, and therefore the length of the day and night. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude, find the sun's place in the ecliptic, bring it under the meridian, and set the hour index at 12 ; turn the globe until the sun's place touches the eastern edge of the horizon, and the index will point the time of sun-rising; turn it till the sun's place comes to the western edge of the same circle, and the index will point the time of sun-setting. XX. Tofind the sun's amplitude, or point of the horizon it rises out of. \u2014 By the last problem the suns place being brought to the eastern or western edg-e of the horizon, the degree of that circle it touches will indicate the amplitude, or distance the sun rises from the true East point. The eastern amplitude is called ortive and the western occasive. ' XXI. Tofind the beginning and end of the twilight in a given place and day. \u2014 The globe being rectified and the sun's place brought to the eastern edge of the horizon, and the hour index shewing the time of sun rising, screw the quadrant of altitude in the zenith and extend it over the sun's place : turn the globe towards the East until the sun's place is depressed 18 degrees of the quadrant under the horizon, then the hour index will point at what time the twilight begins on that day. If the sun's place happens not to be depressed of so many degrees as 18 it shews that the twilight lasts all night, otherwise, that there is no real nio-ht. The ending of twilight is found in the same manner, but towards the West. XXII. To find for what latitude the twilight begins to last all night. \u2014 Bring the first degree of Cancer below the North point of the horizon, and sink it under that circle until it answers to 18 degrees below it. The \"\u25a0lobe will be\" rectified for latitude 48\u00b0 40', at which the twilight begins to last all night. XXIII. The twilight during several nights together at a certain place, that isfrom a certain time to another,find the latitude. \u2014 Reduce the number of nights into degrees of the ecliptic, and taking half of them before the first degree of Cancer and half after, elevate or lower the pole until the beginning of the first part of the ecliptic correspond to 18 degrees of the northern part of the meridian .below the horizon, then the globe is rectified for the latitude sought. XXIV. The latitude being given find how many days the twilight lasts all night. \u2014 Rectify the globe, and having marked on the North part of the meridian 18 degrees below the horizon, turn the globe until the ecliptic touches the mark before and after the first degree of Cancer ; that space of the ecliptic will give the number of days without any dark nights. XXV. Tofind at what time the sun will be due East or West at a given latitude, on a given day. \u2014 Rectify the globe, bring the sun's place under the meridian and set the index at 12; and having screwed the quadrant of altitude in the zenith, lay it over the East or West points of the horizon ; then bring the sun's place to the edge of the quadrant, and the index will tell you the hour. XXVI. To find the length of the longest day in. a given latitude. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude, and bring the nearest solsticia. point (the first degree of Cancer for Europe) to the meridian, and having set the hour index at 12, turn the sun's place from the eastern to the western edge of the horizon, and the index will go over the number of hours sought. XXVII. Tofind the climate of a given place. \u2014 Having found by the last problem the longest day for the given place, subtract 12 from the number and double the rest of the hours, the number will express the climate. Thus in London the longest day being 16 hours 34 minutes, that town is under the 9th climate. XXVIII. To find the climate of months, of a place within the frigid zone ; or how long the sun remain* constantly above its horizon.\u2014 Rectify the globe for the given place and, turning round, observe how many _ F"], [92, "18 degrees of the ecliptic pass above the horizon towards the northern part of the meridian before the first degree of Cancer. If 15 degrees pass, the place is under the first climate of months ; if 30, under the second, &c. XXIX. Knowing the length of a given day, find the latitude.\u2014 Bring the sun's place, for that day, under the meridian and set the index at 12 ; turn the globe towards the East until the index shows half the length of the proposed day, and elevate or lower the pole until the sun's place comes to the eastern edge of the horizon ; the globe will then be rectified for the latitude sought. XXX. Tofind the sun's altitude above the horizon at any given moment.\u2014 Rectify the globe for the place of observation and bring the sun's place under the meridian, the index at 12, and the quadrant of altitude in the zenith ; then turn the globe until the index shows the required moment, and the quadrant laid over the sun's place will shew the number of degrees it is elevated on the horizon. Circles drawn parallel to the ho rizon through the different altitudes are called almicanters. XXXI. Tofind the sun's azimuth for a given place and moment.\u2014 The sun's azimuth is its distance from the meridian, measured upon the degrees of the horizon; having therefore rectified the globe, and brought the sun's place under the meridian and the index at 12, turn the globe till the index shows the given hour, and lay the quadrant of altitude over the sun's place ; the degree of the horizon counted from the South point, where the quadrant intersects it, shews the azimuth, which is eastern before noon and western after noon. The places of the torrid zone, above 5 degrees, have the sun twice in the same azimuth in the forenoon. XXXII. The sun's azimuth and altitude being observed, find the hour. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the place of observation. Place the sun under the meridian, the index at 12, and the quadrant of altitude over the given degree of azimuth ; then turning the globe until the sun's place comes to the given altitude on the quadrant, the index will shew the hour required. XXXIII. To trace a meridian line in a room or garden. \u2014 Stick a pin or needle perpendicular into a table or board, in a place exposed to the sun, and sometime before 12, at 10 or 11, (the oftener the better), mark on the table with a pencil the azimuth, or the end of the shadow of the pin, and from the foot of the pin, and by every one of the shadow points draw a circle ; then watch, after noon, when the shadow corresponds again to the same circles, and mark a dot on each , then drawing straight lines from the pin to all the dots, and bisecting the angles, the bisecting line will be the meridian of the place which you draw on the floor to rectify your globes by. XXXIV. Tofind the variation of the magnetic needle. \u2014 The needle in very few places points exactly North or South, but varies either East or West ; and in order to find that variation, find a meridian line of the place of observation, compare that with the magnetic needle, and you will seethe number of degrees of that variation. Now in London the variation is nearly 25 degrees West. XXXV. To trace a horizontal sun dial. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude of the place, and bring the meridian of London under the brass meridian, and set down on a paper the degrees of the horizon cut by each of the other hourly meridians ; that is, the first hour at 11\u00b0 51'; the second 24\u00b0 19' ; the third 38\u00b0 3'; the fourth 53\u00b0 36' ; the fifth at 71\u00b0 6', and the sixth at 90\u00b0. Next draw a circle on a stone or board and divide it into de grees, and laying a ruler from the centre to the degrees above, on each side of the diameter, draw right lines to the circumference of the circle. Cut now a piece of card or wood forming an angle equal to the latitude of the place and glue it erect on your board in the diameter of the circle, with the summit of the angle at the centre. Then if you expose it thus to the sun, having the diameter in the meridian line, the shadow of the style, or erected card, will point the hours on the circle. XXXVI. Tofind all those places of- the torrid zone that have the sun in their zenith on a given day. \u2014 Find the sun's declination for the given day, and all those countries that have a latitude equal to that declination are in that case."], [93, "19 XXXVII. To find at a given moment the place of the earth over which the sun is perpendicular. \u2014 Find the sun's place in the ecliptic for the given day ; bring it to the meridian ; notice the declination, and set the index at 12 ; then turn the globe until the index points the given moment, and under the declination will lay the place of the then Ascii. XXXVIII. To find the two days at which certain inhabitants of the torrid zone are Ascii, or shadowless at noon. \u2014 Having found by the foregoing problems one of the days at which the sun comes to their zenith, notice the declination and turn the globe until another degree of the ecliptic comes to the same declination, that will be the other day. XXXIX. Tofind at a given moment for what countries the sun is rising or setting; where it is noon or midnight, and those that are in the twilight. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the sun's place at the given moment by Prob. 37. The sun is then rising for all those countries situated on the western edge of the horizon, and setting for those on the eastern edge. Those under the meridian have noon, and those under the opposite side of the meridian have midnight. Lastly, all those countries that are less than 18 degrees below the horizon are in twilight. XL. Tofind the sun's right ascension. \u2014 The sun's right ascension is the degree of the equator cut by the meridian passing through the sun's place. Bring, therefore, the sun's place under the brass meridian, and the degree of the equator cut by that circle will express the right ascension ; \u2014 so called from its rising constantly with the sun in a right sphere, or under the equator. XLI. To find the sun's oblique ascension.\u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude, and bring the sun's place to the eastern edge of the horizon. The point of the equator then also in the horizon is the oblique ascension, or the degree of the equator that rises with the sun in an oblique sphere. XLII. The right and obliquq ascension being known for a certain day, find how much time the sun rises before or after six. \u2014 Take the difference between the two ascensions and convert the number of degrees into time ; add that to six, when the right ascension surpasses the oblique, and subtract when it is less. XLIII. The time of a solar or lunar eclipse being given, find if it is visible at a given place. \u2014 Rectify the globe^or the sun's vertical place at the given time, the solar eclipse will be visible for all above the horizon , and the lunar eclipse to all in the opposite hemisphere. If, however, the eclipse was small, it would not be visible in the countries too near the horizon. XLIV. A place being given in the North frigid zone, tofind when the sun begins to shine constantly, and how long. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the given place, and looking at the intersection of the horizon with the northern part of the meridian, observe how many degrees pass above the horizon before and after the first degree of Cancer, and referring then to the calendar, you will have the days required. XLV. To find at what latitude the longest day is of a given length. \u2014 Bring the solstitial point under the meridian and the index at 12. Turn the globe until the index shews half the length of the day proposed, and slide the meridian up or down until the solstitial point touches the horizon, the globe will then be recti fied for the required latitude. XLVI. Tofind the hour of the day by the sun's rays for any latitude or day. \u2014 Place the globe on a true level and the brass meridian exactly in the meridian line of the place. Then rectify the globe for the latitude and in the sun's place fix a pin perpendicular to the surface of the globe ; bring the pin to the meridicn and set the indexat 12. If you turn the globe until the pin casts no shadow, the index will point the hour of the day."], [94, "20 PROBLEMS RELATIVE TO THE FIXED STARS XLVII. To find the right ascension and the 'declination of a given star.\u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude and bring the star under the general meridian, then the degree of the equator cut by the meridian expresses the right ascension of the star, and the degree of the meridian over it shows its declination, or its distance from the equator, either North or South. XLVIII. The right ascension and declination of a star being given find it upon the globe. \u2014 Find the given as cension on the equator and bring it under the meridian, the star is then in the meridian under the given de^ee of declination. XLIX. In a given latitude find the time of the rising and setting of any star and its passage by the meri dian. \u2014 Rectify the globe, bring the sun's place in the meridian and put the index at 12. Turn the globe on its axis so that any one star comes to the eastern part of the horizon, the index will point the time of its rising, bring it in the same manner to the meridian and to the vv .stern side of the horizon, the index will shew its passage by the meridian and its time of setting. Also may be observed the point of the horizon out of which it rises, that is, its amplitude and the length of time it remains above the horizon in a given latitude. L. In a given latitude and day find the hour of the night by the passage of a star by the meridian, or by its rising and setting. \u2014 Rectify the globe, and bring the sun's place to the meridian, and set the index at 12. Then if you bring the star to the meridian, or to the eastern part of the horizon, if you see it rising at the moment, the index will tell you the hour of the night. LI. The latitude being given, find on what day a star rises at a given hour. \u2014 Rectify, and bring the star to the eastern part of the horizon and the index at the given hour. Turn the globe until the index points 12. Then the meridian will intersect the ecliptic in the given day. LII. To place the celestial globe in a situation as to represent the real position of all the stars in any latitude, and at any given time. \u2014 Place the globe on a true level, and the brass meridian exactly corres ponding with the meridian line of the place. Then rectify for the latitude, bring the sun's place to the me ridian and the index at 12, and turn the globe on its axis until the index points the given hour. The stars will then correspond exactly to those on the globe. Thus any star perceived in the firmament may be named al any time. LIII. On a given latitude, day and hour, to find the altitude and azimuth of a given star. \u2014 Rectify for the latitude, bring the sun's place to the meridian, the index at 12, and turn the globe till the index points the gjven hour. Then set the quadrant of altitude in the zenith, and extending it over the given star the degree of the quadrant will shew its altitude on the horizon (the almicanter), and the degree of the horizon (counted from the south) intersected by the quadrant will point the azimuth, or distance from the meridian in degrees, and the index will shew it in time. LIV. Tofind the latitude of a place by the passage of a star by the zenith. \u2014 Bring the star observed in the zenith to the meridian, and having rectified the globe for its declination you have the latitude sought. LV. To find the latitude of a place by the observation of the altitude of two stars in the same azimuth. \u2014 Extend the quadrant of altitude over the two stars, then elevate or lower the pole until the quadrant cut:. the horizon in the observed azimuth, the globe will then be rectified for the latitude sought."], [95, "21 LVl. To find the latitude from the observation of a known star in the meridian and the rising of another. \u2014 Bring the first star under the meridian, and elevate or lower the pole until the rising star comes to the eastern edge of the horizon, the globe will then be rectified for the latitude. LVH. The altitude of a star being observed, find the hour of the night. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the place of observation, put the sun's place in the meridian, the hour index at 12 and the quadrant to the zenith. Turn the globe until the sun's place coincides with the observed altitude on the quadrant, the index will point the hour. LVIII. Tofind all the stars that are constantly visible, and those that are never seen in a given latitude. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude and turn it on its axis, you will evidently perceive that all the stars that are further South than the complement of that latitude can never rise above the horizon, and that all those that have a greater declination northward than that complement can never sink under the horizon. LIX. Tofind at what time of the year, in a given latitude, a star begins to rise at the sun's setting, and there fore begins to be observable in the evening. \u2014 Bring the given star to the eastern border of the horizon, and observe what degree of the ecliptic touches the western side of the horizon, and refer to the calendar for the day. \u2014 This is called the acronical rising. The acronical setting of a star is found in the same manner, but on the western side of the horizon. LX. Tofind the stars that rise or set with the sun on a given day. \u2014 Rectify the globe for the latitude and bring the sun's place to the eastern side of the horizon ; all the stars then in the same side of the horizon must rise with the sun. Turn the sun's place to the western side, and all the stars in the horizon then set with the sun. This is called the cosmical rising and setting of the stars. LXI. Tofind all the stars that are in the meridian at noon on a given day, and at midnight on a given night. \u2014 The globe being rectified for the latitude and the sun's place brought to the meridian, the stars then under the meridian, will pass the meridian line of the place at noon. Turn the globe till the hour index passes over 12 hours, then the stars under the meridian will pass the meridian line at midnight. LXII. To 'find the oblique ascension of a given star, and consequently the time of its remaining above the horizon of a place. \u2014 The oblique ascension of a star is the degree of the equator that rises on the horizon at the same moment as it does itself. If you take the difference between the right and oblique ascension of any star and reduce it into time, and add that time to six hours, when the right ascension surpasses the oblique, and subtract it from 6 hours when the oblique surpasses the right ascension, the sum will express half of the time the star remains above the horizon of the place. LXIU, Tofind the latitude of a place from the observed hour of a star's rising or setting on a given day,\u2014 The sun's place being brought to the meridian and the index at 12, turn the globe on the axis tdl the index points the observed hour. Then elevate or lower the pole until the star touches the horizon ; the globe will then be rectified for the latitude sought. Lxrv. To find the latitude and longitude of a star. \u2014 The latitude of the stars is their distance from the ecliptic, and their longitude the distance they are from the first point of Aries counted on the degrees of the ecliptic. Place, therefore, the quadrant of altitude at the pole of the ecliptic, and extending it over any particular star, the degree of the quadrant over the star will give its latitude, and the sign and degree of he ecliptic cut by the quadrant will express the- longitude."], [96, "22 PROBLEMS RELATIVE TO THE PLANETS AND MOON. LXV. Tofind aplanet's place among the fixed stars or in the zodiac. \u2014 Look for the planet's place in its orbit for the given day in White's Ephemeris, at the bottom of the left pages, and find the degree of the ecliptic it answers to. Secondly, look for the planet's latitude at the top of the same page, and either with the quadrant or a pair of compasses mark that latitude, noticing whether North or South above or below the point of the ecliptic found, and there place a small star or patch which will represent the planet for that day. LXVI. Tofind the time of the rising and setting of a planet, and the time of its coming to the meridian of a given place. \u2014 Having marked the planet's place on the globe, rectify for the latitude ; bring the sun s place to the meridian and the index at 12. Then bring the planet to the eastern edge of the horizon the index will point its rising time : bring it to the meridian to see its culminating and to the western side of the horizon for its setting time. LXVII. Find what planets will be on the horizon of a place at sunset on a given day, and therefore fit to be observed. \u2014 Rectify the globe and bring the sun's place to the western edge of the horizon, and notice what are the signs of the zodiac above the horizon at that moment, the Ephemeris will tell you what planets are then in any of those signs, and therefore visible. LXVI1I. To trace the moon's orbit on the celestial globe for a given day. \u2014 Find out of the Ephemeris the place of the moon's nodes in the ecliptic for the day, and having surrounded the globe by a strong silk, let the silk intersect the ecliptic in the two opposite points of the nodes, and at 90\u00b0 from each node, let the string deviate from the ecliptic by 5 degrees and a quarter towards the North and as much towards the South ; the silk thus placed will represent the moon's orbit for the given day. LXIX. Tofind the moon's place in her orbit for a given day. \u2014 Find in the Ephemeris the moon's longitude, or place in the ecliptic and at the degree and minute found elevate a perpendicular if the moon is in the northern part of the ecliptic, and lower it if in the South part. The point at which that perpendicular cuts the silk is the moon's place for that day at noon, and there make a mark, or put a patch. LXX. Tofind the moon's diurnal motion in the ecliptic, and therefore in her orbit, in a given day. \u2014 Find the moon's place for the given day at noon, and subtract from it her place on the preceding day at noon, the difference will be the space or quantity of her orbit she has been through on that day. This diurnal motion is variable from 11\u00b0 46' to 15\u00b0 16', and at a mean may be reckoned at 13 degrees eastward every day. And therefore, when the sun's place is known the moon's place may also be nearly known, in the ecliptic, by taking to the east of the sun as many times 13 degrees as the moon is days old. LXX1. Tofind the time of the rising, southing and setting of the moon, for a given day and latitude. \u2014 Rectify for the latitude and bring the moon's place at noon for the given day to the general meridian and the index at 12. Bring her place to the eastern side of the horizon, the index will show the time or quantity of her semi-diurnal arch ; but as she is not fixed in her orbit her motion in it must be subtracted for that semi diurnal quantity to find her place at rising, and added to it to give the place at her setting. Find then the sun's place for the given day, bring it to the meridian and the index at 12 ; bring next the moon's place at rising to the eastern side of the horizon, and the index will shew the hour of her rising. Bring successively her place at noon to the meridian, and at setting, to the western side of the horizon, you shall have the moment of her culminating, or passing the meridian, and that of her setting. LXX11. Tofind the time of the year when the moon or sun are liable to be eclipsed. \u2014 As the moon can never be eclipsed but when full, or in opposition with the sun, and in her node for a central eclipse, or within"], [97, "23 12 degrees of the nodes for a partial one, comparing, therefore, the place of the moon's nodes with the sun's place in the ecliptic, a tolerable guess may be formed when an eclipse will happen. There can be but two central eclipses of the sun or moon in one year. LXXII1. To illustrate the harvest moon by the celestial globe.\u2014 Rectify for the latitude, and in turning the globe on its axis, consider the difference and variation in the inclination of the ecliptic to the horizon, during one revolution. First, you will perceive, that when the signs of Pisces and Aries rise above the horizon, the ecliptic or zodiac, forms a very small angle with the horizon, and that in a higher latitude it would become parallel to it. Secondly, that when the oppotite signs of Virgo and Libra rise on the horizon, the angle formed by the ecliptic is very great. Thirdly, that the greater the angle formed by the ecliptic and the hori zon, the slower the degrees of the ecliptic rise one after the other on the horizon, whilst when the angle is very small, several degrees will rise altogether. Now in September, when the sun sets with the signs of Virgo or Libra, the full moon will rise in the opposite signs of Pisces and Aries, where the ecliptic forms the smallest angle with the horizon, and there fore, the full moon will rise some days together nearly at sunset. On the contrary, when the sun sets with Pisces and Aries the ecliptic is very high on the horizon, and the degrees rising above it, but one after the other, 13 degrees, that is the moon's motion eastward in 24 hours, will make the difference of a whole hour in the time of the rising of the full moon in spring. Patches placed on the ecliptic at 13 degrees from each other, on both sides of the equinoxial points, will elucidate this curious problem. LXXIV. To find whether any given year will be a bissextile, or leap year. \u2014 The earth's revolution round the sun being of 365 days, 5 hours and 48 minutes ; the 5 hours and 48 minutes will nearly make a whole day in 4 years, and that day we add to the month of February, which makes it then 29 days every fourth year. The Romans used to add that day after the 27th of FeTbruary, which, among them, was called sexto calendas, and they called the added day bis sextus dies, from whence our word bissextile. If you divide, therefore, the number of the given year by 4, the quotient will express the number of bissextiles elapsed, and the fraction the number it is after the bissextile. Thus 1815 divided by 4 will shew the 3rd year after the 453rd bissextile. Observe, that in adding a whole day every four years, they added 11 minutes to much; and that these 11 minutes, repeated every year, formed a whole day in the space of 134 years ; so that in 1582 the civil year had already anticipated 10 days on the solar, and the equinox did no longer fall on the 21st of March, as it had been fixed by the general council of Nic\u00e6a in the year 325, but fell on the 10th ; and as it would have thrown the greatest confusion in the order of the seasons, Pope Gregory XIII, ordered that 10 days should be struck out of October, 1582, and the fifth of that month was called the 15th. In order to avoid such confusion again it was settled that, out of four centuries, the last years of the three first, which were to be bissextiles should be reckoned common years. This reformation was called the new style, and was adopted in England in 1752. LXXV. To find the solar cycle and what year of the cycle is a given year. \u2014 The common year of 365 days forming 52 weeks and one day, it is evident that every common year must end by the same day of the week it has begun by. If the year begins by a Sunday it must end by a Sunday, and of course the following by a Monday, and would be so for seven years, through the seven days of the week, if it was not for the bissextile, which deranges that order of the days every fourth year ; for having a day more than the others it cannot end by the same day of the week it begun by, and retards the return of the same days of the week to the same dates seven times four, or twenty-eight years. That space of time is called the solar cycle. As the solar cycles are reckoned from nine years before the birth of Christ. Add nine to the number of the given year, and divide the sum by 28. The quotient will give the number of solar cycles passed since that time, and the fraction the rank of the given year in that cycle. Thus 1815 i\u00bb the fifth year of the 65th cycle. LXXIV. Tofind the dominical letter. \u2014 After the period of 28 years, or a solar cycle, the days of the week will come to answer again to the same date of the month. The seven days are always denoted by the seven letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The letter A being always affixed to the first of January, B to the second, and so on. The letter that happens to answer to the first Sunday will also answer to all the other Sundays, and"], [98, "24 be called from that, dominical. If the first of January happens to be a Sunday, the dominical letter must be A, if Monday, G, if Wednesday, E, &c. It will also be observed that every bissextile has two dominical letters ; for having one day more than common years, the year following it cannot begin by the day whose turn it was to come ; for example, the year 1816 being bissextile and beginning by a Monday, its dominical letter is G, and ending by a Tuesday. the year 1817 must begin by a Wednesday, and therefore its dominical letter being E, the letter F would have been omitted in the order of the letters, and is, for that reason, added to the letter G in the bissextile. The first of these, that is G in this instance, is used till the 24th of February, inclusively, and the other till the end of the year. The next table will show the dominical letters for every year of the present cycle.

Tofind to what day of the week a certain date of the month answers. \u2014 Find in the above table the dominical letter of the given year, and therefore the day that year began by. Then count the number of days from the 1st of January to the given date, and divide that number by seven \u2014 if the division is exact the day sought is the same as that the year began by, if one remains it will be the day following, &c. Thus the 17th of July 1815 being proposed, the dominical letter being A, the year began by a Sunday, having counted the days divide 197 by seven, and finding one as fraction, the 17th of July was on a Monday. LXXVIII. Tofind the lunar cycle and the golden number for a given year. \u2014 The moon completes her revolution about the earth in 29 days and a half, and if her orbit was stable, or if her nodes were constantly to cut the ecliptic in the same points, the same phases or changes would return at the same time the next year. If the moon had been full on the first day of January, it would again be full on the same day the year following. But the moon's nodes have a constant retrograde motion, that carries them 3 minutes and 10 seconds of a degree towards the West every day, and they complete the whole circle of the ecliptic in about 19 years. The same phases cannot therefore be seen in the same point of the zodiac but every nineteen years. This period is called the cycle of the moon, or lunar cycle. We reckon the first lunar cycle from one year before the Birth of Christ. To find, therefore, to what cycle a given year belongs, add one to the number of that year, and divide the sum by 19, the quotient will express the number of cycles elapsed and the fraction, if any, the rank of that year in the current cycle. This last number is called the golden number. Thus 1816 will be found the 12th year of the 95th lunar cycle. LXXIX. To find the epact, or the moon's age at the beginning of a given year. \u2014 The lunar year, or the time the moon takes to make 12 complete revolutions round the earth is 354 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes, and therefore nearly 11 days shorter than the solar year. If we suppose then a solar and a lunar year begin both on the first of January ; on the first of January of the second year the moon must already be 11 days old, on the first of January of the third year it will be 22 days old, and so on. This we call the epact, and is necessary to be known to fix the phases or changes of the moon, and the different festivals through the year. As the excess of the solar year above the lunar is constantly the same, the epact can be found by adding 11 to the epact of the preceding year ; but as eleven repeated would soon form an entire lunar month of nearly 30 days we neglect or take out the number 30 out of the accumulated number, and the remainder is the epact sought. If the number was 30 the moon would be new, or begin on the first of January. The followine table shows the epact for the 19 golden numbers of a whole lunar cycle. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 1 II | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 j 16 | 17 I 18 1 19 0 | 11 | 22 | 3 | 14 | 25 \\~6 \\ 17 | 28 j 9 { 20 | 1 | 12 | 23 | 4 | 15'f26'|TTl8"], [99, "25 Thus to find the epact of a given year, that is the moon's age at the beginning of the year, find the gol den number for that year, and under that is the epact. Thus l8l6 being the 12th of the cycle, the moon will be one day old on the first of January. LXXX. The epact of a given year being known, tofind the days of the new and full moon in a given month, and therefore her age at any day. \u2014 Add the number of the epact to the number of months passed since the month of March, inclusively, and subtract the sum from 30 or 31, according the number of days of the proposed month, the remainder will give the day of the new moon for that month, and 15 days after that the full moon. Thus the new moon of July, 1815, will be found the sixth, and the full moon the 21st; as for the months of January or February, add one to the epact and subtract from 30 for January, and the same for February, LXXXI. To find nearly the time of high water at a place, on a given day. \u2014 Having found, by problem 70, the time of the moon's passage by the meridian of the place for the given day ; add to that about three quarters of an hour, it will nearly be the time of high water. Having observed the time of high water at a place on the days of the new and full moon, the time of high water may always be known by adding to that time 48 minutes for each day. For example, on the 6th of July, 1815, being new moon and high water at London Bridge at 12 minutes past four in the morning. on the tenth, or four days after, the high-water time must be about 7 o'clock."], [100, "A TABLE OF THE CONSTELLATIONS, Shewing all the Fixed Stars passing the Meridian of London and its vicinity between IX and XI o'clock at Night, for every Month of the Year.
